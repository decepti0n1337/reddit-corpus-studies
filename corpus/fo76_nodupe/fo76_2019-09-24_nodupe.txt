Break your armor. You will keep the legendary effects and lower you dr to 0.

---
---
You're welcome :)
---
I'd say it looks nice on a weapon rack, but I think the only one I've seen displayed was off center.
---
So you overemcombered him? Sweet!
---
Really? I take it regularly and have only gotten it disputed like twice (ammo factory yeah, that‚Äôs a hot spot) luck I guess
---
I've never played Nuclear Winter, so I also skip those. FO76 is relaxing to me and I don't wanna drag any stress into it.
---
r/whoosh
---
Thats an odd problem to have? I dont see to have any bugs
---
I would love to see some old school Fallout weapons return, like the HN Needler and the 5.56 pistol, aka "that gun." 
---

---
The H&amp;K CAWS would be an excellent addition too.
---
For anyone with an optimized build, yes it was. Even more for unarmed. It‚Äôs people who had unoptimized builds and use PA who don‚Äôt realize this. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal.
---
You've never had the fast travel bug? It's fucking annoying as hell, one time I had it go in for like 30 minutes.
---
I also only play for like 2 or 3 hours a night, for completing the dailies. In the weekend I play a bit more (like 5 to 6 hours a day I think).
---
Nothing wrong with 3* Unyielding power armour :-)
---
Youre welcome :)
---
For crying out loud. If you can't still kill Earle, it's your build, not the game. 
---
Heaven forbid you not be able to carry around 3k pounds of scrap and every gun you've found since launch. You might just have to let your mole meat souffle go bad.
---
Perk for **1** weapon class.
---
Really? Every time I try to take it, it gets contested almost immediately lol
---
TS is good on weapons that don't already fire a chunk of pellets at once. Ergo, not shotguns. For shotguns it only adds one pellet, so the difference is not near as substantial as it is for other weapons.
---
So for a shotgun, specifically a shotgun, two shot is well below B, J, or AA
---
Nah, that's a cope I've been hearing a lot of people talk about. Fallout 76 isn't exactly a cash cow so I think they're going to divert their dev team to more lucrative stuff
---
Thanks. You would think it would be under floor decor. But I thought I looked under misc also. üëç
---
What is ‚Äúfine‚Äù. What are you hitting for?
---
Yes some times on weekends I‚Äôm on a good bit at night or early morning. Last season was a little hard to get it. I ended having a lot of atoms saved up and bought 10 levels. I didn‚Äôt have to but I wanted to be done with the grind. This season I‚Äôm not going to being I feel it‚Äôs a lot easier and I don‚Äôt even use any xp buffs. Unless someone pops lunchboxes
---
No, you got whooshed.
---
I'm saying the behemoth's used all the resources for the gender reveal.
---
STR is maxed, INT and LCK at 2, pushing luck to 3 tomorrow. It adds really nice perks I wouldn‚Äôt really need but which are adding a nice additional defensive layer for example (like  serendipity on a full health build because.. why not? May have Saved a life already. Also moved some points to CHA already and will move more to END later on to get fireproof for the one time in 25 hours where I die to an explosion).
---
However... it‚Äôs a bit sad that these are the best options around legendary perks (for non PA builds, in my opinion), isn‚Äòt it?
---
Quad double barrel with magic stars. Ugh. 25% less vats costs... and someone said magic weapons can‚Äôt be end game lul.
---
With so many people getting guaranteed legendaries now between ops and meat week there is a glut of legendaries. I am throwing away crap 3* now just for bag weight, it feels like the old pre scrip days.
---
Where did you get the icons from so I can use some for myself, looks amazing
---
The biggest problem is the projectile moves too slow, especially in VATS. Most enemies have moved by the time it hits. Such a shame that a weapon designed around bonuses for VATS performs so poorly.
---
If that‚Äôs how you see it. Good for you
---
Uh oh...
---
That is the pipe I use to poop in away from my camp...
---
Jenkem anyone?
---
Well what happens?
---
If you put it on the allrise, the rocket mod stays on
---
Actually, I just tested this today with a flamer. IT WORKS. You can just torch people now. It's been fixed sometime between Fachnact and this afternoon when I tried.
---
&gt;Harassed my friends and I
---
&gt;after we pressed them about it
---
I mean why did you start it then? were you looking for trouble or something?
---
You should still get the achievement by launching a nuke even if the quest isn't there I think. Look into the photo mode glitch. I know it's cheating but it will take that 2 hours and cut it down to like 10 or 15 minutes with some practice. I did the silos strictly legit until about a month ago and gotta say I don't really miss it.
---
OP is at max caps
---
All I want is my trusty Chinese Assault Rifle from Fallout 3.
---
Make sure you both add each other as friends and both your status' are set to online. If this doesn't work, go through all your privacy settings.
---
I'd really rather the team focus on fixing and balancing what's in the game already.
---
Send it in to Bethesda and Sony/Microsoft. That‚Äôs a clear violation of the new terms of service.
---
Why hire someone when people will buy your game and do the testing for you?
---
Also known as the Bethesda strategy.

Glowing one at Appalachia Antiques if it spawns ghouls

---
Or the fact after fast-travel speed demon no longer makes your reload faster, until you swap weapons.  But Fast Travel's the worst, they broke that when they introduced the 15 second countdown timer if enemies are near.  1 step forward, 4000 steps backwards.  I won't buy FO 1st until they fix it and when they do, I'll buy a year's worth, but I don't think I'll need to keep the space free on my credit card any time soon.

Yeah, it seems like someone intended to do lists of specific landmarks for every region and then maybe ran out of time/never got back around to doing that.
---
What‚Äôs this WE shit
---
I use an explosive 10mm and it works fine. I get chunks from all critters huddled around the blast radius.
---
When I ran Berserkers I ran around in virtually jeans and a t-shirt with no resistance perk cards of any kind. It‚Äôs a fun endgame challenge but I killed myself from my guns explosive damage more than any wasteland creature ever killed me

Yes ‚Äúthat gun‚Äù was cool I‚Äôd like to see the railway rifle
---
Interesting development
---
Current vers of Win10 moved the GPU selection from Geforce Exp. app into the Windows UI itself, so check that Windows isn't screwing it up somehow.  I mean of course it's not, who do you trust more, Microsoft or Bethesda??? \*Wink\*
---
You know that new terms of service ive been wondering if my "Mask up masshole" sign is putting me at risk. Thoughts?
---
Start at one end of the row of cottages..  Work your way down the road.
---
When you reach the WS side entrance, go the back parking lot (across from the fire station), clear it.  Go inside the laundry building and clear it
---
Go back to cottage row where you left off.  Do those.  goto the golf clubhouse and clear it.
---
optional - kill the large critter by the gazebo. And the (sometimes legendary) radstag to the right of the tennis club
---
Get the one in the pool area, then the several more in the cottages above the pool.  Walk up the side of he building, grab the loose caps on the table.
---
Cut across the top of the bunker to the flatbed truck in the road.  Kill those 4.  Cross the street to the power station, kill those 4.
---
Kill the mole miners outside blackwater.
---
Repeat.
---
BTW,  There are also 4 on the backside of one of the rows of cottages.
---
I get nearly 10k XP plus 3-5 egendarys almost every circuit
---
If UF or RR starts, skip over to those for even more.
---
Loot as you go, and sell to the bot at WS station
---
Yes in the context of video games. Sorry we were talking about video games so I figured you'd associate Microsoft with it's video games. 
---
  
---
Microsoft is a software company who's made trillions off of Windows... I really wasn't talking about Windows though.
---
I‚Äôve scrapped my urban scout mask and white powder jump suit so far, if that could make you feel any better
---
There is a diving suit in the game I have seen it it is a dev room item one of the guys I play with has a friend that has one
---
We already have the railway rifle
---
oof.
---
Well, Let's hope you get lucky on you next daily op.
---
One of the loading screens says that it was modified to use 5mm, it didn‚Äôt use that back during the civil war
---
Yeah im done with fallout until then
---
Is it specifically just for the emotes, or for your favorited items too? Cause sometimes I have it erase my favorites bar, so I‚Äôll go into my inventory and unfavorite and then refavorite an item and it‚Äôll be fixed
---
No. Turn on pacifist mode or have some conviction.
---
No thank you, I prefer killing foodies
---
This is a great idea.
---
Is there some other way to interpret what you said?
---
No everything is gone, its just a blank wheel when I scroll my mouse if that makes sense?
---
the new ToS is extremely vague and essentially says that Bethesda can ban you for any bad press, pretty much.
---
so refrain from stirring \* up either way and be on your best behavior just in case.
---
What do you mean? They have all these whales buying their way through seasons on day 1, FO1st subscriptions (I'll admit I am one of these)...
---
And they only have to pay like 3 devs and maybe a couple monkeys to keep the game running.
---
It's gotta be profitable.
---
(I'm seriously kidding, I understand all the hard work a lot of good people are putting into this game, but with the incompetence we see on a regular basis, sometimes it *feels* like there's a skeleton crew keeping things going)
---
This is absolutely ridiculous. I have two perfect 3 star unyielding urban scouts peices that don't match with the other forest ones. Now funky duds is useless for me. Just because of color. WOW
---
try swapping to a different weapon then swap back
---
Hear me out...
---
Archimedes II from FO:NV. Lol
---
It does, I‚Äôve only had the issue with the favorites bar before though, not the emotes. Have you considered turning it off and on again... jk, idk mate
---
When you try to fast travel, it just closes the map and you stay put.
---
I think they are in the underwhelming category /s
---
Yes. Pipe is life.
---
Hellfire power armor.
---
Rename all non scrapables with a symbol prior to name. I use "!" They will show up first and you will know to avoid them. If you wanna take it to the next lvl my pieces are named...
---
!CA-UAPWWR- LA 
---
!SS-ASAP- LA
---
Etc..
---
Will never scrap the wrong thing again
---
I'd love some massive melee weapons that can only be used while in Power Armor.
---
Imagine a massive scorchbeast queen club, or a nuke dud welded to a pole
---
Nice use of negative space
---
Haha wish it was that easy to resolve. I've checked settings too and can't seem to find anything to get it back either :( I've just had someone wave at me and I can't wave back, they prob thought I was being a dick on purpose üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Your game just got suddenly boring as hell
---
Good advice thank you
---
I pulled them from google images, try searching for ‚Äúfallout 76 player icons‚Äù and you‚Äôll see them! Hope this helps :)
---
I get that upon logging in with increased regularity. 
---
Entering pipboy, going to items, and then exiting often fixes it. Sometimes I have to do that twice...
---
The new exploit can kill people even in pacifist
---
My camp?  I always have canned dog food and other foods for sale on the cheap.  I have to limit how much I put up so everyone has a chance to get some.
---
It is sadly normal for things to clip through the ground. If you can't find that legendary enemy you wanted to loot, or the guy you're supposed to kill for a quest cannot be found, they're probably clipped through the ground.
---
I was using a person‚Äôs decontamination shower one time and in the middle of the animation they left and their camp disappeared. For a few minutes afterwards my character was running around with their whole body jolting with electricity. My favorite bug so far.
---
The cars are the best part.
---
The mama dulce event gives the canned stew that also gives an xp bonus.
---
I put mine by Flatwoods because I put a ton of cheap food and plans in it in the hopes that low levels will take what they need.
---
Then its usually vacuumed up by a level 140.
---
This has been my ted talk.
---
Gross.
---
I scripted a legacy awhile back thank god I had just enough script to get it back I almost lost it foreverüòÇ
---
Constantly. Crashing constantly on Xbox and this is happening. Since One Wasteland install.
---
Finally someone gets it.
---
I‚Äôd love to see them use this as an opportunity to bring back some of the more extreme heavy weapons like the ‚Äúshoulder mounted machine gun‚Äù or the ‚Äúarc welder‚Äù. The Brotherhood is known for its love of Heavy Weapon wielding knights so I think it‚Äôd be in the spirit of Fractured Steel. There also wouldn‚Äôt be any licensing issues since BGS and Obsidian are under the same banner now
---
Any update?
---
Ah, a Gourmand!
---
I'm still trying to figure out whether the armor penetration is based on damage per shot or damage per pellet.
---
Literally the only reason I‚Äôm considering it everything besides scrap box and atoms seems dumb lmao
---
Thank you!
---
The Western Revolver exists to give false hope that revolvers will ever be viable.
---
Somebody tag the Bethesda people. This is fucking brilliant.....
---
If you try to sell it in your vendor, yeah anything above 7k probably won't sell for a while
---
But if you listed it on a community hub like the discord or trading subreddit, you'll get those offers easy 
---
Tons of people have alts on alts with maxed caps, caps are guaranteed thus easy to farm, and they pay those prices because they don't want to bother with random chance
---
Gonna have to google all of these since I have no idea what any of them are
---
It's a great place to farm, there will always be easy days to run solo. I've got like 1000+ 2mm ultras in a week. In general, recent patches and ammo recycling upped my ammo stock by thousands. 
---
Tin cans no more!
---
What's the respawn bug? The one where you spawn in random spots at Scorched Earth?
---
Lmao. I opened a cargo container one time and saw the "WANTED!" flash across my screen. Not knowing I couldn't see players or camps I spent 20 minutes looking for am event with participants and begged them for another 3 for someone to kill me. Thankfully one guy joining the event immediately mowed me down as he joined and I thanked him endlessly. Now every time I see a wanted player I will turn off pacifist, kill them, turn it back on and emote a thumbs up.
---
Vendor log in personal terminal or pipboy or even a separate vendor terminal.
---
It's not back, more like it never went away. XD
---
Beth said they kind of fixed it partially. It have happened to me twice, once on SQB and once on encrypted.
---
Yeah, FO4 local map was almost always completely useless
---
Better than when you wave at someone and they give you the  üëçüèª emote back üòÇ. I‚Äôm not even worth a hello to these people
---
5.1 pounds, awesome rad resist and stealth.  It's been in my stash for a while too, but I just started using it for situations like this and for nuke zones.  
---
I definitely have better armor for day to day use, but this has its uses too.
---
Wait....you get AN mask and not the plan to make it?
---
Literally just an edgelord and you're being triggered by it. 
---
The left can't meme.
---
Yeah when I end up wanted on accident I just go all in and start trashing peoples camps personally. Not like I need the caps.
---
Speaking of "knights" and going off another post in this thread....a massive sword would be cool. Something for the power armour...
---
Dang, thanks.
---
Nah, it's you being a karen.
---
Walk around clockwise and if that doesn't work try going anti clockwise and if that doesn't work Google it or fast travel out and start again üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Thank you
---
If you are on pacifist you should be fine. If you want to fight back magic shotguns/harpoons are your friend, they are capable of ignoring the PvP damage cap in VATS, so 1 shot should end their little greifing spree.
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to make urban/forest scout masks, they are a rare drop from Savage Divide events.
---
You're not alone, I scrapped a traveling leather coat some weeks ago and who knows what else (to get the scrap 76 clothes atom challenge), hahaha.
---
Or given the love for "mediele" titles.....a massive 2 hander sword would be cool...like the sword from Transformers lol
---
Used to happen to me on encrypted too bit not for a while. Today on meat week events twice. It sucks because you either wait it out possiy indefinitely or pass on the rewards  its crap
---
You mean the timer that goes off even if enemies aren't near? Good times.
---
It's a targeting beacon that calls upon an orbital laser strike.
---
Pretty cool!
---
When headed to scrap I sort by weight. In the armor tab it throws all the outfit items down to the bottom because only weightless legendary items have a chance at weighing less than them
---
In my opinion?  No. Because ‚Äòanti-masker‚Äô isn‚Äôt a protected grouping like religion, ethnicity, gender and so on. 
---
But that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
So you cannibalize the wanted people? That is brilliant! ü§£üò±
---
Yea I think ya talked me into it. Im gonna dump my reg armour since it only gets used for .1% of my play.
---
So, you think a sign that says ‚ÄòNo Gays‚Äô isn‚Äôt a violation of the Terms of Service?  Can you elaborate on that?
---
Perhaps it's offensive to people from Massachusetts, but nobody gives a fuck about them anyway.
---
Good to have some insight into the development process
---
Or some form of unarmed melee weapons for PA. It sucks that I can‚Äôt use my DCG or MMG in PA cause they‚Äôre classified as unarmed. Some form of Power Gauntlet that would work for PA as well would be cool, or just rework unarmed mods for PA arms so they can do some serious damage! Attach some spikes or something to your fists whilst in PA and really do some damage
---
Do you regularly walk into other people's houses and sleep in their bed? I mean sure, I use other people's workbenches but using their bed seems a bit rude.
---
A heavy incinerator, tesla cannon. I want the chinese pistol and the assault rifle from fallout 3. Also would mind an anti material rifle but for the love of all the gods make it right handed.
---
Adding to the thought....we should be able to keep on our under suits in pa....otherwise we are what....fully naked in them?...makes no sense
---
Makes me wonder why they didn't bought Sony then.
---
I've had this spawn a several times when running up from the steak house to the radio station. Its a decent fight. The first time I got blindsided by the behemoth and killed pretty quickly. Freaked me out because its an encounter spot that wasn't used much before.
---
With rank 3 Taking One for the Team I am dealing slightly more damage against Earl with my shotgunner than I was before the update. We made it last time I tried but I went through like 1000+ shells.
---
You might not have enough armor piercing?
---
Yes!! Or starts, flashes up, vanishes, cancels your fast travel and leaves you with this momentary confusion about what it was you were about to do.  the last bit might just be me.
---
I remember how heartbroken I was when I scrapped my first X-1 Chest with a Jetpack. That thing cost me like 10k back in the day!
---
This was meant as a standalone comment for OP. Sorry!! You can buy the scout masks in whitespring bunker.
---
Edit* you can NOT actually buy the masks anymore for anyone seeing this in 3 months from now.
---
They have the posion effect for the vault 94 set...why not have a melee damage outgoing effect?
---
This and perks - if you have low strength and no melee perks then a super sledge is a pool noodle
---
I‚Äôm still pretty new, is that a mod I add?
---
That‚Äôs what I think is coming with the BOS dlc
---
I primed my gatling gun just because of how much ammo you get. Up to 8,000 ultracite rounds now lol. I'm trying to get as many as I can in case this gets nerfed.
---
The first shot begins the damage bonus, the second applies it
---
My mind jumps to the Electrocutioner‚Äôs Gauntlets from Batman, but reworked for PA obviously
---
&lt;laughs in minecraft caves&gt;
---
Do you know if super reactor takes more budged than the fusion one?
---
The game doesn't stop you from being matched with blocked players, I keep finding grey silloettes punching me and unloading explosive legacies on me.
---
Left handed hand scanners on the right side of doors....
---
His 1st first time?
---
&gt;So, you think a sign that says ‚ÄòNo Gays‚Äô isn‚Äôt a violation of the Terms of Service?
---
Quote me where I said that. Do it. 
---
A lot of stuff is against the tos. You're still being a karen.
---
Pretty sure the Auto Axe from fallout 3 has been sitting in the files since Wastelanders. Hopefully they drop it with steel dawn.
---
Pipe is li.... Never mind, I don't even know where it is, sad I know
---
Gonna check if my Daily OPS will reset at 5pm or 6pm.
---
So first, I'm glad they have more coming but I'm concerned about nothing official for next gen. 
---
Second they need to relook at the lack of scaling with certain weapons/armor/enemies. I'm sorry I don't need level 100 molerats in my life or cave crickets for that matter. 
---
Third with this new deal with Microsoft will they keep using Amazon servers?
---
Does it work with automatic weapons?
---
I remember I wanted someone to kill me cause I was wanted. I forgot what I did but I was a level 80, I think. I asked three different people who were like level 20 or so &amp; I taunted them, messaged them, hell, even used my mic to ask them to kill me. They all ran away from me. I was lucky enough that someone actually did. I thanked them right after.
---
Passion means nothing when your execution is garbage.
---
Due date as in...baby?? Good luck!
---
oh shoot i didn‚Äôt even think of that, i don‚Äôt prime my stuff either cause i don‚Äôt collect a lot of flux to make the ult rounds. but if they are dropping ult rounds i may just do that! thanks for the info!
---
...how tf did I miss that legendary perk
---
There's always that one turret that wants to kill the travelling merchant.
---
At a workshop recently I had turrets that shot other turrets and became red. I had to scrap + replace them.
---
I did it to my tattered field jacket instead of the trapper arm I was going for. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I wish they bought TikTok just so they can bury that cancer.
---
Sure.. but the view is.. meh
---
I didn‚Äôt say you said that. I asked it as a **question**.   That‚Äôs why I used a question mark instead of a period. 
---
Here‚Äôs another one for you: How does believing that a violation of ToS is inappropriate behavior make someone a ‚ÄòKaren‚Äô?
---
‚ÄòBeing a Karen‚Äô is traditionally defined as ‚Äòbehaving in an entitled or demanding manner beyond the scope of what is appropriate or necessary.‚Äô
---
Pointing out that someone is engaging in homophobia and reporting it to the governing body doesn‚Äôt fit that definition.
---
It's a ranged sneak bonus, so any ranged weapon used while sneaking counts
---
A universal rule in the internet:
---
You should hold your drawings
---
Je shotgun is fun, but rubberbandy. And you're gonna need lots in int to run max demo expert and gunsmith, cuz it is worse cnd than the cursed weapons
---
LOL yes I am currently growing a human and it's terrifying. Thank you.
---

---
Real men sleep on a bed made of lego.
---
Yeah maybe next time!
---
I had to run and regroup, his floaters were killing me.
---
Do the returns on xp ever stop diminishing, or will it take like a year to level up at level 700?
---
No you can‚Äôt, and haven‚Äôt been able to for a long long time.
---
... launching a nuke. Dude.
---
Legendary effects and armor modifications are still active even if the piece of armor is broken. To use berserkers, you can run about in your armor and remove white knight and lucky break. Play for a while until all your pieces break.
---
Armor is breaking faster than it did before the patch. Before patch it could take many many hours to break your armor. Now... its faster.
---
As long as you don't need to change your armor, you can leave it broken forever while equipped. You will still benefit from unyielding and deep pocketed, etc. You will just lose DR/ER/RR/PR from the armor. Yes it removes the benefits of the radiation or poison resistance legendary effects (or mods); those are the only ones that stop working.
---
Yup
---
Many players who have been around the block with FO76 won‚Äôt attack wanted players because many wanted players were honeypots to get players with caps to turn on PVP. The honeypot player was often grouped with a posse, hiding nearby.
---
You've opened a pandoras box of pipe is life.
---
As a vats pistol agility build
---
I approve this message
---
Already had that planned in my build thanks to the legendary perks! But I'm sorta already used to rubber banding. Glad to hear it's at least fun. Getting tired of bloody build over here lol
---
No prob, but no you can‚Äôt buy them any more since long time ago
---
It is not hard, it's tedious and you can only miss a 2 weeks (not counting if they add double score) or grind millions XP. 
---
I'm on rank 30, have done every daily and weekly challenge, except 1 weekly that was autocompleted. :(
---
I am so bummed they aren't bringing Mischief Night back. I have only been playing for a few months but I've heard how awesome it was. I was really looking forward to experiencing it for myself this year. 
---
I am with you on the Halloween celebration. I'd love to see them go all-out but I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
Cool thanks. One person was saying you have to wait to do the second shot.
---
&gt; So, you think a sign that says ‚ÄòNo Gays‚Äô isn‚Äôt a violation of the Terms of Service?  Can you elaborate on that?
---
Don't try and weasel out now. Stick to your guns champ. You know exactly what you were doing.
---
If you still need them I just got two more of them today and would be happy to give you one. ign is admiraldarkstar
---
I'll be on tomorrow night after 8 ET. You can pm me here and I should see.
---
The monorail system in the bog is huge, which part are you talking about exactly?
---
Where is pipe?
---
Oh really? I didnt know. Ill change my previous comment
---
Console players: FPS?  Anything over 10 is great!
---
'karen' has several meanings and one of them is a person who follows rules to a T, often just to inconvenience other people on purpose. essentially making a big deal out of a minor offense.
---
and in my opinion that description fits here. I suppose discrimination is against the ToS, but what op posted is so insignificant you'd have to be a real karen to go out of your way to stir \* up because of 'no gays'
---
No, it is where you are stuck in respawn and have to force quit the game.All controls are locked so there is literally nothing you can do but watch the camera over your corpse.
---
Sounds interesting
---
Yep. It's pretty much the deadliest non-event mob spawn in the game. I'm pretty concerned about running into them with a non stealth character. Thankfully the floaters stick out like a sore thumb in the Mire, because the behemoth is damn near invisible.
---
Or just a kid. Judging by their post history, I'm going with that.
---
Definitely not just you. One easy way to make people actually get stuff from there is adding Handmade skins from Nuka-world. They look pretty cool, people like them, and it's a re-used asset from F4. Win-win for both Bethesda and their customers.
---
The Great War.
---
I asked a question. It might have been a loaded question, but it‚Äôs still a question.  It was designed to get you to take a specific stand. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt quite work. 
---
And you‚Äôve ignored the second question as well.
---
Let‚Äôs try a third:  **Do you or do you not believe that posting a message of ‚ÄòNo Gays‚Äô is a violation of the ToS?**. 
---
Take a clear cut position on that question, *champ*. What‚Äôs your stance?
---
Solo is easier and you know it :)
---
Love my AA2525 ... but you know I also love my gamma.
---
Pistols do need something ... and i really would love some revolver joy
---
Obviously. It's solely apologetics though; they wanted to use 5mm for game reasons, and wrote a throwaway line of lore to make it fit.
---
What I'm saying is that in ballistics, a cartridge will do very similar "damage" regardless of the firearm. A gun is little more than a fuse-lighter, and cannot "make a bullet hit harder." This is vastly simplifying the topic.
---
If a door leaving to another area was in the local map , you could more or less know if the way leading to it was discovered or not , or if you actually saw the door in your level
---
But in F76 this wouldnt work since the entire location in on the same map so there is almost zero "door to loading" , just elevators
---
Well said
---
Nope, when you level up you get perk cards. Look at your strength and just focus on melee/unarmed
---
Like in the middle between foundation and fort defiance
---
Sure.  I suppose a viable option.
---
Thats just stoopid
---
Same ways. Level 196. Only did one silo run and was on a team while doing it. Plus had like 10 other people in a live party doing the same run. I did not launch the nuke But because the leader of my team launched the Nuke I ended up completing the "I am become death" quest.
---
Happens way to often, yet there are people that think the fast travel bug is worse...
---
Seeing it come home to Roanoke after the restoration, I will never forget. Fingers crossed for future new lands DLC, accessible by train.
---
What build category is this in?
---
I distinctly seem to remember getting the plan and going "huh. Wonder what that is" before learning it but i can't find it.
---
Either I'm missing it frequently or I hallucinated the whole thing. Not ruling out either option here.
---
Psychobuff is my friend as a melee casual. I buy it if it‚Äôs not super expensive in vendors.
---
Lots of people use chem's. The ones that don't have a crafting recipe sell pretty well too. I can't think of which ones those are off the top of my head though.
---
Just Googled the tesla cannon...I agree that would be cool.
---
I agree. Microsoft seems to know the right balance between making money including through micro transactions and not pissing off players so I think we'll see things like scrip limits raised.
---
Aint that a kick in the head.
---
Daily ops are a guaranteed legendary or two. My second op I got a 3* Vampire‚Äôs / +10 when aiming / 25% reduced vats Fixer, which is easily the best legendary I‚Äôve ever gotten.
---
You don‚Äôt need a hacked weapon to do okay. You need a solid build and a decent weapon. If you get (or already had) an amazing weapon, then it‚Äôs basically business as usual.
---
As far as I'm concerned, folks who lock their camps with lvl 0 locks are doing this on purpose lol
---
There‚Äôs definitely some down time when they‚Äôre really little...once double score weekend arrives, roll that bassinet over to the gamer chair and get to work! üòé
---
It would be cool, if they could also add some skins/ changeable items for us that have Fallout 1st ‚õ∫'s. I remember last the first time I seen people's with Christmas tree   decorations.
---
Real chads use survival shortcut
---
Well I didn‚Äôt know about that. I‚Äôll definitely buy that
---
Make sure you have the appropriate weapon perks for the weapons you're using. 
---
Level 25-40 was pretty difficult before the latest patch, and from other threads on reddit it seems like it was made significantly harder.
---
I know, but it just got worse because of ops with the guaranteed drops every 5 min if you are in a good group.
---
No biggie, so many things have been changed, it feels like a different game now than a few months ago
---
35
---
Yes! Even without heavy gunner perks, it still shreds
---
I score canned food and drinks from Flatwoods, and the city of Watoga. Easy if you did mayor for a day quest. Food everywhere on dinning tables, store shelves and rooftops. Also do a grocery run inside Whitesprings. All trash cans with the perk card? Can't remember the name right now.
---
i m doing fairly decent without any legacies. My J25 UGL still does more damage (over time) than any legacy in my arsenal
---
Any plans that I can't sell after a month of being at like 10 or 20 caps I end up just putting into stash bin at the overseers camp
---
Yeah it's extremely easy to get those rounds with a gatling gun then even use them with a minigun if you prefer.
---
Pistols are a medium to short ranged weapon, so Perception has very little effect on them. Concentrated fire further diminishes the need for Perception.
---
It would make more sense to leave the damage perks in  Agi but move the utility perks to other SPECIAL slots.
---
For instance Modern Renegade should be a Luck peks just like the Rifle cripple effect is.
---
Trick or treating along the cottages of Whitesprings, painting on the sides of them, blowing up ALL the cars. Dealing with the robots. Then the final grand finale in Whitesprings commons, forking the lawn, more trick or treating. Sigh. So fun! üò≥
---
Oh fun, looking forward to that one.
---
Deep mining gas mask too
---
I found my first one a few weeks ago, seen a few posts since, apparently there‚Äôs at least a couple scattered around Appalachia. My theory is secret underground tunnel system that will open with future update.
---
Regenerating armor is nice to have on a full-time PA character. When you're in your camp crafting things your health comes back. Maybe not worth the SS armor grind to get, but nice to have.
---
do you happen to know the .50 cal drop rates?
---
are you on ps4?
---
I‚Äôm level 30-31 and I missed a couple of challenges and haven‚Äôt done all of this weeks weeklys so maybe 32-33 by tonight just tryna get those atoms lmao
---
5mm can be as low as 10 and as high as 80 from what I've seen
---
They might be trying to compensate for any lag. But i don't think it's a required step
---
Damn, that's nice, did you use the atoms you get from the new season to get ahead? I wanna know if I should spend the 150 we get to further myself
---
Psychotats, X-Cell
---
They‚Äôve done this. Most Raiders and settlers wear atx clothes. They also update structures with atx assets (the satellite dish for example got added a bunch of places after it came in the shop)
---
I think I'm level 41, mostly just leveling up.
---
It‚Äôs good pipe 
---
You wanna try some pipe?
---
Is it really an exploit if it doesn't add anything lol
---
is that for ult or regular?
---
Doesn't take long to trade, and it all starts from caps, which you'd eventually save up enough to get sth nice.
---
There are always people selling stuff at a lower price, you just need to do a little bit of shopping from time to time.
---
So far I have found the following from vendor machines:
---
TSE Tesla 25k
---
BE25 Railway rifle 10k
---
BE Gatling Gun 15k
---
Pre-nerf BSS Meat hook 12k
---
And these are just some highlights among countless other underpriced stuff I have found.
---
PM sent!
---
I just stopped using the legendary purveyor and I don‚Äôt know what to buy with gold either
---
Get the can do perk and check every trashcan in Whitespring. Each trashcan counts as a food container.
---
Nah have not used atoms, just done every challenge and played the game. There are people well over 40 that i know.
---
i do OPs every day with 6 characters. Today I got my 2nd full set and i have an extra mask
---
At 32. No levels bought. Don‚Äôt really grind the repeatable. But it comes a lot faster with the 1WL. And don‚Äôt do NW.
---
Is there a ‚Äúmarker‚Äù this season to keep track of where we should be around? Last season it was the ship or something like that?
---
I always thought it would be cool to be able to find a blueprint for the place you‚Äôre in and have it serve as a paper local map, to keep consistent with the theme that the Appalachian map has.
---
That‚Äôs a magic weapon tho
---
your gonna shoot your eye out kid
---
You should compete in the Angry Turtle Discord Daily Ops league
---
Awww sweet, I've been trying to do all the dailies and everything, but idk how I'm so far behind, unless what I'm doing is wrong?
---
Nuka world dlc added higher level equipment, for pistols it‚Äôs the western revolver
---
Totally agree.
---
No
---
Mhm
---
This is the first I've heard about that speed demon issue honestly
---
I definitely get some lag there when a bunch of people build camps on the golf course. Aside from that I don‚Äôt have much problems there.
---
Why do you need to compete with duped and hacked bs? Do you look for pvp all the time? In PvE you can ignore others and play lone wanderer, and tag enemies in group events when there‚Äôs others around, saves your ammo and time.
---
25 missed two days ago far and have a couple weeklies left
---
One wasteland is complete balls for new players
---
The tent is another good reason, if only so you dont have to head back to a camp for the rested bonus
---
Any reason why or just not said?
---
I wonder how many people out there are thinking about doing the same
---
No, PC.  Sorry bud.  I usually have 50+ canned goods in inventory I sell 5 at a time.  Free to low levels that stop in.  I think I dumped 40 freebies the other day, but my runs instantly restock me... So yeah.
---
A lot of people might be focusing on meat week.
---
Anyone have a pic of both?
---
Isnt there a perk card for that now. Home body or something?
---
Bugs they didn‚Äôt fix from last time.
---
Secret service armor with buttressed and jet pack
---
Yikes
---
I don't think you're behind, it's just that I spend most of the day grinding. I love shooting things. and thanks to daily ops I don't need to worry about ammo as much anymore.
---
I don't know if last season's safety net level sheet is still accurate, but if you're at least level 20 this week/33 next tuesday, then you're fine.
---
Buy it for one month. Claim any and all emotes/clothing/icons/etc (You keep these forever). Load up the scrap box as much as you can (without first ypu can only take scrap OUT). Private worlds seem more balanced as the game only accounts for you and/or buddies (events that cant be done solo stipl cant be done tho). Plus you get decent chunk of atoms. Just wish it was like $5 cheaper
---
Edit: SURVIAL TENT RULES. Cook station, stash, scrap box, bed. Just needs a workbench of some kind to be able to scrap things other than junk
---
In the end Of the quest line you can decide to split the gold bullion several ways or take it all for yourself. Taking it for yourself gives you 1000 bullion while splitting it can give you much less depending on how you decided to split it.
---
My camp is down by Watoga right by the monorail line and the railyard. You can electrify and place lights/posters/etc a long way up the supports.  
---
I am not a great builder like so many on here, but it does make for a neat effect.
---
The loot pool might be the same or different for Bombs Drop. Mischief Nights is officially cancelled.
---
Best irony here is that this patch was supposed to help newcomers but they achieved the complete opposite
---
Yeah the perks dont do crap anymore everything is a melee and bullet sponge till you unlock legendary perks. Every encounter will feel like a boss encounter untill level 50.
---
Ewww.  
---
I don't pvp at all except for the few times in NW.  
---
I don't block with any ranged weapons so IMO those two effects are useless.  
---
A shotgunner is going to have to get closer to do better damage than say a Sniper. More DR and ER b/c of that.  
---
There are different Tiers of effects. I don't think you can get two in the  same teir. Bookmark this:  
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects  
---
I've had good results with:  
---
Anti-Armor, Double, Furious, Instigating, Quad, Supressor's, and Two Shot.  
---
Explosive can damage you as well so only use in an open/wide area.  
---
Rapid. VATS Enhanced. Crippling.  
---
Stat boosts on your primary SPECIAL like STR and LUCK for Shotgun.  
---
Lightweight is good b/c Shotguns can weigh a lot and you need at least 3 different ones.  
---
Cursed is only on 3 weapons and so new I wouldn't trust it. They degreade a LOT faster despite perks.  
---
Armor:  
---
Regenerating. Unyielding if you're into that low health build. Vanguards.  
---
Durability. Anything that reduces weight of armor, ammo, junk, etc. but remember each category caps at 90%. Perks and Legendary effects do not stack.  
---
There is a backpack mod plan which I have on my 2. The Chemist mod reduces weight of all chems including Stimpacks by 90%. You can free up 3 points/slots in STR for taking off Traveling Pharmacy if you have it.  
---
IMO, the biggest problem is you're only going to be carrying Shotgun shells and more than normal. The Gauss Shotgun uses 2mm EMC rounds and I don't have it yet.  
---
You need 10 Plastic per use of crafting shotgun shells. You should focus on the mats for that ammo even after you get the Ammo Maker. I have almost 4000 rounds on that char.  
---
Some Legendary effects suck no matter what while the rest are subjective. For a shotgun build and IMO, those two are pointless. It is your character and this is just what I've learned and my opinion.
---
Nice get em done mate, they good for boosting you up a rank entirely
---
I used to do a lot of sleeping when I was xo farming but now I just buy lunch boxes and get those big boosts
---
Insoend all day grinding too lol. Ah ok good
---
I‚Äôm at level 27 as well. I usually do all but one of the dailies (usually either the ‚Äúgain a level‚Äù one, or the NW one if it‚Äôs tedious), and I did all of the first week‚Äôs weeklies. I don‚Äôt grind XP, so I only get the 10k bonus when it comes from play.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm not even slightly worried about the pace. There will certainly be double SCORE or some other bonus event(s) to ensure we get a leg up.
---
I don't think they're as good. I've never used that gun though.
---
Which looks great.
---
Well I forgot to mention but I pulled a better poisoner ss, 15 less limb damage overall
---
I'm hoping we see more on the bombs drop event. 
---
I remember thinking that it would be an event where maybe there would just be random nuke drops all over the map during that week but I guess we will see
---
Like a fasnacht mask but of Grahm
---
Lots of people post their god rolls up on weapon boards with messages to trade because we don't have room for the caps.  
---
I have a VFFR LMG, QFFR Tesla, Fancy Shotgun and some other good stuff. No one messages about it though. Maybe there is a better way?
---
I had it for a bit, felt bad about giving them more money with some of the choices they have made, so I canceled it, and don't really miss it.
---
I have scrap I need for repairs tagged, and I don't pick up anything else, and that's the only scrap I keep and it always stays at low levels due to repairs.  The survival tent is nice, but I have so many caps paying for travel all day makes no difference, so I really only miss having a place to scrap lead with I hit the silos.    
---
Now that there are public parties exist I wouldn't ever play private and lose the bennys.
---
So how‚Äôs the state of the game after this update for a returning player? Haven‚Äôt touched the game in months and haven‚Äôt kept up with much.
---
You should be able to make the private server open to your friends, and not just people in your group. When you're in the main menu, click play, go to private server, and before clicking play you should see the option at the bottom of you're screen.
---
Its random. My advice is spawn at the penitentiary. I usually get 3/4 ghouls spawning there
---
From my experience the damage to the cows are the same. The only difference is how fast we kill the mobs.
---
I managed to complete it multiple times solo so far.
---
Friendly fire also helps keep them alive.
---
ü•∫üò© I can't believe I won't get to do that!! Ughhhh
---
I tried to give stimpacks and ammo to a lv 4 today at meat Cook, but it got swarmed by 3 level 600 players...
---
Caps are such an overflow for high levels nowadays though theres hardly a point in doing that anymore. Many of us are just ambivalently throwing caps at ammo and random shit because we just hit 30k again
---
That‚Äôs what I did. I saved up my atoms over the course of about 6 months and dumped them into the scoreboard because I‚Äôm getting tired of playing this game without any substantial content drops. I want the BoS bunker and the Armor Ace wallpaper though so I just got that stuff and I‚Äôm done playing for now. I‚Äôm more inclined to cancel my subscription if there‚Äôs nothing to do or buy with them. I don‚Äôt consider ~11 tier skips to be worth the money.
---
Flyboy helmet has the effect (for no apparent reason)
---
Just go on a rampage and start destroying someone's camp. They will eventually stop you.
---
44, I have bought tiers though. I play a lot of different games and don't have time to play 76 a lot. 
---
However there's a huge drought in content for games for the next month so I'll probably not spend anymore.
---
being on the drums does help lad. five proud ones standing around for one squirrel to spawn doesn't
---
It's super noticeable with a slow-to-reload gun like a gatling plasma.  You feel like your arms are covered in goop.
---
Rank 51. I started late on Season 1 so I've been having fun racing my friends on Season 2. One guy is a few ranks ahead of me which is kind of pushing me. Also grinding out Levels to max Legendary Perks so that helps give extra Score
---
I purchased a couple levels in  the first season but I‚Äôm gonna try and get through it completely no purchases and I‚Äôm at level 31 and I‚Äôm going to do some hella xp farming on the weekend to see what I can get to
---
Mines just southwest of Morgantown, off the road. I dig the accessibility to various events, Sutton station, visible to new players. But I like your spot too!
---
I just figured that was *the speed*
---
What does your farming run look like? I need to do this soon.
---
I'm depressed to learn you're on PC. I have my camp set up at the cave to the west of Grahm's Cookout location, and if you go through the fake fireplace door you can drop down to my secret Cat Cave, where I keep so much cool stuff. The door I put at the exit to the cave is locked, and I'm pretty sure it's impossible to jump back up into the house so I've been hoping people are getting trapped down there and having to fast travel. It didn't even occur to me that they might become Wanted! That is so cool!
---
I think so. I know there's one for slower hunger and thirst. If you're wearing power armor all the time though regenerating is essentially free, not worth spending perk points on. Though in my experience if you're always wearing power armor you'll end up with more stimpacks than you know what to do with so even the regenerating is unnecessary.
---
Dang. You guys spending atoms?
---
True, meat week seems to grab focus away from anything else.
---
What's your level? I'm at 277 on my main, and I never had problems with soloing the event and enemies in Free Range Pre-OW. 
---
Tried two events so far tonight, and watched ghouls 1 shot my Brahmin two times. The wolves are more of a nuisance, but at least I can heal the Brahmin after killing them
---
I'd like a PA light arm mod since I use the Sheepsquatch head instead of a helm.
---
2 shot teslas are pretty good? I'll hafta pull mine outa storage if thats the case, I got tired of the 15 ammo cap and constant reloading but i liked the gun
---
Stack the Rested, Lunchbox, and cranberry relish.  They stack, and it makes farming SO much easier
---
Shotguns are making a resurgence, especially with limb damage. Combat shotguns on auto, preferably with Anti armor and VATS perks can decimate most common enemies without having to deal with the health rubber banding effect showing up
---
Off topic of camps: Holy shit my reputation with raiders is still in neighborly and literally I have to do is say ‚Äúhave a good day‚Äù and I‚Äôll get the gauss mini gun
---
Regular
---
The bar represents your bond to that player. You cannot bond with yourself so your own name will not have a bar.
---
The bond persists between parties. If you are fully bonded and they move to another group, if you join them in that group you will still be bonded.
---
The number of people in the group you are bonded with increases the strength of the buff of the public group.
---
***I‚Äôm glad you asked!!***
---
Here‚Äôs a solid lead farming route that doesn‚Äôt require using Lucky Hole Mine. That will let you save up your Acid to make Gunpowder as needed. If you need places to farm Steel, I recommend running Uranium Fever whenever it shows up. During my last run I ended up with over 1k Steel from scrapping all the gear they dropped. You can also reference this doc for Steel or other resources:  https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
**This is the route I use:** *(The #c at the end is how many caps it takes to Fast Travel from the previously listed spot. The entire route costs about 100 caps. If your C.A.M.P. is placed along the route somewhere (mine is near Silo Alpha, for example) you can reduce this as well as have a guaranteed spot to dump your loot easily. And having the Survival Tent will make this easier, especially after the silo runs.)*
---
+ Green Country Lodge (40 Lead Scrap) 9c from Vault 76
---
+ Eastern Regional Penitentiary (80 Lead Scrap) 18c  (or 12c from Vault 76)
---
+ Missile Silo Bravo (80 Lead Scrap) 10c
---
+ Pleasant Valley Cabins &amp; Ski Resort (90 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Alpha (80 Lead Scrap) 4c
---
+ Monorail Elevator (80 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Charlie (80 Lead Scrap) 13c
---
+ Charleston Fire Department (80 Lead Scrap) 18c
---
It‚Äôs usually about 600 Lead Scrap, give or take. For the silos, just run in to the gym on the first floor, grab the weights and run out. For the monorail elevator, wear your Power Armor (it‚Äôs a long drop if you misstep).
---
600 lead scrap should get you about 9600 rounds of 5.56 with Ammosmith 2, Ammo Factory 4 &amp; Super Duper 3. If you make sure that your damage perks are optimized, you can usually kill most enemies with just a few rounds. 
---
That run above doesn‚Äôt even factor in Luck Hole mine or the random lead you can pick up from other world items. Make sure Lead is one of your tagged junk items and just pick up items that show as tagged with the magnifying glass. 
---
With just a short time dedicated to an efficient run, you can have more than enough ammo. I run a .50 cal on my main, currently have 20K+ rounds for that and still craft and sell about 30-40k 5.56 rounds every week (note; that was *before* the Ammo Factory Legendary perk. I expect to sell possibly twice as much now.)
---
I‚Äôm 334. I never seen the cows get one shot.
---
No. We're stacking XP buffs and grinding XP. Prime Cuts helps a lot but if I'm not there I'm running West Tek or doing random Events for hours at a time. I spent Atoms towards the end of Season 1 but this time I'm aiming to do it without cheesing it.
---
and scrip, and bullion.  :P
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been collecting lunch boxes and cranberry relish for the weekend and I‚Äôm just going to only xp and challenge farm to see how far I can get
---
Torch path gang rise up.
---
Ad Victoriam, brother.
---
I LOVE THIS!  
---
Almost see a DS flipping the bunk assembly right off the Foundation block
---
I can help next time I'm on if you weren't able to complete it today. PSN TracerBullet53
---
How does the skin look in general?
---
Would it be good for some halloween costumery
---
Friendly NPCs are buffed
---
I wish these would show up more. I've only seen random ones a couple of times.
---
Funny, if I'm wanted i get stalked, I'm not even a low level, but someone will clap my bloodied build from behind within minutes of me being wanted before i can turn around to defend myself, I'm assuming people don't want to kill you cuz they think you're bait for their high level sneak build friend to kill you once you start shooting.
---
It‚Äôs a new plan for the treasure hunter events
---
Ad Victoriam
---
I don't know if it's just me, but having 100 steps feels like it forces them to spread out rewards that I want and give me a period of time when I don't care about the rewards I'm getting. For example, I use secret service armor and I went through a long grind to get it (and then I cover it up with cosmetic clothes from events). I don't care about wood armor paint. I'll never care about wood armor paint. I don't even care about leather or metal or, especially, robot armor. Robot armor is ugly, and smearing red paint on it isn't going to make me wear it. But every few levels, there's another reward I'm never going to care about.
---
I understand that having a reward that I can get every day, even if I don't care about that specific reward, still offers a sense of accomplishment that keeps players coming back, but I think that I'd rather see 10 levels with reward bundles (all the armor paints plus 150 atoms at one time) with point totals equivalent to every 10 levels in the current progression would make the milestones feel more impressive. If you want more, then do them the equivalent of every 5 levels and swap off between consumables and camp/cosmetics for each bundle. For me, it would make the achievements more meaningful.
---
Nice
---
So, is a tato like a tomato with the texture of a potato? That actually sounds pretty good.
---
Thank you brother üôè
---
I scrapped 2 Mothman wings. I came across one in the cranberry bog and he dropped 2. I had to get off real quick. The next time I logged I saw scorched earth pop. I ran there and after the event I ran to the first tent (as I usually do) to scrap the flux. It wasn‚Äôt until later that I was searching my inventory for it that I realized it had been scrapped. In a few hundreds hours, that was the only time I have ever gotten a Mothman wing.
---
Nice. What's good so far is that the subjugator hasnt come out of hiding to give us a tune for our money
---
Lots of the Atom Store helmets have a headlamp!  
---
Of course, it's an unintended bug because they don't actually *have* headlamps, and it shines behind your right shoulder for some reason, and it would've been picked up and fixed if they had performed even the most basic level of quality assurance and testing on the crap they try to flog off to us..
---
Do you want more mothman stuff? Then heres more mothman stuff! 
---
Like sheesh I get its West Virginia but there are other cryptids that should get love. What about the Sheepsquach? We rarely see Sheepsquach merch.
---
Prison and Bolton greens usually have a low level monster or two.  Go in solo, if you don't fine one right away, reload.
---
Had the same issue the other day, but I do have a mic and no one would touch me even with me begging "kiiiilllll meeeee" at the cook out
---
Had to run into someone's gating plasma shots during heart of the swamp to finally die
---
Same here. Game froze, got back on and it cycled over and over...
---
What did you run into? One guy saying mean words to you thus you assume that the whole community is getting worse? 
---
So far my entire experience is still fine on PS4 except for the few griefers
---
If you get downed and revived, you gain full control, but your character will keep snoring and getting well rested!
---
The same happens with instruments, I play music through every Earle fight now to keep the players spirits up!
---
Energy weapons have not been able to roll explosive mod for quite some time.
---
PIPE IS LIFE!
---
What do you mean by worse. Like I think the daily ops made the community help each other out a lot more and interact more
---
Lost some with Patch 21, patch 22 made it worse!
---
Gotta protect their loot bags too
---
I keep getting the lights and the signs so I feel your pain. üò•
---
I‚Äôve got two jumpsuits, two spec op hoods, two galleria signs, and one solar panel and one Burroughs sign. 
---
So yeah, rng likes duplicates, anecdotally anyway.
---
Propel just aren't as nice as they used to be. I'm running into more D Bags everyday.
---
Agreed. Upvoting
---
just did that and it worked good. thank you :) üíï
---
Feels the same on PC ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
There's got to be. An in game auction house for example. Somehow that should be possible. But seeing all those posts in the mar ketplace with like no responses, especially on PC, does not give me high hopes in getting what I need to finish my builds
---
You‚Äôre very welcome!
---
Happy cake day!! Where can one find one?
---
I‚Äôd like to see the end product. Great start and good concept. Advictoriam!!!
---
New fallout 1st feature coming soon, cap stash. First bug? Anyone can access it.
---
What kind of sound?
---
Ok from patch day last week tuesday to this week tuesday same scenario. Just trying to figure out why its not happening anymore. Maybe daily ops? I dunno
---
Trade your duplicate rewards for those you do not yet have (except glaive plan which can't be traded). And utilize your alt characters. That is what i did and now i have all the rewards. Oooor just wait couple weeks and buy them off player vendors for couple hundred caps.
---
Compared to how long ago? I'm on PS and am not sure what you mean.
---
Edit: ah I got it. Less than a day ago you asked this sub for help for a glitch and didn't understand the solution someone gave, so you called them an "idiot", told them to "get a brain" and called them a "dunce". The issue is you.
---
I keep running into afk people In daily ops just tryin to get a free reward
---
Why is pipe?
---
Also you have to pay extra for those which is why i didnt include them. But its a good point
---
Tbf they were at the pick so there's a stash box but yeah, that's why I only drop like 40 stims
---
This
---
I have 3 war glaive plans in my stash. I‚Äôm keeping them Incase I can start trading them one day, but by then their mostly would sell for nothing.
---
In the forest, there's a loop just below a highway 65 sign. If you search around the area, you can find 4-7 firecaps. Use green thumb, and make it a routine for a while.
---
Is that what that is?  Interesting.
---
When you log in to the game, stay at the main menu amd open your scoreboard. Check your rank which should be normal and then carry on joining a world. For some reason if you don't do this, the game decides to reload all your ranks in game as soon as you get another rank up. Doing this has consistently worked for me, but I am on PC. Not sure if it would help on console versions.
---
Yes please
---
Lvl 22.
---
I missed at least a day, haven't done most Level Up Dailies, and haven't done a NW challenge. I've gone back to work so my grind capability is much less than for Season 1.
---
Thank you! You get get them from doing A Colossal Problem. You have a chance of getting it after completion.
---
Oh yeah that would major suck but wouldnt put it past Bethesda lol even if its ironed out in pts.
---
Oh yeah. Those people aren't new but they are a lot more obvious because of the 4 player limit in the daily ops
---
That terrible mile miner event ohhhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooooooo.
---
When does that start?
---
Strictly pve for me. I've just noticed an increase in these weapons used since the new patch and with the ttk being so fast on them, some of these events are getting a little more difficult to compete in. Primal cuts namely being amazing for xp but when you dont get any tags, well... not so great anymore
---
Shotguns only work well in vats with specific effects such as limb dmg and vats chance, cant think of the other effects that work.
---
I'd start looking for a different weapon. The gatling has a fairly low rate of fire, and your damage output won't be great. A handmade or fixer would be good for commando, or a gatling laser/plasma for heavy.
---
If you can't find bloodied versions yet, anti-armor weapons are good. You'll still get some damage boost from your perk cards and adrenal reaction, and the armor penetration is noticeable.
---
I essentially soloed him last night.
---
You can do that? Damn I thought it wasn't possible to rename chassis
---
Yea  I use the stim diluted so i get 4 diluted out of 1 reg. I am constantly selling them for the weight. But i have re done some perk cards so i use a decent amount now. Nice to not really have to watch the hp gage
---
The dark matter power armor plays a small space jingle whenever you enter it, I was wondering if it has something like that
---
I'm not sure because I've never had a tse, but my junkies explosive is aMAZing and my favorite gun. I don't think you can go wrong with either. Explosive is really powerful
---
Check the wiki, I know i've added some locations on there as well as a few others...
---
Betas for life! I was a beta og too
---
Reduce damage when blocking on armor causes all shotguns to become ‚Äúmagic‚Äù.

I love this community. Another mod from a discord helped me build my PA Set with mods and legacy paint free of charge.
---
Y'all know that symbols work and show up before letters right?
---
.like this
---
-or this if you wanna be fancy-
---
I don't have any blue prints.
---
I think so but, give it a try, fast travel, try to reload something big, fire a shot or two.  Swap guns, swap back, reload again.  If the bug isn't just me then you'll really notice the difference!
---
Not only did I not read your post all the way through, I didn't read your response all the way through either.
---
I suppose thats true
---
Earlier Today I played various daily ops and I like starting the public team myself so that I have more options as the leader. In one game, we had 4 people and the 4th never joined, kicked him to make room for another in the group who actually joins.
---
In another, there was a high level (150 or 200, don't remember exactly), never touched a single point and by the end of the second he was still near the spawn area killing mutants, I'm assuming just to farm. Kicked him.
---
In one more, It was just 3 people and one random was afflicted by the "wendigo-man" glitch or whatever its called.  I wasn't sure if his guns were glitched or what but he was just running around like a headless chicken, but i kept that guy in because he was contributing to filling up the points.
---
Basically I'm saying i would have let a lv18 in whether they were a legit new player or not, so long as they did SOMETHING.  I know from experience that higher level doesn't mean you're better at the game.
---
i did see a cargobot the same level as my character. if i play public server out of 20+ drops i only got less than half. when i play private it gets to me but not instantly, when it says get the supply drop and it marks it i wait a little bit before i get there.
---
At this point all I have left is to go the extra mile in power levels. That means "perfect rolls" and the like. But with however many chances there are to decrease the efficiency of a weapon with one or two off rolls in addition to the sheer number of weapons and armor that can be rolled when getting a legendary, chances are you HAVE to look at trying to barter for the last few pieces of the puzzle

Misc. Structures. Between the Cranes quest sign and Green portapotties.
---
Nice i also read that you could them them from the legendary run but i completed that and i even checked armour ace and no such reward exists there. Just wanna confirm that A colossal problem is the only way
---
Avowed is also supposed to be an exclusive. Looking forward to that
---
Why not pa?  You're losing out on 45% armor pen.
---
Just let us mod our dang pip boys
---
Is this the Brotherhood Special Ops Mask? If you're on Xbox you can have mine. I hate the BOS. Bunch O' Shits, you ask me.
---
ign: inversecoma
---
i can provide some lead probably
---
Literally the only downside
---
How much dropped per kill?  Curious if it's still a net gain with a minigun.
---
PIPE IS LIFE
---
A hundred times this. A clean Garb of Mystery (with Eye or Ra on the outfit) we can wear armor under would be a genuine game changer for my main.
---
I‚Äôd love to see wandering recruits of the Responders patrolling areas while one or two people wear the Responders power armor left over by the original group
---
You can farm legendaries, xp, and ammo from the ops and you can do it solo without launching a nuke over and over again. I think that's where a lot of the focus has gone.
---
Yeah power armour get all the goodies. *sad sneaky boi noices*
---
Gotcha, ok! Thanks for the input
---
I love it. Love being able to do endgame anywhere rather than two zones. To each their own.
---
**Narrator** - "He won't"
---
Tbh, I never even thought about that!
---
Lucio Ball is back, baby
---
To its the source location of the light. Lokking at a desk with the pipboy light just blacks out whatever is on the desk
---
Just take off your armor and clothes and take your death
---
31 i think. Still have 1 weekly left
---
I feel like every community of every game I play is getting worse or I‚Äôm just getting more üßÇ
---
Did you actually see them compete (pop up on screen)? Did you happen to play through daily reset (just under 10 hours ago)? If you did, you might have been hit by the auto complete bug, though I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs still a thing this season
---
Are they lvl 100 always?
---
Same thing with the outfit if you didn't figure it out, you only get one unit of it
---
Hit 46, 30 minutes ago. Son is on 32. No atoms spent just good all farming.   
---
And I farm a lot with my 309% xp boost.
---
I don‚Äôt know how incredibly fast they can kill the prime beasts, I would imagine if you have a weapon with explosive effect, you could vats the beasts with a shot or two and that should be sufficient for tagging. The event is also timed so if people don‚Äôt kill them quickly, it can fail and no prime meats for anyone.
---
I love you
---
Also why do bullion plans stay purchasable even when known when none of them can be shared either
---
While we're at it, can we please be able to do something with "crafted" legendary drops? Ever since I bought the Gauss gun plan I've been getting Gauss guns dropped as loot. Don't want them, but I cant sell them in my shop, can't sell them to a vendor, can't cash them in for scrip, and can't even give them away...  What's the point of putting a cap value on them if we can't sell them?
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware, a colossal problem is the only way I believe.
---
I‚Äôm surprised there isn‚Äôt more headgear with light attachments lol the pipboy light sucks
---
Maybe new/returning people due to the one Wastelanders update. Hopefully the jerks will get bored and it‚Äôll go back to (most) people being nice again. I‚Äôve noticed suddenly people are awful at the meat cook event and not even playing the drums before the event starts to get easy score...
---
Pipe is Life
---
I‚Äôm patient. But I also believe you might be correct.
---
On a serious note my camp is on one of the spawns for it so I occasionally get a sniff
---
I assume this is the 'helping npc's in a mine' event someone was describing earlier. Buuut mainly just commenting because you have a badass name lol
---
Hahaha üòÇüòÇ
---
Stick them in a container then take them out one by one. There should be another container near the turn in box
---
There also might be a limit per day but I'm not sure on that one
---
Very handy if you have multiple PA frames. Inspect it in your inventory, then rename it.
---
My understanding is that Two Shot adds a flat 25% damage bonus for weapons along with an additional projectile. So in the case of shotguns, while it's only adding one additional pellet, you still receive the 25% damage increase that gets divided evenly across all pellets.
---
Great interview, was glad to hear camps are getting a focus next year. Even though I am not the best camp builder I do love trying to make something at least a little interesting.
---
I KNOW THIS. Right next to Slocum Joe's in the Forest, starts the firecap area. Follow the river up to Morgontown, looking in the grass near it and a little up the various hills. Using Green Thumb, you can get like 30 firecaps.
---
Cool but sucks you can‚Äôt stream fallout 76 on iPhones. Already got a new android and now I can play fallout 76 via xcloud. Now I can enjoy the game on a work trip next month.
---
My turrets have perfect accuracy against travelling merchants, but cannot hit anything that actually attacks us!
---
DO isn't a time limited event
---
**PIPE IS LIFE**
---
Or hit me up i got 1700 on me
---
It‚Äôs underwhelming at best. The main flame is constantly burning upwards with a distinct trail and there is a secondary flame effect that comes from midway down the head that‚Äôs always lagging behind you wherever you go. It‚Äôs weird seeing two separate trails tbh and makes it look lazy imo. If you stay in first person it‚Äôs fine, but honestly it feels more like someone‚Äôs first mod.
---
Though I think I will still use it. It‚Äôs distinct and kind of charming in its own way, but it really could have been something great. I also wish it gave off some light to complete the torch aesthetic, but that is a secondary issue.
---
I still have good results with my Shotgunner.    
---
The pump action is too slow. The Combat Shotgun would probably be the best regarding ease of getting ammo, fire rate, damage, etc.    
---
The head is a weakpoint in many enemies so keep going for that. I haven't had too much trouble with it. It's a learning thing all over again.
---
In Watoga just north of the BOS vendor there‚Äôs an outdoor cafe that I can usually get dog food at. Also equipping Can Do triggers on trash cans and dumpsters for food
---
I am on xbox i would appreciate the gift
---
You can try Valley Galleria, tons of trashcans there, and it works on the refrigerators inside too.
---
Right next to the vault 94 jumpsuit/under armor?
---
I think it‚Äôs a consequence of live service games, players have expectations (usually set by deceptive marketing) that the games can‚Äôt possibly meet due to team size, complexity etc. These games often overhype and cause communities to get disappointed and bitter, but we‚Äôve spent so much on them that we feel like we can‚Äôt quit (sunk cost fallacy).
---
Ah nice
---
Well, fingers crossed we see it by the end of the year. Cheers!
---
Who is pipe
---
Dogs are common near Grafton Steel, as is the Grafton monster on the bridge
---
I think I'm at the same.    
---
So far the rewards are mostly not that great. I've managed to get all of the Daily and Weekly ones done pretty quickly. I don't do NW.
---
I thought whatever weapon you use to kill the enemy is the ammo they drop, but if i switch guns before the boss dies, and i go to loot corpses, they will have the ammo of the gun i just switched into? What about the common awards? Will the ammo be of the gun i have currently equipped, or the gun i used to kill all the enemies?
---
I dont know, guess i dont know wich PA is the best one
---
Dang, how tho? I've been doing these and idk how people are ahead of me without using atoms?
---
The time spent loadinginto  NW then finding a creature you could probably get 20k exp just grinding mobs for the repeatable
---
Pistols unplayable with damage nerf. Forget about pistol build until Bethtesda up pistol's damage
---
Get it done man, I believe in you
---
I havent done any NW challenges cause I just hate it
---
Sewage vent from Moleminer city.
---
I got my brother in law one of those for Christmas one year
---
As a veteran, the increase in difficulty is less fun, yes I can handle it but seeing supr mole rats that out dps a bear, fog crawler and a rad scorpion is just crazy!
---
The levek scaling is also way out of whack, lv 20 scorched are tankier now than lv 68 scorched used to be pre one wasteland!
---
They should have done level scaling or nerf, not both at once!
---
I havent done any nw challenges, I hate that game mode
---
Thanks for the tip, you right on that, i like gatling because the bloodied, but yeah so slow
---
I'm a Veteran and I LOVE Mr. Gutsy.    
---
"Is that someone who needs me to kick their ASS!" üòÜ    
---
"Look at that. All dolled up and ready to die for your country."
---
Take my upvote as we pistol users really need a proper damage boost.
---
Lv 100 ones are even worse!
---
Best news ever
---
Dang, and quick question, when does the Subjugator arrive to move on the board? He should arrive sometime soon idk
---
I know DO aren‚Äôt limited time, but I assumed the rewards are going to be since they mostly revolve around the BoS theme, like next season there will be different rewards probably
---
I start at the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center, grab the ones in the basement, then make my way up the river, get the Slocum‚Äôs Joe ones, the ones around the yellow house behind it, the ones behind the bus, then keep going. Very relaxing
---
I literally dont use magic weapons. I got them but I don't use them. Wanna remain ready if they ever fix them. Using a AAFFR90 UC Gatling Laser, but I got a few magic Miniguns and Shotguns.
---
Didnt think about that. Makes a lot of sense.
---
Alright here's mine (i'm a bloodied melee build)
---
1. Fix hit reg for melee especially
---
2. Even if a mob is killed before you were able to hit it you can still loot (can't hit a mob with melee if the two shot explosive fixer can kill him with vats before i get to it)
---
3. 3 star legendary drops 3 star loot
---
4. Give the ability to learn dragonrend shout to the vault dweller because of scorchbeast never landing 
---
5. uncap the limit of collection of dirty water from water pomps (a lot of items require boiled water instead of purified)
---
6. Make a new damage system where every weapon is viable but they overall all have the same dps like a fast firing minigun takes more bullets to achieve the same damage as a slow swing of super sledge and a slow firing fatman with a huge reload time deals the best damage and with perks optimization and food/chems you deal 50% or more damage.
---
7. Stop making atom shop item time limited and stop selling stuff as bundle even though you only want one thing from the bundle
---
8. Speaking of atoms, make the atom achievement repeatable 
---
9. Magazines and bobbleheads gets you permanent buffs and aren't randomly placed on the map.
---
10. Increase duration of alcohol buffs (rad ant lager (+50 carry weight) for example lasts one minute)
---
11. add to cola nut perk card the ability to stop having black out with nukashine
---
12. End game bosses give better rewards making it worthwhile and every reward in game stops giving plan dupes
---
13. No scripts limit/gold bullion limits/caps limits/vendor caps limit
---
14. The ability to make plans
---
Number fifteen: the ability to sell ammo, and plans to bots
---
Lastly:  Make everything tradable
---
Why are they so many "the community sucks" posts today?
---
I can't remember the last time I traded and I haven't done it that much. I have obtained all my gear through questing, crafting my own, buying from player vendors with luck on what I want and prices, and on occasion someone gifting me something.    
---
Learn patience and with luck you can get what you need a good amount of the time.
---
Gunslinger was my first toon in this game and I used it til just recently when the gauss pistol came out.It was always underpowered and the gauss pistol changed very little when it came out.So that‚Äôs when I changed my build to vats stealth commando.
---
They can‚Äôt raise the damage on the pistols to compete with rifles in a realistic aspect.They could just do it to make them viable but it definitely would not make sense from a realism standpoint.Not that anything is realistic in the game to begin with though.
---
The best option they would have is for new perks to be introduced that give pistols a advantage over other weapons types.Like the dual wield aspect that has been thrown out for all fallout games over the years.Whether it be pistol 1 hand melee or double pistol.Since they have never bothered with it I doubt this is even a option.Disarming attacks have been a thing in the past but that mechanic would not work in this game that‚Äôs why they passed on it.
---
In most games 1 handed melee and pistols do less damage but in many of them you can dual wield or use a shield etc.Fallout games just don‚Äôt have this mechanic.Even in other fallout games only a few overpowered pistols could get close to competing.
---
I would be very surprised if we ever see anything decent for gunslingers in the game.
---
How does that work?
---
All the goodies besides the 15 legendary affixes and a jetpack that doesnt burn through fusion cores
---
If you're on PS4 you're welcome to mine, I sold one already but they don't match the commie aesthetic I'm going for.
---
Oh there‚Äôs a bunch in a basket next to a skeleton on a chair at the bottom of one of the pillars near the Monorail Elevator
---
who?
---
I have a question about that. I know you can't equip broken armor, so you just don't take it off. But can you still enter/exit power armor and still have you're broken armor equipped?
---
Cuz it sucks
---
Loving my AAFFR90 UC Gatling Laser.
---
Random. Sometimes none, sometimes a lot.
---
Have to serve hop every few tries
---
I accidentally sold 1200 rounds of Shotgun shells on my Shotgunner while turning in ammo. I lost points in getting them back and ended up Equipping Ammo Factory R1, Ammo Smith and Super Duper to minimize the hit.    
---
Point is: Slow DOWN people.
---
I really miss how the maps looked when they were in your pipboy
---
I have indeed caught them wearing the different cultist masks from the shop
---
Well if you have completed every challenge every day since season 2 started the only difference can be the time played / xp gained. I personally run high int build all the time with max rank inspirational perk to maximize xp gains. And when i remember, i try to keep my well rested buff up. I play maybe 2 hours a day (just to complete all the daily activities/objectives like scrip limit etc), and do not farm xp per se.
---
I don't know.  
---
In S1 the guy was already there when it started. Who knows how it's going to be this time?
---
I did get 1 to finally drop. I'd left to do some other events and noticed the marker had changed. The 2nd I gave up on since almost an hour passed since calling it. Aint worth waiting an hour for 45 .38 ammo, a can of dog food, 10 dollars and a beer.
---
It would be nice to see the Caged and Spiked armors come to the shop and get some use from the raiders. I mean technically one of them has a variant of one, but that Forged armor was a favorite of mine.
---
Maybe a cabin symbol with a heart? I always pop the heart emote if I like a camp I‚Äôm at and if the owner is home.
---
If I'm being completely honest i literally only ever used a local map when i was in the fallout 3 subways
---
If you do roll a 3 Star, use that link and weight your benefits to losses.  
---
A few points of lost damage reduction or something isn't a big loss.  
---
When you can, get the SS Buttressed Chest armor plan. It adds a good boost to overall damage reduction. The lesser ones aren't worth the gold.
---
I use ~ as it drops everything I want to keep to the bottom of the list, and that lets me spam scrap without issue from the top of the list so long as I slow down when close to my good stuff. I also rename my gas mask "~ A Gas Mask" and my hazmat suit "~ A Hazmat Suit" so that they're at the top of the keep-list. That way if I somehow manage to oops and scrap an extra item, it's easily replaceable. The one thing I do have to watch out for is new items I've picked up since the last scrap-session (usually cosmetic-type outfits) and I've definitely scrapped a few of those by mistake. :|
---
is worth if you are kinda starting out as low level and you need easy resources but the damn things never worked for me. which is a shame the system is there and implemented just buggy.
---
Huh, it's almost like actually playing the game would be better than sitting on your rear in a bush.
---
I've done nothing but lead them back to my single digit randos all night
---
I‚Äôm curious how the servers are split up between the states. I don‚Äôt want to jinx myself but after a solid month of being back I haven‚Äôt run into any negative players. 
---
When I played on Xbox that was a different story. Otherwise PC has been really positive for me. I did run into a newbie who was trying to hit me with a shovel, I am in passive mode; and I basically signified that we could do that fight but he isn‚Äôt going to win and he left me alone.
---
In my experience its the same as its always been on PS4 while Ive been playing this game. The occasional arsehole but on the  whole very positive. Having come from playing Red Dead Online to this game, the difference in community is chalk and cheese
---
Im a level 460+ and I join and just throw up the ? And follow anyone else. If they get lost I'm at least lost with them.
---
I rename all items I want to keep/equip so that I don't make this mistake.
---
Names like: zzz Natalia's Deathclaw Gauntlet
---
The zzz will ensure that it is always at the end of the list.
---
What I really wish though is for there to be a way to remove some items from the scrap/sell menus.
---
Hey I got an extra Deep Mining Gas Mask if you‚Äôd like one
---
i'm collecting magic weapons at the moment, what are the legendary prefix on yours?
---
I still open my pipboy about 98% of the time for the map.
---
Yeah I kept the poisoner (the better one) but I‚Äôve spent too much on my arm so I‚Äôll just move onto the other parts for now
---
Speaking of flatwoods monster every time he shows at my camp all my mutfruit from the trees is gone.Not any of my other plants just the mutfruit.Is this where he gets his purple power from or what?
---
Isn't that the truth. I keep buying bulk ballistic fiber from the robo vendors. With selling loot back and my vendor, its easy to turn over the 2900 caps all 10 bulk cost. Worst part is the secret service armor doesn't even need it!
---
This is a cute wholesome idea ‚ù§Ô∏è I like it
---
I used to just drop them, now that 25% of my play time is to make sure i can switch into my stealth suit without being over cumbered, i put all my plans into my vendor for 10 caps
---
Dude, pistols are the only thing in my arsenal that hit after the nerf.  I didn't confirm numbers before nerf before 22, but check out my B2525 gamma gun damage stats with current patch:
---
* 389 ballistic
---
* 110	electric w/signal carrier antennae
---
* 125	rad w/deep dish
---
* That's 624 total damage, way more than than anything per shot I used even before the patch!
---
\^\^20% health and max gunsliger and adrenaline reaction mutation, zero chems, zero adrenaline perk, zero chems/food and no sneak perks.
---
Now check out my previous/nerf BE25 Lever damage w/max rifleman, adrenaline reaction mutation @ 20% health, zero adrenaline perk, zero chems/food benefits and no sneak perks
---
287 ballistic vs pre-22 493
---
Finally, check out my previous/nerf BE25 Fixer w/max commando, adrenaline reaction mutation @ 20% health, zero adrenaline perk, zero chems/food benefits and no sneak perks
---
* 177 ballistic vs pre-22 293
---
Anecdotal, Piper (pipe gun benefiting from both rifleman and gunslinger perks) same conditions as above:
---
* 250 ballistic vs pre-22 631
---
So, given the piper damage output post 22 nerf (plus max rifleman), there must be something unique w/the gamma guns that needs to be researched.  I remember them being in the low-300's pre 22 w/out perks.  I keep them for the unexpected PVP b/c they ridiculously wrecked even w/out those perks.
---
I've only realized this a few days ago and have yet to verify effectiveness in field.  The numbers are crazy despite the nerf, so optimistic.
---
Currently I have 2x B2525 gamma, 2x A2525 gamma, 2x J2515 gamma, 1x TS2515 gamma and 1x TS5015 gamma, and will be testing those this upcoming weekend.
---
I'm going to post this information in the forum shortly since it may keep people from jumping ship, because I was planning to do just that.
---
Mine's at the junk pile just South of abandoned bog town. Good junk source, rare enemy encounters, nice amount if traffic and right next to the Cranberry Bog's Pime Cuts event
---
[equips Cannibal 3]
---
Yes I will be right over... ;)
---
Had similar the other day. Accidentally opened a level 0 locked door. Wandered around for a good half hour while people came up to me, looked, and ran away. Must have thought I was bait?
---
I was doing Primal Cuts earlier today near the downed aircraft and getting owned by the molerats while trying to take out other prime targets and thinking "these new f'n molerats can bite my nutsack" - then I realized that's probably exactly what they were doing.
---
Yea how much and what do you play on?
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 where the crashes are baffling and the specs don't matter!
---
You might be able to try setting core affinities or bumping the priority of the game up to try something at least. Lack of easily accessible logging and error codes makes this game a nightmare to troubleshoot.
---
My friend who joined FO76 without playing any previous games said "Where is the interior maps button?" I explained even if we had the maps it wouldn't matter they were completely useless.
---
- 25% and 50% Power Cores can be found on random power armor spawns, and sometimes when an enemy uses a heavy weapon that drops a Gatling Laser. 100% Power Cores can be produced from Power Stations, but you'll need 100 workshop power - which you'll need a Fusion generator, or to repair the Power Plant adjoining it, which is a tough quest for a level 20.
---
- The power frame blueprint is obtained by finishing the Garrahan Excavator Power Armor quest, which is also quite beyond a level 20. You'll likely be better served getting to Whitesprings or Foundation and using the power frame crafting station, and even then, you'll have to pass some high level places to get there.
---
- You'll likely have to again, take Power Armor pieces from Power Armor spawns. I think only level 15 Raider stuff will be available for you to physically use, and you'll have to wait till 25, 30, 35, and above to use the cool stuff.
---
I wish theyd rotate more individual items through on the flash sales. They seem to have dropped off a lot to what they were. Theres things Im still hoping to see. I want the potted Sundew plant on its own and the Mr pebbles backpack. Im also hoping to see the coffin backpack since halloween is around the corner. Seems to be the same stuff coming back around
---
Well, additional bonus, at the top of the elevator, there's lead and concrete
---
It was so much better that way, even if they just made 76s map the old retro style like all the others had would be much better in my opinion
---
Have you tried to travel to Crater?
---
Being there starts the quest for me
---
Give me level 200 roaches
---
Yeah i kinda lost hope for that one too
---
PC players all seem happy to me. Nobody griefing, everyone helping everyone out. I play a ton and server hop a lot, I've seen it all. One big happy family for the most part.
---
Those mean ol console kids got something to prove I guess.
---

---
Maybe the fact that it plays in the wrong spot is related to the Ash Heap/Camden Park quests that spawn when you're nowhere near that?
---
Makes me wonder if there is an invisible layer that's supposed to line all these things up with the visible map, and its scale is off.
---
It is annoying but you can't expect to get all the rewards just by getting one month of Fallout 1st every now and again.
---
Thank you kind sir for I didn‚Äôt know that and know I can also mark lead off the list of materials
---
Here's some stuff i'd be willing to buy from the shop:
---
\- "Atomic Arsenal": A pack of placeable decorative military vehicles such as the APCs or twin-barreled Main Battle Tanks, vertibird (with placeable landing pad), etc. Perhaps some of those mininuke containers and nukes as well
---
\- Ranger Tower: This was datamined a while back with the ATX shop code tag
---
\- Nuka World Raider gang outfit &amp; camp decoration bundles
---
\- Far Harbor outfit, armor skins, &amp; camp decor bundles
---
\- Enclave Scientist hazmat suit &amp; enclave bundle
---
\- BoS outfit or item bundles
---
Eh you get the idea.
---
Hell, i'd even love getting my hands on those teal institute hazmat suits. Extra points if we can get various colors for it.
---
The devs said they felt it was too buggy and they haven't been able to fix it. I think they should do it anyway, we all want it
---
I buy in bulk
---
Excavator rules but it has no jet pack mod
---
I like x-01 cause it looks good. Truth is i feel well protected with all power armours and i choose only based on looks
---
The bumper sword from new vegas
---
I can't say for a minigun, but I used a handmade and checked ammo before and after.
---
I had a net gain of about 160 rounds, and that was with only looting 25% of the bodies. Usually takes an average 5-6 rounds per super mutant, including missed shots, and for what I did pick up, I averaged 10 rounds per body.
---
Same drops with a shotgun, so I would assume it would apply to a minigun. Hope that helps.
---
Edit: someone else said they drop about 20 5mm, so my assumption was not correct.
---
I've been paying for it for months tho
---
Wait, how are you dying at the cookout?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(yes I know you mean prime cuts)
---
Yep, I didn't even play for a few months and left it running for the bonus cash shop points. Came back to over 5K points. Not only is the endless junk stash pretty much a must-have for me, the survival tent is ezmode icing on the cake. Edit: Ah right, and I pretty much live on private servers now unless it's time to poke around player vendors.
---
It almost doesn't matter. I run Excavator most of the time for the extra carry weight. And since you are bloodied use the Emergency Protocols mod, since you can't have a jetpack for the Excavator anyways.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Maybe the dev's are letting us get a head start before bad guy just rushes up the board
---
I think December should have all the items from the previous year. 
---
I'll be honest, I'd much rather be able to choose the Elite Ranger Armor over half the stuff we've gotten in the past few months.
---
I agree!  The emote would specifically tell them vs. them assuming you are even emoting about their camp.
---
Dude as someone who lives 10 minutes from where this was filmed I'm all for this.
---
It is literally a stash box but only for junk and has infinite space
---
Can we get the weapons balance they promised before pointless crap.
---
Shit, you're a genius! Priming my handmade for farming today!
---
Not really pointless :)
---
You can't put scrap into a scrap box without fallout 1st.  With fallout 1st, that answer is yes.   Works just like a stash box
---
Are you pc or console?
---
I agree completely
---
Yo! Both flamingos have lights, the positioning is the only thing different. ALSO, the lights are yellow on them when turned on, and red-ish bulbs when turned off. 
---
Also I love these things, I only got the free ones though cause one position is all I need...lol. 
---
Cheers!!
---
I've personally been a sub of F1st since Wastelanders dropped. It just so happens that the one thing I want from F1st left with that update. 
---
I'm actually gutted, the Elite/Advanced Ranger armor is my favourite and had I known it was in the game I would've bought F1st for it. However I only found out a few weeks after Wastelanders came out when I was playing NW and seen somebody wearing it.
---
I believe most of the crashed and freezes are because they use incredibly bad servers. They most likely have the cheapest budget server package from AWS. I have never played a online game with this much lag and delay and other issues that are clearly related to servers.
---
Did he mention whether this would be DLC we would have to pay for?
---
If it doesn't already, perhaps pacifist should block picking player locks.
---
What they said
---
Ask the assaultrons I keep shooting in the head once with my Enforcer-buffed shotty to disable their lasers if heads count as a limb
---
Truly! I can‚Äôt wait for the interiors, so much potential!
---
Toilet reading stash!!!! Now I know what I want for the new camp display.
---
I usually buy psycho and buffout
---
Maybe. I don‚Äôt really struggle, and I have never traded outside of using player vendors. 
---
Honestly, the damage difference isn‚Äôt as much as you think. Someone with a B2525 Handmade is definitely going to outdamage a 1* Bloodied Handmade, but the difference before you factor in your build is roughly 13%. That‚Äôs not enough to really matter in a game where DPS is not really critical in any scenario.
---
So you can manage just fine with decent armor, and a 1* weapon complimented by a good build. No godrolls needed.
---
No i died at both lol Went up waaayy to high on my jetpack and died to fall damage right when the reward sound went off at the cookout. And watched my corpse get tea bagged lmao ü§£  what a day in fallout
---
You do that ass. ü§£
---
That's strange I haven't had a CTD in months. Have you updated your driver's recently, is your ram use spiking, did you forget to sacrifice a goat to Todd Howard?
---
You know what I want? Short version, add non-straight damage increases to all of the 1-H weapon perks and cards.
---
For the Pistol Perks (Guerrilla, Gunslinger, Crack Shot, Modern Renegade, Packing Light) add something frost he following list to some set of those EXISTING perks; alternatively, add some pistol-only benefits to some perks in other trees (like double the chance for Quick Hands if you use a pistol, etc.)
---
* Reload speed reduction
---
* Flat damage avoidance / dodgy
---
* VATS hit chance
---
* AP refresh
---
* Crit fill
---
And really, love for Gladiator as well ... add these effects to the existing perk cards that apply to 1-H melee weapons
---
* Parry (small flat melee damage avoid, stack w/ blocker)
---
* Riposte (small damage reflect, like Ricochet)
---
Etc.
---
He made sure to mention at the end that everything is still going to be free. 
---
He mentioned how his mindset is that they owe it to the players, to "Make it right" for them.
---
The wiki.
---
Keep this in fallout 76 marketplace
---
Ah ok dang, cause I know you cant do score challenges again so that's why I'm wondering how some people are so far ahead already. Is how does xp affect score?
---
I play every day and I hate it. Todd Howard has personally cursed me to forever be trapped in West Virginia. I see the molerats burrow into the ground and I too wish that I could dig to freedom. Every day is suffering.
---
/s
---
ohhhh.. you should try solo. the enemy robots in there will greet you with open arm fire. üòÜ
---
Add to this: Back entrance to Gauley Mine, The other side of the road from Slocum Joes and the house south of it. Along the power lines and road going north from Point Pleasant and in a basket at the foot of the monorail elevator tower nearest the cliffs.  Also a couple in the basement of the ag center at flatwoods.  With the OP and these locations, you'll get around 50 with green thumb.  Use chemist and super duper to craft nearly 3x the usual amount.
---
I don't know the answer to that. I don't run berserkers but I have read posts about it. You could try finding an almost broken piece and break it and see if you can enter and exit the PA with the broken piece being equipped automatically. I want to say it won't work because the PA removes your armor when you enter.
---
Is the drop for this that much lower than other Daily Ops drops? What am I missing?
---
even without magic damage
---
Dude... it‚Äôs been a week
---
ü§™üòÖ
---
Welcome to Bethesda.
---
You gain 100 score for every 10k xp earned. It's the repeatable weekly challenge.
---
Pipe is life!
---
I love this idea! I use my Christmas tent year round!
---
Thanks. You're right, it would be super easy to test. I'll do that next time something breaks.
---
I would imagine they will return at some point in one form or another.
---
I absolutely agree that this could be great news if this goes ahead. Problem though is Bethesda is pretty poor at sticking to what it says it would do.
---
That aside though, I'm curious as to what the final implementation would be like. I have a gut feeling that the thing that makes the most sense is like a mini version of the vault DLC from Fallout 4 where it's build to go underground or into a cliff face and the interior space starts out as a cavern.
---
I can't see Bethesda leaving cash on the table and not reusing the vault DLC assets for this game. The most features with the least amount of money and effort is very much the Bethesda way.
---
October 15th
---
DO has been out a week.
---
And I've gotten 3 of the damn things...
---
The comments on this thread reminded my why I stopped playing 76. It's a just game I genuinely don't understand why high levels are so adverse to sharing an online open world game with lower levels or randoms.
---
Most people will get it, it‚Äôs like a 10% chance from rewards. It‚Äôs not a huge chance but play special ops enough and you‚Äôll get it. It‚Äôs definitely a lot higher than getting a B2525 fixer before the dupe lol.
---
I hear from a lot of friends that aren't getting the drop either. Just saying.
---
Really, you just had to comment this. Just sad.
---
Nope it doesnt really move it just flickers. You're destined to be Wards errand boy forever. (Cue maniacal laugh) 
---
That last bar seems to take forever. It's a hell of a mundane grind. Keep at it it's worth it in the end.
---
Great idea, would definitely use it
---
Lucio and his balls
---
Yea it‚Äôs a 3% chance. What do you expect?
---
My game has personally been performing better than it has in months. I changed some ini settings as way too much is going on at once for even the best PCs to keep up with. 
---
I'd have a look into that if I was you. It's allowed from what I've seen
---
I tried to use it but i hace one problem i can carry more weight without pa that pa
---
It ebbs and flows. It's good on the whole but we get waves of arseholes at times. Happened a bit after Nuclear Winter dropped. Happened again post Wastelanders.
---
If it‚Äôs easy to get, like the toothyman mask, do you still want it and wear it?
---
Haven't played as much as I could have, but hit 40 tonight.
---
Cool name...I need a Miller about now.
---
I have no experience with that, but if you create a new character, all you need to do is get out of the vault and down to the Overseer's Camp, craft a weapon and a piece of armor, then have that first encounter with Duchess in The Wayward. Challenge completed, without the need for any actual work towards leveling.
---
I paid the lump sum as I had disposable income at the time. I feel like it was worth doing, but since they haven't really kept up on the fo1st "exclusive goodies" it feels like it should be a little cheaper.
---
That said it has made the game quite a lot more enjoyable.  The cosmetics are whatever. As much as i like the ranger armor, i haven't used it in a while. The scrap box is great and really shouldn't be locked behind a 1st sub. The survival tent is nifty, and quite useful, especially when leveling a new character.
---
The monthly atoms are nothing to sneeze at either. I don't spend a lot on the atom shop, mostly due to camp budget (not worth paying for something you don't have room to build), but it's nice to have the atoms there when I see something that really sparks my interest. Also I used atoms for the last 5 ranks last season because I was tired of the grind.
---
Overall, I don't regret the purchase at all.
---
62 atm the new buyable lunchboxes makes my unyielding get like 1k xp a kill I was getting 6k xp for a lvl 100 mirlurk wueen
---
Yes duh lol I didn‚Äôt mean that one I‚Äôm thinking of a different one it was a big high powered sniper rifle
---
Like many have said here it is very much worth it for access to the scrapbox and the survival tent.If you like the atom shop then that‚Äôs another good thing about it with the atoms.The private world is great for doing relaxing resource grinds.Also another plus is next to no scorchbeast attacks unless you go provoke them first.
---
Try moving to "more solid" ground, it works for me the best on flat ground. Try not to be on any sort of man-made foundation
---
Pipe
---
Just a lot of people not getting the outfit besides myself.
---
That's genius. Although the turrets themselves are still noisy :(
---
I recall one I called, Took ages to find to it and when I did it was stuck between 2 buildings just kinda spazzing out.
---
Honestly im suprised anyone uses them.even with a buff i would not use them...unless they gave use dual wielding with them.then and only then would i use a pistol.
---
Roll the chest first anyways. You know you want that sweet, sweet jetpack action. It will change your game.
---
Corpses will drop the same ammo as you use to kill them, unless you are using Fusion or Plasma Cores (in which case you get random other ammo instead).
---
The reward screen is different. That can give you Fusion or Plamsa Cores. I dont know if you have to kill the final boss with the Heavy Energy weapon to get them, or just have that weapon equipped at the end. Probably the former based on other comments.
---
It's used for a Brotherhood of Steel Daily Quest. It's just an easy completion. I haven't played since before the season pass update so if there's any other reason, I'm not aware of it.
---
New glitch to turn them in more then one at a time. Turns out a lot of people like to glitch in this game.
---
I have 3 of them already. Make another character to run more daily ops. It‚Äôs ugly btw.
---
I did one a few days ago. Worked fine. You just have to wait long enough to drop. It'll leave a map marker if you don't see the cargobot make the drop.
---
He was very adamant that Shelters would be coming with the next big content update. 
---
However yeah, I'd want that to be quite honest. I don't particularly care about new features for building. So long as they can refine what we have now. If we can get some new building assets and a big cave, that's what I'm there for. 
---
Also so long as there is a way to fast travel straight into it, I'd imagine how annoying it would be to go to your camp and then inside
---
I figured that, but it gives me the option to store, i never attempted cuz i don't want to lose my junk.
---
Thanks, was wondering, thought I'll ask, gotta love this forum.
---
üòÜ lesson learnt for me. I have watch countless numbers of the senior nuker's video placed the target circle where the zone should not overrun the distint Site V9. I guess i should have adjust a little tiny bit down.
---
&gt;Have you updated your driver's recently
---
.... this computer is literally seven **days** old, bought from an extremely reputable and very very thorough OEM (Puget Systems, in Auburn, WA).  I highly doubt it's the drivers.  :)
---
Also bloodied are garbage and beserker' are garbage..
---
I have tried all these different builds and imo they suck.same with junkies.just horrible builds.i see them get their asses kicked all the damn time.
---
Thanks everyone! I followed all the advice on this post and tonight someone actually bought something from me, yay! Thanks!
---
Power armor reboot,ammo factory, taking one for the team, electric absorption ,funky duds ,sizzling style . in that order
---
The ctd are when the hampster powering the server falls off its wheel.
---
I've had good luck opening a lunchbox at the end of each meat cook.  I usually walk away with 4 stacked from people reciprocating.  100% xp boost for an hour.
---
just found it thank you
---
the game is made specifically to inconvenience and annoy players as much as possible so I don't know why you're surprised that people would look for ways to bypass all the bs.
---
They broke something (or changed intentionally) in the last patch and you can now do the the stash trick again with the data. Meaning get lots of them and do multiple quest turnins in one go. Previously they had fixed this and you couldn't do it, meaning stacks of data were useless.
---
Ah ok
---
Yeah; I love Fallout as a franchise, but I'm thinking that's more headache than I want to deal with.  Ah well, other fish in the sea, etc, etc.
---
I play solo 99% of the time so yeah, I'd wear it.
---
The quest maker seems to think that it arrived and dropped the cargo, but one never arrived, I used up 16 of mine over 3 servers, they never arrived!
---
I think it looks bad when you put windows together like that. Irks the ever loving b‚Äôjeezus out of me
---
Great! I'm not sure I'll be on again tonight, but if so it'll probably be at 10 to do Grahm's cookout. I'll definitely be on tomorrow afternoon and/or night. My username is SkullcrackaX. Tell me  yours so I don't give it to the first schmuck who comes along.
---
Apparently they were testing it in the pts to improve it. Fingers crossed!
---
I really like the train car, but man, nothing snaps to it at all. Conduits ignore the ceiling, stairs wont snap to the base, a ton of stuff on the roof counts as not even being there.
---
Err... i think 'maiden' is usually another word used for '1st time'. Like 'maiden touring bike ride to....'.
---
To be fair, I dont blame them. When I'm grinding them out, going back and forth to the Whitesprings just to turn in 3 or 4 pieces for separate chances is tiring
---
Your fusion core question was handled thoroughly, though one other place to look is fusion generators like the one across the street from the Purveyor. 
---
Google "Raider power armor location" for a list of possible places, though your best bet is probably the Crosshair in the far north area of the Forest. 
---
If you're on xbox I can craft you a starter set if you like, no charge.
---
But it's the closest to military gear that I've seen.
---
yessss
---
And they somehow do more damage than bears and rad scorpions, wtf....
---
I had bad luck.  The first time I tried, the event ended before any critters appeared.  The second time I blasted about 5 of them in a group and they flew off into space.  Never found one to check for critter chunks.. LOL
---
Edit:  I gave up after that because people started giving me the stink eye.
---
Valley Galleria I think is pretty straightforward. Burning Mine isn‚Äôt too bad. Hands down, fuck the Burrows though.
---
im serverhopping right now trying to find stuff to buy to drop my almost maxed caps on before someone buys more stuff off my vendor.
---
... so far no luck getting rid of caps... got a 3K gun for 99caps, then a 6K gun for only 300 caps, then 40 stimpacks at 1cap ea to flip tomorrow...  it sucks to spend less than you make LOL....   oh wait ? what?
---
The cap struggle is real.
---
... oh there's that 10,000 cap VATS Unknown I always didn't want.
---
I love this. You hit both... The chip away at whoever has more health... Until they are both nearly dead...
---
starkiller00732 is my gt ill definitely be on in the afternoon if that works
---
For BOdS daily. also, wasnt aware it was a glitch, but read somewhere (haven't played in long time so can't remember if it was on a wiki or forum post) that turning in more than one can increase chances.  Although when I did it, it takes all of them but completes once.
---
I agree with this to a certain point
---
I don't mind not having to spend money, especially on a game that's still, by and large, just as broken as it was on release.
---
Casual level 131 stealth suit sniper build.  Game is absurdly hard now.  Anywhere from 5-12 shots to kill my spawns. Hemorrhage ammo doing ops and events. I don‚Äôt like playing in PA and I have never liked heavy guns.  I liked my build. Now it‚Äôs all but worthless
---
Creation engine is a thing of wonder I tell you what
---
Yup, it's still here, and I encountered a new variety at Encrypted that when I got back into the server, I was still the conduit... Even though the event ended, I could sit in my camp and die to the pylon damage!
---
Seems likely.
---
So, I've turned off my 1st subscription.  I'll come back again in 6 or 8 months, to see if the Microsoft acquisition has improved things.  Fancier hamster wheels in the servers, at the very least, right?
---
You only need to get lucky twice mate. You'll get it eventually, even if you don't, others will; and will drive the price down and you can just buy it with caps.
---
You can surely scrip them for scrips
---
Well, that about sums it up. 3% huh, damn.
---
F76: "Would you like to find a new world?"
---
Me: "Yes, please! I've been trying to find one for 10 minutes!"
---
F76: "**Too bad.**"
---
*"...when Bloodied was the best build."* \- It still is.
---
Duped AB Rounds from the displaycase bug
---
not sure about pre wasteland nuke launching difficulty. but with the update 22, be sure that you will use more ammos than pre update 22.
---
We did get the weapon balance. Enemies become op and weapons get weaker.
---
Is that not what balance is?
---
I honestly wish they'd bring back the BB gun. Or the Varmint Rifle if they need something with a bit more kick.
---
Suffering from success
---
It's the Red Rocket Robot poster all over again.
---
Both posters are completely identical, except the one you pay for in the Atom Store costs less materials to craft versus the one you can get for free from plans in the game.
---
I mean, how long does the season lasts? Because getting 30 levels before a month is a lot to me. People were complaining it is difficult
---
*a
---
Do you have shotgun perks?
---
A Christmas Story reference.
---
Pipe is life
---
How does it work with shotguns? does one pellet start the effect and get applied to each extra pellet?
---
They know we can see the flashlights on the Combat, Marine, and Ranger helmets right? Because I sure can.
---
Edit: Plz Beth.
---
I've had legendary mole rats deserve I don't deserve any loot even though I was the only one shooting it!
---
&gt;He was very adamant that Shelters would be coming with the next big content update. 
---
Also all the Brotherhood DLC were meant to come by this year...
---
It comes when it comes. I hope they do a decent job like they did with Patch 22.
---
&gt;Also so long as there is a way to fast travel straight into it, I'd imagine how annoying it would be to go to your camp and then inside
---
Only for you &amp; maybe team mates. I'd want newcomers to see the outside of the camp before entering.
---
True but I was referring to when it was highly overpowered.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. You‚Äôll get it don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm trying to get the war glaive plan on one of my four characters that can actually use it.
---
This I got the lights damn near everyday lol on my commando
---
I suck dick tbh
---
Metaphorical cash dude. Not literal cash.
---
gamma guns look great on paper, but last time I tried one they performed really poorly compared to rifles.
---
maybe now with the nerf + armor penetration they can measure up, it's certainly an interesting pistol.
---
I remember it being particularly bad against super mutants.
---
Lol! Right?! I got one today.
---
I want the Civilian Issue Power armor used by the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel!
---
I just don't understand it. 
---
They have had the contemporary bundle in the featured 80% of the time since it was originally added. 
---
There's like 5 mothman bundles that seems to rotate in and out each week. 
---
There are a lot of cosmetics in the game, I dont know why they don't just add everything permanently as it comes in during the season then do an Atom Shop wipe at the end of the season and repeat.
---
Most of the stuff is in featured so often that it spends less time out of the shop than in it, just make it permanent and rotate in new/old things.
---
That and something NEEDS to be done about bundles that have items you already own. 
---
I should not be paying full price for a bundle when I own half the items within it.
---
It's actually the mission reward awards ammo, for whatever weapon you had equipped when the boss died.  I was trying to get rid of all my plasma cores by using them on the boss, but then the game "awarded" me with about 8 more because I had my plasma gatling out.
---
Just to be clear, are you getting rare drops at all?
---
Try reinstalling the game again, see if that fix it
---
You on xbox? I can get ya through it. It's basically just a bunch of left turns
---
PIPE IS LIFE.
---
I just "an" for emphasies. As one do sometimes
---
They need to fix the current weapons first, if they just did that it would be enough short term.
---
I have two shotgunner and a master. Unequiped bc I want more carryweight
---
Which perk is it?
---
Its tru I got fusion core u can get fusion core
---
This is exactly what I'll be using the mind blown emote from the current season rewards for.
---
Yeah this is a real pisser, especially when you run multiple characters and only one is 2 handed melee.
---
You answered your own question. It looks cool. THAT is the point.
---
Plasma/fusion cores don't drop from normal enemies, but they will be awarded to you if you have equipped a gatling plasma when thee boss dies.
---
Is the gauss minigun the only one worth getting?
---
If it hangs up, you have to bash.  Magic ones work better than the one you have.
---
Both of mine are magic, so I don't know how the standard ones do.  I've got a B3325 and a V50LD90.  Both of them work great in VATS.
---
I just want some heckin Enclave stuff =(
---
Theu dont drop the same amount ok
---
Try as I might, I can't get this plan to drop on a character that really needs it.
---
You mean in game right?
---
The Brotherhood are coming within the same update. They've already said it will be in Late November/Early December time.
---
Brotherhood will be the big content drop and Shelters will be the big new feature for that season. He also mentioned new weapons, armors, random events etc.
---
He said it will all come this year.
---
For being an ‚Äú extraterrestrial‚Äù weapon it sure is weak
---
YES PLEASE
---
Every Stash Box skin should have a matching Scrap Box skin.
---
No.
---
That is not how it works. Say it out loud.
---
I really like the scrapbox, but to be honest beyond that I havn't really noticed anything that's made me say "man I'm glad I've 1st!"
---
HOWEVER, I do buy atoms monthly anyway, and the value for dollar to atom is really good, so. Yea it's worth it!  
---
Edit\* you know what? Actually I use the tent a LOT. Especially when my GF is screaming for help against an assaultron on the other side of the map and I don't wanna spend 50 caps to come back to where I was. Also in nuke areas it's amazing when I get overencumbered and wanna stash my masses and stuff.
---
Correct.  The more complex and terrain-specific it is, the less likely you will be to place it back.  
---
The blueprints also don‚Äôt have enough space to hold an entire camp.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that a GL worked at Bethesda
---
Need a '5-6 min launch nuke timing' inspirational life goal poster in my camp. üòÜ
---
What just happened, was this post removed by mods?
---
I once scrapped my fully modded gauss rifle, Charged Language, without knowing. It was a sad day....
---
From using a .50 cal, about 6-12 bullets per enemy.
---
No what do you mean?
---
it's not perfect, but going into the atom shop and exiting before joining world again usually puts me in a new world.
---
i dunno if it's the atom shop, or the time i wait while doing it, but it's pretty reliable.
---
So you‚Äôre getting Elder rank but not getting rewards? How many times have you ran daily ops?
---
Mine works just fine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Probably gonna be quite a while with that sadly. They seem to not care about factions from 76. Responders, free states, etc all get very little.
---
You can build a camp using one floor piece and a set of stairs. Your ‚Äòsecond‚Äô floor is now your main. 
---
If you want to build specifically to the land around you it‚Äôs going to be very difficult to move it as is
---
Post body says removed, I think mods just deleted your post.
---
Love my quad explosive poon. Miss the ole fireworks fast reload trick but she is my daily driver.
---
Agreed on all points, but the damage was never this high for the gamma before the patch. Everything pretty much took around a 40% damage hit.  The piper was ~60% along w/melee and heavy.
---
Really anything. Right now I merge my scrap box into a dresser.
---
This is why some people will be really upset during the instances when Bethesda turns certain areas into new event spaces and such. It will happen, cant be avoided. 
---
For now, pick a spot away from Monogah Mine or Prime Fissure Site and you will be OK.
---
Its still showing as normal for me.
---
I would say the same of any build thats unable to optimize the AB.
---
Magic shotguns are still working well. Just got a bloodied combat shotty, absolutely love it.
---
Also been rocking a bloodied explosive 10mm for a while for tagging events (so other players can hit stuff too). If it gets too tough, it can still take stuff out with 4-5 shots, that's with no pistol perks either, just bloodied build.
---
But the new events will have you bubbling over with ammo. I have about 1200 at any given time but have to start carrying less.
---
You‚Äôre pretty new so you‚Äôll probably move your camp around a lot for a while. If you build a camp around a unique landscape and have to move it I think whatever can be moved and fits in at the new place can be moved instantly. The parts that can‚Äôt be fitted in the new area will be kept in storage in the pieces used to make them. One of my favorite things about the game is building awesome camps around cool locations though so I say it‚Äôs worth doing around level 40 or even 30.
---
It didn't jam, just not doing as much damage I would think would happen. This is my first roll of them. Only one I have that might be of use is a bloodied bc I don't see any other way to use them and I don't know what those letters and numbers mean
---
There is also camo for the ss armor but yeah they could use more skins.
---
how?  rug trick?
---
 All of your endurance is wasting points, as is gladiator.  Move those spares to perception luck and agility.
---
Yup, I opened 50 Large gifts and I got like 30+.
---
Nah I‚Äôm good it just takes me a long while to find the points when I join mid way and have to guide myself. Today is the mine place anyway I think.
---
I am not a huge builder. I build based on utility, but maybe i am missing something in the fun of building. I love building games, but the result of building in this game does not make me excited. Building for the sake of building can be fun, but i think most need more than that. Give it a purpose,  make it give special bonuses or benefits or make it like creating an entire vault ala Fallout Shelter, something to manage for those who dont want to kill and loot maybe. Something beyond just a cool house with a bigger budget.
---
Check vendors at player camps. Now that season 2 has started people who have less common plans are logging in again and I've actually found 3 new plans since the patch. A T45 part, heavy robot torso and an ultracite PA mod. Not stuff you even normally think about, but it had been weeks since I'd found anything new.
---
They glitch underground. Ive had the same issue for ages. Dont be upset for not getting those nocternal rolling pins.
---
You so lucky! This and the solar panel are what I want the most. All I've gotten are the war glaive, gutter, and liquid courage.
---
Will do! Mind if I ask what you recommend I use instead?
---
Daily Ops and testing *all* the guns to see how the changes have impacted them xd
---
And a skin for the lever action rifle that turns it into a genuine, Red Ryder carbine action two-hundred shot range model air rifle. With a compass in the stock,and this thing that tells time.
---
Blue printing doesn‚Äôt work beyond small,basic structures and pretty much no decorations or doors. Unless you buy one of the premades.
---
It‚Äôs probably best to build at each location if you want to decorate. It‚Äôs all stored, so you can piece it together from the same parts.
---
I personally have been experimenting with the steel bungalow. My workshop moves every time. The other one, the shelves cause issues. But this might give you a idea. https://youtu.be/4pa_YYuJbcA
---
Oh, and if you do try making a mobile build? 2x3 foundation seems as large as I could reasonably get transportable.
---
Take 1 point in the three levels of weapons perks before upping them to 2 and 3 stars.  
---
The first point in each is 10%, the 2nd and 3rd are only 5%
---
Post is 100% gone. Might want to message the mods to see about getting it put back up.
---
Did one yesterday near the bog after not having played much for a while, it did seem a bit glitchy. Took me a while to get there so I had a solid marker instead of a circle by the time I arrived. The cargo-bot seemed to be stuck hovering about 10 feet over some low rubble, so I shot the bot for giggles. It dropped the crate and zoomed off while I decided to see if I could kill it (not enough DPS before it was out of range).
---
You could dl the text chat mod and hope they got it too
---
I try to give my bases a lived in look, I like the idea of role-playing my character a little bit so idk, maybe thats just me
---
I will
---
I love to ponder about what they‚Äôd do, however I couldn‚Äôt imagine a conversation between MODUS and a Brotherhood officer ending with any kind of positive conclusion. 
---
If they did that, then yes it‚Äôd have to be a sect of the branch siding with MODUS. 
---
(I imagine MODUS‚Äôs reaction to an official telling him about BOS values, even for a supercomputer, Would be an instant aneurysm shortly before ordering his robotics to slaughter every BOS member he knew of).
---
Can confirm
---
Sucky bug
---
How can you even tell it‚Äôs the same world ? You can‚Äôt ?
---
The level scaled enemies really are out of whack and need fixing.
---
My son likes the gauss shotty, me I can't stand it. For me personally the only gauss worth a damn in my eyes in the mini and that thing is an ammo eater. Though with rank 4 ammo factory(plus ammo smith) and ultracite rounds it doesn't feel to terrible.   
---
I am also a terrible person to ask since I only play my legacies now post patch 22 and haven't even touched anything else aside from melee for meat week critter killing.
---
When is pipe?
---
This is solid, thank you.
---
I have literally no legendary gear whatsoever save a furious 50 cal, and I've had absolutely no issue either. I got 3 friends to start playing as well since the patch, cause that's when GF and I came back, and they've had 0 issue playing either. And that's with us refusing to baby them. We gave them a 10mm pistol and 200 ammo and told em good luck, call us if you REALLY need it xD   
---
They have not.
---
I fucking hope they dont keep using amazon servers and secondly fuck lvl 100 molerats half the time my 2 shot nade launcher doesnt kill those trash mobs and thats what its for, killing trash mobs
---
What do you play on? If you are on ps4 I can give you a tour and show you exactly where to go
---
What am I to swap them for. I don't have a ptiblemnwith their weight so can remove the weight reduction one for them.
---
They are going to give everyone some bright purple safety orange trimmed with neon green accent scrap box and you all gonna be pissed when that happens.
---
The thing about the 100 mole rats isn't that they're super strong for me. THEY ARE JUST SO FREAKING HARD TO HIT. I waste more ammo trying to kill a molerat than I do emptying into a lvl 100 prime fog crawler cause it's hopping around like it's on meth.
---
Lol I've accidentally scrapped both of my paddle balls on accident.
---
That's true. I had REALLY expected more responder stuff with wastelanders. I was kinda bummed to find out there was none.
---
Give it to all players first.
---
Life is pipe
---
Ghouls, scorched, supas and robots are all immune to rads
---
I used to main pipe weapons before the nerf for most of the map, the big nerf has nipped that in the bud and I had to scrip it!
---
What about an Assaultron leg lamp?
---
As a FO1st member,  I find this entitled post to be the most Karen post for the month of September.
---
Thank you Karen, for posting this I needed a good laugh.
---
Bloodied isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù prefix.  It just does a lot of damage üòè
---
And more Mr. Pebbles items!!
---
Junkbox and tent
---
There is a camp emote and I combine it with the heart emote. It‚Äôs a group up emote that holds a US Flag.
---
I would also like a "back in 5" emote for teams
---
just how the necks posed far as I can tell
---
Sell your Buffouts and Medx plox. Need them for crafting.
---
I know its not grammatically correct but sometimes you can use that for emphesis. Please just stop
---
I think again, i have to say, we shouldn't need a bloodied pistol....to fucking viable use a pistol. We should not need a bloodied legendary to use that weapon in any content. We shouldn't need bloodied to use anything viably in end game content. 
---
Base damage should be buffed for everything, bloodied needs to be nerfed damage wise, and every other damage legendary needs to be nerfed damage wise as a fair ratio. If Bloodied is 10% stronger than Berserker, or whatever, then after nerfs tha'ts how it still is. Just using berserker as an example. 
---
BLOODIED AND JUNKIE AND TWO SHOT EXPLOSIVE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE OF A WEAPON'S PERFORMANCE. EVERYTHING IS FUCKING VIABLE BLOODIED AND JUNKIE (maybe this one not EVERYTHING). 
---
WE SHOULDN'T NEED BLOODIED OR JUNKIE OR TSE IN ORDER TO VIABLY USE A WEAPON JUST MESSING AROUND IN THE OPEN WORLD.
---
Thank you for your input, we already knew bloodied pistols were viable. Some of us invested in pistols early on, and now we're fucked because RNg won't give us a bloodied, or we don't want to run bloodied or don't have the right perks for it post level 50. We were under the assumption we could play whatever we wanted so long as we had the damage perk for that weapon on, we'd be strong enough to fuck around.
---
They are not on the daily ops rewards. Or in the game yet.
---
Yes, and not just mole rats. For some reason I lose a lot of bodies at the Monongah power plant workshop, including dogs and radrats. The bodies are just gone at random, and it's not because I didn't look hard enough... can even find blood splatters but the bodies either despawn or fall through the world, is my guess.
---
Well Bethesda was probably in the middle of being bought so their wouldn‚Äôt be any reason to work on new stuff just to give zenimax more money
---
I used to have my C.A.M.P. next to one of the blood tick huts. Damn ticks would annoy me every time I went to my home. And I was a low level back then.
---
No, you can‚Äôt. That makes no sense and no one does that. I‚Äôll stop but only because you are obviously ok with believing this is normal. Good luck.
---
Another unofficial use, not yet mentioned, is being able to transfer stuff to your mules. I have 3 mules holding around 250 various legendaries and I did it all using the private world. 
---
Here's how:
---
Get your toons all in the same spot. I use Morgantown Station. Drop weapons/loot/etc in the suitcase out front. Leave the world, switch toons, join private world. It will load you into the same world your other toon just left. Go to the suitcase and grab your weapon/loot/etc. 
---
The server persists for only a few minutes when you leave it, so don't dilly dally around. I've done this at least 100 times, and only had 1 failure. It's not foolproof, but I'd say at least 95+% safe.
---
I thought tvise were kinda worthless. Are they valuable?
---
Thank you for your list. Another place to add is the weight room at Vault-Tec University as well. Might be a nice addition on your way through.
---
I ran pistols from June to pre-patch and I have to disagree with a lot of people that call it "viable." 185 levels to be clear.
---
You can't call garbage viable. Viable means to operate successfully, it doesn't do anything special anymore.
---
Pre-patch, they were cheap cost VATS killing machines. Grim Reaper, Gun Fu, Adrenaline, a couple Gunslinger cards, Concentrated Fire on weakspot... I could clear rooms without ever running out of AP. A lot of people complained before patch, but me, I made it work. I even performed greater than other builds in high enemy scenarios. Radiation Rumble was a joke, I could do it with a friend protecting the other side. I even managed to outdamage anyone with an instigating sneak critical black powder pistol doing 3000 damage.
---
Now, I came back, did some adjustments, applied Tank Killer, it's bad. Added some more Gunslinger cards to make up for the damage, it's still bad because now I'm wasting too many perk points.
---
I went and did a Commando + Demolitionist build...ok, this is too damn good. AOE damage and savage single target damage rolled up in one? I even added Quick Hands 3-Star so when my rifles with 25% fire rate empties out quickly, I can randomly get an extra mag, sometimes proccing 2 times in a row, ending up firing like a machine gun for super damage.
---
For 3 separate Commando perk cards, one star each, I'm outperforming my Gunslinger build, with about 40-50% extra gun damage versus 30%.
---
And because of higher perception, I'll sometimes switch in bigger explosive radius making Daily Ops easy, clearing out enemies by 3s as they spawn.
---
The problem is that Gunslinger uses way too many perk cards to do as much damage. You hinder yourself. Your flexibility goes down the drain. Going Commando, I was able to add explosives into the mix and adding in a higher tier Adrenaline so my explosives benefit even more. And the funny thing is that I still have room to grow. I'm thinking Ground Pounder, increasing my reload speed by 30% means 30% more damage overall. I don't think pistols have a reload card equivalent. What, with pistols you can sprint faster? Garbage.
---
Pistols need a rework. It can benefit by adding cards like, faster weapon switching, bullet penetration going through bodies or ricocheting from one body to random another. So many ideas man, if a dev DMs me, I'll give them to them for free. Don't be afraid to take notes from Fallout: New Vegas. Here's a free idea: Pistols: Do 20% more headshot damage. 10%, 15%, and 20%.
---
Whats the wing do?
---
I shop for people dumping chems for at least 50% less than vendorbot sell pricing so I can flip it all. Otherwise all I use is diluted radaway/stims (bloodied build). Everything else gets sold. I never buy chems for myself since I get so many every day as it is.
---
Make sure to sell them maybe a little less than vendorbot sell price so it's not worth someone flipping them and someone can actually use them.
---
They are too easy to be honest. 3 man team of randoms doing some in less than 6 minutes. The sewers can get confusing but still easy to get done in top tier time. A good 50 cal and PA and your set.
---
Reddit  MomentüëΩ
---
Correct. But I have one of the magic prefixes on top to make it even more OP ;)
---
I know right? What the fuck does being a FO1st member have to do with rewards from daily ops?
---
The last one wouldn't be good, since people could trade the quest only items and plans, and people could get these items without actually grinding.
---
Sadly if they didn't place the turret ontop of something, it's gone until you move camp!
---
I first discovered it because I saw a wire hovering to empty air where my turret was supposed to be.
---
Ok, that makes sense. 
---
I think I phrased my question incorrectly but this makes sense now.
---
Its just like that damn Father Winter helmet. Why yes, Bethesda, I would love a very rare, lvl 15, ten-pound paperweight I cannot trade, sell, or give to a low level. *rolls eyes*
---
I do it in my excavator PA and die maybe 1/10 runs with a random team.
---
How is pipe?
---
How long did this take you?? Temped to do it myself.
---
Just start a public ops team and then jump in. Only need 2-3 players to get it done.
---
That update broke my medic, though she needed work anyways but becoming a wet tissue versus everything in the game made me wonder if I'd have to delete her or find a way to make 20+ levels just to fix her build at a point where she's dying to everything anyways. Then I realized I had a medic's combat shotgun in the stash and the day is saved. She's still squishy but I can at least progress and figure out what I'm doing with her build without throwing up my hands completely. It'd help if I wasn't chronically shy and actually played with other people beyond my one convert friend who doesn't play much. (I'd tried to build the medic as a super min-maxed VATS-heavy medic pistol thing after much debate about medic build options in general... and yeah, now she has the durability of a wet tissue anywhere on the map and garbage DPS to boot. Legendary endurance perk is helping fix some squishiness while I debate on what else to do to make her more durable because min-maxing out tankiness failed so hard.)
---
Needs more helmets with creepy critter body parts to light things up. Hello helmet with an irradiated ghoul head on top that glows.
---
Everybody knows this.  Notice the ballistic and energy weapon numbers compared to the lever and fixer.  That's the point.  Rads are just a a bit of icing.
---
Exactly, because you think because Bloodied is viable, there's nothing wrong. Not everyone wants to run that build, and in some cases a lot of people find that build braindead simple and boring.
---
I keep getting lost in the sewers and mines, even if I just did the ops and should know the way!
---
I wish the vault was the raid more often cause I never get lost there lol
---
Damn you want some fries with that salt? I have heard people use AN as an emphesis on particular words. Might be a british thing i dont know. Just stop flipping out over it and stop correcting peoples spelling....
---
Good, we got some people who understand.
---
Hell no. I want the ammo factory
---
No Starched Genes or Class Freak? You aren't going to run any mutations?
---
Well on a 95% VATS shot, if it connects, that means BOTH bullets hit, does it not?
---
Good point!  I also need to update this to include the Professor‚Äôs House to ensure the loot list gets pushed over.
---
I did a few each day for 2 weeks. Not rushing. Then when the final objective is to do the test I saved it for last. In the end all I had to do to finish was do 8 tests.
---
Yeah these are the stepping stones. Try to find player selling em 400 caps or less. If you see em low, buy one of each in case you wanna try out some new ones or go in a diff direction buildwise. Unyielding whatever stats and armor peices, hop around player vendors and do the 1 star armor script at rusty pick, and then start grinding for better gear once you can drop your health and bump your stats. Don't even need to be super low health, even 35-40% will lend itself to having a boost to all specials except endurance. If you can, consider sticking with stealth so you can drop your health even lower and invest in max sneak with escape artist, cuz then you can get even more of an xp boost farming typical places like west tek, charleston building, burrows, ft defiance, and now places like the prison that scale to your level. Go in, pick up everything, scrap and/or sell guns. Higher charisma means better prices. This is essentially how you begin building up, getting more perks from leveling faster. Etc...
---
Adrenaline, master rifleman, grim reapers sprint. I see you don't use mutations, or that would want 5 pts in luck
---
I think so yes
---
Hello small animal intestiens on my sack hood with radioactive goo in them to make them a christmas light
---
10 caps?? I sell mine for 5
---
While I would love more Power Armor, adding more while staying in the lore is tough I'd reckon. People would be like "Why...wasn't this in any other fallout games if this is the past?" They'd need to come up with a reason why it was never found again, especially by the brotherhood or enclave.  
---
And some of the armors you listed were experimental armors from the enclave that don't exist yet.
---
What makes the bloody one magic? I thought it was only limb or bash damage that would do it, guess there's more to it that I realized.
---
I finally moved my camp when I realized I was spending all my time near white springs and watoga. 
---
My old camp had a steel extractor. Put the new one on a site with lead since I kept running out while crafting ammo. 
---
Wow...had no idea how much steel I must have been blindly burning through because I‚Äôm about to move again. üòÜ
---
I play on PS4, sorry for the delay I‚Äôm playing Dark Souls with an old buddy of mine
---
Lol one time, I saw a 5 cap bounty in the middle of the map, red icon, couldn‚Äôt miss it. Figured someone picked a lock. Then after about 45 minutes of playing, I noticed the bounty was still there, same person, still at 5 caps right in the middle of the map. 
---
I was like, this guy must be afk, I‚Äôll do everyone and them a favor and kill them to get that off their back and not take their loot. So I fast travel to their base which they were afk at, and I find myself staring at the base of Seneca Rocks Mountain range. I look up, and this guy has a fortress built at the very top of Seneca Rocks. Tried fast traveling to the CAMP again, spawn in the exact same spot. So I put on my SS jetpack, and start working my way up. 
---
When I finally get near the top of the rocks, I start to work my way in over the fortress walls, and I see the guy....an almost naked man in his underwear only. He sees me, and I was expecting a mounted defense against my assault, I start to shoot while jumping and trying to get in. He then starts sprinting full speed, but not at me, to the side of his CAMP away from me and then LEAPS over the edge. I was like no way! This guy just wasted my time by committing suicide. But as I follow him to the ledge trying to shoot him, I noticed he didn‚Äôt get as far as he wanted and landed on a ledge about 50‚Äô down instead of the 100s of feet drop he wanted. I then finish him off,  and start laughing so hard. 
---
I was like how long was this guy sitting there waiting for someone to come and get him and then for him to commit sudoku at the last second and steal the would be murderers glory lol. 
---
Still makes me laugh thinking about it.
---
I'd suggest looking up magic shotgun legendary effects and rolling one. You'll need to use vats for the most damage. It honestly takes getting used to and I thought I made a huge mistake switching up my build. I love the thing now, though. I can take out most enemies in one or two shots.
---
I have the new lock pick perk and I‚Äôm always opening peoples doors by mistake
---
I always run fireproof in endurance, you could also put 3 points into ricochet in luck and get adrenaline into you agility its very strong also if you want to use a melee secondary ... firstly you would use rank 1 of all gladiator ,expert gladiator and master = 30% instead of 20% and since the nerf melee is a bit useless unless you're fully speced into it, I would put those 3 points that you have in gladiator into traveling pharmacy unless you have the bagpack mod . 
---
Ontop of all this if you really want to feel like a killer I would recommend commando over rifleman because its just so much stronger. But you obviously don't need to it depends how you want to play. 
---
If you use another of chems use chemfiend or if you want those quality of life perks do it . 
---
Some highly recommended QOL perks 
---
White Knight for repairing armour,  ballistic fibers not too easy to come by if you're using combat armour 
---
All carry weight %reduction perks come into play for me at some point (I pick it all up I need help) 
---
Team medic is good for team daily ops 
---
Inspirational if your in a team along with strange in numbers 
---
Hard bargain 
---
Good with salt if you like to cary another of food and use food buffs a lot,
---
Revenant is a fun one if you use a few pieces of life saving armour / you get knocked down but you get up again , because nothing ever gonna keep you down  with 50% extra damage. (Not sure how good this is anymore ) I like it . Zombie man.
---
Another of these perks are just to be put on when using ie, repairing or selling or carrying stuff  bte
---
And thats all I can think of right now 4am . I'll reply to any questions but it won't be fast more than likely. 
---
Good lucky .

Here's what i would do you're a bloodied so blocker is a must have either ditch travel pharmacy or bear arms manage your stash weight and you don't need multiple heavy guns so i advise ditching bear arms, for endurance good doggy is useless ditch it and max fireproof, in charisma you don't need lone wanderer, get empath and herd mentality and if you don't use energy weapon take the grounded mutation and don't forget to join public teams and when there's multiple players in it share strange in numbers. The field surgeon is a life saver when you take bleed damage, fire damage any form of lingering damage taking a stimpack with fast healing cancel them and help against groups of gutsys too. In intelligence no need for the stipack 15 % perk. In agility adrenaline is worthless post patch +20 damage (not percent literally 20) when you're on a kill feed don't always happen and isn't that worth it anymore take dodgy in a PA with emergency protocol and nerd rage ap regen shouldn't be that much of a big deal. In luck bloody mess is useless post patch too replace it with serendipity (most useful perk on bloodied build) in legendary perks you want poison resist damage or you'll get one shot by stingwing and mirelurks, you also want power reboot or something else because energy enemies are rare and 20 % is nothing knowing fo76 rng. Read all perks and look at their level they're not all max level also tenderizer isn't useful but i left it because i don't know what else to put so you can add 2 points of special wherever you want, maybe lifegiver in endurance do as you wish.
---
I'm the opposite, i think the ballistic slow firing pistols should be doing MORE per shot damage to be honest now that i've thought about it, then a rifle. One shot form a pistol at close range should be doing the damage of 2-3 rifle rounds. That's fair because the ballistic pistols that aren't 10mm have less than half the magazine size of a rifle. The rifle will do more damage per magazine, the pistol will do more damage per shot. 
---
The problem is that's barely the case right now.
---
I agree with having pistols do more per weakspot. Pistols should be doing more damage per weakspot than rifles per weakspot, i say twice the damage. So if you're aiming for weakspots, pistols are better, the trade off being you fire slower, have shorter range, and more recoil.
---
I think electronic equipment such as power connectors and wires also stop the ability to blueprint and re-place
---
The game became significantly harder for my 2nd character. I have a melee build character who was level 22 before the update, and I immediately became almost useless. I used to kill every regular enemy (bugs, wolves, cultists, scorched, etc.) in less than 4 hits, but now I'm lucky if I can kill anything in under 10

This character is now level 35 with 11 points in Strength (via the Strength Legendary Perk), I have 4 points in Slugger and 3 in Gladiator. Not only do I still take about 10 hits to kill most enemies, but I take a ridiculous amount of damage (with rank 3 Barbarian and 9 Endurance) and have to repair my armor and weapons every few hours. At this point I feel like I'm hitting enemies with a pool noodle while wearing a lifejacket as armor. This is probably worse for actual new players who don't fully understand the game yet or have access to Legendary Perks
---
Also event enemies still don't scale to my level most of the time, and often times seem to scale up, especially during Primal Cuts where I consistently get destroyed by level 60 mole rats
---
Honestly, the survival aspect is a non-factor later, at least that's how it seems to me. I've never worried about a damn thing in a long time. Got water purifiers churning out 30 water every few minutes, and with super duper I make so much food I sell 90% of it for caps to vendors.  
---
There are benches and cooking stuff everywhere.
---
Before I offer feedback, is this a completely new play through or changing an existing character into this build?
---
Was in that mine once before ops and once after. Fine inside now.  I supersize with them though. I spent most my life not knowing road names but being able to get anywhere ive been before.
---
I'm DYING for the tents options, can we have the options for the other ones? New fo1st players like me want some variety (I've had it for 3 months now) ! I WANT THE CHRISTMAS TENT PLEASE!!
---
Oh happy noises!!! I play on ps4 too!! No worries i watching nogla live right now
---
What platform are you on i have 2 and the mask ill sell them to you [pc]
---
This man has a point.
---
And if you start feeling the tedium of doing the same thing over and over, throw a few OPS in here and there. 
---
You could even run a Casual team if you were to juggle those.
---
Yeah you're right  i meant more like secret service armors and untradable plans like war glaives but i don't have anything t
---
Patch 22 changed the HW dynamic quite a bit.
---
I‚Äôll go over ballistics, then energy, then explosive types.
---
Of special note is energy weapons got a lot more competitive damage-wise with 22. Unsure of the reason, but they‚Äôre quite viable in terms of damage.
---
50cal is a fantastic all-around weapon. Lack of spin-up, large ammo capacity, good damage, and easy to craft ammo are key. Downsides are very long reload times, and poor accuracy (has a large amount of spread, but little vertical recoil.)
---
LMG has good damage, solid initial accuracy, with a high rate of fire giving it just about the highest burst DPS you can get, but it‚Äôs small ammo capacity, vicious recoil, and expensive ammo make it a less common weapon.
---
Minigun has a very large ammo capacity, the most common ammo type for heavy weapons (5mm drops in large stacks) and just as easy to craft as 50cal, laserlike accuracy/virtually nonexistent recoil (with mods/Stabilized) and very high RoF make it a useful long-range bullet hose. Downsides are primarily the rapid ammo consumption, and low damage per bullet, plus the spin-up/down mechanics. Still, it‚Äôs arguably better DPS at range than a 50cal due to the lack of bullet spread- you aren‚Äôt doing damage if you aren‚Äôt hitting your target! 
---
Gatling Gun is a very efficient daily driver, especially when just questing. High damage per shot, great accuracy, minimal recoil/spread, and decent mod ability (receiver mod increases fire rate by 25%! Unfortunately conflicts with Prime receivers) make it great at taking down trash mobs efficiently without using excessive amounts of ammo. Downsides primarily are the slow rate of fire, which is very slow. Great weapon to get FFR on, fire rate feels much better with speedy receiver+FFR. 
---
Harpoon gun- very high single shot damage (or shotgun effect, depending on mod). Just about the only heavy weapon with a real scope. Chance to find ammo in corpses. Downsides? Single shot with very slow reload rate, short range (especially with shotgun mod!), and rounds have bullet drop, not hitscan like most weapons. Mostly used for the luls, although a legacy quad-explosive variant is a brutal 4shot shotgun. 
---
Gatling laser- high rate of fire, fantastic accuracy/minimal recoil, low damage per shot. Basically an Energy Minigun. Unique advantage are the massive core charge amounts with Power User perk and crafted fusion cores (upwards of 1300 rounds). Unique downsides are the core mechanics, which means reloading before you empty a core just puts that partial, but full weight, core back in your inventory; ash piles that laser weapons leave, which have a number of negatives associated with them, a persistent bug with running a core dry with sustained fire may not actually empty it, leaving you with a bunch of 1-10% charge cores in your inventory. 
---
Ultracite Gatling laser- see Gatling laser, except it does more damage and shoots green beams, and is extremely rare. Not to be confused with Prime relievers/Ultracite ammo types.
---
Gatling Plasma- sort of an energy 50cal- similar fire rate, similar damage, similar spread, similar ammo capacity. Worse vertical recoil, though. Negatives are a core mechanic and spin-up/down mechanic, and plasma goo piles with plasma weapons, that have similar issues as laser ash piles. Unique feature is the beam spreader, which creates sort of a shotgun effect. Explosive variants are one of the most heavily duped heavy weapons. 
---
Flamer- amazing short-range damage. Another candidate for highest DPS, but at short to very short ranges. Does high damage, solid fire rate, minimal spread/recoil, but default range cuts off entirely at about 30-40 feet. Several mods for increased damage or ammo capacity. Downsides are VERY poor durability, and bugs with weapon range when using anything other than the default nozzle (there‚Äôs irritating workarounds; but they may be worth dealing with because nozzles greatly increase damage while theoretically dropping range even more).
---
Fantastic Daily Ops weapons, if I do say so. 
---
Cryolater- okay, can‚Äôt give much personal experience on this one. My impression is a funny support weapon that slows/freezes enemies. Most commonly seen used on the Queen or other boss fights. Very poor damage, ammo capacity, rare/expensive ammo, short range. Very niche weapon. 
---
Gauss Minigun- not sure if I should put this in ballistics or energy; like all Gauss weapons, it‚Äôs sort of an in-between. Good damage, high rate of fire, innate explosive effect, high ammo capacity make this a very solid candidate for best boss-fight weapon. Downsides are the fact that it‚Äôs a Bullion weapon, so it‚Äôs rare and untradeable. Spin-up/down mechanics are unfortunate. Ammo is rare, expensive, and very heavy. Range gets shortened by barrel mods, so you‚Äôre trading off DPS at range for DPS up close. Weirdly the Prime variant does the same damage as the Electric variant (while still maintaining the bonus vs Scorched). All other HW do more damage when Primed. 
---
Plasma Caster- very high single-target damage, quite accurate, decent fire rate, make this a semi-auto Heavy Sniper of sorts, minus an actual scope. Downsides are small ammo capacity, rare/expensive Plasma cartridge ammo. Also, another Bullion weapon, and same issues with Plasma Goo Piles. Vaguely similar in practice to a Gatling Gun, but much less common ammo and much smaller ammo capacity, plus it‚Äôs not automatic. 
---
Of special note for explosive launchers- currently every explosive effect in the game damages the launcher 1x per target hit, which is incredibly counterproductive for weapons that are meant for crowds- you nail 10 guys with that fatman? Congrats, your weapon just took 10x durability loss! Also, boss enemies (most noticeably the Queen) tend to be very resistant or immune to all explosive damage. All explosive launchers are very niche; I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them unless you fully spec into explosives too, and even then, save them for crowds and special occasions. I say this as a HW/Explosive main since launch. 
---
Auto grenade launcher- Best overall explosive HW. Usable ammo capacity, solid damage, long-ish range, useable durability, ammo is common and light relative to the other explosive HW. Downsides are the ballistic arc; takes some practice to hit your targets. Smallest explosion radiuses of the 3. 
---
Missile launcher- crap baseline, niche when upgraded. Get an auto tracking scope and a quad barrel and don‚Äôt mod the muzzle. Good explosion radius and damage, auto tracking is pretty cool but has a few things to learn. Heavy ammo, very poor durability, especially vs crowds. 
---
Fat-man- ahh, a hallmark of the series. Unfortunately, just not up to snuff in ‚Äò76 unless heavily built for.
---
Single shot, very heavy and rare ammo means you‚Äôd better make each shot count. Ballistic arc, but seemingly unaffected by drag- aim high, and you can send those footballs far! Highest damage and explosion radius of the group, worst durability. Damage really isn‚Äôt worth it *generally speaking*. MIRV mod creates a split of 4 micro nukes, but drastically reduces range as they auto-split and drop straight down at about 80feet from the launcher. A fully built Bloodied Explosive build with a 2-shot fat-man lists for about 7k damage in the pip-boy, however. 
---
And then there‚Äôs the poor beaten stepchild that I almost left off the list.
---
Broadsider- just don‚Äôt. Not even once.
---
been really lame. I won't be mad if they pop out a ton of quality content and the atom shops sucked cause they moved resources into more development, though. But that's not likely D:
---
same boat... whats the alternative these days? (2nd best 2H melee?)
---
But what is the fun of magic weapons? And why would I use vats, especipy when being swarmed. And again, what do those alphanumeric sequences mean?
---
There's a power armor mod you can put on that makes you generate AP when you take damage. Works well together.
---
Better yet... Spiral Staircases!
---
Not sure, thinking of going to bed myself...
---
I never was in the mine until the ops but I run the ops several times a day just so I can get a good feel. Plus I get really good drops and I got an AA explosive the other day
---
This clown has only one proper place to be built: at the foot of your bed.
---
I run regular events in between the prime ones. Sprinkle in a couple dailies too.
---
Me too, I've also had it for 3 and got nothing
---
Yes and no. I'll openly admit that the scrap box and tent have completely spoiled me. But the lack of persistent worlds or being able to change the rules in your worlds and still no word on mods means I'm gonna let it lapse next month.
---
Maybe when mods actually happen I'll rethink it.
---
I dislike the scaling myself as just like when Blizz did it to WoW, it destroys the feeling of progression. It also gives you very limited ways to fix a badly-built character. That said, regarding daily ops specifically, I've only tried one day's op on two chars (been gone for a few months) and figured out pretty fast my sneaky sniper was not going to be able to do it at all because the mobs got high perception buffed, so they'd see me immediately even with 4 pieces of chameleon on. But then I ran my tanky unarmed chick through and made it even with the mobs being "freezing." The end boss was rough but doable and I got every reward tier short of the group-recommended one. So yeah, it definitely comes down to build for sure (assuming those buffs are an RNG roll every day), gear would also make a diff. This was the Uplink daily for what it's worth, in the Burrows versus super mutants.
---
Vibes, most people i meet are legitimate so nice and good . I go away from encounters most of the time feeling really good . Especially when they talk . The community is awesome.
---
And thanks for the support.
---
Hey you got one, you can get another! 
---
Just know your not as dumb as me. I scrapped my backpack and wondered why I was overweight for probably 3 hours last week.
---
I'd be fine with pistols overall causing a lot more stagger than normal. I get that pistols are NOT meant to be room clearing weapons unless you SPECIFICALLY spec into VATS, that's fine, that's perfectly fine, i agree with that completely. If you spec into GunFu, your weapon should clear rooms with quick acquisition. 
---
Otherwise, if I'm choosing to aim down sights and fire, I'm most likely fighting a 1v1 or 1v2, AT MOST a 1v3 with slow enemies scenario. I want the stopping power to stagger shit. Make it a pistol mod for christ sakes. 
---
Otherwise, i just want pistols to have higher base damage. I want ALL WEAPONS to have higher base damage overall, and then nerf the legendary effects, and MAYBE some damage perks. Legendary effects should be the icing on the cake, while the weapon is the cake, not the other way around.
---
I tried to layout a build for mutations and just felt like I was losing point in the non automatic rifle area and am still uncertain about ammo and if I should have Melee as secondary
---
Nothing just random drop
---
You have your magic weapon, I have my 300 round Bloodied Black Powder rifle that fires like a minigun! Tis a good day!
---
Fresh start but ive played all previous fallout titles even #1 lol. I appreciate any advice you have.
---
The events team gives you an xp bonus vs a special boost. Even just a 3 man team is a great benefit.
---
Apparently was a one time thing, my husband has the raider one but he's been playing since beta (i think that's the name for the pre launch whatever) i started playing 3.5 months ago lol. So yeah... Fluff you new members i guess üòÖ
---
Ohhh, like the West Virginia BoS turn into something else and its a shameful record in the BoS so they never talk about it.
---
That works...really well actually. The BoS are all about controlling technology and history. Very fanatical about it even, so censoring their own history makes total sense.
---
I will look into those perk cards, also yeah I chose not to go with mutations cause I'm not really sure any would suit a solo none automatic rifle/vats build
---
You're welcome (: I've been enjoying the level progress since One-Wasteland came out.
---
The mob waves in most the events are fantastic for XP
---
Exactly
---
Not consistently. I‚Äôve got a conduit and connector in my workshop that moves.
---
I want it but I feel like it's going to serve no purpose because of legendary perks.
---
They'll realise a 1dmg per shot bb gun, just so the red rider version can be a 400 atom skin.
---
Nice!
---
What's your beef for nerfing bloodied anyway?  I've played nearly every build and find it's the most enjoyable.  I've got a couple of Junkie's that are fun in a different way, but still fun.  Berserker's was great until the sneak bugs crept up and SPECIAL checks became a factor.  PA/Heavy was just too easy, but if that's allows others like, all good.
---
Regarding bloodied, the game mechanics encourages, even pushes players to adopt low health with adrenaline reaction, unyielding armor and perks like serendipity.  Don't hate the players, hate the devs.
---
The fact even fallout 1st items rotate in and out is a scam. When you buy first, they should give you ALL the rewards listed through the service.  Then they'd be limited to only offering new content too.  This time gaited FOMO garbage takes the cake
---
Keep finding tunnels and don‚Äôt die, eventually you‚Äôll find them. At least that‚Äôs what I do
---
A few years later during the events of Fallout 1 they clearly made a superior version.
---
Here's a video that explains things. Basically, some legendary effects are magic and end up doing way more damage than they should. This applies to shotguns and some heavy weapons. 
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Best possible advice imho. I have only had 1st for 3 months for as long as I‚Äôve played. Fill your scrap box and cancel until you need to fill it again.
---
One leg lamp as reward #97 for season 3 of Fallout 76: Grinding Edition.
---
which is funny because people who argue for capitalism say it fosters competition and innovation. the necessity of anti-trust laws and existence of massive conglomerates prove otherwise
---
You could get rid of you could go 1 lvl of Tormentor remove Gladiator and move those 3 perk points over and get both Class Freak and Starched Genes.  Then you would have the huge damage buff of Adrenal Reaction and Eagle Eyes plus DR mutations like Grounded and Scaly Skin. Not to mention things like Speed Demon, Marsupial, Carnivore/Herbivore or even Bird Bones.
---
Everytime someone complains about not having a chat I just thank bethesda for all toxicity I didn't need. I hate online chat so much because people always trash talk everyone else minding their own business.
---
Definitely, ultimately though you'd have to weigh what there's more of in some cases IE: If an event gives 1k XP, 4x would be 4k
---
But is there also 4k worth of enemies to XP farm.  
---
I've found Earle for example to be better just to use the INT bonus and use my Plasma Flamer on the ridiculous amount of Wendigos that'll come out.
---
I do imagine though that Meat week is best farmed as an event group since there's not all that much mobs.
---
I‚Äôm only like level 230something, but boy oh boy, one wasteland is the shizzle!!
---
Ol‚Äô Reliable is kind of a staple when you can name any weapons! Well done I like them.
---
I always gobble up cheap stuff to flip.
---
But this one time this guy had some kind of "Noobs only" type of sign on his vendor, and it was 1000's of chems and other items for 0-caps... and I had walked away from it out of pure morals LOL
---
 
---
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign  
---
Blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind  
---
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?
---
I feel like heavy Energy Weapons are in a perfect spot honesty. The Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, and the Flamer are three weapons I use constantly and I feel the strongest I have ever been, and this is coming from someone who used to use Two Shot Explosive weapons when they were broken.
---
Are you PS4? That (especially the taking forever in pre-prep) sounds like my group. üòÇ
---
Here's hoping Microsoft actually does something about the hackers in NW since Bethesda doesn't give a damn.
---
Ooohh i didn't realize that, would you recommend I dive in more mutations my first playthrough?
---
It may be how I'm placing them in that case, I usually have all of my electronics in corners (Lights, connectors, generators etc)
---
I thought the exact same thing when doing Daily Ops for the first time.
---
B3325= bloodied, 33 vats hit chance, 25% less vats cost   V50ld90= vampires, 50% limb damage, 90% reduced weight. The magic parts of these shotguns is the 33% vats hit chance and the 50% limb damage
---
It's been pushed to a future update
---
I know what they are, weapons that are super OP when wearing an armor piece with a effect and using vats. But why do I need to use them? And for my mental fortitude Please tell me what the letter and number combinations mean.
---
Ironically, it‚Äôs not very reliable lol. It‚Äôs more so when enemies are either so weak that there is no point in wasting bullets or something as low as a roach.
---
Responders and free states both have quite a bit of atomic shop stuff
---
33 vats hit chance is magic,
---
Try to kill SBQ or Earl solo. Or close daily ops solo for max reward level. 
---
My commando or heavy can do it. Pistol can't
---
I typically mute the talkers.
---
Got one once where the guy thought he knew me from vietnam or something (way before my time) and was chatting it up the entire time with the other two guys on the team. I didn't have a mic hooked up, so I finally just muted them.
---
Then there's the mouth breathers, coughers, kill yellers, etc. Please people mute your mics!
---
Then there's the awful people that just swear incessantly the entire time.
---
I got into a group once that was talking about something cool, so I had to hook up my headset so I could chat with them. My introverted self rarely does this though, but it was a really fun experience on that occasion.
---
Thanks!
---
I normally spam the Heart Emote infront of the persons Camp, I feel like it gets the point across. But yeah it would be better if we had a Nice Camp Emote.
---
It took us years to get a Sorry Emote so I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Ha ha that‚Äôs even better! You have to have something in your inventory to just finish them off
---
I would
---
Can you please tell me what those letters/numbers mean?
---
I would make cannibal rank 1 since you don't get enough benefit from rank 3 to be worth the extra two perk points. I'd personally suggest choosing either meelee or rifle for your build. If you go rifle drop gladiator and pick up another rifle damage perk. If you're only using it to fill your strength stat just choose blocker which will reduce any meelee damage you might take. Lead belly is nice early game but later on after your do a scorched earth event and get the radiation shower you'll never worry about having too much radiation/not enough radaway. 
---
Do you plan on using VATS a lot? If you are then you should max action boy and consider luck perks like grim reapers sprint or four leaf clover.
---
They can definitely suit your build. Too much for me to explain here, and this post does a far better job anyway: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h9o817/guide_to_mutations_for_newbies_and_intermediates/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Sorry that I was asking you what the letters and numbers menat, thought you were the original commenter.
---
Earl doesn‚Äôt happen that much and hopping groups looses the bonus till you get bonded again. If i change the group goal I generally lose players. I just get randoms so if playing with friends they could be more receptive of the change. Im a solo player so i can only use that as my experience. Hate mic breathers so i dont use one lol. Edit: i even solo the meat week event and the bonus at the end is a pleasant gift as are the average 100+xp per enemy. Its pretty easy with my 50 cal instigating explosive +1 perception.
---
I like the idea of this... maybe lock out using V.A.T.S. or put a severe - AP hit on the confederate uniform to get the old style "feel" to it? Could make PvP a bit more interesting seeing people use black powder weapons and iron sights.
---
I always see killing people with Bounties as a favour to them. Most Bounties I kill give me a Heart Emote after.
---
Wait. They're getting rid of hunger and thirst? O\_o
---
I wasn't asking you to explain just want the original commenter to explain.
---
Thank you, ill read through it, I appreciate your help.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. You got about 1.5-2 months worth of challenges and they usually kick in double dailies sometimes and then close to the end of the season, they give ya a chance to catch up with a double daily &amp; weekly challenges before season ends. I skipped two weeks in the last season and was still able to make it. To miss out is to miss a month of challenges pretty much.
---
I have a spare plan for sale. What are your offers :)
---
The website makes it look like it wasn't a planned outage so anyone's guess.
---
No one can know. Best to go to the official forums and check there.
---
I haven't found it any more difficult, but if I am rushing it (phasing through doors etc) I don't see any change. Of course I am in the 200's
---
√è don't think it can be done without unyielding. 
---
And for those who are reading the post, you need *critical savvy* perk with the 34 LCK to get critical hit with every other shot. OP forgot to mention that.
---
Yeah what ?
---
Pipe is life...

I mean half the time people skip updating their drivers on gpu after building a new comp. My friend had a similar issue with a different game and his drivers were out of date since he had just left it with the factory installed driver.
---
got it. thanks.
---
Maybe. It‚Äôs stupidly finicky. I gave up making everything mobile and just rebuild. But it‚Äôs definitely stopped me from moving lately. Wish it‚Äôd get fixed one day.
---
I‚Äôve bought backpack mod plans in a vendor?
---
oh that doesn't look good then. thanks.

I don't think that's how fallout works? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I named my 10mm Pistol "Wasteland Classic".
---
They are getting rid of the penalties of not eating or drinking. You still get the positive effects if you do.
---
There is plenty. A private server, infinite junk storage, a free portable fast travel storage for when you‚Äôre overweight, free cosmetics and exclusive atom shop discounts. There‚Äôs no need for them to add more stuff
---
That's a fair point, I have a couple of folk I've met in game overtime that will do certain things with me in which case we jump group goals depending on the objective but alas I feel you on the randoms thing it can certainly be a pain in the butt at times
---
Just keep server hopping. It takes a while, but I keep finding all kinds of good stuff for great prices that I pass on since I already have most of what I need. Armor isn't as bad... the only hard items are very very specific weapons. 
---
I've managed to find quite a few "trade only" weapons that I've kept for myself over time. Key word.... over time.
---
As for tagging enemies for XP, get yourself an exploding 10mm or something similarly fast shooting and reloading. This is my goto for any large event. just shoot near everything that moves and you get 99% of it all before the annoying OP weapon people kill it all. Works well on Line in the Sand and most other mass mob events.
---
Pipe is life.
---
Alright, thank is for the tip. I legit didnt know that,
---
If you don't plan on using energy weapons then you can't go wrong with the grounded mutation. It drastically reduces energy damage but increases energy resistance.
---
Sorry, I name my weapons and armor really vulgar and sexual names which I cannot type here without getting mass downvoted or reported...
---
Not really related but does anyone else constantly try to use their pip-boy to get to the map?
---
I‚Äôve only ever seen 2 legendaries from a run before.
---
Yes there is, because it is an hour of work. All these items that I don't get just because I was late to the game is total BS. They're getting my hard earned money and I should get more for that.
---
Dont sell 1, dont sell 2, and dont sell 3 for my instigating western revolver, executioner. 44, and AA plasma pistol flamer respectively
---
I will definitely rank down my canibal to 1 and put the extra point into rifle,  as for vats I had read that stealth card benefits plus vats benefits work really well with non auto rifle builds,So i thought I'd use those together.
---
About as bad as someone wanting an urban scout mask  that I had duplicates of and was going to give to someone for free on here. I went to find it... even looked through my alts... it's GONE, and I know i didn't sell it. Musta accidentally scrapped it not recognizing the name of it ... sigh.
---
I honestly feel like the sole reason this update exists it to promote Fallout 1st to some degree.
---
Harder mobs require more ammo. Ammo costs junk to make.
---
Harder mobs break weapons and armor faster. They cost junk to repair.
---
Using more junk means you collect more junk. Junk has weight.
---
Players buy FO1st for the Junk Box to store more junk.

33 vats is also a magic suffix.

You said ‚Äúfor my mental fortitude explain what the numbers and letters mean‚Äù, but it seems like it‚Äôs mental ineptitude from the way your acting like an ass.

I can carry way more without PA also. Especially with several Uny pieces with weapons weight reduction and backpacks. But I tell you what, that first OP with the resilient bots was a breeze with the right set up. And it synergizes well with heavy guns as well. I only use my PA for a few events and nuke zone farming.

My suggestion, Shoulder Lamps like this FO4 mod so that people can wear the armor and helmets/headgear they like while still having a great flashlight.

Depending what video card you have... goto either AMD or Nvidia's website and grab the latest drivers. If it's an onboard intel driver... good luck.
---
Weird issues like that can often be video driver related.
---
Also, since you're using xbox games pass, it wouldn't hurt to make sure you have all the latest windows updates.
---
My biggest want right now are some of the halloween plans from last year. I have a trade for a few pumpkins and racks, but I still need more pumpkins. Bloodied unarmed weapons would be cool too.
---
You must be right. Apologies.
---
Edit: thanks for the award, not sure why I deserve it! üòÖ

Nope, I will straight up pay 30 caos to go claim a 5 cap bounty. Adds some excitement to the wasteland
---
Goodbye meat week hello netflix i guess
---
I always loot that place clean whenever I do that event. Most people never bother, so there's always plenty around.
---
also note for the OP... throw Can Do! perk on while you're out exploring and click on EVERYTHING, you get a ridiculous amount of food.
---
O yea for sure it can be great and it can be annoying,  push to talk should be the only way to have it. People that have a microphone on and have speakers playing the game sound need to check themselves for sure. Other then them I haven't had much "bad experiences "  
---
most people I find amusing even if I don't speak with them, I met a group of Americans all low levels at an event , I didn't speak but they were all so happy to see a guy eating the feral ghouls and literally yippied "looks like we got a cannibal like us" and all started eating. 
---
So I guess it brings joy when other people are having a good time 
---
And for you I understand when people are having a bad time brings bad vibes , like when people swear at the end of events that get failed ect.
---
I'll consider the fireproof perk card instead , as I play i do notice fire damage is my weakness atm. As for the gladiator perk cards being one point each I never knew that, thats a great tip ill consider, but now my question is if I switch to auto rifle will I be struggling to maintain ammo for the type of weapons I use? Thats the only reason I have points in melee since I don't know if ammo will be scarce. All together ill be re reading these tips and appreciate your help!
---
Wait, does that means Survival Shortcut Legendary Perk Card is gonna be made redundant?

I put on ‚Äúcan do‚Äù under luck. And I go inside whitespring and loot all the garbage cans. Leave with about 15-20 food items. Server hop
---
It's thought to have been related to the healing factor mutation... running that by any chance?
---
I never had the issue until I went to a full bloodied build. So, something I'm using in that caused it, mutation or perk, dunno.
---
Typically you get 2 for elder but 1 run did only give me 1.  I will call shenanigans for 8 and 5, I just do not believe you.
---
Ive got 3 of those POS cluttering my inventory AND I CANT EVEN DISPLAY THEM
---
Dude it‚Äôs waaaay more stable than ever in my experience. I haven‚Äôt had a server crash in months, and client crashes are fairly rare- and I‚Äôm running 2 clients simultaneously on PC! In fact I should say they‚Äôre quite rare- I had a spat of frequent crashes a month or so ago, but we had a heatwave at the time, I think some part of my PC was overheating during that.
---
I wish they would keep it in. It adds a layer of rpg goodness.
---
The event in the ash heap has 200+ xp enemies and can get a bit frantic solo but well worth the xp. The cave cricket swarms are a challenge. If i had regular team members i would definitely be changing the team objectives as the prime events have a little cool down. I dont even care about the crappy legendary drops. Leave most behind. Another nice part is going back to the same spot on the same server all the loot is laying out in the open. Got more acid gold royal jelly ect than i know what to do with. You can easily sort the other stuff as it visible too. Like hunting for treasure lol.
---
Hey man, at least you‚Äôre owning it.
---
You realize that the people working on the actual code and the people who make art, visual assets, and models are 2 different teams, right? The artists aren't working on balance or code tweaks, so implementing something like this wouldn't really take away from that effort.
---
The community is always here to help, fire proof is also explosion resistance too BTW.  
---
It depends ammo usage varies and the the way you use it. At the beginning yea ammo can be scarce for sure but  Events like daily ops can be a great way to farm the exact ammo you need . 
---
I can't honestly tell you I know too much about the ammo situation because my main man is unarmed and I use him to feed ammo into my secondary just from what he picks up and that works for me. so other people would be more qualified than me to to answer that .
---
You gotta be quick to do this, but if you're team leader, you can change the team's focus. Create a Casual team and play the event, maxing your xp. When the final dangerous creature approaches, switch the team.to Events. You don't lose your bonds when you do this. Then after the event, switch it back to Casual. Your teammates probably won't even notice.
---
That would really be a nice touch. I mean we've already picked factions here, let those wastelanders do something more helpful than panning for gold (broke ass doesn't even have gold to loot) or saying some b.s. about my apartment building of a camp having 'a lot of potential'. Next I'ma hear one of them tell me he took an arrow in the knee!

Back when I used a 2-hand Supersledge build I had a Zealots 40% Power atk damage +1 STR Supersledge.
---
On the queen, the thing was slaughtering my Bloodied super in damage, Granted my bloodied was a Faster swing Speed and 90% weight reduciton, but still.
---
Zealots is definitely good for the SBQ fight
---
**Legendary Luck Perk.** The ***+5*** won‚Äôt allow you to equip more perk cards, but it does have all the secondary benefits. It‚Äôs like having another set of that +Luck Armor equipped.
---
I wish you'd gone into a conversation about Vault 94 raid. Really wish I could here them go into it
---
Well fed and well hydrated will still exsist.
---
Abso-fucking-lutly yes
---
I kind of agree. I do wish they would allow me to plant anything in game at my camp though. Farming stuff for cranberry relish gets old.
---
It does make for some fun photos ops if they get clipped and can't hurt you. :)
---
but yeah, normal occurrence. Hopefully the last patch will have fixed some of this. The patch notes specifically said they fixed some of the below ground spawn issues for the prime events... I'm hoping it fixes others, especially the breach and clear event (there's always something stuck underground!)
---
The Bungalow, Chinese Bunker, Log Cabin and Train Car all move very reliably.  If I had to put them in order of preference, it would be Train Car, Bunker, Bungalow and Log Cabin.  I've got Train Car, Bungalow and Bunker blueprints that are decked out with generators/turrets/workbenches/beds/musical instruments/stash boxes that I often place at workshops.  My buddy says the Red Rocket prefab is good, but I've yet to outfit one and test it.  The seedy shed is too small to be very useful.
---
I agree. I wouldn't mind seeing the bar go down slower, but removing it completely? O\_o
---
Herd mentality serum plus joining a team with a mutated person and the charisma perk that increases mutated bonuses when with other mutants equates to +3 to all stats. 
---
It could possibly be seen as counterintuitive since you couldn't use any more perk cards with it but you could stack a maxed Legendary Luck perk card to have +5 luck.
---
Legendary Luck should grant the additional +5.
---
How is that going to work if food and drink are removed? What will you do with all the canned food, alcohol, etc?

Well if Bill lets the African children starve for just one day, it could be enough funding to correct all the bugs in this game.

At this point, most people have farmed all the rewards out of Earle, so they are just shooting wendigos until the timer runs out since earle doesn't provide anything of value anymore.
---
Yes
---
I recommend trying another sub that allows bartering. This one does not.
---
I almost guarantee you there‚Äôs a delay, heavily dependent on your ping to the server. But I‚Äôve barely been playing my rifleman since the patch, so I haven‚Äôt tested it. Look up angry turtle on YouTube, he thoroughly tests all kinds of mechanics, I‚Äôll bet he‚Äôs got a video on it by now (it was on the PTS for a long time)
---
Pipe is love, Pipe is life.
---
mind if I get one of those helmets from ya?
---
From what I understand they're just keeping these and adding more
---
Nope, I only have adrenal reaction and marsupial right now.
---
If you love it I‚Äôm just curious what level are you? Most people sub level 60-70 have said it‚Äôs been a bad update and made the game harder when it was supposed to even things out. It‚Äôs basically made standard non legendary weapons not even viable without having to spend massive amounts of time farming for materials for ammo or to repair broken weapons and armor. 
---
If I had to take a guess, and I apologize if I‚Äôm wrong, are you a high level bloodied build that now takes more shots to kill something to make it more like I guess a good build in fallout 4?
---
Ah, yes, the Arktos skin
---
Mines down too. Definitely not scheduled they are having server problems.
---
Pretty good for a robot.
---
I dropped cannibal on my unarmed chick (the only one who used it regularly) because hitting space to jump would randomly target a body instead and she'd get locked into nomming it when I'm expecting to jump and/or might even be fleeing something. I also would forget I even had it, as out-of-combat healing hasn't been much of an issue with any of my builds (look into making Healing Salve and also the Healing Factor mutation makes all the diff once you're at that point in levels, plus food/drink heals).
---
Beyond that, I'm not really sure what this build is, which probably says something, but I'm also a mixed bag when it comes to being able to theorycraft properly. This looks like a bloodied build with unclear focus on weapons and playstyle. If you intend to sneak and not get seen much, endurance becomes a non-issue. If you want to use VATS heavily, you're gonna need way more crit-related stuff. And when I say this looks like a bloodied build, a lot of your cards are intended for low-hp play so you're going to need the gear to back that up (usually unyielding legendary armor, power armor, or possibly full sentinel but that's someone else's forte).
---
I'm not sure how helpful this is but my non-vats sniper looks like this at level 100 and she's doing well: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f166fb&amp;d=ar2an2ao0ah0pp2pr2lt2e00pd2pk2li2ic4au2s72pl2s01c72a80l71lu2ii0cu0cm0&amp;w=c52cr0c02cv2i30ia0i50iq2if2pa0p80p90&amp;m=51c9fe&amp;nw=p1p8p6pci5a7a5&amp;n=Morrigan%27s%20sneaky%20sniper
---
And for contrast, this is my 121 sneaky bloodied 1h-melee dude who is OP in... four piece of unyielding now? I forget: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c3946e8&amp;d=aj2ao0e00sg2l71lu2la2ir2eu0c72a72a12ss2se2sb2pe2eh2ed3a00a42i42&amp;w=i12ce0am2a80ar2lt2s50si0sj0ej4ck0cu0&amp;m=1c29fe8h&amp;n=Riddick%27s%201HM%20bloodied ...and this build has swap-out options to take it back to sneaky non-bloodied 1h-melee which honestly I enjoy playing more, it just doesn't have as good DPS
---
Edit: Also, definite recommendation here to not go into this game thinking "I'll never use mutations or that'll be something I do waaay late". Prep for it now, Marsupial + Bird Bones alone is a total game changer. All my chars run some sort of mutations always, and I was one of those peeps who originally thought "oooh that's like... something I'll probably never be able to do anyways." Mutations can be bought for 250-500 caps each at a lot of player vendors. ;)

Can you create a public group and she join? Still doesn‚Äôt help with the private server issue but gets you closer

They ain't removing food and drink, they are only talking about removing the debuff of food and drink, parched/dehydrated and famished/starving.
---
Any recommendations kind sir
---
Legendary perk Luck +5 there is your 34.   
---
Also run luck bobbles for +2 so there is 36.   
---
Also Live and Love #5 Talk Yourself Sober +2 luck while under the influence of alcohol for 38  
---
Also  **Charred scorchbeast liver** is +3 luck and if you are a carnivore it is +6 with strange in numbers.
---
Good Internet etiquette. BOOM! here's my free award.

In terms of raw carry weight, it's pretty close, but you get a special modifier on a backpack equivalent to traveling pharmacy and thru hiker I believe.  However the tankiness from pa is absolutely unattainable without using power armor.

I don't have any trouble moving my prefab workshops that are pre-wired with lights and rocket turrets, unless I try to blueprint them with anything wired to something that is sitting on the ground.  I just make sure to remove any wiring that isn't part of the main structure before blueprinting, I/E if you have a generator on the ground outside, don't try to blueprint the main structure without removing the connecting wire.  Stairs/steps are a huge problem too, don't attach them to anything that you might want to move.  Make sure the main foundation is the only thing that touches the ground.

Good advice right there. I always start a fresh group anyway. Had a couple under 50 guys tag along for about 2 hours. Told them to just tag the ads and i took them out. They were very appreciative as was i for that extra xp at the end. Dont really care about ammo anymore as i make 370 or so at a time with the legendary perk and ammosmith. The materials are cheap at whitesprings well lead and steel the gunpowder i can craft easy enough with the bookstore and the tons of acid that drops. Im gonna try the sneaky switch tomorrow and see if it helps.
---
Yes and messes up less than the bed
---
Um, one thing to keep in mind is that at least for now, junkie‚Äôs shotguns are magic weapons in VATS. 2 torso shots to down a super mutant in daily ops as a full-health junky build (and I‚Äôm finding similar damage between a JE pump and a J combat shotgun, because the combat shotgun has an armor piercing mag- but it shoots and reloads faster, with less condition loss!)
---
You left out the 1650 monthly atoms, which is more than you can buy for the $13 directly. I agree that I would like to get more exclusive stuff. But I ain't angry with what I get.
---
Thanks üòé

There's a lot to load at whitesprings, you're not over heating?
---
Sending DM
---
I‚Äôm with you. This is no longer fun. Everything is a bullet sponge. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Bethesda could have capped enemy levels in certain areas to make gameplay more natural for higher level players.  And as someone else said here, some areas should not be visited by lower level players anyway. Another good idea with poor execution Bethesda.
---
Bloody meat hook interest you?
---
&gt;she didn't even get to mutate before she died.
---
in that case it probably wasn't your gatling plasma that did the trick.
---
For reference i was at 122 when meat week started im 140 now.
---
Nope, only really ever happens here and then the game boots back up just fine (and I load back in conveniently in whitesprings)
---
Blocked. ***AND*** reported.

Don‚Äôt you love being downvoted for truth?

I can solo him on my B-HW-PA build; I can probably solo him on my 3 other characters but I haven‚Äôt been in a position to try (nor do I particularly *want* to).
---
They can join, they just place their own ball and its the same animation you have.
---
Didn't even think of that. Nice
---
Formula P too, charred sb livers. I used to use it to juice.
---
glad I'm not the only one
---
I think energy weapons weren't hit as hard as ballistic or something, the prime receiver is multiplicative apparently. I just got myself a bffr gatling plasma with primed receiver and it does crazy well. Check out angry turtles video on the anti armor one.
---
Besides that someone could have used a magic heavy if the queen melted that fast, the ffr plasma isn't magic level damage.
---
Community effort, my good human!
---
Oh wow didn't know. Magic weapons I'm guessing are dealing OP damage? I got an AA Pump right now and I already feel like it's better than my last build. Good to know, thanks for the info
---
No problem

---
Take one for the team. Because it applies a debuff to attackers, it‚Äôs considered a hostile action and can finish the ‚ÄúPVP handshake‚Äù if they attack you first. Supposedly this is only true if you also have pacifist off.
---
And if you‚Äôre in a team, because PVP is engaged on a team level, any one of your teammates having it and getting attacked can enable PvP on your entire team.
---
What platform are you on

The cosmetic request log is endless. I would like the bunny costume.

I'm unrelated request would also ask for store front displays

I clear it with a Ultracite plasma caster right now. Average 2 to 5 shots and get anywhere from 4 to 20 rounds back. Probably stick that with that for now.
---
Dude that happened to me today. Though I was the one doing the emote...
---
Yeah I tried to point out how broken the damage and hit detection is in the video, its almost unplayable. I feel like I'm cheating or being cheated. There's very few in-betweens. Hopefully big daddy Microsoft will throw more cash at the development and hire more people to work on the game.

So you can get +6 from food, then try to get + Luck armour to make up the rest
---
so then there is no reason to drink water?
---
Yah. There‚Äôs two types- certain legendary effects combined with high ROF weapons (~200) give a exponential damage increase for sustained hits on the same target, and other legendary effects combined with Shotguns in VATS give massive bonus damage.
---
Look up magic guns angry turtle on YouTube. Angry turtle is a fantastic YouTuber who goes in-depth thoroughly testing and explaining all kinds of FO76 mechanics.

I actually think the fo76 community is generally pretty good, for a gaming community anyway.  Lots of people are willing to help out.  This thread is not a typical sample of the community, ime
---
I was so sure we were gonna get it with armor ace. Or a scrubbed toilet thats clean enough to eat off lol.
---
I don‚Äôt think so, I have been getting hit with it quite often, other than annoyance I haven‚Äôt noticed anything bad
---
Right, they will be setting it up so that eating and drinking will not be mandatory. However, you can still choose to do it to get the positive buffs of being hydrated or well fed.
---
it's not a daily you can do it as often as you want
---
Yes!!!
---
Its just how live games go.they throw stuff in for limited time and pull it in a few weeks or months it's not just a f76 thing.
---
Same here
---
I think you meant sympathize but what you typed was way funnier
---
Common bug.  View your scoreboard from the main menu before you load into a game.   That should prevent the repeated score increase notification.
---
With the 33% isn‚Äôt that a magic gun? You might be getting... better than intended performance out of it.
---
No, with this method https://youtu.be/vJwmP20hsMQ
---
Its just an animation. When two people play it, its not even a proper game being played. Just two separate canned animations happening at the same time. There are even two balls at play when its two people lol
---
Lone wanderer is a complete waste now there‚Äôs public teams. You act as your own team mate so there‚Äôs zero reason to not be on a public team even if just my yourself.
---
Candy bowls for a fallout Halloween? YES SIGN ME UP
---
They probably will, like the super bright camo paint jobs they love so much.
---
I doubt anyone has the Armor Ace power armor yet. Unless they spent A LOT of atoms.
---
It‚Äôs still plenty active. I‚Äôve got a massive friends list from being a trader, and I still rarely end up in the same server as any of them.
---
I have seen this, I was so concentrated on the floater, I did not see the behemoth until it was too late...
---
Yeah it's the most valuable reward from the event.
---
New player surprised it was even a thing. This and allies being unable to command are just why.
---
Some butt hurt people here thinking the 5 items they got is a lot or something. Sure it beats the nothing enclave got, but the next dlc is said to be Enclave hinted so we will probably get them then. As for free states an responders its a complete toss up as they have no new content planned.
---
I fail to see why a Glaive would be so slow considering they were invented to be used while riding horses
---
"if I should have Melee as secondary" - Just use a melee weapon without relevant perks when needed, especially early-game if you have ammo issues. Machetes work in a pinch.
---
Just saying if I worked there and browsed reddit I would so do this paint job, knowing that people can't bitch since you know they finally got a skin for it, and if they do bitch they just look entitled and whiny.   
---
Thus it is then safe again for a few months to not listen to the community.

---
Take the helmet off the pa and see what happens.
---
Heavily situational, dude, and in fact he gave a perfect example in his post- a nocturnal minigun will be a HUGE drain on you most of the time; a perfect case where a different gun might make a huge difference.
---
Maybe, it works with combat and metal armor without a helmet
---
Not really, the benefits are minimal and the roi is super low. It's just tedious.
---
Seriously. For interior spaces, NOTHING.
---
Ok.

Ooooohhh fuuuuddddgggeeee

That is pretty cool

Currently, Cloe out West is glitched for me my main character. I can't turn in "Play Date" at all.  
---
My other character has no problem doing it. I imagine her heavy French accent going all mental.
---
Holy shit it was alot of atoms specifically all 12 k I had saved since launch.   But I haven't tried the skin yet still grinding the main story on my pa alt
---
Cha ching 18 levels in a couple days.
---
I'd love for pistols to get a further buff, but they are doing much better now with tank killer. I don't know about other pistols but I feel the western revolver is very viable. 
---
I have a two-shot severe western revolver (used to have a two-shot explosive one, but it actually did less damage for headshots for some reason) and a bloodied severe western revolver. The two-shot is actually doing quite well when I'm at full health, especially now with tank killer. Most super mutants (except for 100s) die to two headshots or a single critical shot. Scorched will take two headshots at first, but once adrenaline kicks in they go down with one headshot, except for those 100 level ones, but that is what the critical is for.       
---
Tank killer is a game-changer too. I actually shot a level 60 scorchbeast out of the sky the other day with 5 to 6 head shots, half of them being criticals. I was very impressed. 
---
I also find the western revolver is far more accurate than my hunter's rifle. I can usually get headshots from a considerable distance very reliably.
---
Nope. They're making it so stealth can't participate in events and ops, still haven't added gear for stealth ( I see why now ) or rifle users since patch 8. 
---
Shit patch.
---
I haven‚Äôt made any videos, but my Bloodied HW/explosives in PA build was a brutal meat grinder before P22; it‚Äôs now an unstoppable hellfire tank thanks to fire and poison resistance, take one for the team, power reboot, plus more endurance and luck perks for more health and defenses (ricochet! Mysterious Savior! Oh my!).

I plan on getting out of my PA so this is a big help.
---
ouch
---
Took the power armor helmet off and lose both the resistances
---
Same, but different. Why does Sam sometimes have more than 1 of the same plan available? I bought 2 of the same plan on accident. Totally useless.
---
Sounds good, I'll take a look! Thank you appreciate it
---
I wonder why secret service armor would require it
---
Lol I bought a damn quad 2525 plasma rifle thinking it was a tesla for 10k caps..used it and stored it it's kinda fun to use the flame mod..only bought it because the high price
---
So it seems to me that you need a helmet.
---
Bro SAME! I‚Äôve only gotten a rare reward twice this whole time and I‚Äôve been doing them daily and making Elder too.
---
*sigh*

Bloody gauss shotgun - Bloody Mary |

Instigating Shotgun with suppressor - Sneak shot |

Anti-amor shotgun - Antiarm or shotgun
---
It‚Äôs interesting that it works with 5 pieces of combat armor but need 6 on secret service
---
Just unlocked the foosball table am I near 27 yet?havent counted
---
Yeah its discouraging to play when your weapons are so unbalanced. Especially discourages PVP combat, its totally dead. Everything else is fine. I guess I have all the best gear I could find and need something more to aim for. Its personally just my opinion. I feel like I spent too much time in the game tbh.
---
Run heavys with no heavy perks and tell me it‚Äôs viable. It‚Äôs not situational. Your build is your damage. And if u look he says he runs a commando weapon but when he switches to heavy, mini gun in this case it‚Äôs crap. One wanders how May commando perks he has against how many heavy weapons perks. I can drop scorchbeasts in seconds with a crafted fixer. Not because of the gun. Because of the build
---
Same, like solo launching nukes. I like Earl cause a lot of people pop lunchboxes right before we go in.
---
I‚Äôd upvote these. Terribly named weapons are the best
---
Anyone else having problems with loading in? My screen stays black with the public teams available sign and the loading symbol frozen. I am getting incredibly tired of paying for fallout 1st when I can‚Äôt access the game. These bugs are getting out of hand.
---
Man I hate you whales.
---
Lol. I went afk while doing some housecleaning. I came back and someone was sitting in the chair next to my bed, also afk.
---
Only thing I can hope for it that when it does finally give me something its 6 days worth of luck and I get multiple items...I only want 2 things...thats it lol
---
Fast Travel to Foundation, climb the big tram tower thing next to the Gold exchange and wait. Free travel means you'll have several players coming after you in a couple of minutes, and while up there, you can see them coming. It's funny watching them all race to find you first. Some even fight each other. 
---
I picked a few locks to get a bounty and every time this works quick.
---
BlTCH (That's a lower case of L) for my Bffr fixer.
---
I really like the lever action name, pretty damn cool.
---
I was originally going to name mine ‚ÄúThe Instigator‚Äù as well, but decided not too since I felt there would be too many the‚Äôs already.
---
You can buy a legacy or a b2525 HM or fixer for 10 bucks.not saying it's the right thing but until we have a legit way if trading the honor system we have is so broke and let's be real nobody is putting their high end handmades or fixers in a vendor for caps.every one the grinds is at max caps
---
You‚Äôre welcome to one of my stack of liquid courage recipes.
---
I like the rewards that come with it. Well, most of the loot. I can do without the cursed items.
---
A bloodied HW is basically the same as 9star HW perks; the only other direct-benefit perk is Stabilized and tons of people run HW outside of power armor.
---
So yes, it is situational, when a single *good* legendary effect gives you the results of 9 perks into a weapon, and where a *bad* one (like nocturnal or berserker) can leave you worse than no perks at all.
---
That actually gives me a great idea. Next time I run into someone who is afk/sleeping, I will wear a fastnacht mask and stand staring at them like in the movie paranormal. I will then go afk while doing it...
---
You are a legend! Thank you so much!
---
Most you can get is two. If you drop an item you own and then pick it back up during the run, it counts as a reward at the end of the daily ops for some reason. Seems your friends were trolling you hard
---
They could give Fallout 1st members a Gold and Black paint job for all the Power Armor types but instead they give a skin to a camp object
---
It's not. The minigun will use more than you get back. If I'm in a team and conservative with my ammo (tagging enemies instead of killing them), then I'll come close to breaking even.
---
He must care deeply about you. He checked if everything was OK with you without disturbing your sweet dreams.
---
Wait what!!!!!
---
Yes the only reason I  subscribed is for
---
The Tent
---
The Scapbox and
---
The Atoms
---
The rest is just nice if it comes my way, otherwise lookout ghoul I have scavenging to do!
---
stated with 900 rounds, ran it 8 times, have 5000 rounds now lol
---
The challenge is nice, but not being at the level for the ammo resources yet makes ammo a priority, but not too bad with daily ops rewarding so much. repairing weapons and are is a lot more frequent, but manageable. Overall I like it, it makes it more of a scavaging / survival game.
---
I have, it's even worse than I thought. not the level scaling mind you, I actually like it. it's a lot easier to farm levels now.
---
but the damage nerf has me relying too much on legacy weapons. it's the only way to have any real damage output now.
---
A .45 handgun.
---
A new type of hypermodable energy weapon like laser and plasma. Able to be pistol, rifle, auto, sniper ect. But you know, not shit like current energy weapons.
---
Sadly it was super great for my and my friend up until the update last Tuesday... i know others liked it but for us it made everything not fun.... but if you like the new update then yes 1st is worth it for the scrapping and the private world :)
---
I've actually been quite lucky. My first 2 days were with no rare rewards. But the past couple days have been giving me rewards like the reactor, Vault 94 jumpsuit and stash box, as well as the War Glaive
---
AA/SS/S Cultist Dagger -"Repent".
---
With some of the retcons and skins like the hellfire armor, the lore is already very broken, so...
---
Right away your second word. Bloodied. It‚Äôs build related. It‚Äôs not an argument. Your damage and defence comes from your build
---
Love my Mr Fuzzy Mining Helmet. Bright ass light is perfect for finding bodies in the mire or in the mines.
---
Honestly haven't noticed much of a difference. My main is a full health rifleman, usually in power armor. Things still die just as quick as before.
---
i die more than before, but I still every thing 1 shot. I have too add that for me AAE and TE shotguns seem to be usable again, before the update I was shooting with BBs at enemies. now I melt them no matter the lvl, ofcourse normal enemies.
---
The chest is the best. The jetpack really helps with mobility, including in daily ops.
---
is it possible to sell the crafted outfit, or does it have to be a drop?
---
Biv needs to come out of the basement!
---
Anytime bud. 
---
For leveling up challenges in dailies and weeklies, it‚Äôs very easy. Make a new character, skip everything in the vault and run straight to the exit, then once you get out, do the short dialogue with the robot, then talk to the two girls at the bottom of the stairs of Vault 76... Then run straight to the wayward bar, do the 3 min dialogue, then go to overseers camp right outside the bar and craft a cheap wood blunt weapon, and then craft a leather piece of armor. Easy 10 minute task to finish the leveling up challenge. (First level right out of the vault does not count for the level up challenge. ‚Äî Delete character after hitting level 3, and rinse and repeat the routine if more than one level needed.)
---
Wasn‚Äôt sure if you knew this tip but felt like I should offer it. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if other people are far ahead, you have plenty of time. You‚Äôre already a little more over a 1/4 of the way there. That‚Äôs pretty good in my opinion. I‚Äôm only #24.
---
Yes, I wish we could trade them at least, I  got an unyielding SS chest the other day, but I have a vanguard one that suits my build better, still kept it though.
---
Get a Harpoon gun and you‚Äôll 1 shot or 2 shot at best every non boss mob  in the game simple
---
I'll keep an eye out for you.
---
I‚Äôm like level 230something, but certainly not bloodied... I‚Äôm kinda my own build, like a Commando/heavy tank merchant?
---
I‚Äôm totally into honest vending, scouring Appalachia for deals, then up selling at my shop. It‚Äôs been super fun!
---
And with the fletchette mod for the harpoon gun you‚Äôll have unlimited ammo from looting the enemies you kill simple
---
pIpE iS lIfE
---
I got the vault suit and crate on patch day, and burrows signs on Wednesday...since then nothing, I want the glaive and solar chargers thats it...
---
Harboom Gun- Two Shot Explosive Harpoon Gun
---
Miss Piggy - Two Shot Explosive .50 cal
---
Shooty McShootface - Vampire‚Äôs Faster Fire Rate Gatling Laser
---
AA - Executioners Explosive Gatling gun
---
Shredder - Two Shot Explosive Faster Fire Rate Minigun
---
Ouch! Sorry yer not stoked..
---
Interesting. Thanks for the response!
---
I could apply that same logic to fallout 1st itself. I am using my hard earned money to buy the game, and I am missing out on what could be considered fundamental content to the game
---
I don't know if i can believe that. I also have a two shot revolver, don't know what Severe doess off the top of my head, and i also have tank killer, and it still takes me 4-5 headshots to a super mutant to down it. without Adrenalie stacked up. 
---
Are you running bloody mess?
---
Having similar issues with sneak melee but can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly what it is because this game is a mess. I can kill enemies in one hit with a sprinting attack sometimes, but then the same enemy type (and same level) will withstand a sneak attack with 3x damage bonus.
---
I can understand the foosball table being just an animation, honestly I dont even know how they would implement a version that you could actually play. I just dont understand why there isnt a small gun range minigame with the shooting range one. I mean there is no way it would be that difficult to code that in and it would be way more fun than just watching your character use the shooting range. Just food for thought for developers, camp items that are interactive to the point that they provide minigames to people who play them would sell fantastically from the atom shop.
---
I thought they would buff some stats like the weight bench does but maybe they were disabled as a precaution since the weight bench STR buff could be stacked repeatedly.
---
Have a black mining hemlmet with bright light. Its better than sex. Not that i have sex, im not a simp
---
I cannot agree more. The Burrows is a maze, and it's only by dumb luck that I get anywhere. On the way to the boss fight, there are some dead end stone tunnels that always mix me up.
---
Dude, do you play? Bloodied is a legendary effect. The only thing ‚Äúbuild‚Äù relevant to make the legendary effect work is being at 20% health... if your health level is the only thing that makes you a build, a build doesn‚Äôt amount to much does it it?
---
Yes, there‚Äôs this whole thing called a bloodied build as well, but it‚Äôs completely irrelevant to my point. I‚Äôm solely talking about the legendary effect.
---
My main was a full health rifleman as well. Instigating lever action would one hit most creatures. Since the nerf, a lot of enemies have become 4-5 slots. Daily ops with the weapons was not fun.
---
Had a couple really good weapons and armor, so i switched to bloodied. I don't think I can ever go back!  The damage is crazy compared to previous nerf lever action.
---
Ah yes I  have been trapped by this before.
---
Food and water needs will soon be removed soon, so there goes some more survival aspects.
---
my wife hates seeing other players. I got it to be able to have a world for just us.
---
ü§£üòç
---
It isn't, but all of these babies keep crying about how hard this game is.
---
Me: Fo76 can I have a new world?
---
Fo76: We have new worlds at home.
---
New worlds at home:...
---
lol!
---
Haha!
---
Same would be extremely helpful
---
If you‚Äôve been to other camps and the players haven‚Äôt changed them you‚Äôre in the same world.
---
I started a new character for the AA &amp; Furious Fixers I got from the legendary sale. I was an unarmed bloody build before and I‚Äôve honestly never really used guns in 76 before. Having a lot of fun with the gun thank RNGesus for the roll! My previous build was nerfed into hell and it took a week of frustration to give up and start over. I‚Äôm having a blast now especially with ops but I really miss my old toon...
---
free armor bench? cool, thanks for the reminder.
---
Fallout 1st costs less than a movie and popcorn a month, i am more than happy to pay it.
---
Would it be cool? Yes
---
Would it be a complete waste of time, since it would probably be boring, badly implemented, or extremely buggy, and not really make sense/fit with the game? Yes
---
Ok. I‚Äôll be on later. Remove all your perks that affect damage. Nerd rage hw oerks. Any buffs. Blocker serendipity and anything that affects defences. You can stay at 20% health and run Earle and then tell me your build isn‚Äôt the majority of your defence and damage. I doubt you could do a westtek run without dying multiple times. Even letting u keep adrenal reaction on.
---
According to the mined data on [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005CBBAB), the perks require 5 pieces of Secret Service armor, and the keyword which the perk looks for is on the arms, legs and torso but NOT on the helmet. So based on that I'd say it's a visual bug, but who knows?
---
Completely agree! I missed out on the contemporary camp bundle originally as I took a break around that time and was really bummed out. Luckily it resurfaced last month and I was able to buy it. Other than that I‚Äôve had no desire to buy dang near anything in the Atomic Shop
---
All I want for Christmas is a non-PA helmet that gives DR.
---
The whole point of a helmet is to protect the head, yet AFAIK, there are zero pieces of headgear aside from PA helmets that provide any sort of protection.
---
It's almost immersion breaking. Do we know if enemies can headshot you? If they can, and there are no protective non-PA helmets, that's just so dang dumb.
---
Yes. This.
---
The meat week rewards are costumes and possibly a melee weapon called the tenderizer and its mods. 
---
It's a cookout that happens every hour on the hour. You can collect and turn in critter chunks and greens during the event, put out fires and clean up messes, contribute wood scraps or feed for Chally, or just play the drums or turn the meat spits. Grahm sells the plan for Chally's feed, which you can make at your camp and bring.
---
There's also the primal cuts events, in which you kill waves of animals against a timer. You get prime meats as a reward, which you can turn in at meat week to get legendary scrip and progress the event.
---
The only thing stealth can‚Äôt participate in is daily ops, and they‚Äôre adding in a new one where stealth will work in a few months. Also, it‚Äôs pretty sad that you‚Äôre that pissed over 1 feature not allowing stealth whenever it‚Äôs complete overpowered. You take zero damage, because they don‚Äôt even know where you are, and you deal 2-4x as much damage depending on your build or what perks you‚Äôre using. Grow up
---
I was fucking pissed when I realized I missed the Elite Riot Gear. Favorite armor from New Vegas hands down.
---
I like the scrap box, but I would prefer a much cheaper version of fallout 1st that doesn't include the monthly atoms.
---
It ought to give the Jimmy Buffet-buff, ‚Äúwastin away again in fallout 7-6‚Äù
---
&gt; Professor‚Äôs House
---
Can you explain where this is and what you are looting there to help push your loot list? Also, do you go to the red/blue house in Summersville (if you fast travel to that POI, it will be the first house you are looking at) - There are over 200+ burnt books, so long as no one has already looted them. I try to utilize that as well to push my loot list.
---
All my drugs are 10 caps, and my drugs are better than yours ;)
---
I wouldn't say all pistols are weak. It depends on your build. I have a Instigating Western Revolver and it's been obliterating Super Mutants just fine.
---
As someone who has turned their camp into a brewery with displays of many alcoholic beverages in display I am all for it.
---
Oh plenty, you get the bonus damage but say on a gun like a gat laser when you create the core it gets over charged and running the perk power user you get more use out of a core. At the first rank Im getting 650 rounds + 250 rounds out of the "normal core it turns into after you burn though the over charge" That's 900 rounds of ammo on the first rank! Max out the legendary ammo smith perk plus the ammo perk and super duper and the cost goes even further down.
---
I agree. in the first year it was out I encountered more people willing to help a newbie out than I did in Destiny; which is saying something. But over time, I think the frustration dedicated players had towards the devs has jaded some people. It's too bad, but the negativity in the game and community was too much of a put off for me to enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The fo76 community will always have a special place in my heart.
---
As others have said, the scrap box is great. The tent is handy too, since it lets you deposit your junk without having to fast travel.
---
If you use atoms, it's a better deal than buying them directly. The atom exclusive stuff is pretty lame so far though.
---
I‚Äôm a low level (74) shotgun build.  Before patch, most mobs died with one shot.  Not it takes two.  Crits rarely 1-shot so I might as well swap pot any crit perks I have.
---
I've been thinking for a while now, that a guestbook terminal at camps would be really cool.
---
On my stealth sniper:  
---
-Dominance Shift - gauss rifle  
---
-Nocturnelle - fixer  
---
-Smoldering Kingdom - plasma flamer  
---
On my unarmed melee:  
---
-Hand Atop the Ziggurat - deathclaw gauntlet  
---
-Earth Ripper - mole miner gauntlet
---
It's not just ops. 
---
&gt;Also, it‚Äôs pretty sad that you‚Äôre that pissed over 1 feature not allowing stealth whenever it‚Äôs complete overpowered.
---
It's sad that you don't understand the fundamentals of game design. If the only way you're able to make something work is to disable a spectrum of builds, *you're doing it wrong*. 
---
Stealth also isn't OP, you're just whining. Why not run PA Heavy armor? You take minimal to no damage, and run some of the strongest weapons. 
---
&gt;Grow up
---
Your lack of understanding does not equate to my "grownupness". 
---
Your ignorance is laughable, as well as your attempt at maturity. Good job champ.
---
Edit: Also, good job not even replying to the other complaints. Sorry that I don't run a spec that is given easy to get armor and weapons, and have patch after patch giving them content and gear. 
---
*Literally over a year since stealth / rifle users have been given either*. But go ahead.
---
I a really got the Burrows signs because of a trade with a guy for an extra Vault 94 Stash Box plan I had sitting around.
---
So using pa wich perk do you recommend ?
---
Definitely should be more content for fo 1st subscribers. If you pay for a monthly service then clearly you should get more rewards. If you don't like the fact that people want items for their subscription service that they pay for then get it yourself. Bethesda is a business not a hand out they need to make money on these things in order for it to move forward.
---
VATS seems a tad more accurate for my Gauss Rifle these days.
---
Bloodied stealth commando still solid and the downside for that is just daily ops eliminate the use of sneak other than that still pretty good
---
(: Thank you
---
Camp Adams
---
Gulpers were the first thing I thought of when I found out about this. I‚Äôm sad too
---
Uh, I really just am happy with it, doing event like Jail Break, and it not being like shooting fish in a barrel, is pretty cool to me.. However, it‚Äôs sucks that lower levels are not enjoying it, after all, I thought P22 was supposed to even the playing field???
---
I was lucky enough to receive a IE Fixer from Mumbles around the time of the update. Most enemies die in 1-3 shots, tougher enemies like Fog Crawlers can be a bit of a pain though. For those enemies I bust out a plasma thrower which absolutely melts, both enemies and the gun itself, and Daily Ops made it's ammo inefficiency a non-issue. I know bloodied can massively increase my damage output, but I'm having fun where I'm at and I'm not really struggling at all.
---
Thanks
---
This! I would pay Atoms to buy one for my CAMP that gives players the same effect when they activate it.
---
Pipe club!
---
Look under challenges in the menu, for ones marked "Tadpole."
---
Me every time. I am so used to the map tab.
---
I bought the gauss pistol and i was very disappointed
---
X-Cell, Psychobuff, and Buffout or Bufftats are what I always buy.
---
The game is still too easy. What changed the most is that I can feel good about using weapons other than bloodied since they do as much damage. Well not as much but the gap is much smaller
---
Way to move the goal posts. OP asked about a gun to do more damage. I‚Äôm talking about doing more damage with a gun. The only one talking about survival and defenses here is you.
---
What is pipe?
---
YES, PLEASE.
---
Cannibal is life.
---
How do you not know the slope trick yet? Half my camp is merged with it. Suitcases under beds toolboxes under workbenches and that wood burning fireplace over a campfire so it has an actual fire. Pit group couches floor lamps into desks table lamps into sitting gorillas like hats. So many possibilities.
---
My Input may be pointless since I‚Äôm only a level 36 but I find the update to be great with only a minor annoyance. 
---
Being able to roam around the wasteland is amazing. Seeing all the areas that have great lore and most of all the loot. It gives me opportunities that otherwise I‚Äôd have to wait until my character was lv50. 
---
The minor annoyance is ammo and I burn through it so fast, I end up farming lead, steel, gunpowder one day so I can play the next. I have been told to do daily ops to farm ammo and didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat nub‚Äù on the team but tried anyways only to get raged at. 
---
Its not huge issue by any means since eventually I‚Äôll finish my build and be more efficient with my ammo but this is the Perspective of a low lv player.
---
Good luck mama!
---
I wish theyd show what youd be missing if you didnt havr fo1st. Like it doesn't even show what fo1st players are getting. You see absolutely no updates on the shop if you stop getting 1st.
---
Also this is why I canceled my fo1st. No new stuff in months.
---
Thanks I‚Äôve put it off for to long
---
Happens to me before as well, obvious bug again, there also a bug when the uplink progress doesn‚Äôt move.
---
I've sniffed it twice. There was a dead brahmin near it the first time, so I was wary, but I feel like I made the right choice.
---
No. It‚Äôs build related. If u want a viable weapon you have to build around it. The weapon alone isn‚Äôt enough. Not even close. The reason op struggles when. He switched from commando weapons to heavies is, I suspect, build related. Even with a nocturnal with a solid hw buikd it would be viable. Not the best but you could do good damage. In his situation just saying get a gun that dies more damage isn‚Äôt helpful.
---
Same, but I'm not really speced for pistol. Would be better if automatic maybe. And I haven't added any fireproff till I got the shotgun
---
Oh dip, that's rare? I got it on my first ever cook out. I just got a mod for it too on my last cook out. Do you happen to know what it's worth?
---
Playing this game with a scrapbox and without a scrapbox is like playing 2 different games. I have to play without it sadly and inventory management is very unfun. Would love to see everyone able to use a scrapbox one day
---
I think the patch fixed it.  Tired tonight and it let me backout several times, but didn't give me any rep.  Also didn't get any treasury notes when I finally completed it.
---
Today I ended up doing what I believe Bethesda wanted from OW.   I was forced to get F01. After running out of repair resources, low on ammo, and a packed stash box I couldn't take it anymore.   Purchased it and now I'll have endless space to store resources for weapons/armour repair and make as much ammo as I like.  I immediately felt different and didn't care how much ammo I had to pump into an enemy.
---
He can at least feel safe now that someone is watching over him while he takes a nap.
---
It's based on karma. The more nice things you do for people both in the game and your life, the more likely you are to encounter it.
---
Its a large amount to cycle through be patient. I grabbed the mr fuzzy ride and people constantly message me where i got it. It all comes back and its September a bit early for Christmas
---
Yea I‚Äôm keeping different good rolls just in case I want to try something new later. It‚Äôs worth it.
---
I would love to see more weapon skins that work on all weapon.
---
Farmed the whole last event and didnt get it. Did prolly 10 more this time around still didnt get it. Then my homie I meet is 76 (shout out to Mccomber) got a extra and was boss enough to lemme get. :D
---
Colossal waste of time, unfortunately.
---
I'm getting used to it. My guns don't feel quite as strong as they used to but that's okay. The one thing that became even more apparent with One Wasteland is that the damn Mirelurk Kings need a nerf with either their attack or overall DR/Health. They were a pain in the ass before but getting swarmed by them now is even worse imo.
---
So me farming 230 Salisbury steaks is going to be a waste of time. At least I‚Äôll have more stash space without all that food and water I‚Äôve been hoarding.
---
That's something i don't think they took into consideration..it was more of a way to balance end game player with end game equipment. And honestly i still hit pretty damn hard. However newer players haven't quite had a chance to achieve this equipment or maybe not even optimized their builds for their level. You're now fighting the highest level thing you can with mediocre equipment. Not really thought out.
---
Get rid of tank killer in favour ground pounder for faster reload you will really notice the difference. Thats the biggest thing. Get Agility up to 15 and loose white knight you dont need that at level 160 equip escape artist, sneak up to 3 and maybe covert operative. Better criticals on luck. 
---
Weapon wise is down to personal choice. But as you are using an explosive weapon i would certainly be looking at a dense chest mod or fireproof up to 3. You have already identified that explosive weapons break way too quick. I think 25/25 is much better. That way you can loose gunsmith and free up points there. Your build is ok but with a bit of tweaking will be really good!üëç
---
I like daily ops and I‚Äôm a stealth commando build, I like the ops mainly for the free ultracite ammo hence saving me quite a bit of flux for crafting other stuff
---
Morgan freeman is what I named my exploding handmade
---
I've been playing the game since launch and I try and kill anyone that has a bounty on them so I can get the challenge completed to kill 76 wanted players and so far I have 20 kills after 2 years
---
I‚Äôm not sure, but check the medicine vendor at Whitesprings Resort. I got mine from there and checking players vendors
---
I also got 2 rares and have had elder every day. 80% drop rate my eye.
---
I have a bloodied explosive faster reload double barrel that I call BOOF BOOF!
---
The areas were originally capped two years ago when the game dropped and over time those level caps have increased for the higher level players. They want a challenge, I get it. When you run around like a God in the game, some people find that boring. Which is why Diablo worked so well, they had the "torment levels" for those wanting to have more challenge. 
---
Those that play casually can't keep up with the higher ranking players so we want something that isn't going to take waaaaayyyy too long to enjoy some end game content. It's a challenge to create something and meet the expectations for everyone. WoW felt this with all their updates and eventually had to create servers to cater to the old school classic WoW players who liked that challenge while the rest of the casual players ran modern day Wow.
---
All gaming companies have to take risks and change things to stay afloat in the industry. I get it. I'm still dumping bullets into enemies and I'm playing a role that I didn't ever have any intentions of playing. In order to stick with the changes made, I think we lose focus that we too need to change. Those not willing to change will leave and those of us who still want to enjoy the game will figure out how to adapt.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm still not pleased with what has happened but I can't place ALL of the blame on them right now. I need to make changes and after trial and error....if I can't manage and I've exhausted all efforts, then yeah, I won't look back on walking away with my subscription and the other amounts of money I drop in the atom store.
---
Do yourself a favor, change what you can, exhaust all efforts and then walk away with no regrets.
---
For real, this is the only game that gives me issues with my monitor :(
---
That happened to me today 3 vertibirds and a cargo drop heli my instinct was to shoot down the cargo one and I ended up getting c**k blocked by a damn mountain. Looking forward to seeing more of those though fallout 4 was very entertaining seeing constant warfare with the vertibirds.
---
Outer Worlds was really good...
---
Use herd mentality. And get pieces of armor that have luck boosting stats.
---
Ya i toss those. Not even worth selling
---
Also you may want to get the luck legendary perk card
---
Things not being a good enough deal for you, does not make those things "Scams". That's 100% pure Karen logic right there.
---
If you think you should be entitled to all previous content, sure whatever that's a possible opinion. But calling not getting content that you weren't told you were going to get a scam, is stupid.
---
I named mine based on the primary prefixes of the legendary effect, yeah I‚Äôm very basic
---
From bodies ammo drops in multiples of four - 4-8-12-16 (roughing to 10 rounds per kill, also note you won't be able to loot every body, so make shots count). And then 200-300+ with the weapon which was last fired on boss. I use Gauss Rifle for boss and Lever/Tesla on everyone else, and switch to whatever I want for the final shots.
---
`15 Base Luck`  
---
`5 Legendary Luck`  
---
`5 Armor (5x +1 Luck Major prefix)`  
---
`3 Herd Mentality (assumes in a group + Strange in Numbers)`  
---
`8 Charred Scorchbeast Liver (assumes Carnivore + Strange in Numbers)`  
---
`2 Shielded Vault Suit`  
---
`3 Day Tripper/Formula P`  
---
`3 Happy-Go Lucky Perk (might interfere with Liver so buff of drink needs to be non-luck)`  
---
`---`
---
`44`
---
So this is what I came up with though my math maybe off on a few things like the Liver. Liver gives +3 base which is boosted to +6 with carnivore mutation, then increased by 25% with Strange in Numbers perk. This ends up being 7.5 but I see +8 effectively in my pipboy so +/-1 Luck depending on potential rounding. There may also be a conflict with buffs since certain catagories of consumables overwrite each other if there is a shared effect, this changed I think 2 patches ago allowing a little more freedom but its still unclear to me.
---
**My questions for you are:**
---
\- what is the point of this build?
---
\- Are you going to be able to reasonably maintain the appropriate buffs?
---
**Some other things to consider:**
---
\- Is the weapon in question speced with the Lucky 3rd star effect? (vats meter fills 15% faster)
---
\- If your goal is just damage increase and not just hitting critical thresholds, have you considered +20% crit damage boost consumables and chems?
---
\- Is the armor major prefix slot more worth it to have luck or AP regen?
---
\- Is this build worth the effort when you could run half health Unyielding instead and cut out a chunk of maintenance costs?
---
Mine works with 5 pieces of scout armor ( no headwear ).
---
You have to wait a day to reroll the rewards for Paladin and Elder ranks, as those rewards only drop once per day.
---
Moving your camp from one location to another may require rebuilding.   But if you keep your camp in the same location you do not need to rebuild every time you play.
---
Thats.. thats not how company acquisitions work?
---
Sorry to hear people were raging. This game's community overall was quite nice when I was playing regularly, though I did run into a few losers. They should be a minority overall though and I hope you have more luck next run!
---
I named my Light Machine Gun "Gruner" after the inventor
---
Well, Less is more
---
* Lose the carry weight perks. As a Rifleman/Commando, you don't need that much strength.
---
* Having III/III/III perks (base/expert/master) is overkill; I/II/II is sufficient.
---
* You only need rank I Concentrated Fire.
---
* Keep Tank Killer III, but do get Ground Pounder.
---
* Gunsmith V is questionable. Nice to have for crafting, but you'll want Nerd Rage.
---
* Sneak III, Covert Operative III, Escape Artist, Adrenaline V are key for stealth rifle/Commando builds.
---
* With that much CHA, you absolutely have to run Tenderizer III. Tenderizer is still applied multiplicatively and not additively, so it's great for automatic rifles and fast-firing weapons.
---
* Serendipity III is key. You don't really need Class Freak, the negatives of mutations are pretty mild as is.
---
* Get Fire Proof II and never be scared of explosions ever again.
---
* Legendary Perks: Get Follow Through. Like Tenderizer, it's applied multiplicatively and therefore provides a huge boost to damage output. Same goes for Taking One For The Team.
---
Cool üëç
---
I depend heavily on thumbs up. Last time I did that after carefully exploring a camp, the owner hearted back, so communication was made.
---
Ground pounder is for automatics. Everything else you said is great advice. If OPs main is an explosive rifle, I'd get rid of gunsmith completely, suck up having to make repairs regularly, and add in the demo expert perk.
---
I agree with what above said for the most part. I would keep tank killer it shreads with AA weapons. You are missing out on the major damage of legendary follow through. Get rid of white Knight and good with salt. In strength Try blocker max, it helps out. Tenderizer achieves as much damage as bloody mess since patch.
---
Where was that sorry when I failed Line in the Sand because I ran out of steel like a dumb ass?
---
Silencers don't reduce damage, only range. The range reduction isn't even that severe. I have never had a situation where I thought to myself "damn, if only I had that extra 30 range, I'd be doing more damage" because the sustained x2/x2.5 damage from sneaking tends to improve your DPS even within that sacrificed range, especially when headshots are multiplying off of it. We've also got Crack Shot to make up the range difference.
---
Right now a sneak-focused gunslinger doesn't have an optimal array of options. The 10mm can do decent, but the damage is still lacking. The gauss pistol hits hard but can be somewhat unwieldy with terrible sight options, no true scope, and a range stat that does not support silencers as well as other guns. The only other weapons to support silencers aside from these two are pipe weapons, with the most viable being the pipe revolver. This isn't optimal. Giving us a silenced .44 option would round out the semi-auto sneak arsenal much better.
---
I'm calling the rotation of fallout first items in and out of availability a scam. FOMO, is a scam. And somehow SO many people have bought into it that its now a primary tactic used by companies, especially those that deal with digital products. Pretty detrimental if you ask me
---
Did the same with the outfit. Was wearing a power armor so it took the outfit off, only had it a few hours and it's my favourite outfit in the game. Tried since but keep getting whistle in the dark plans and nothing else
---
The Drill too while they're at it.
---
I like it.
---
Don't get Batteries Included *and* Power User. Pick one. As a heavy, you'll WANT Stabilized III.
---
Also, don't get Ricochet, get Serendipity instead. Wait, does Serendipity work in power armor? It might not, now that I think about it.
---
Bill doesn't run MS. If anything, maybe ask Phil as he's the head of gaming.
---
Public teams, recent legendary perks (they help my build alot) and all of the gear in wastelanders to grind for, theres something for everyone in that dlc
---
Well...the Christmas themed tent kinda makes sense as a limited time only item...
---
I've been leveling like a madman. I'm going to be maxing a legendary perk and unlocking the last slot sooner than expected.
---
There is a legendary perk that stacks with ammo smith that allows you to make more ammo. The only trade off is you need to be level 50 minimum to access it. I'm a big guns power armor build and the new legendary ammo factory perk has saved my ass.
---
Serums,ammo,bulk junk
---
I find drills more often than chainsaws and I think drills even drop from some events. Buffing them would be both great and hilarious.
---
I have dropped 6 of them. Never felt better offloading trash
---
I want stabilized but i dont know what to get rid of
---
love doing OPs for ammo, always come out with 500+
---
Lol. 
---
Counterpoint: I run around in random WWR armor outside of my power armor in my ‚Äútravel‚Äù perk set (PC master race) with zero survival or damage perks equipped and still rock through random ghouls and super mutants with my BFFR Gatling gun. What‚Äôs doing the work for me at that point? The gun, and Adrenal Reaction. That‚Äôs it.
---
It‚Äôs simple math. A legendary effect (bloodied) at 20% health increases damage by 80%. 9star weapon perks only increase weapon damage by 60%. So that single legendary effect, can effectively replace the equivalent of 12 perks, if you could even equip 12star damage perks. 
---
Add in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù weapon like a handmade or a fixer  vs a ‚Äúbad‚Äù weapon like pipe rifle, and you can see how having a ‚Äúgood‚Äù weapon with a ‚Äúgood‚Äù legendary effect has a HUGE impact on your damage output. Which is what OP was asking about. I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs about half your damage; the rest of your perks and mutations are the other half (although this heavily depends on if you‚Äôre HW, melee, rifles, shotguns, or pistols; melee damage mutations have a large impact, and VATS/Stealth are heavily affected by certain perks and legendary armor effects)
---
Which brings me back to my initial point.
---
It‚Äôs very situational, dude.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs no need for them to add more stuff
---
For the price you pay, they definitely need more stuff to add.
---
Definitely fallout community is one of the least toxic, this was just me ‚Äúnot knowing what to do‚Äù and someone who probably just wanted to run the event without issue.
---
Done 100s and all I get is bloody chef stuff or the black grill master hat, gave up and bought the backpack and grill plans cos never got em last time and know I won't this time. 
---
Not even had so much as a sniff of a mod for a tenderisor but that might be because I assume I need to learn the plan for the weapon itself first
---
I think it's coming back soon. In the past few months I've seen it multiple times in the background of other Atomic Shop items. Thats normally how Bethesda teases ATX items.
---
Legendary perks you say? Is that from leveling? 
---
Did they ever fix energy weapons? I‚Äôd love to jump back in, as the community seemed so rad. I just couldn‚Äôt handle the constant crashing and the inequality with weapon types/builds.
---
Stealth Commando is still fine. For Daily Ops, consider switching to a run 'n gun commando though. Ditch the stealth perks and get damage mitigation instead (Serendipity, Dodgy, etc).
---
Also, lasers are not a great choice. The damage calculation for energy weapons is still broken, so you'll always be doing lackluster damage. Plus, lasers break crazy fast.
---
It's not just PC!  Console is even worse  lol
---
I would love a "Nice Camp" emote or "Howdy Neighbor!"
---
Is there any way to send a msg on pc? I think pc players will need it.
---
I loved those maps. Especially when wandering around outside. Was so cool to see everything from above on yoir pipboy
---
&gt;No new stuff in months.
---
There's at least one free item every month. They're almost always shit, but saying no new stuff in months is just straight-up lieing.
---
Definitely add Stabilized in Intelligence. I swap that one out every time I want to use a heavy gun in PA.
---
I'm not doing bad damage, im doing more damage then with my be fixer (not sneaking). No, why should I have to do that is my point?
---
I played the game on Xbox before moving to PC. At least you guys actually have a way to communicate. You can view profiles and message players through PSN or Xbox. PC doesn't even have that. We're basically isolated if we don't have a mic or don't want to use it.
---
There are no atomic shop discounts for fo1st
---
This is very wholesome, stuff like this will keep people motivated through any struggles. Thanks for sharing. Also love the bbq idea I‚Äôve been turning mine into a brewery.
---
There really isn't anything new. The last new thing was a bog wanderer outfit which I liked. But it's just been reskins as of late
---
Legendary perks are accessible after level 50, and you scrap unused perk cards for perk coins, which level up your cards. I believe when you first choose a card for each slot its free however, just leveling it costs coins. And I mean, I'm not the best to ask cause I use ballistics but I have a good heavy energy weapon or 2, and theres still some broken ones in the good way like the gauss minigun, so I think so. Never had issues with them messing my game up. And the game is better but it still will feel similar to launch. Just different. But much more playable.
---
I'm usually the one watching... or joining, or puking on the sleeping player.
---
A pipe weapon on a pipe build does serious damage. It‚Äôs not situational it‚Äôs build. Everything comes back to build. Explain why there are so many explosive plasma gat users who do little damage at events. Or why there‚Äôs post after post complaining about the damage nerf and they can‚Äôt do damage woth their fixer or LMG anymore. It‚Äôs build
---
Might try that bit liw myself at min
---
I, too, am of the bloody stealth commando clan. Post update I had to adjust and found that running Blocker,  Dodgy, Evasive and Serendipity almost makes me tanky. I can do the ops in Nerd Rage and get through on just a few stimpaks. Except for the melee robots, those things are a bitch. On offense the main difference is I use more ammo, no biggie.
---
I didn't really had problems with the change, except that my Heavy Gunner (junkies) needs a few more bullets.
---
 My Junkies Comando Build does around 33% percent less damage but I still don't have any issues.
---
Legacies also do remarkably less damage then before. Like that.
---
I'm also getting issues logging into YouTube on my ps4. It was working just fine earlier today and now its saying it cant even verify the license that I own youtube, when it's on M Y console. Hopefully whatever this bug is corrects itself on both apps, quickly
---
No brainer. Minigun. Gatling lacks in dps now.
---
Enemies stronger
---
Players Weaker
---
Bethesda: "Balanced as all things should be."
---
Meanwhile hacked and op weapons never got the nerf as hard as the legitimate ones did.
---
The closest thing to that color scheme is the Vintage NukaShine skins for PA. I wish they would add some of these skins to the T-65 soon.
---
My experience has been that anything larger than a 2x2 footprint won't reliably place from blueprint. Not that it can't be done, but if you want a mobile camp, I'd stick to 2x2 or use a prefab structure like the red rocket garage. You definitely want to stay mobile until you're at a higher level.
---
Division 1 lmao not even close. Something is wrong if it‚Äôs t takes you 4-5 mags for a ghoul bro
---
&gt;All the enemies you face have your level, it looks like you are doing nothing
---
As a level 16 this is exactly how I feel. Everywhere I go and everything I fight is the same tough battle. I don't want to stomp over everything, but roaches taking more than once hit is ridiculous. Ghouls are a bit too tough to take down for my liking too. It's not that I hate a challenge, I just want to be able to explore the map, but it seems like everywhere I go I'm facing tough enemies.
---
I brought this yp a month ago, i really wish someone in the dev team was paying attention to this.
---
And to sell repair kits.
---
That would be nice, don‚Äôt get me wrong I enjoy people sending messages about my Mothman chapel but a simple emote would be good too.
---
It's pretty fucking spectacular all around. Now if they fixed the VATS bugs, I'd be as happy as a radscorpion with two stingers.
---
just playing a lot or running all buffs/uny gear?
---
That's what I was thinking. I was considering looking for a Vampire's as it could help me maintain my health in fights with Earle or SBQ. What would you reccommend I do?
---
i was def over exaggerating on the ghoul and i‚Äôve only used one of my smgs so far but i‚Äôve noticed that it now does fuck all damage to animal enemies
---
Now might be a good time to start a new character and use meat week to level the character quickly and in the way you‚Äôd respec. I agree though...if we had a convenient respec option, and contextual dropping ammo like we do in ACP and Daily Ops, but everywhere...this would go a long way.
---
Peppered tenderizer or super sledge
---
With gamepass ultimate, you can stream gamepass games to an android device.
---
&gt; How do you not know the slope trick yet? 
---
No, no I do not.
---
It's solid. 8/10. Everyone complained the game was too easy. Now it's harder. And more rewarding. A lot of xp. You can't get bored in the forest. Enemies levels in lower levels escalate. No more yawning in the tea event.
---
Are you on xbox I can sell you a Vamp minigun for 5,000 caps
---
How was the stove/chem set made?
---
I want the Laer.
---
Make it legendary like the whisper in the dark
---
It's annoying when they do some kind of maintenance on any game or device, that we the players who are loyal to them, continue to be screwed by their incompetence to do something right for once
---
Nice! Having an outlet for unused perk cards automatically peeks my interest. I remember energy weapons breaking incredibly fast...so much so that they seemed unplayable.
---
Compared to a sword its slow, weight hurts speed and polearms are about reach, not speed
---
My husband likes to port to random lowbies and aggressively chases them around with gifts. I always try to remind him that if they're ignoring him then they're probably just alts but unless they specifically tell him that he'll continue to chase them for awhile saying, "LET ME LOVE YOU!!"
---
We have a local chat mod.
---
The needler huh...
---
Only needler I know of belongs to a certain new overlord's franchise Halo.....lol imagine of we get Halo weapons
---
When I have the time I like to enjoy other people's camps and play music.
---
I am, but I logged off for the night. Will tomorrow be okay? Also, what are the other stars and effects that go on it?
---
My main ranged weapon is an anti armor gatling gun, and I love it. There is no spin up time, ammo consumption is low, I can kill most super mutants in 3-4 shots and I am not super optimized for heavy guns (I mostly fight unarmed). From daily ops I come out with 700-800 more ammo than I went in. Never have to craft ammo again.
---
Ah, that's what you mean. My gatling plasma does degrade a tad faster than my 50 cal machine gun but that's cause its legendary and whatnot. Plus, I have repair and degradation perks which borderline make weapon snapping and repair costs non existent issues. And trust me man, me too. I hated seeing all of my old unused cards. My inventory is neat now, and now perk card packs are valuable as hell after level 50 and during the new season's events. I recommend checking out a video on YouTube ab the legendary perks so you're better informed
---
No. Game is perfect now. My bloodieds hop in power armor. If it's to risky I go 50% red. Solid update. 8/10.
---
Turrent 1: yo bro you stole my kill!
---
Turrent 2: whatcha gonna do bout it fam
---
Turrent 1: fight me brah!
---
*the two go at it forever*
---
In a world where they ask you to scrap floater grenades and not your rare loot. RIP spec ops mask.
---
I just got one if you're still looking to purchase.
---
I switched my build from a full health TSE rifleman to a Bloodied stealth commando bc i found a B25ffr 250dr Handmade few days before One Wasteland.
---
Im more powerful now than before so im good. Still learning the bloodied build, as im still dying a lot.
---
Respecing in regards of legendary perks.
---
No issues with bullet sponges. I still need Uny powered armor and started buying SS Armor and buying modules instead of the useless random 3* armor.
---
Well that's good news. I'll have to try it out myself!
---
Cute lol
---
I don't have one but I use either a vamp 50 cal or a vamp gauss minigun. Most of the time I use a bloodied explosive mini. It's wonderful. If can, get 2 minis. 1 for damage and 1 vampire and tanking.
---
I run it normal, no phasing the doors or anything like that and pre one-wasteland was fast   and easy, I averaged about 12 min runs. Post one wasteland its more like 15/20 mins because the guys are a little tougher and if I happen to get killed it throws my whole run off.
---
Yeah but uh im not paying for something I'm already paying for
---
I got a Bloodied Gauss Minigun in my first 5 rolls (Bloodied + FFR)
---
Emergency Protocols and Nerd Rage for a PA build looks enticing, ngl.
---
Gotta love the pain we go through when dealing with the purveyor and this shit. Havent found one good 50 cal legendary yet, and I've been farming for months
---
Not so much anymore for me. Many stuck with bloodied but it‚Äôs only a bit stronger then the options below it now, not hundreds of % stronger. Even then, TSE, AAE, AA, TS, Quad, and Junkies are still strong and competitive with one another while having more build diversity then Bloodied. They can all be used either full health or low health depending on what armor and perks you value.
---
Named my Matte Black Handmade Lovisa
---
The Explosive something something AR my cousin gave me Little Friend
---
My vicious vampire's Gatling Laser Nosferatu
---
My Shishkebab Benimaru
---
Those are all the unique names I have given my guns.
---
That's weird getting rid of Hunger/Thirst but ever since this recent update, even without Speed Demon, my thirst increases.
---
There's a trainyard just north of Fissure Prime. Has 3-4 glowing snallys.
---
Read some of the comments - does this also mean you can‚Äôt starve/dehydrate to death?
---
At least if you rolled a semi-decent 50 cal you could sell it or trade it. I can only scrip it üò≠
---
Isnt that restricted by the zenimax rules?
---
I wouldnt recommend it for anyone under level 30, but if you are above, try the uranium fever event. It spawns nothing but mole miners. I farm them for steel, legendaries, treasury notes, and of course black titanium. But the main thing is leveling up and sustaining yourself so you can fight them ofc
---
I did the same thing as you and only recently got back into the game. 
---
1) servers are stable and in the 3 weeks I‚Äôve been back have only crashed once which was due to a player trying to force crash the server.
---
2) enemy scaling, now that enemies scale to my level I can travel anywhere and it‚Äôs easier to find weapons the are geared towards my level.
---
3) NPCs, the game needed them badly and they are fun to interact with. They fill areas that on launch we‚Äôre basically ghost towns.
---
Daily ops are incredible for ammo.  All the enemies drop whatever you kill them with, plus you get a bunch as a reward at the end.
---
Flame spec is actually viable now, without me collecting and saving acid for a month to use it all in a day.
---
That's what scares me about getting the plasma caster and gauss minigun when I get off my ass and finish my reputations ;_;
---
FFR on the second perk would've pushed me over the edge.
---
Welcome to the (nuclear) club!  
---
 Now do it a few more times. It is &gt;so much&lt; easier, on later run throughs! My first run (with a friend) took 90 minutes, now I solo it in 30 :)
---
I want one in the Mole Miner color scheme cause that would be dope.
---
I just do simple things, primarily for weapons with long names due to legendary effects - my Plasma Caster is named P94, because in Fallout 1/2, it was called the Winchester P94
---
 If I have any in my inventory, I'l leave some drinks and some food for the owner to show my love.
---
But yeah, an emote would be cool.
---
Worth it. 
---
Get a 'trial' month, spend the time filling your scrap box as much as possible. 
---
Then wonder how you ever managed without it.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt dabbled too much in events. Only one or two with friends. I‚Äôm only lvl 26 currently so I‚Äôll try leveling up a bit before taking them on again.
---
Junkies is better hands down plus with junkies there is more ways to increase damage, tse on the other is a flat  damage rate. I seen your trying to move away from bloodied but a bloodied junkie explosive semi stealth  build is insane.
---
Im a high health commando and havent crafted a single gauss minigun. Got a AA FFR, Bloodied ffr and furious in that order. Still never rolled a handmade i can use in 2 years of playing. Frustrating they aren't tradeable.
---
BE Gatling Gun : / 1876 Mk.4
---
Hell yeah! Awesome idea üôÇ
---
Go for that. Just try and make getting to level 50 as easy as you can while doing quests and setting your build up. After then, events get easier to do and the game is a tad easier. When I was level 20 I sisnt have enough black titanium for my power armor. Now I'm drowning in it at level 120
---
Deathclaws drop more black titanium than miners do.
---
Look out for the 'Breach and Clear' event in the Ash Heap. I've done that a few times for a certain other resource, but I always seem to end up with more black titanium than anything else at the end of it.
---
You can also go to the Rusty Pick and access the treasure map vending machine outside, and purchase a map from it. These treasure maps are different to the ones that randomly drop from enemies, because you actually have a quest marker pointing you right to the location. The dig site usually showers you with black titanium.
---
You might wanna talk with Zenimax about that bud.
---
Yeah i‚Äôve had it. It makes a ‚Äúpop‚Äù noise. Then all I can see is the HUD. Everything else is black. Must‚Äôve been from the latest update, the game got a bit weird after it. I usually restart to fix it.
---
I tried the subscription for a few different months this year. After filling my scrap box with more junk than I will ever need, I see no reason to subscribe again. I never really used the tent, and having a private server seems more useless than ever.
---
*wall is just there*
---
Turret 1 and 2: WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY MOTHER? *starts shooting wall for forever*
---
Whoa! Once in three weeks is totally acceptable for a Bethesda title. It‚Äôs when it‚Äôs every thirty minutes that makes you want to pull out your hair.
---
Enemy scaling seems brilliant. So many areas existed that became obsolete after a certain point.
---
Are there a good number of NPCs?
---
Oh thank you I haven‚Äôt heard about that! But deathclaws are a bit too spooky for me to take on just yet.
---
I‚Äôll check some out now! Thanks for your valuable input.
---
Lmao pretty much how it is
---
üëç
---
This is exactly why I message wanted players first before deciding whether to attack them or not. I offer to take away their bounty and let them know they're welcome to stash their scrap first. If it's someone who accidentally became wanted, they accept my offer. If it's a trap, the offer to let them stash their scrap first lets them know I know how PVP works, and they don't bother responding since they know they won't get any scrap out of me.
---
I wish there was more NPCs but there is still updates that they are coming out with like the brotherhood coming back. Yes on launch it was just praying you could play without the game crashing lol.
---
Dataminers have found this in the files, when it releases it might be what you're looking for: https://youtu.be/YDm8Rel27dQ
---
I thought it was just me... I find running network test after power on before playing anything seems to resolve it, refreshes everything.
---
An AA Gatling Gun is actually probably one of the most potent selections of the heavy guns you can have for such a build, right now. The way armor and damage resistance works, slow big hits push more damage through enemy armor over many quick small ones, and Gatling has such a "punch" that Minigun trades away for speed instead. All things equal, the two should come out about equal dps, but against heavily-armored enemies, slow and heavy piercing shots reign, assuming you can land the shots as consistently.
---
A have a quad one, it charges to 20, I hit about 1400 damage, (max gunslinger and bloody mess) and then the enemy gains roughly half its health back after I watch the bar disappear. I have hope that one day the damage calculation won‚Äôt just spaz out and it will actually be an amazing weapon
---
Xbox?
---
Yeah actually
---
piPe is life
---
I love it. I'm leveling up so fast now. At level 427 and I started ow at 388. That is huge. I've got the whole map open up to me now, I'm doing os many more events. 9/10 I wish it was harder honestly
---
If you are on Ps4 I can help you with that.
---
I‚Äôve actually seen a few fish swimming around by some docks when I fell in. 
---
They looked normal from what I could tell.
---
I‚Äôm disappointed at the lack of options to oppose the BoS:
---
-I don‚Äôt want to give them my precious junk in exchange of alcohol and grenades.
---
-I don‚Äôt want to be their errand boy and do missions for them.
---
-I don‚Äôt want to join their ranks.
---
-I dislike their unilateral claim of the Atlas Observatory.
---
I just wanted be able to kill them off and claim their technology &amp; other assets for my own.
---
No doubt! If I could go a session with only half a dozen crashes I‚Äôd consider it a victory.
---
I managed to get two of those, in a row. The fact that it looks like the imask I actually wanted is annoying. The fact that it's untradable, 100 x heavier, and literally useless due the low level is a bit insulting.
---
Do you know what is the definition of insanity?
---
Power user is only worth it if you use gattling lasers, it turns its clip from 500 to 1k
---
U make a very fair point tbh
---
My gt is same as here QuakeSumo, if you want BT I can drop quite a bit on you.
---
Some guy wanted for 15 caps showed up at my camp naked and did the finger guns emote at me. I asked if he wanted me to kill him and he gave me the thumbs up lol, so I switched off pacifist mode and turned him into a goo pile. 
---
I then later that day killed a wanted person in a public event. I sort of got the blood lust.
---
Only two times I've ever killed (or even bother with) wanted players in two years.
---
Respec my character from a rifleman to a heavy gunner in power armor. We really need a monthly respec option...
---
I'd ditch Batteries Included then. Weight is manageable, but being able to get twice the boom out of gatling lasers with Power User is really nice.
---
Oh sure thanks! Are you on now?
---
That's what I'm saying, man.
---
I dumped 2k scorchslayer combat rifle shots into the damn thing and it didn't drop shit.
---
Ah Nevermind servers just shut down. We can do that tomorrow if you‚Äôre on then.
---
Good point!... But do you see how slowly he peaks through the window?
---
ü§£
---
I would say its worth it. As a working adult with a little disposable income, it saves me headache from having scrap / playing tetris with my stash.
---
I would not have even continued playing fo76 without it.
---
I would swap your rank 1 refractor for rank 1 concentrated fire. The +10 energy resist is not going to make or break whether you die from a protectron/assaultron and the benefits of targeting limbs/better accuracy from CF are better, imho.
---
ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§Æ
---
I use gatling plasmas
---
Nah serendipity is no pa
---
GG
---
And scream in your micro : We did it Tod
---
Huh, I'm on, maybe your particular server was having maintenance. Try again.
---
Nope this boring ass game needs some pvp
---
Dont think its gonna matter when im using a heavy weapon thats not the plasma caster
---
My partner and I gave up and have found a different game to play together. I ran out of ammo and spending hours gathering resources to make more only to blow it quickly on the next quest doesn't seem like fun to us. We are level 70, casual players. 
---
Loved the game pre-update, but it went from fun to just hard work overnight.
---
Beforehand we'd just got to the point where we could properly explore the high level areas and it felt like an achievement, TBH just being able to go to Watoga early on would have removed that feeling of progression.
---
Shame it's got the groundhog day effect, so it's an utterly futile practice.
---
You could set up a camp farm at deathclaw island, it is just one, but it can be repeatable if you want, that's a slow way but it can be a safe one
---
Gorge Junkyard has a titanium deposit in the workshop area: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gorge_junkyard
---
I don‚Äôt like them simply due to their BoS theme, or in other words:
---
I don‚Äôt like the BoS &amp; don‚Äôt want to run errands for them!
---
Hope at some point they add similar activities for other factions or against the BoS.
---
But between Fortifying Atlas, Daily Ops and the upcoming BoS DLC, I‚Äôm getting tired of Bethesda trying so hard to push the BoS down our throats, regardless of our stance with them.
---
FOMO is not a scam, its call have self control. Plus the gaming industry is not the first industry that does this. Nike, addidas e r have been doing this for decades as well as a lot of other industrys. Its called supply and demand, they wouldn't do it if there wasn't a demand for it.
---
Too bad the Encalve is basically non existent right now. Other than yourself.
---
I just gave away a 3* bloody minigun, too bad I didn't read this post earlier. I'll keep a look out if any drops.
---
Just saw your edit not really any perception perks that benefit heavy
---
All the cows I have seen including the free range ones have been 50 I believe.That might have just been the forest one not sure.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know there was one there. I‚Äôll check that out!
---
Right. I notice a benefit from CF when I use a caster, .50 cal, or ballistic Gatling gun. Other than that, you‚Äôre better off with something else. Glow sight would be useful. 20% damage to glowing enemies isn‚Äôt trivial, but if you‚Äôre more comfortable with refractor then stick with it.
---
I‚Äôve got the same thing. Supposedly it‚Äôs on a list of things to fix. But I‚Äôm just a hair below minimum video card requirements so I can‚Äôt really submit a ticket.
---
Since the update, everything breaks crazy fast regardless of rank 5 Gunsmith perk. The same can be said about armor.
---
Forgot about glow sight ill get that
---
Do you have Taking One for the Team equipped?
---
IE combat shotgun is good.
---
Yeah it spawns in the center of it, I usually build a platform away from the island, stock it with turrets, and then proceed to lure deathclaw towards it so turrets can do the job, and usually I get off a few pot shots to ensure xp gain, it can be slow though so don't expect the most efficent, but it is fairly safer than most other alternatives.
---
Pretty much. I have a hunch all the bundles are there as a way to spend caps for newer players. Everything I've seen in the last few weeks are just recycled bundles. Or outfits buried inside of a 1500 bundle that's already made the rounds over the last few months. Kind of a cheap and lazy tactic.
---
Where do I take the actual archery test I passed the exam but don‚Äôt know where to take the test
---
It's just as easy for me as it was before. I still instagib enemies, except for bosses like Earle or the SBQ. Now I can actually get decent rewards, such as level 50 legendary items, from previously low level areas.
---
I love it.
---
Leaving the cap off the toothpaste?
---
Yeah looks like it haha. My gt is Geckey53
---
"Cooking would reduce weight"....unless you're using enough spices to cover up the fact you're eating rad toad bitsü§¢üò≠üòÇ
---
Yes, it is the main cause? It‚Äôs a bug or intended?
---
What type of .50 are you looking for?
---
The feeling I get is they are coming to WV for something specific possibly nefarious.Perhaps something taggerdy was suppose to secure or do and when they failed they had to send someone to take care of it.All I know is they better make it a good reason.Galavanting across the entire country that early in the timeline seems unrealistic.Unless they are coming to get or do something that would tie into one of the earlier games that was never explained back then.
---
Nuclear winter is dedicated to pvp.
---
Then power users not really wort it. Fusion cores are plentiful and you should be using electrical absorption too. It's a great card
---
In Daily Ops if you like going solo I'd consider dropping Dodgy if in PA. You can take so many hits that you have no AP to move.
---
‚ÄúSomeone needs to do something about civilians setting off nukes.‚Äù

A patchnote from the not-so-distant future... 
---
'We heard you'd like the chainsaw to become useful, so now you can use it to harvest wood from tree trunks! (does not stack with woodchuck perk)
---
-love, Bethesda'
---
But in all honesty I agree so much! Why are power Tools even in the game, they weren't useful for anything but dicking around before and after 1WL they just became obsolete
---
The lack of options to oppose any faction that you don't like is unfortunate. Off the top of my head the only thing you can do to "oppose" any faction is to send the raiders to Foundation if you intercept them during Rocksy's quest. And nothing happens, you just get negative rep from settlers so the only thing affected is yourself.
---
I guess if there's a Settler/Raider encounter you can pick a side, but nobody is the wiser. The wasteland really doesn't react at all.
---
Love it.    
---
Do you remember what food you made, just out of curiosity?
---
Just hit 43 last night, still have 1 weeklies left. Just been getting tons of xp
---
It's probably intended. Turn on pacifist mode and you wont get flagged as hostile no matter what.
---
I saw one at meat week
---
Just because its been in practice for a while doesn't make it any less of a scam
---
I just exploded my first nuke and didn‚Äôt do it over the correct fissure site or something and so the scorched beast event didn‚Äôt trigger. A really high level character appeared near the blast zone, clearly thinking my dumb arse had done the right thing, and was keen for some scorched beast action that never eventuated. 
---
I spammed that sorry emote while chiding my friend in the group chat for not explicitly pointing out that I needed to make the blast zone over the highlighted dot, because they clearly are friends with a fucking moron who can‚Äôt see shit.
---
So what is gonna be the penalty for speed demon now that there are no real consequences from hunger?
---
Oh it sucks, fortunately I lost only couple of junks n caps game to the Explosive GP, thx for the advice
---
I got kicked the other day from my team mate I was on chat with. Then, I apparently kicked him later üòÇ this was also in Spec Ops. I don't think it was his fault buddy
---
Definitely creepy looking. Too bad it doesn't look like the IT clown!
---
With the new daily ops I get like 209 a day I sit at like 800 stimpacks
---
You will not have much free time. Haha. Mine is almost 7 months now and my play time has dwindled severely. And I'm the dad. My wife's got it worse since I can't help feeding. Good luck and congratulations!
---
Same. Full health PA heavy with a AA GG as main. No regrets.
---
Add Adrenaline, Tenderizer and Taking one for the Team into the mix and GGs are definite beasts.
---
I‚Äôve always wondered if someone has ever done this, not gonna lie I would probably hide in my camp in shame if I did so props to you for owning that TIFU
---
Minigun and gatling lasers should defo weigh more than 100 pounds if actual physics were involved
---
Don't speak that way of Microthesda they will ctrl alt del you.
---
I'm mixed on this, because there are so many camp items that serve as a stash box, and I don't want to have to run around and hover over every box-looking thing to see what type of container it is. It's useful to know that the FO1st stash box can only look like one thing, and when you visit someone's camp, you know what to look for. (I presume this is part or all of their reasoning for not adding this feature yet.)
---
I hope that if they do add skins, they remain simple and easily noticeable in a camp. Maybe just a couple of paints for the same physical box design.
---
Its not a scam that people have no self control, stop blaming companys because people don't know how to say no. I scam is selling you a car and instead you get a t shirt thats a scam, released limited edition/time stuff is not.
---
Yes.
---
Doing that again and again and again and expecting different result.
---
What system are you on?
---
At level 5 you should try to get the main quests done. If you really want to level up, kill things after using exp boosts such as well rested, etc. 
---
Super mutants are great sources of exp, but if you aren‚Äôt doing main quests you‚Äôre walling yourself off of content.
---
Should i get rid of escape artist and put the point to intelligence and get rid of power user and get sabilized 3
---
The floating numbers are buggy and should not ever be used to judge how much damage you do in Adventure mode. Comparing the health bars is the only way to go.
---
Angry Turtle did a video about those arm mods a good while ago and concluded that they did work.
---
I would also like a pipboy map. They can leave the maps as it's now, my nostalgia just wants them to add the green map in my pipboy.
---
The debuff counts as an attack so if you have pacifist off and someone shoots you it triggers PvP
---
Go for elder. Others will explain why
---
Nice, thanks.
---
I won‚Äôt lie that weapon looks really cool (looks like a weed whacker on steroids) but there‚Äôs something about using an actual chainsaw and living out Doom Guy fantasies in FO76.
---
Severe for the Western Revolver if I remember correctly is the mod that says it adds improved damage and critical damage... Looking at the wiki it says it actually adds more damage than the hardened receiver?   I didn't run bloody mess before the update, now I have been experimenting with it. I find it really odd. Sometimes I feel I kill things faster without it. Could be because I replace it with perks that give you crits faster. 
---
I also eat a ton of food, although those buffs shouldn't be affecting my normal damage, just my accuracy (+per food) and critical shot (+10 or 20% crit).  I am also heavily dependant on VATS, as I can't hit the side of a barn without it. 
---
I just have the basic gunslinger perks so that's 30%.   Adrenaline is first rank, but it is awesome once you get a few kills in. 
---
Not sure why I'm having such an easier time killing things than others after the update. 
---
I find that creatures seem easier depending on region, even though they are supposed to be the same level. 
---
I also have a ton of weapons on me, so I also switch often depending on what I run into. I certainly wouldn't try using my pistol on those Fog Crawlers or tough creatures like rad scorpions.
---
Anything that's good. Probably just a two shot and weightless with another random good effect to be honest
---
Or they can leave the map as it's now, my nostalgia just wants them to add the monochrome map in my pipboy.
---
I played it a few times after launch (missed the beta), so it was definitely available for longer than fifteen minutes post launch. Went away pretty quickly though. Left so fast that I began to wonder if I'd imagined it.
---
Go for elder tier first, imo, unless you want to run it multiple times for some legendary that you're probably gonna scrip. Running it multiple times doesn't increase your chances. I don't see how doing it individually will boost your chances, you'll still roll the 3 rolls at elder.. If yer lucky and you'll get 3 rares in one run.
---
I just got to this stage in the quest yesterday. Need to find glowing resin, any ideas about that?
---
I feel you man...
---
What's on second.
---
Mimic (treasure chest with jaws) for a scrap box.
---
Oooh I thought you were limited to 1 rare a day and if you went for elder you just missed out on the other rolls.
---
It‚Äôd be cool if chainsaws would gain you more wood from trees actually. Would make them a legit harvest tool for wood.
---
Who knows. It's fine though.
---
Yeah that's a good idea. Escape artist isn't really needed for a pa heavy
---
Try unequipping and reequipping it.
---
Best event uranium fever and silo's has lots of junk
---
I'm traditional.  Want radioactive gum drops üòä
---
go straight for elder. if you are super lucky you can get all 3 rewards at the same time.
---
Few times I played it, there weren't any issues, but it also was all of us playing PVE. If it weren't for this thread, I still wouldn't know PVE was even an option in that event.
---
Yea I thought that at first too. Getting Elder on your first run rolls the 5, 10, and 80% chance so yea, you can potentially get 3 rares a day on each character that is lvl 50+. Its a real kick in the pants tho when you get nothing. gotta love RNG.
---
Hey thanks. That makes me feel heaps better!
---
gat for everyday use.  magic mini for bosses
---
"Notices full hp bar. OwO what's this?" Instigating 25 25 gauss rifle. I have no regrets.
---
If it makes you feel even better I‚Äôm level 500 and am still scared of doing this so at least when I do it I know you did it first so thank you!!! üòÖ
---
It's not as bad as I feared.  I'm using about 2 - 3 times as much ammo; killing most things in a couple shots/3-round bursts.  I had to make two adjustments:   I use the CSS much more, along with a couple stealth perks, andI  have to be more tactical.  By the latter, I mean doing things such as using cover while reloading, etc.  I never had to consider that before.  
---
I'm glad I didn't have to go through this as in my mid 20-50 range.   I probably would have stopped.   It was difficult enough on my first character.   On my second, I had a bat that mae all the difference in the world, but if melee is nerfed as badly as I hear, that might not help now.     
---
The other difference:  not sure I'll do ACP again.  That was difficult enough before the damage nerf and enemy buff.
---
If you need someone to play with, levelling you up a little easier, I'm level 300+ and could help if that's your bag :)
---
Breach and Clear is a good way
---
I would suggest vampiric weapons. They heal you when you hit an enemy. Vampiric explosive is even better, but beware of splash damage that can kill you.
---
I‚Äôm home and online, ign: draganot
---
My lamp doesn't even project. I've seen it working once and it was so pretty. But now it's just a glowing lump.
---
Level 52 here. At least I can look like a fucking moron well.  :) Glad to be of service.
---
Side note after you hit 300 on 1 character you have access on every character to the legendary perks, still need to rank on the other character but legendary perks from lvl 1 is op
---
yeah sure, that would be nice, gimme 10 mins, I'm making irl food as I just finished putting my children to sleep, PC?
---
Dude, you rolled a magic gun, it's even better.
---
Keep us updated on your drops.
---
We can be morons together ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
As a lvl 500 veteran, I love this patch so much. I am that kind of player who enjoys modding fo4 into a real survival mode where you will face mireluk queen when you first reach sanctuary. This patch finally makes fo76 challenging for me. Soloing daily ops and prime meat events are exciting, and now I can farm exp from anywhere in the map instead of being stuck in the mire/bog previously.
---
I understand the difficulties faced by the low-level players and I wish Beth could try to strike a balance between catering to both the low level / high level players. I hope Beth will not lower the difficulties too much in future patches though as it seems the major view on the sub is that the game is too hard right now.
---
Yeah it was wired. I think it has something to do with maintenance still going on, probably not gonna be done for a few hours.
---
Wait there were more outfits other than the NCR Ranger outfit for Fallout 1st subscribers?
---
Yeah, the community in this game is just so friendly. I mean i've had the occasional jerk, but overall it's like the most wholesome community ive ever experienced. 
---
I love that the devs are leaning into that with the public group systems.
---
I remember when the game was announced griefing was a huge concern and its not really a thing. Theres trap houses but thats more comedy than griefing 
---
Turns out the wasteland is a wholesome friendly space.
---
yeah near deathclaw island they are actual 3D models of fish swimming around, they do look normal and you cannot interact with them
---
Yep give me a few mins, 7am over in the UK, and I'll be on, wanna DM me your gametag?
---
pm me if you want, I'm on the reddit site right now while I eat
---
Thank you. &lt;3 I‚Äôm sorry for going Debbie downer on you there.  Just having a rough week.
---
I didn't even know you could rename weapons. Give me a clue please.
---
I was curios about this myself. Good to know
---
There is a big problem with the game when it comes to survival and variety.As you can see in nearly every post people start throwing out the same suggestions.Get legendaries,mutations,PA and so on.
---
You can‚Äôt even use PA til 15 and you have to Hunt down the pieces to at least get most of a set.The next upgrade is not til 25 and that‚Äôs if you can find those pieces etc.Also not everyone like the feel of PA so being pushed into it would displease them even more.
---
Mutations are not even an option til you get into the 30s even 40s.Again this is dictating a specific type of play.
---
Legendaries are rng based so who knows what you will get and when you will get them etc.
---
They update the forest region a ways back to be more new player and low level player friendly.Now with this update they went in the opposite direction.They have made the game into one that pushed you down specific play styles with specific types of gear,perks and features.
---
vallery galleria signs and caged bulbs, only two things ive gotten on two different toons.
---
If you're on xbox I will help you with supplies.
---
The thing about radiation, that the game actually gets wrong, is that water is actually a good blocker for certain kinds of harmful radiation. It's why a lot of the sea wildlife in the areas following the bombs that were dropped in world war II remained unscathed to the effects of radiation. Unlike the people who actually experienced what they call the flash which slowly gave survivors terminal effects within two years.
---
do uranum fever, collect litterally everything from the dead mole miners, scrap the weapons and the junk they drop, alot of steel drops
---
To rename an item, select it in your Inventory, Stash, or a Workbench, and choose the "Inspect" option. Then, select the "Rename" option to enter and save a custom name for that item. Items can be renamed as many times as you like.
---
Or just buy Bethesda.
---
If physics where involved then you wouldn‚Äôt be able to fit half of the stuff in your inventory or stash box lol
---
That's funny.. Here twixtored it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBfRj\_9yjbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBfRj_9yjbg)
---
I get it every 4-6 months to stock-up on scrap, free-up some space, and get some Atoms. I buy it in the middle of the month so I can get access to free/discounted items for two months vs. one.
---
Mutated octopuss. Irradiated angler fish.  Bloated glowing puffer fish.

/softly/
---
*dont*
---
Haven't received it once, but I do keep getting everything else. Especially vault suit plans.
---
There are the Advanced and Elite NCR Ranger coats. If i remember right, they were in shop around 3 month before Wastelanders hit.
---
I bet it will match the freebie demon Mr. Fuzzy backpack.
---
Why's there no Del Lago?
---
At least you can trade those. It might not be much, but it's something.
---
It gives you th option but if you try to do it you'll get a message saying "pay me or be gone pleb" or something to that effect
---
thats weird, heavy weapon perks dont start unlocking till 30.
---
So you played the game for 30 levels without investing in any damge perks and not finding any heavy weapons ammo, then hit level 30 and heavily invested in heavy weapons.
---
So basically you have a horrible character design anditss some how bethesdas fault? you hve 30 levels to realize what worked and what didnt. wtf dude.
---
Well, they didn't give us a corresponding Elite Gear Helmet either.

What was the FO1st Mr Fuzzy Ride?
---
Dodgy if you're not sneaking and not killing fast is pretty shit now, like if you're fighting super mutants and especially if there's that minigun mutant, your AP Is going to be so fucked. I put action boy and an ap refresh armor peice but you just get lit up so your AP is always down. They should have at least made the AP decease a little less to compensate the stronger and tankier enemies.
---
What would the point of Survival Shortcut be then?
---
&gt; exclusive atom shop discounts
---
Have there been any? Because I know they advertized that, but I've never seen any discounts.
---
i have to run third person when using this gun, for a couple reasons. 1-rarely, if ever, do i have the issue where i cant do anything without bash/holster. 2- way faster firing rate. Dont really like the 3rd lerson view, but with vats its not like i had to aim anyway
---
Well i got from level 101 to 114 in few hours, since all enenies give more xp to me. Im loving it
---
How much you willing to pay for it
---
This! This is why I dont understand why Bethesda doesnt advertise the FO1st free/ FO1st atx items better! They literally lose money because no one know what they're missing. And people keep telling me "but the whole point is the scrap box and sever ". No! For me, the whole point of 1st is cosmetics they advertised in the original listing and have since pulled. Lemme see what's on sale for FO1st members /FO1st ATX exclusive and chances are I'll resubscribe!!!
---
Past 2 days I got nothing but today I got the vault 94 stash plans so that was nice
---
This. Exactly.
---
What's your build, do you consistently use chems and food?
---
You've fully bought in, I don't envy you
---
It means that the negatives associated with hunger and thirst are being removed.You can still gain benefit from food and drink buffs.You will still gain the bonus from rejuvenated for instance if you stay 75% or above the thirst and hunger thresholds.
---
Basically they are killing of the main survival component of the game.Pretty much rendering some perks and negative effects of mutations null and void.
---
It takes like two hours to level up twice and you scrapped Starched Genes? üôÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wham Bam - Super Sledge
---
The Judge - Automatic Handmade
---
Chop Chop - Grognak Axe
---
Ghost Maker - Automatic .50 cal
---
Painbringer - Lever Rifle
---
Pew Pew - Gatlin
---
But you're forgetting most of the rivers in the game are running south, so that water is washing through the toxic valley picking up all those chemicals as it comes?
---
Water is a good blocker to an extent. The water in a reactor pool isnt radioactive unless you get too close to the bottom.  Not sure I'd want to risk it though with all the radioactive dust particles sinking in.
---
It would be cool if they added a fishing mechanic. They could add really rare legendary fish are are hard to catch but rewarding in some way!
---
Shotgun 1 is magic. Bashing is a magic effect
---
Monopoly bad
---
I have brought i  to shit i dont pay for fo first as it overpriced, I dont buy expensive clothes because I dont buy into it, so what are you on about.
---
What fallout 76 has glitches? No way!
---
It‚Äôs the bashing damage, it makes it a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù shotgun. [Here‚Äôs some info on magic weapons](https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs)
---
Isn't that what shooting the cow means?
---
My bad.
---
Srsly, stop shooting my brahmin.
---
Why is the glaive considered good? It looks like the Grognak axe does more dps, no?
---
There *is* a fish model in game, currently unused for anything other than a fancy corpse. Head just north of Point Pleasant, following the river. 
---
Same model as in four, nothing new. Personally, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really enough water on this map at a good depth for us to fight something like that.
---
There were bugs last time? I didnt even notice :(
---
So you don't even need to use bashing for it to help out your stats?
---
Not intuitive but ok...
---
It is almost impossible to swing Grognak‚Äôs Axe when frozen compared to the Glaive
---
Microsoft is also likely to make all of their BGS releases available on Game Pass, so honestly most of the direct profits of this acquisition will likely come from PlayStation/Steam (since PC gamers have access to Game Pass but generally prefer owning their games).
---
Yep. Chasing the dragon of LP. Is it me? Should I always have SG equipped? If so, lolz at this concept.
---
So you unequided your mutation keeping perk and then equided a rad cleaning perk and now you're semi mad at Bethesda because it ended up doing exactly what radaway and deco showers do?
---
If you buy the limited edition book it has the maps in. But I know what you mean when I started playing id get lost loads.
---
Thats one ive been neglecting as of recently but aince one wasteland might so it more
---
You can sell it
---
Right, I see that, but I'm wondering if the time securing a site gets extended between the two scenarios. A 2 player team with 2 players near the device yields an "x2", but will a team of 3 with 2 nearby yield a slower "x2"?
---
I'm not seeing a lot of people having to wait for a full team to get elder status. An extra body is just a potential positive, right?
---
Shotgun 1 has a known bug. So far not fixed by Bethesda.
---
You know who does that?
---
A synth.
---
Probably to force us to spend that gold on the helmet lol
---
Anything that heals rads (except Radsponge) also heals Mutations
---
Yeah, you never ever unequip that, it's the little price to pay to be superhuman.
---
Quad ones with commando perks are also monsters.
---
Furious Teslas can do some ridiculous dps when you chain them.
---
Deco showers and radaway won‚Äôt clear the mutation if you have SG equipped. 
---
Who says LP like ‚Äúwhat rads‚Äù work the same as radaway and deco shower? That‚Äôs an assumption. An assumption of which you‚Äôd be right, but an assumption nonetheless. As is NOT having SG equipped simultaneously with what rads.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Costly price. So what‚Äôs ya sellin? Marsupial? I buy.
---
They only take 6-8 minutes and only give a rare reward once a day, so ppl do them once and that‚Äôs that
---
Making the argument that pistols builds do not suck because your bloody build hits for X amount of damage is a invalid argument.You can do much better damage with a bloody rolling pin than you can a a non bloody one doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good.Pistols are not terrible or even unplayable but they still stink in comparison to where they could be.
---
Yes, thank you. I‚Äôve been logging in and noticing that I‚Äôm taking damage from my explosive guns despite having perks to mitigate/remove that, dying quickly in general, low SPECIAL, low damage output, increased resource drain and low regen, absurdly low carry weight, or items weighing more than they should...   
---
i guess I need to load a blank perk profile into my manager just to unequip everything and then put it back on
---
Great, so the EXISTING event is too buggy, so they're replacing it with an entirely NEW event... ::grabs popcorn:: This gonna be gud.
---
Uhh i do mine everyday 1 time per character 5 characters sir/madam
---
That's actually a good idea, I got tired of reequipping everything but a blank profile will work.
---
Most people can get Elder in a single run, and then after that they‚Äôre mainly just useful for xp/ammo. Just create a public team for Daily Ops though and you can typically get at least one other player which is more than enough to get Elder with about a minute remaining
---
Evil: set player locks to level 0 so anyone with the legendary lockpicking perk will automatically get wanted if it was by accident
---
Exactly how doesn‚Äôt it work? I got an Unyielding Left Leg today with END/weapon weight and my SPECIAL reflects the extra END point when I put it on.
---
Yes, ive had 3. I've tried,  but they all eventually die
---
I kinda wish this game had a minimap for interior locations.
---
It's crazy. When this game came out, I was like God dammit, I gotta deal with being parched and starving. But then when I got to around level 70 ish, I actually like it. I like immersion. It's really weird they are doing this.
---
This has been in the game for a while, but it used to happen VERY rarely. Since the latest update it‚Äôs happened to me three times already. Twice in a single day! Sucks cause you have to close the game completely and restart it to fix the issue or you‚Äôre just blind
---
I thought that the plans were sellable through vendors? I‚Äôve seen people talking about reading plans on other posts
---
Also please don‚Äôt do what I did and buy the Secret Service armor (non-power armor) helmet (before you have the five pieces of armor). It‚Äôs entirely cosmetic and I wear other headwear anyway. 1650 bullion down the shitter...
---
Found the video, thanks; it's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOdT8nXbDdo
---
Good stuff; it looks like Brawling is way way better than Weighted.
---
Its a simple concept: Have ANY mutations? Yes? Then DON'T  USE ANYTHING  WITH RADIATION REDUCTION!!  If not freely use anything with rad in its name.
---
What went wrong was making it a once a day per character thing. 
---
What they should've done is make it so the first time on elder is a 3x chance at an item, and then when you run it again it's only a 1x chance depending on the rank you get.
---
Got room for one more noob im level 21 and will be down to join PSN AssassinsRioT420
---
Last time I became wanted was due to the same thing...picking a lock on a footlocker without realizing the building I was in was part of a workshop.  No one came after me at all.  I begged a higher level guy at a train station to kill me and he did thankfully.  And he stood guard over my loot until I got back there.  Thanked him for it.
---
And it would make more sense than just ripping the wood out of the trunks with our bare hands!
---
I made essentially the same thread a couple of days ago concerning chainsaws and Tools and someone suggested the drill might be used for camp repair, which is also a cool idea.
---
I think you glitched haaaaaardcore.  I've had ''what rads'' since the updaye dropped.  I've also been bathing in rads and subsequently brushing them off as quickly as they fall off with it at rank 2.
---
Haven't lost a single one out of me having all the mutations besides carnivore since i already have herbivore.
---
On ps4, and i gave up on starched genes ages ago.  Just went full mutie and relied on ''sun kissed'' for my rad removal.
---
Of note, ''sun kissed'' never removed a mutation for me either.
---
All of them but the war glaive plan can be traded. Can't even trade the war glaive itself. It's classified as a bullion item, because you can get mods for it with bullion.
---
1st gives enough of an advantage and goodies as it is. Also they make money selling the game, it's not F2P and I really wish people would stop pretending that it is.
---
As someone who got the war glaive already, this worries me.
---
I run [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f139b89&amp;d=s22sq2s32sr2sg2pe0eh2cu2ce0c13s12ir2ib4a72a04l71ls2lt2cm0lg2x73xp3xj3x83le2x13ip2ic0&amp;m=c2f7ba6&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=142834) as a Bloodied Heavy PA. I solo Daiy Ops without issue and tank just about anything this game throws at me. While also dealing great damage. Weapons of choice are Primed TsE and Bloodied FFR .50 cals.
---
The ONLY two pieces of gear you need with this are your weapon of choice and Emergency Protocol on whatever power armor you want to use. That's it.
---
I still find my self trying to open it... lol.
---
I put my fusion generator behind my vendors. I built some conduits around it using the lights and the connectors that go through the walls, the whole thing sort of fits nicely into two foundations and lights up the interior nicely. It's effectively hiding in plain sight. I made it so I could move my camp around and the 'vendor house' is the power house, so I can just hook wires to my buildings and power them up quickly.  
---
I had a similar idea about that monstrosity, with putting the vendors around it on each side, and building something that would show it off and be functonal, but since I got it on my character who probably isn't going to move I havent' tried to do anything with it yet. 
---
I'm curious if it would connect to those metal stairs with the premade grated flooring on it. That would open up a lot of things you could do with it, but this is FO76's build system, so it probably doesn't work that way.
---
I don't sorry. I haven't even tried to build it in my camp yet. It probably does, because it's larger, but I could be wrong about that.
---
Only downside is when your character stands in it, their feet go through the base and the arm clamp and needles don't line up with your character.
---
How is stealth not OP? Most damage, no risk in dying. Come on dude. PA is good but stealth bloodied commando or even other versions are just too good.
---
That‚Äôs odd that‚Äôs it‚Äôs the only thing that can be traded... I‚Äôd understand making the weapon impossible to trade as a way to prevent duping, but preventing the plan from being traded seems a little extreme. Hopefully the Microsoft acquisition will see a more focused look by Bethesda at the duping issue so future content won‚Äôt have to be so severely locked to a player through the ‚ÄúBullion Effect‚Äù
---
That and more negative emotes... "Your Stupid" - "You Stink" - "Noob"
---
If I remember correctly, there was model or texture made for a giant squid in the far harbor dlc. Imagine.
---
It's pretty trash especially since there's only one mode it seems. I still can't believe they haven't added text chat to the game yet when modders did it near fucking launch. They are woefully backwards when it comes to basic features of an online game.
---
That won't work out because you waste too many perk slots for running both builds. Focus on 1.
---
Marigold Pavilion. There's 5(?) spawns for it.
---
Big tree to the east of the lil lake there.
---
made stupid thing by yourself and blame devs for that. seriously?
---
It's scrip not actor's dialogue.
---
Because people have already seen everything they have to offer. Literally just "uplink" every day. Not to mention most of the maps used are trash to navigate. Lookin' at you Burrows and Vault 94.
---
If you want to run pistols run them.It will be much more challenging for you but you can get by.Pistols were never in a good spot in this game and they are still not.Most of these people saying it works great are using legendary effects and very specific effects mixed together to get those results.
---
The Tenderizer still works... Although mine's currently displaying upside down for some reason.
---
Mirelurk Cake with Bloodleaf Aioli, Aged Queen Mirelurk Steak, Deathclaw Steak, and a Sweetroll.
---
Whenever they're there I use the thumbs up and then the heart and hope they understand...
---
Hey thanks for the tips! I do want to free up some INT spots, that‚Äôs why I want to split ways with my TSE
---
Does the generator light up at night?
---
&gt;Am I wrong and daily ops are actually bad? 
---
Can't be wrong when you're having fun mate.
---
I wish I had that problem...I have maybe 1000 caps at lvl160-something...
---
I could do without it. I get some people like it but I am just in it for the gameplay, not to babysit my own character.
---
Their approach to challenge is the laziest approach they could take in general.
---
"Nice CAMP bro, solid girth, I rate 8/10"
---
I wouldn't mind getting the War Glaive. I ran through with my other character and I  got the Vault 94 Jumpsuit and the Vault 94 stash box plans. I don't ever wear the jumpsuits, but that stash box will be cool.
---
I get that too, yeah
---
Maybe you should treat her better.
---
ok bad joke I apologize.....not really
---
words to live by.
---
I think it has something to do with making the locations 'seem' bigger and more complex than they actually are. If they showed you the map, you'd see how simple it really is. Hence no map. Other than that theory I have few more... Maybe the people that make 76 don't honestly realise that people want local map (cause they're young/never played previous Fallouts etc.) and never bothered to implement it. Or it is too hard for them. Or maybe they're about to announce that there's a NEW Item to get from the Brotherhood for gold bullion or something... A sonar like device that shows the local map of caves, vaults, houses and all that. Just like in the previous Fallouts. It's a Pip-boy feature. If they just introduced it as a mod... Maybe with Microsofts cash... Who knows?
---
You can't even do that now, if you dont eat or drink you will just fall to very low health but never die.
---
Elder Rank... 1 run... less then 10 mins total time playing DO.. no reason for me to do it afterwards
---
It seems counter productive. Why not just use a more ammo efficient heavy weapon like a gatling gun?
---
Maybe a chat system similar to runescape. have the overhead chat + the chatbox, and have both toggle-able in options
---
For me Funky Duds doesn't work with all 5 pieces of Heavy Raider armor. I thought it has to be all same armor type and variant, but looks like it also has to be the same armor affix - I had 3 Vanguards and 2 Chameleons.
---
...can I have it?
---
I'd probably change Iron Stomach to Fireproof, and use the Carnivore Mutation to reduce the disease risk of meats. If you're truly set on Shotguns, you'll have to move the 3 Luck points from One Gun Army to 3 Perception points for Skeet Shooter. 
---
If I may offer an alternative however, is to find yourself a Quad Harpoon Gun. If you fit Flechettes into it, it does very comparable shotgun damage (and has similar great short range consistency with VATS), and you won't have to change your build. Its also insanely ammunition efficient, because one Flechette shot gives you back 1-6 harpoons, so as long as you keep looting it back, you don't run out of ammo.
---
Nothing is a kick in the pants, getting double workshop plans is like a kick in the teeth. (had that happen to my alt the first day)
---
V94 is super easy. And the burrows is not that hard either. After 2 runs you should have it figured out
---
Damn yes of course good point re ground pounder!
---
So both of them give you an added 40% reduced weight. Let‚Äôs say your max carrying is around 325 with those equipped that means without them naturally you can only carry 195.
---
Stem packs and all sorts of other things add to weight. So if you‚Äôre carrying around a lot of AID or ammo then that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre heavy.
---
It's not that it's hard, it's just a chore. Like caring for a whole ass person when playing the game. Like why tf I have to feed my character in a game that has NPC's that never eat or sleep.
---
I like those blue lights, I am going to steal that idea, thanks :)
---
Gatling for long range vat sniping and ultracite 5mm collecting in ops. Minigun when fighting huge amounts of mobs or bosses. Gotta admit though never used a 50 cal or lmg before so couldn't comment on them
---
Just be warned, in Bethesdas frothy crusade to cap everything in the game, they added a max number of items you can rename. Not sure what the number is, but I hit it yesterday.
---
I wish.
---
Congrats on the any % most helpful answer WR üòÇ. Appreciate it üëåüèº
---
Yeah I‚Äôm debating just respec-ing my build to be a no PA shotgunner with Secret Service armor time account for the loss of defensive/tank capabilities.
---
I really want that! it looks amazing!
---
I'm 99% sure the 10mm SMG didn't get the "final pass" before release. Too much stuff going on with it.
---
I have a furious explosive I'm getting rid of I'm on pc
---
You want 5 additions. There's no point half-arsing it.
---
As for effects, it doesn't matter that your STR and END are 1. They'll still be 1 even with debuffs.
---
Junkies is one of the top meta picks just behind Bloodied and nowadays likely anti armour explosive or two shot explosive.
---
"Your C.A.M.P could not be placed"
---
I use a **TSE Gatling Gun and it has never steered me wrong. I guess I‚Äôm just getting bored of using the same guns now. I‚Äôve been this built for probably ~90 levels. Which for me was this whole summer. I might just be indecisive in moving to a different build since I‚Äôve grown so comfortable with mine.
---
I'm intrigued.  Tell us more about these "particular words" for which "the British" use AN to add emphasis... they don't happen to all begin with vowels, do they?
---
Psychotats, can't believe people vendor it so cheap. 25 percent damage buff as well as other buffs makes it my go to for killing bosses quick.
---
Resilient robots in a maze left a bad taste in my mouth, but now I am loving it :-)
---
Thanks for the tips! I‚Äôll keep the harpoon gun in mind. I never gave them a fair chance because I always assumed they couldn‚Äôt dish out the damage.
---
They have stated they are looking into making adjustments to make thing easier for mid level players
---
I did not put what was in each room because as an Explorer I like to find out for myself what there is to find.
---
That‚Äôs a thing?
---
thats good
---
Having 3 chars over lvl 200 and one well over 600, i had the luck of having a lot of spare perk cards and levels laying around. My main is still a mixed bloodied build. He uses shotguns, commando and heavy and still is my strongest char. He oneshots pretty persistent in almost every situation and is now surprisingly even more durable than before.
---
My bloodied commando wasnt happy at first. She rolled with a whole wood armor set that made her actually invisible at all times. Ducking in the middle of a SB fight on open field, and beeing just gone to all enemys was normal. She uses her UNY SS set again because with the enemys PER now, it doesn't make a diffrence. But the DR and ER does now. Follow through was enough to bring her back to her old dmg.
---
My bloodied heavy char needed the most changes to keep him durable at low health. I changed a lot perk wise to make the most use out of PA, because his UNY SS set wasnt that great. I had some problems to make the PA reboot perk work. It seemed like it never procs. But while updating my perk loadout mod, it said there was a problem fixed with loadouts legendary perks not working properly when changing sets. After that it started to work well actually. Using it on lvl4 tho.
---
All in all its still easy to kill everything rapidly, and im kinda happy bloodied builds are no easy mode anymore.
---
I don't even have the time to do daily quests. After 3 months of playing finished one main üòÅ. But I know for a fact you can Max both Factions. I envy people who have the time and patience to do it.
---
Amen!
---
&gt; Am I wrong and daily ops are actually bad?
---
Well, as with most things, - YMMV.
---
For me, my build isn't really suitable for the Ops (it's bs that stealth builds have been screwed over here), and my rewards so far have been shockingly bad, which makes me not want to bother continuing with them.
---
Hahah I just want to know if it‚Äôs possible. Good chance I give up on both of them in a week üòÇ
---
Then why not start a fresh and build from the ground up the kind of build that you DO want to play. Levelling is quicker than it use to be (though midgame is tough if you're not prepared).
---
Seems a waste to spend those perk levels on something else that you might change your mind on again later.
---
People use it for killing stuff?!! I use it just to irradiate myself back to bloodied range XD
---
This. I remember the Deliverer in FO4 being able to load up like 12+ shots in VATS on a full AP bar...
---
The super generator? The little pylons on it sorta crackle with blue electricity.
---
The solar panel just has a little green light on the side.
---
My pleasure I only did the B.O.S. side because it is the side most used to obtain the assorted collectable Asylum uniforms.
---
Awh thought there would be a cool effect like tiny blue flames at the edges
---
Why not just use different heavy weapons? They all act differently.
---
Gattling, good dmg ammo efficient
---
50cal great all arounder. No wind up good dps
---
Lmg, thing shreads. Ammo hog. Small clip
---
Flamer, great for clearing rooms hits all enemy's in its stream
---
Ult gat laser, good dmg. Can hold 1k rounds with r3 power user. Super accurate
---
Harpoon, put fetched on it and its an awesome shot gun, you want a quad version
---
Mini gun, your classic heavy. Wind up, shoots real fast. Looks bad ass
---
So many options. Where rifles you really only have 2 choices. And shotguns you have 3. Heavys have so much variety I love it
---
I'm a level 57 max luck pistol build, and I'm starting to sweat.  Still have plenty of upgrades I can get, but it feels pretty low damage. Still able to do most things solo or duo, but for instance it takes forever to chunk down a protectron. 
---
Until I can't do daily ops though, imma keep having fun!
---
The pipe must flow.
---
Fighting against windmills.
---
It's tough but it can be managed.

---
Stuff I wrote in this post helped me a lot.
---
TL;DR is get the best possible gear fully modded you can for the level you're at (not even legendaries) and avoid tanky enemies like super mutants and robots.
---
Oh, awesome! So super good for DO runs. Thanks for the info!
---
‚Ä¢ I keep strength for the mass amounts of stims/radx-way I carry to free up stash for legendary scrip. 
---
‚Ä¢ will I see a large difference in damage if I scale down rifleman perks to I/II/II?
---
‚Ä¢ Gunsmith V is pretty much just there to keep my TSE Lever from dying out every 20 shots, looking to part ways with it anyways. Nerd Rage wasn‚Äôt in my horizon though since I‚Äôm a high health build right now, but could use some insight on how it could help me. 
---
‚Ä¢ Sneak III, is that nerfed at all in One Wasteland or is that only in daily ops?? I do want to increase Adrenaline so I‚Äôll look into that. 
---
‚Ä¢ CHA is at 5 to assure 3inspirational/strangenumbers/travelagent, would tenderizer make a big enough impact in your opinion??
---
‚Ä¢ Class freak I‚Äôll have to try without cause I‚Äôve had it equipped since acquiring mutations
---
‚Ä¢ I have heard there‚Äôs a bug with Taking one for the team, I could be wrong but doesn‚Äôt it trigger wanted even if you‚Äôre in pacifist?
---
Thanks for your advice by the way
---
I would do the same thing, but use voice chat after sending a message, saying in game chat and full on act like a customer
---
Been that way forever, not sure if it's actually a bug or a design choice. Don't recall seeing any CM responses on it.
---
What duping is there?
---
The .45 pipe pistol is a revolver, and can be modded with a silencer (contrary to physics). Like Zathrus said, if there's a precedent in place, there's no reason the .44 shouldn't also benefit.
---
I'll do it a few times for scrip, but then I look at the clock and my level progress bar and think "Better get my ass to Westek".
---
GL?
---
Daily's for the long run. Now that there free fast travel to crater and foundation no problem. I checked steam achievements some time ago and 2-3% had friends crater or foundation unlocked.
---
You do not need to be 50 lvl to use legendary perks. They are available since lvl 1.
---
Haha really?
---
Yeah they changed how damage is calculated. It's now additive instead of multiplicative. So everything got nerfed. Though in the meta stand point everything's pretty much the same, the gaps are just smaller. Melee felt it the hardest
---
Enemies now scale to your level
---
Legendary perks where added
---
Lol yeah i get that but i had a quest object under a house went down and had to walk through mud to get to the terminal, it was weird. Looks like im stuck in the mud half the time.
---
What do you mean? There‚Äôs all kinds of duping ranging from things like serums to presents to caps to weapons and more. It‚Äôs really damaged the in-game economy of Fallout 76 (Not saying it‚Äôs destroyed it, just hasn‚Äôt done it any favors) and for players that wish to play legitimately, has been a large issue since the game was released almost 2 years ago. Multiple duplication methods exist as well, some having been patched out but a lot haven‚Äôt
---
are the daily‚Äôs in crater and foundation the fastest way you know of? Also, I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs a point in each quest line where it tells me I have to pick a side right? Don‚Äôt want to accidentally lose one side
---
One thing I would also add - run leader of the pack as often as you can. You now get legendaries that will scale to your level. Try to get vampiric weapons and regenerating armor from this event - it will really help with the sustain.
---
I use t65 and a be1p gat plas and only thing i really need is stabalized
---
Maybe it's a parallel world that just looks identical.
---
No, you have it correct. If you don‚Äôt have any 1 point cards available, it won‚Äôt show you as having available perk points in strength
---
These days people can get their ass kicked and according to this sub some gey their ass kicked all the time.
---
One Wasteland is poorly balanced to low level players.
---
So meta wise the whole Junkies or bloodied explosive weapons still run the show eh? And guessing leather armour is still meta too for sneak? Even the chinese stealth suit doesnt help? (If that actually got released in wastelanders?)
---
And a damage nerf to everything eh? I bet pistol users are loving that right now, dang..
---
Dupes exist in the game now?
---
Every time I hear or see this dumbass comment it makes me laugh. Using this as a rebuttal just goes to show the blatant ignorance in this fucking game lmao. Nuclear winter is a battle royal it‚Äôs not survival pvp there was a dedicated game mode but now it‚Äôs gone survival pvp was easier back then in normal adventure mode but now it‚Äôs gone. But no this baby ass community is to scared to shoot at each other in a fallout game lmfao. Even if anybody wanted to play nuclear winter it‚Äôs absolute dogshit aswell as nobody plays it either they literally made it so you can play it with less than 52 people which defeats the purpose entirely smh
---
For a single shot Harpoon gun, definitely, in which you spend so much time reloading. 4 Flechette Shots however, is ample amount of damage. Before the One Wasteland update, it would routinely one shot the chest of most filler enemies, but with the update, the 100 level filler enemies require two shots (barring lag and such) - which is still pretty good efficiency for a non Junkies/Bloodied build. 
---
Admittedly its not perfect, as it has a noteworthy dip in flight curve for long range shots, and shooting it outside of VATS seems to have less concentrated damage.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs been around since essentially the BETA but has become more of an issue as people have found new ways to exploit the game
---
Ouch, so I guess killing the queen isnt easy anymore? Remember people used to kill that thing in 30 seconds with a two-shot minigun lol
---
Did armour values also see a nerf as well as damage produced?
---
yes but I mean for weapon weight only cause the 2 pieces give me 40% weapon weight reduction with both of them I have 558/263 weight but when I remove the 2 pieces of legendary gear which only reduce weapon weight and I only have a shotgun and a camera in my inventory and my weight goes to 695/263
---
I know about aid and junk I have other armor pieces that reduce the weight of aid items and junk items but weight shouldnt spike up like that while im only carrying a shotgun and camera
---
A Spookily Spectacular Suggestion for sure.
---
Yes, these are exactly my perks as well, plus a bit of Bloody mess for flavoring...
---
It's sad isn't it? Those weapons premiered with wastelanders and they're still broken. (Gauss rifle was broken since launch!!!) What the fuck can we even do? I have been screaming my lungs out since forever..to the point where I get downvoted. Jeff Gardiner. The lead behind 76, he has a Twitter, spam him, spam the forums too...
---
Use a different gun to get ammo for your main gun. I just flew through 40-50, I have no idea what sort of challenges you're facing that are insurmountable.
---
Stealth was definitely hurt due to there being higher level enemies (which equals higher perception for said enemies) but it‚Äôs still definitely a viable build and a lot of people still use it. Bethesda also has plans to make a new type of Daily Ops in the future where it will be more appealing to stealth builds as enemies won‚Äôt have ‚ÄúPiercing Gaze‚Äù
---
Dumbass lol, simply put nuclear winter is pvp which is true. Whether its what you want, its still a dedicated pvp mode, so resorting to insults straight away just show you level of intelligence.
---
All the fucking time.   76 is a mess of menu.  Oh I need to fast travel *pip boy* fuck *opens map.*
---
That is a maddening oversight in my opinion. Glad I clicked on this post to find this out.
---
Queen is still easy to kill. It takes a little longer, but not much. And she lands more now.
---
I dont know if armor got nerfed, but I would imagine that it's counted the same way as DMG, so yes.
---
High level players should not have problems to survive.
---
That‚Äôs the problem with Bethesda games,They always let you be and get everything or at least to a high extent.Raider and settler quests should have had a trade off with them.There should have been consequences for choosing one over the other and for keeping all the gold.Instead you lost a small amount of rep you could make back in a week or so.
---
"I like the smell of napalm in the morning."
---
Biv-fest!
---
Hey try the gatling plasma, it's pretty awesome. I like ur build but for more damage u need tenderizer in charisma!
---
If you're running an explosive weapon, then I definitely recommend moving points around to fit Demo Expert in there.
---
That event gives 100+ pre war money and this week one of the weekly challenges is to scrap 100 pre war money.
---
Another idea: it's meat week, with one rank of butchers bounty I got from a perk pack, super duper 3 and hard bargain 3, I manage to cook up enough meat to juice a vendor for all 1400 caps for the day. Depends how many times you can run it but it's basically constant. 
---
After meat week is over, running uranium fever and selling all the weapons (gauntlets and guns) and glowing meat steak from it, will pretty much clean out a vendor.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love my flaming war glaive. Can't wait to fonally get my first legendary.
---
But getting the plans for a second time on the same character is painful.
---
Thank you for informing me! Much appreciate!
---
I do mine everyday once. Only get 1 chance at rare rewards a day. I either solo it or get my mates in
---
Yes please. Even the current stash skins would be nice to use.  
---
But, It would be better if it was an FO1ST exclusive skin, as per the item it's for.  
---
Maybe something with "ScrapBox, almost 7.6 Billion uses" (as per the recent buy-out)
---
Not hard to switch between Full Health and Bloodied PA Heavy, really just switchn perk loadout and a PA torso with emergency protocols
---
np
---
Ive got demo expert i replaced gunsmith
---
good, going to have a go then
---
V94 is harder for me after having visual memory from the raid.they connected it all in a different way and got lost twice lol.
---
Okay. I'm just providing feedback based on the build you posted.
---
Also, I'd drop Radicool, Travel Agent, and Escape Artist.
---
I'm holding out for some new Halloween related items, particularly a Survival Tent skin.
---
Bethesda is developing a new mode for Daily Ops that is less focused on running from Point A to B, B to C and so on. Instead it will be more stationary (probably some sort of wave based Op) with a different default mutation than ‚Äúpiercing gaze‚Äù so stealth builds will be more viable in Ops
---
I hope other Ops in the future are as simple as this. Sure, it's easy to solo for someone who knows the layout but for a team of randoms comprised of people who never really explored these areas, it's a good challenge. 
---
The ammo gained is pretty good, too! Just hope they upped the Ultracite 2mm EC ammo drops on mobs killed.
---
I did that multiple times today, I was using a B.E. LMG, B.E. Flamer and a V.E. Fixer. I think the Blood Eagles in Vault 94 and the Super Mutant  (Galleria or Mine) are the best one for Daily Ops. I just hate when I'm soloing it seems that the damn uplinks are much slower than with a team.
---
Just an atom shop item but like all of them they rotate. FO1st is exactly the same items rotate and like i said its September Christmas is a long way off.
---
Just claim gorge junkyard. It's the easiest workshop to claim, set up black tit extractor, lock it, go about your day and check in every half hour or so. Couple hours should give you plenty. You'll need acid to smelt the ore.
---
Im getting rid of escape artist but i sometime switch to melee for certain scenarios and the extra carry weight is nice
---
Camp Adams. It's a range just up the hill a bit. Opposite end of the camp from the Mr Handy.
---
I imagine players are also preoccupied with running Meat Week events right now. I bet daily ops picks up again afterwards.
---
Uh... burning mine/black water?... why u at welch?
---
I've stayed away simply because its recommend level 50 and I don't like getting carried. After what happen yesterday at prime cuts events its sort of put me of the events all together.
---
Why is me insulting you making you go baby wa wa mode??? Lmao
---
We are a wonderful bunch of people (most of the time). Welcome!
---
Wiah the responder one would come back already
---
flyboy clothes has flashlight on the chest, someone think it will be cool to make it easiest as possible and put that effect on helmet and not clothes.... they literary put 0 effort
---
Its not it just shows your level of intelligence. So have a good day.
---
Please don't add more trash to allready trash filled legendary  loot pool.
---
Burning mine/Black water?.. why u at welch?... also you do know it can be mined right? Workshops have nodes for resource extrators
---
Thank you very much I was stressing I‚Äôd wasted a perk
---
Same here last 3 days nothing
---
Btw herd mentality is mandatory now due to public teams.
---
No problem, I‚Äôd recommend though that you either get a 1-point card to fill that slot or move the point into another SPECIAL slot (assuming you‚Äôre lvl 50+)
---
If physics were involved then my combat rifle wouldn't weigh as much as a fully modded fat man!
---
Preferably with free gloves and disease cure, wouldn't want to help spread a pandemic, like the Scorched one currently doing its rounds. Just saying.
---
Lol I‚Äôm level 512, I‚Äôve just used up all my points trying different builds and found that being able to PVP is the most important to me. 500 points later
---
Maybe they're just some big-ass eggs!
---
Well at least you realized your true potential in the end, even if it took about 400 more levels then the average player üòÇ
---
If a player camp has a restroom, I leave I.O.U toilet paper in it.
---
Yeah bloodied and junkies are still top dog. Aa is now nipping at their heels though. Explosive or ffr is still best for second.
---
Any armour is fine for stealth, they fixed the shadow mod on all armours. Uny anything is best for stealth thanks to the stat boosts
---
Stealth suit is out. And it's a decent piece for nuke zones, better than the haz mat since it has some Dr and stealth. But uny is still begter
---
Pa users got. A big blessing with the legendary perk electrical absorption. Since it can charge your cores and heal you when hit with an energy attack
---
Yeah pistol users are not thrilled, though tank killer works for them now so that's good.
---
Some people, like myself, are loving the update. Others mainly food builds, are not having a good time
---
If you're not running low health with Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction, you're just not going to be doing as much damage as you could be doing. Even with a weapon like two shot, Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction will allow you to do more damage than you would without them.
---
I need more Enclave related content, skins and CAMP items too.  
---
Screw the PoS, I mean BoS, a bunch of power crazy tech hoarders.
---
Haha, *oh boy*...
---
Queen is actually easier to kill since you can now break her wings and force her to stay grounded
---
That would be nice.
---
Ah right. The FO1st stuff doesn't seem to rotate that much, not nearly as quickly as the Atom Shop stuff. It's been six months since there was a survival tent skin.
---
You've got 15 strength, Calibrated Shocks, and Batteries Included. How much more carry weight do you need?
---
And... why melee? Seriously? Just shoot things. They die. Saving a little bit of weapon degradation or ammo just isn't a good enough reason to allocate perk points for a "sometimes I do this thing" perk.
---
If youbreally want it, keep the perk then; but swap to it when needed.
---
Or the little camp xerox machine inside a heart.
---
Using the event team buff and tagging every enemy to get the xp and the canned meat stew i had built up occasionally as i dont have tons. With a consistent 4 person team and hitting all the ads it adds up real fast with the prime meats event. Some of the ads are 200+ each depending on the location. Just need to hit them to get the xp not take them down yourself. Now there were some shared cards that im not familiar with as i dont generally play in a group so i have lone wanderer equipped. But again they weren‚Äôt in my group the whole time either. When there wasnt a prime meats event i was doing another quick one to keep the xp flowing. Super mutants ave 100+ per kill so i did try to do jail break or the mad dog at the dam one as that one is fast and 1000+ is easy to get real  fast. i didnt add it all up but but it was substantial each time. And dailies or any side quests as they also give a decent amount pretty quick. Some were close to 1000 just for completions not including the kills. Once i had a rhythm going it went real fast. It wasnt an hour or two but a solid 4-5 per day to gain 18 levels.
---
Local map was kinda not that great anyway in a lot of places, it was pretty hard to read, but do I ever miss having the main map in the pip-boy.
---
Remember it will cost you 1 legendary coin to un-equip a legendary perk card
---
Yes they need a new engine but The creation engine is better for their style of game. the unreal engine won't do their game justice. I don't know the in and outs of it but I small google search and you'll find it. I even think bethesda has said something on it. off memory it is to do with the players interaction with the world and with everything being entities execpt structures.
---
Go straight for elder. You get exactly the same chances to get rewards either way. Once I got very lucky and got three rewards from one elder run, so it's possible. Other times, I did not get anything, it can also happen.
---
I agree, pistols are missing something special about them. Stagger could of been their main focus or some perk card that removes 40% armor called Hollow Points for 2 seconds.
---
Another good idea is that pistols can fall in line as a support weapon more than a damage dealing weapon. Stagger effects, 5-10% to completely stun a target for 2 seconds, disarm an enemy weapon momentarily, "Attack Command:" hits increase VATS/critical shot damage to enemy by 5% for everyone. So many ideas for team work play. With these kind of ideas, pistol users can fit right in with the rest of them without needing to deal a lot of damage. This game needs more support roles than just a medic. "Tag Em: Pistol shots mark enemies for 30 seconds and increases VATS accuracy by 5%" "Give Them Hell: Pistol shots restores AP to team."
---
I‚Äôm not running a low health build though. I try to keep my health as high as possible and don‚Äôt even mess with bloodied on this toon
---
Caps are pretty useless though. If they were going to increase anything it should be scrip and treasury notes
---
I got 3 old man winter PA masks. Tell me about it.
---
I missed the Faschnact event and didn't even know that was a thing. But I feel for you.
---
I haven't had it happen once and I've been playing for almost a year.
---
If it doesn't give me milk, it must be defective.
---
So I'm just helping you out.
---
I have a problem with these cloaking enemies, where they begin shooting at me 2-3 seconds before de-cloaking.
---
I'm not bloodied and can take the hits, but this annoys me as the cloak is supposed to come off if they begin shooting.
---
Other than that I do like the Ops, just wish they would let me have a chance for the rare rewards more than once a day.
---
In my 200 hours of playing, I've never been attacked by players. Always hostile NPCs plinking at my camp. 
---
I set up near New Gad, super mutants shoot at my roof windmills, I artillery strike them.
---
In my 1.2k hours my vase had never been destroyed by greifers. And I was around when people could just shoot your base and break it
---
My base has been destroyed 1 time recently when loading in to a already nuked region. That was a bummer
---
Serendipity+Ricochette+Dodgy+Lone Wandere+Blocker and you survive everything with your bloodied stealth commando.
---
I tanked mine even more by adding Endurance with the new legendary perks to have Life Giver + Rejuvinated.
---
Oh SHIT son, isn't that from The Pitt? That cool as fuck I haven't thought of that weapon in years
---
That too. Though I don't use scrip because I've never gotten anything good. And I've always got too many treasury notes to turn in. But a general increase in all currency limits would be a good idea.
---
Rule 10 trading is not allowed her
---
Go to r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 without the periods for all your trading needs
---
I'm at level 250 currently, and I've had my base destroyed only once, I had built my base bit too close to the monogah mines so it got wiped in the blast wave.
---
The better solution is to make bulk ammo packs and have vendors sell those for caps. Idk, 1,000 rounds for 500-1000 caps. Then people will be constantly strapped for cash. Doesn't have to be EVERY ammo, just a couple semi-popular types.
---
You wanted tips to improve damage and I'm providing them. I get why low-health isn't an attractive option for some people. And I'm sad to say it but low-health builds are still king of dps.
---
But, if you're intent to stay full-health, I recommend a Two Shot, Anti-Armor, or Junkie's Explosive weapon.
---
That's a good idea. I've never got enough ammo and if this was a thing, I'd be fine!
---
Precisely
---
Never, and I've been playing since launch. The worst ive had is someone come in and pick the locks of my water purifiers and hang around trying to initiate PvP. In the end I just reloged into a different server.
---
It can't be traded. You have to get max with the settlers for it
---
Alot of carry weight with how limited the stash is and im not spending 15$ a month for fallout 1st just for a scrap box 
---
And why melee because its fun and i dont want to go up to a enemy and bash them when the resilient mutation is on for the daily ops
---
If i remember correctly,thing that use gold bullion can't be sell or give to other player.
---
AA Gatling gun is better than AA Minigun, but a Vampires Minigun is better than Vampires Gatling gun.
---
Gatling gun has a bigger single bullet punch, so use that to kill enemies.
---
Minigun is better for effects that doesn't care about actual damage, like Vampires and crippling enemies (need perk).
---
It was the only one untradeable. Just like the War Glave. At least you got a plan. The power armor mask isn't even max lvl. It's lvl 30 I think and only for the T-51 B I believe.
---
Dang that sucks, I really didn‚Äôt want to grind that out for weeks. Thanks for telling tho üòÅ
---
I couldn't agree more... At the moment I just kinda use the camp emote and then the heart emote after, I think it gets the point across but it's a hassle
---
me and my mates were level 13 when the update dropped on new characters, were level 25 now with little to no issues, its actually been a lot more fun than it used to be
---
the only thing we ran from was a legendary scorchbeast because of how little damage we were doing, considering our levels that was appropriate
---
it was hilarious when we stepped into the prison thinking we could have a go, i got sniped in the shoulder and stumbled, one mate got one shot in the head, i got finished off, the other one saw all this and walked off, it was great
---
Tomorrow?
---
As someone who was in your exact same position all I can say is, go for it. To me, the best thing this update brought were the Legendary Specials, it is 100% possible to rock a hybrid build without the need of swapping perks too much or loosing special allocations. Mind you, I have maxed 4 Legendary Specials so it is grindy as hell to get to that point but boy oh boy it is SO.MUCH.FUN. I dumped my Gauss Minigun since I found a better Minigun anyway and the ammo weight of 2mm is just offensive and forces you to take Batteries included if you intend to keep your Gauss Mini well fed.
---
Ok so, shotguns, I know it‚Äôs a bit shitty to depend on a bug but I highly recommend a magic shotgun, roll. Junkies or 33VATS if you can on your Gauss Shotguns, using VATS is just straight up cheating because of how good they become and the range it acquires(when it‚Äôs not missing at 95% due to another bug), the better your shotgun rolls the more you can get away with not equipping shotgun main perks, for me, a B/40 bash Gauss Shotgun is consistently one-shoting every enemy in Daily Ops and one to two shoting lvl100 tanky mobs, you still will struggle from time to time against the more elite creatures such as Behemoth or Mirelurk Queen but that‚Äôs normal.
---
I used to be a Bloodied Heavy PA main, so in my perks (to make shotguns work) I took away 1 heavy guns and put master shotgunner, along with bloody mess and believe it or not, that was performing already godlike to me. I strongly recommend using Perk Manager as that turns Legendary Specials in the ultimate Be Whatever You Want user. Right now I‚Äôm level 487 and so very close to my Heavy/Shotgun/Commando build(PA optional)
---
Didn‚Äôt get a friend request
---
2500hrs in and it‚Äôs never happened. Other than loading into nuke zones a few times, the only time it got close to being attacked was when some player threw an artillery grenade into my camp. This was back when players could damage your camps easily. I just server hopped before the first shell even hit
---
Bethesda next month: "Fixed a bug where players received second Warglaive plans that should not have dropped."
---
1: It is possible, yes.  Always do the Dailies for both locations.  Another batch of advice is Settlers around the entire map of Appalachia tend to thank you for killing enemies attacking them, which also boost the Rep Meter.  But ofc by a small bit of it.
---
2: Regardless of choosing, you get both Bullion access.  However, if you want the Chinese Stealth Suit, do the Settlers Questline, which gives you plans, from the mission.
---
3: Not at all, unless you kill the members of the faction (at least once, at one point.  I could be wrong.).
---
they changed how damage is calculated. It's now additive instead of multiplicative. So everything got nerfed. Though in the meta stand point everything's pretty much the same, the gaps are just smaller. Melee felt it the hardest
---
Can we get like 100+  emotes? Who needs chat anyway.
---
I'd rather chat than emotes but slim chance.
---
i feel your pain. i accidentally scrapped my spec ops outfit because i was scrapping stuff on a workbench during the scrounge/exit part of the op and didn't know i had already been given the rewards since i hadn't backed out yet
---
No please, no Dirndls in Fallout.
---
I‚Äôve only seen it once. Figured it would just be static.
---
Can you still make cramburgers
---
I don't own Fo1st either. I feel you, weight management is a thing. But still... 15 strength, calibrated shocks, and a weight perk for your weapons and ammo should be more than enough.
---
For the daily op, you're going to be going up to them on either case. Why bother with half-specing a character for melee when you can just bash to finish them with any shooting build. The most important thing in a Daily Op is how well you handle the damage while sitting on the control point. With Resilient active, you just need to tank more as any second spent running up to enemies is a second wasted no capturing the objective.
---
this is seriously moronic that this "bug" is still a thing. not only do we have to waste our time buy 200 gold per day to save up in hopes to get this gun. Then you go to use it and the game is like GOTCHA B!tCH! you cant make the ammo. Ive been looking for the damn normal guass prime plan now a month with no luck sense buying the guass mini prime stuff doesnt bother to teach me how to make the GD ammo.
---
I still hate it but I'm over it.
---
Rad Sponge, another card based Rad cleaner doesn't get rid of mutations so assuming another card doesn't do it too was a fair one.
---
The best time ofe with randoms was 8:01
---
Imgur and link sounds like a terrible christian comedy duo.
---
Not really half specing since its 1 perk that benefits both builds and since i was a melee build for my first 100 levels or so just doesn't feel right getting rid of the perks
---
True that...as long as you don't get dosconnected
---
Happened to me once, about a year and a half ago or so, might have been longer than that actually.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I took a wrong turn in the Burrows and couldnt for the life of me find a way back to the group and they wound up doing that entire section of uplink without me. By sheer dumb luck though I was in the right place for the next part so by the time theyd gotten to that part I had a head start. I dont know that i redeemed myself but i didnt feel like a total failure. These dungeons in the ops are horribly easy to get disorientated, specially if you are directionally challenged like me
---
Good question! Would love to hear your guys weapon names as well. Have 4 chars and my favorites are:
---
The Bangstick 2.0, a quad gauss shotgun
---
Nosferatu, my VE Fixer
---
The Scorchbeast King, a classic BE gatling plasma
---
Boom Boom Pow, a B25 gatling gun
---
The Last Minute, my BE tesla legacy
---
And also "The 'ol Reliable", my trusty (well not that trusty anymore) 10mm üòÜ
---
Well, yeah I mostly invested in things like crafting perks to be able to craft whatever gun plan I found to experiment and just kind of got by with normal weapon damage combined with sneak multipliers not to mention pumped a shit ton of points into endurance thinking it was going to work like Fallout 4's perk tree where after a certain level of endurance I'd unlock the cannibal perk at least the first level of the perk but instead found out that it would only show up at level 12. So essentially the first 12 levels are mostly endurance. Eventually, I got bored of those weapons and found a 50 cal machine gun, ammo converter'd my other shit and well, just sort of rolled with that and jumped to other heavies like the gatling laser despite how nonexistent cores ended up being so, I just want back to 50 cal and whenever I ran out of ammo, I'd just go raid a low level area for more junk.  
---
Now, this was just fine because with low level scorched and other things it just didn't matter. You be able to pump a round into their head and they'd just die because One Wasteland wasn't implemented and continue to scavenge for junk to convert into ammo with little to no problem.  
---
I just sort of assumed Bethesda knew what people expected from the modern MMO design and would have a competent system to respec but I guess I expected too much from a company that designs primarily single-player games to know how MMO's function in 2020 and yes, incompetent game design *is* Bethesda's fault. Not all players are going to look up guides for meta builds. Players are going to make mistakes. We should be able to reverse those mistakes via a respec.
---
Well, in the end, it's your buidl and your call. I'm just saying it doesn't help a heavy gunner in power armor survive hits or deal damage.
---
If they're still in the pip boy then you haven't turned them in. Go to crater and talk to wren or the one by the bus.
---
That was you?
---
Only once because a friend launched a Nuke.
---
Rad Sponge clears rads. It's also a card just like the Legendary Perk.
---
You can test it it. Simply shot an enemy with stealth, then wait 1-2 seconds and shoot again. You see a big difference in the shown damage numbers.
---
The delay sadly makes it useful only for bosses. If you combine it with the Suppressor perk, it wont proc at all most of the time.
---
As an update from a fairly casual player, it's mixed.  I'm mostly a rifle build with some in energy, heavy guns and shotguns for variety.  I've found that mobs of ferals and molerats that I encountered are not any harder than before really...when I had them on the east side of the map.  I am overall going through more ammo than before but not by a huge amount.  My playstyle is still the same and it's still working.  I was using a tesla rifle before for mobs which was awesome and it still rocks for mobs.  I took out a behemoth tonight with a .45 lever action rifle but I used over 500 rounds to do it and had to flip to a .50 cal sniper to finish it off because I ran out of ammo.  I don't have any amazing weapons (a stalkers tesla, furious grognak axe, just a regular lever action, a regular but modified .50 sniper and a two shot pump shotgun) but I'm getting along largely the same as before.  I fought one scorchbeast (I'm level 87, it was level 75) that was pretty easy to take down, and one level 100 sheepsquatch that was a pretty tough fight along with the bullet sponge behemoth as well for the big tough enemies.  Deathclaws are still pushovers.  So overall I like having levelled enemies all over the map, the tougher enemies seem tougher than before to me overall (except deathclaws and that scorchbeast) and I'm not running out of ammo very often.  Armour is breaking quicker though.
---
Lol! Are you still friends?
---
I'm tired of all the neat and clean &amp; high tech items, too far from the theme of the game. More nuka cola things, more things with derelict written all over them. I think I'm in the minority here however.
---
Yep.  Happened like...  5 months ago I think.
---
Me too because then Mappalachia 2.0 would have images to plot points onto for interior maps üëÄ
---
Plus I usually gain at least 1 lvl/ day. At that rate a month is a lot of perk points, and who cares if you end up moving 2 or 3 later on? It's a decent idea. There are lots of perks that we only use for a while and then switch up.
---
Pretty much invincible anyways and kill everything in about a second or 2 and you could say the same about any weight reduction perk
---
&gt; it looks like Brawling is way way better than Weighted. 
---
Keep in mind this was before the recent change in damage calculations. I wouldn't be surprised to find that Weighted is better now than it was then (and maybe even better than Brawling if the latter now behaves like all the other damage buffs and merely adds 10% of base damage), seeing as armor penetration as a whole is now relatively more usefull than it was before those changes.
---
I've always used an ult gat laser. They are supper ammo efficient, and are great sb killing guns. Holding 1k rounds per core, sure accurate, and good damage. They are a very under appreciated weapon. Flamers are also hugely underlooked
---
That‚Äôs hardly cheating now. You‚Äôre only accepting a gift from another kind soul.
---
Ouch.. one second less and you would have gotten elder.. did a 8:00 exactly once.
---
I really want weapon flashlights too
---
I got into flamers earlier in the week.. damn they are good.. now carry a vampires as a get out of shit weapon.
---
Fallout 1st is worth it just for the atoms. I don‚Äôt use them however - I just bought it for the Scrapbox and only the scrapbox.
---
I know, thats why it hurts so much.
---
Only my brahmin every day
---
Hey man sorry only just saw your comment! I'm on pc unfortunately no crossplay :/ good luck in the wasteland though
---
Until you can effectively farm or craft lots of ammo, a gatling gun is going to be your best friend as a heavy weapons user. The gatling gun shoots 5mm ammo with a high damage-per-bullet ratio which makes it very easy on ammo consumption, and since miniguns also use 5mm you tend to pick it up in lots of 200-500 rounds at a time. 500 rounds will last a long time with a gatling gun. It takes me anywhere from 5-10 rounds to kill a leveled super mutant, for example.
---
You can get tons of black titanium by killing mole miners. They drop 'miner suit scrap' which contains black titanium if you take it to a scrap bench. Lots of mole miners at Welch and Blackwater Mine. If you see the Uranium Fever event pop up, join in for dozens of mole miners. You don't even have to kill them, lots of players will show up and do the killing for you, just provide backup for the higher level players and tag the enemies so you get some loot.
---
Are you on PC? If so, I can craft you a gatling gun and hook you up with some ammo and black titanium.
---
as a fact they are slower solo, its sucks. makes 4-person ops breeze by if everyone is on the level.
---
You‚Äôre at the stage of your training where enemy the health curve shoots straight up into the sky! Find a good melee weapon, and SHOW THEM HOW UNCLE SAM DEALS WITH COMMIE MAGGOTS!
---
Take off any melee related cards you have and attempt to fight level 50s with a shitty serrated machete or board trying to kill enemies with guns to try to take and use their guns against them and only finding at most 12 shotgun rounds on their corpses that are barely enough to kill one enemy because of the new shitty scaling. Especially in camps with enemies that all have guns that are all level 50 and will proceed to all shoot you while you try to run in with your shitty melee with no damage and shit durability when the enemy is able to kill you in a few seconds.  
---
All while you're trying to find somewhere to search for junk to convert into actual ammo except you can't because every single enemy is 50 now.  
---
It will be so fun.  
---
Trust me.
---
Happens less frequently these days but my character still hops out of his power armor and is straight up in his underwear for a few seconds sometimes.  Used to happen almost every time I got in or out.
---
Personally I only use PA for a few select things anymore. If you are pretty much always in it though, carrying around 20+ pounds worth of armor does seem silly.
---
Hey it didn‚Äôt get me down! Actually made me laugh :) I hope your week gets better though
---
No you don't need to be in their faction, none of the power armor has requirements like that. But stay away from raider armor anyway it's the worst PA. You get the excavator armor at lvl25 which is +100 carry weight, and if you want a jet pack, jump around to player vendors and see if you can find a good deal on one. T45 t51b t60, all better than raider. You get the ultracite PA for free in the brotherhood questline. 
---
Also note that all PA jetpack mods require 5 violet flux and 5 cobalt or crimson I forget. At low level these are hard to come by.
---
I have both a Vamp's. 50 cal and a Vamp's Gat Laser. The Ma Duece has better damage, but with Power User I get more shots with my GatLaz. Also I can pop the low core in my PA and using electrical absorption, I can recharge the cells on the go. Plus taking over the workshop at a power plant allows you to use the fusion core extractor to make you 3 cores every 15-20 minutes.
---
My camp has only been destroyed once cause i wanted to see what a nuke did to it. SPOILER ALERT! It destroyed it.
---
I dont get it either ....
---
You can just use a magic shotgun in vats and you won‚Äôt have to change any perk cards. I‚Äôm a heavy gunner but use a combat shotgun for running around, also recently I put 3 perks into perception and got the first rank of each commando perk to use this JE combat rifle I got. I use the big guns for boss fights but I like to switch it up
---
I'm not advocating against your way of doing things, i just gravitate towards cheeze and always look for that "how do i solo this" angle :p
---
And yeah, still a ways to go for me as well, good luck out there :)
---
Silos for lead....the gyms
---
Carnivore here, as you might guess the use is that we eat them. It's meat that doesn't spoil, that's very handy.
---
I‚Äôm loving the daily ops for farming legendaries, haven‚Äôt got anything great yet but it will happen:)
---
It just sucks when you run into a squatch and be like ‚Äúyeah, I don‚Äôt want to deal with this right now‚Äù :/
---
Like, my heavy could just hold down the left mouse button for a bit and be done with it, but my pirate guy starts to struggle on the tanky ones.
---
I do them once to get elder and that‚Äôs it. You can‚Äôt repeat them for more rewards so no reason to.
---
nice
---
Don't they run of the same stat for damage cards? Just change perk cards when shotgunning. Though if I remember correctly you will need at least 3 in perception for the shotgun card there and there's one in agility too.
---
its not intuitive because its not intentional
---
its a well known bug that exists on shotguns and certain heavy weapons with quite some different effects
---
it only works in vats with shotguns
---
its in the game for a long time now but its ultimately a matter of time before they find a way to patch it
---
It doesnt. I don't have the helmet and I am getting the bonuses on secret service.
---
I think i've had the same 4 cores for my PA for a week now..    
---
"damn getting low.. better head to westek"  :)
---
Join whatever works it puts you in walk a little bit, exitvto the main menu then rejoin the game. It'll work.
---
Could be a magic gun? My noob alt is running around with a level 5 3*magic vampire shotgun and one 3* 15% block armor piece and it one shotting in VATS only. Outside of VATS the gun only takes a quarter of the health bar down.
---
With 3 cells i kill 5 glowing ones in that uranium event. It's insane
---
Sometimes being autistic sucks, but in these cases i generally have to do a thing once and by the second time I'm running record times, all three ops locations are fairly straightforward if you got your route down.
---
That being said, the first time i went into wendigo caverns i cursed like a drunken sailor.
---
Most of the stuff you get use of each month makes it worth it for most subs.There have actually been a decent amount of extra items.3 ranger outfits and a bog wanderer outfit.4 atomic paint skins and 2 ranger paints.2 camp items 4 tent skins 2 icons and 2 emotes.A few more of course would have been nice but it is what it is.
---
As far as deserving all past items upon subscribing that‚Äôs just nonsense.You don‚Äôt get all the back issues of a magazine for free when you first subscribe or you come back from taking a break either.At least with this they will probably return certain items to be claimed like the holiday tent.
---
I thought it only uses rifleman? 1 have the automatic mod and still get the rifleman boost. Or do they stack?
---
Use throwing knives to finish them off, they count as melee damage.
---
At least your not keep getting the gutter
---
Same lol
---
At this point all my characters have it - except my melee guy :c
---
Never had my base destroyed by griefers. However, my base was once near an area where multiple scorch beast would occasionally spawn and destroyed my Red Rocket garage. The walls were broken and the ceiling completely collapsed. I thought it looked great and wanted to keep it in disrepair. Logged in on the next game session and everything was repaired. So I guess if you‚Äôve a busted base, logging off and on is a free repair all.
---
Also some people can run them and get elder solo.So even less people around to run them with.
---
To further add to this if they just kept giving you rewards then the rewards would be easy to get and players would grind it out all in one week or something and then wouldn't have a higher population to keep players incentivized to keep playing it everyday so there are others available to do the ops.
---
The best advice is to find the time with the most people on and start your own ops party and send some messages out asking players for help. I have done this a few times and was able to get 2 souls to help me and bang out elder easily. 
---
This community is very helpful if you ask around!
---
Really. We have lights that project a beam, we have duct tape, commooonnnnnnnn!!
---
do you unequip them or do you mean they are unequipped when you hop in power armor?
---
because if youre entering power armor you also loose your benefits from underarmor and the backpack
---
The mini gun takes too long to spin up and the Gatling gun fire rate is too slow for me, 50 cal all the way
---
Mine works fine with 5 peices of SS armor, mixed matched prefixea. Dont even have the helmet plan.
---
You likely have a magic legendary effect on your shotgun. Look up angry turtles magic weapon video.
---
Seems that they forgot to include some things in the new calculations. One of my weapons still gets the pre-patch concentrated fire 3 bonus for some reason.
---
Oh that's cool didn't know legendary luck worked if you had a natural 15. And strange in numbers + herb gives everything a +3? 
---
Yeah I've considered a half health UY which may make more sense for the nice boost to AP and Perception
---
How much do you know about Wastelanders, T notes and gold bulllion?
---
Either that or someone felt sorry for the loss and fixed it for you
---
Steel Dawn is both the Storylines combined. That is coming this year.
---
Expeditions, New Daily Ops and Perk Loadouts have been pushed into next year. 
---
He even mentions it in the video. I do suggest watching the video since its coming directly from him and it was posted yesterday
---
Ive gotten 4 burrows signs...
---
Not to mention lasers pew pew pew ;)

Daily Ops Elder Runs: 24
---
Yes please, double points if it makes electric guitar sounds when you hit an enemy with it! That'd be awesome right there.
---
Never for me on PC
---
Why do you want to use up the scrap kits? Those things are life savers to have around, but Im a junk hoarder since I have fallout 1st lol
---
I join public groups for the buffs. And then never interact with the member unless its for daily ops. And even then we are more just in the same area. Just because there's people around doesn't mean you have to really interact with them
---
Go somewhere with a lot of ghouls, about one in 10 drop a bunch of chems
---
What platform are you on?
---
If you're on PC add ign: KoreaRiceBox and I would be more than happy to do a scorch beast queen run with you.
---
I have grouping anxiety, I can solo ops and can use them to farm annoying to get fuel till my weapons break so don't group for them generally.
---
I want more of that stuff. More junk type items, stuff that fits the wasteland theme. I want a junk/raider camp, not a camp I can see with 20 minutes of driving IRL.
---
it only works as long as you don't actually want to protect the stuff inside... like for instance locking a door on your vending machines after you reach 30k caps
---
Check to see who's at the event.   If there is are high-level players there, you can show up and just get a tag as many as you can.   If you stay close to them, chances are good you'll survive.
---
Scorched mongrels for me, everytime nothing else and boy are they annoying. Ally does nothing to them and they wreck my camp. I didn't want to as they use a lot of budget and were pretty useless in my last few bases at finding enemies but I went and fitted 2 rocket turrets to hopefully get them. I am worried they arent gonna kill them with them being levelled now though the enemies.
---
i stopped using cannibal perk the moment i realized i couldnt eat other players
---
The only thing I don't like about energy heavy weapons is that the partly consumed cores litter your inventory, it's just annoying to have 15-20 pieces of 5% full cores each a separate item. Other than that, they are effective, especially the anti armor ones.
---
I use the flag camp emote. I claim their camp, it's mine now.
---
Yeah running without starched genres is just asking for trouble.Even if you don‚Äôt use rad removing items or perks sooner or later something will happen and you will have to go get them again.
---
Amen.
---
I didn‚Äôt know one could repair other people‚Äôs bases. Every day I learn something new about this game.
---
The cranberry bog still have a base level for mobs so you actually can‚Äôt go there right away
---
PS4 only right now. Apologies. I ought to have said that in the post. 
---
(I‚Äôm having Sheldon Cooper levels of distress though over deciding between the new PS5 and Xbox - or simply ditching both for more RAM and a new graphics card for my PC.)
---
THAT PLAYS ELECTRIC GUITAR NOISES
---
Best thing we can do is give feedback, but they clearly stated some time ago that they WANT to keep making things that don't necessarily fit. I hate seeing pristine clean things and shit that don't match the timeline in this dystopian world.
---
Youre saying a build is "unplayable" because you cant solo the two bosses who were designed with 8 people in mind..... really? If i have time sunday morning, im going to try and solo earl again. It was doable in patch 21 with a junkies 10mm.Now that follow through and tank killer are a thing for pistols, i beleive the damage is just about the same, so it should be able doable.
---
Getting elder Daily ops is totally doable with a handgun. Enemy type,mutation and location are a much bigger factor than weapons.  Volitle blood eagle's in the galleria/vault 94 is much much easier than freezing or invisible robots in the burning mine/burrows. The biggest limitation to soloing daily ops is how slow the uplink bars move and knowing your way around.
---
Near 3k hours and not once.
---
I love it, no more under leveled legendaries is the best. I needed a bit more of a challenge so it‚Äôs great
---
On the subject, I‚Äôd also love it if there was scrapboxes at train stations as well. I hate having to fast travel to my camp or tent to store stuff. 
---
(I‚Äôd just call the tent to me but I have it beside the water tower thing at the whitesprings station and sometimes it won‚Äôt let me put it back down.)
---
imo all the daily and max limits are in the game to force ppl to log in every day to take care of things, that way they could show Microsoft hay look see we have x number of players logging in every day for x amount of hours 
---
im really hopping that now that they have sold the company that we can get all the limits removed and get a game that can be played as much as we want to play it 
---
we dont need any of these limits they dont help the game at all
---
Military grade duck tape too!
---
I have a non and an explosive. The explosive breaks a lot more.
---
Never in 300 levels
---
as far as i I know there is no way to dupe items atm.
---
I went a few days in a row getting elder with nothing so lately I‚Äôve been getting paladin rank on purpose for my first run and then getting elder on the next run, I got 4 in the last two days with this method
---
Yesterday I payed 30+ caps to fast travel all the way from deep in The Mire to the Wayward to take a 3 cap bounty.
---
I just want my big iron to, you know, be a big iron. Is that to much to ask?
---
Ya I have a full set of SS armor without the helmet and it works fine
---
Cleanse the wasteland = giving out npcs free hazmat suits, spawning glowing ghouls and altering plants genome.
---
Ha, got the DOOM reference.
---
only in vats. " magic" effect is only in vats. and imo vats should do more dmg!
---
Man I wish I could just get one or the other lol
---
Sharing Cannibal on a team is great too. It‚Äôs pretty funny when someone isn‚Äôt paying attention and tries to jump standing next to a corpse and eats it instead.
---
I think pre nerf it was the faster fire rate. Now after nerf I think explosive is back for the extra 60% damage from demo expert. I probably wouldn‚Äôt change anything until more tests are done to see which comes out on top.
---
Explosive for everything but It breaks stealth, non explosive for the Queen
---
Yes, it is a common behavior this days... " It is everything and everybody's fault, not mine, I am a special snowflake, flawless, my momma said that many times".
---
It took me a long time until I launched a nuke, too. Never played in teams besides the open ones and I have no friends in 76 to play with. Sometimes it's quite sad and maybe because of that it took me very long to figure out where to go for the last quests (looked it up in the wiki in the end, because nothing in the game lead me there).
---
In the end I did the bunker run and nuke launch all alone. So it's possible. :)
---
I leave raw fertilizer in any camp toilets I find, if I find their vendor is charging stupid prices... I leave shit on their bed.
---
Ooohhh
---
And the accidental bumping into a rad shower ...
---
I've considered getting rid of it on my main, but only because I can make any serum etc.
---
Plus the sound you make when u draw the torch is the same sound when u draw a shishkebab
---
Mine works with 5 SS pieces.
---
I *think* they said they were going to, but I don't recall seeing which ways they'll open it up to.
---
If I'm wrong *please* correct me, thanks!
---
Go PC!
---
You will still get to use a controller if you like and mircosoft just bought Bethesda!
---
Transition to the master race!
---
Hopefully switching cores in pa and having Electric absorbtion as a perk might help this.  
---
I'll test this later today by going to westek killing everything not using an energy weapon and then swapping out my cores to see if it's a viable way of recharging them.
---
I buy bullion purely to keep from hitting the cap.
---
Grinding the gauss shotgun is quite easy compared to grindig the T65 PA :D
---
I'm doing it since the perk got released. Works fine but I think just taking over 2 power plants is easier and less hassle
---
Watch those palm scanners to get into the bunker then ... right side of the door ... left hand scanner ...
---
Once in 2300hrs, and that was only because I forgot to turn my vendor off when I went after a wanted player.
---
I had that once that a player shot all my camp down while I was there. I quit the game to prevent further damage. But sometimes stuff like my stash box are gone and I need to repair them when coming back home after a long hard day in the wasteland.
---
Hells yeah. I saw a guy who'd made a murder windmill, it was sooooo cool.
---
Yeah piercing gaze really got me bad here, i did my first run easily to the second medal, tried another one and my weapon BROKE at the final boss :')
---
Well stealh commando build sounds like a specified build
---
I totally agree, the thing I love the most is no more under leveled legendaries üò≠
---
Then i guess you would use double doors to get a notification and have some time to quit  in case someone got the perk to max
---
Explosive for maximum damage quickly. Breaks quicker.
---
Non explosive for good damage quickly, lasts longer.
---
Damn I missed it then. I just barely subscribed to FO 1st this month and didn‚Äôt ger any of those.
---
It should atleast be 50k.
---
legacy bloody explosive tesla (named) =  DONT DROP
---
I'm level 21 so I got a ways to go before I get stuck in.
---
We need Gringotts for Appalachia maybe if servers can't handle that many caps in your pockets...
---
As a gamma gun user for like 10 updates,  they are and have been beasts. 
---
The stealth suit or PA is nearly required (though maybe what rads will work now) for the blowback you get at point blank enemies.
---
The dps is far better than most think.
---
Or just a laugh.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
So let me get this straight...
---
The plan itself can be dropped from the daily ops, but the mods for it can only be gotten via gold bullion, and that‚Äôs why it can‚Äôt be traded correct?
---
So why not make the plan and a non upgraded war glaive tradable and then flag them as untradable once you attach a GB mod onto it? Like other stuff becomes untradable once you attach an Atomic Shop skin to it?
---
It‚Äôs honestly really painful to have gotten the War Glaive plan twice on my Bloodied Stealth Commando and then not get it or any rare reward for my Melee Character the past 5 Ops. This would also let us trade the legendary variants we get as long as they aren‚Äôt upgraded. (I got a really nice vampires war glaive on my commando that would have been perfect for my melee character... But since there‚Äôs no way to move it from one character to another I had no choice but to scrap it.)
---
The only issue I have is the damage I receive from supermutants automatic guns now. This can take a few seconds and I am down even though I am wearing secret service armor and underarmor already.
---
I tried a daily ops solo. Didn‚Äôt go well. üòÜ
---
I won't play with out it now. I easily have 1000s if pounds in junk and I want MORE!! I was buying atoms once a month anyway, so it's really no different in price for me anyway and the the convenience of the scrap box and tent are amazing added bonuses. I have yet to use the private server after 3 months, but I plan to take over multiple workshops and farm junk on it one of these days
---
I don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt have an easier way to store and exchange gear and other items between our characters like ESO...
---
And a bass axe.
---
Cheers for input might just stick with what I've got then still mows them down
---
Good lord, do you realize how entitled that sounds? Do you think that because you spend your money at a specific grocery store you should always be entitled to whatever discounts they offer even when the promotion is over?
---
Limited time stuff is everywhere, where were you when the game had it available? 
---
You're getting exactly what is advertised for your "hard earned money," so you're not being ripped off. You missed out on some skins, tough shit. You should have been around when they were avaliable. No promise was ever made by Bethesda that you can get previously avaialble skins if you purchase FO 1st.  You are owed nothing. If you don't like the current deal, cancel your membership. Either way you should definitely quit bitching like a spoiled little girl.
---
&gt; Same reason they had nuclear winter score challenges to get people to play that to keep the population for it somewhat stable or more consistent.
---
I haven't been able to do any of my NW score challenges as I just sit in the main menu while it "finds a game."
---
Ahhh, see I did try to start a team for doing events and such, but wondered why people kept joining but not showing up. 
---
This explains it and makes perfect sense as to why. Love me some buffs. (I‚Äôm all about the Nuka Colas and beers...)
---
also great sneak weapons. Flamers are silent weapons.
---
What is the target if you have crit savvy 3 to achieve the same goal?
---
I would very much like to know more.
---
We need a .44 hose ... plenty of people use .38
---
Fallout 3 is just shy of a hour east of Harpers Ferry. The tunnel with the train tracks and the radiation barrels should lead directly to DC IIRC. The river that runs through the town is the Potomac, which is the same that cuts through Fo3's map. Boston is a loooong way ro the north-east, and we won't ever get there directly.
---
We will visit various places outside of the map next year with Expeditions, but it's mostly going to be like Daily Ops from what they told us. Small portions of land from past games and not, in instanced cells that we will teleport to and from.
---
There is no master race, just lots of gamers. I‚Äôm impressed with Microsoft‚Äôs game pass though. 
---
I‚Äôve always owned PCs though. (I‚Äôve a Football Manager addiction...)
---
Start at the vault talk to the two npcs outside down the stairs.
---
34 is the target with crit savvy 3. You spend 55% of your crit bar to crit and 34 luck refills 56% per shot.
---
It's never been done before.... in fallout. They dont know how to go about making it happen.ü§•
---
This. Barrier of entry and rewards. With no environmental damage to dodge and a much higher time limit ops is better to farm xp and ammo.
---
Yeah I remember seeing that. Tbh I think they will make a separate map for any new locations they add. I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt be easy to update the current map to include more land and we all know how Bethesda are with shortcuts. It also might cause a drop in FPS and since the frame rate is already low at certain times it would be best to have it as a separate area.
---
I just message them if I really admire their base.
---
Gotcha. Ok thinking.
---
That would make much more sense, I'd like that.
---
Can't message on PC.
---
I don't know where people are getting "they're removing the hunger/thirst mechanic entirely" from.
---
They're not removing the mechanic. They're removing the penalties. If you want to stuff your face constantly to benefit from the well-fed/hydrated bonus you can still do that, but ignoring it completely will no longer hit you with severe debuffs. 
---
*They have stated that almost every single time they mention it*.
---
Technically it already has it. If you just move your camp unit, it will auto blueprint your camp. I just have never been able to get that blueprint to successfully sit down again.
---
Brother, the servers would melt..... maybe Microsoft saves the series...
---
Happens more often than you think. Don‚Äôt feel bad, it happens all the time haha
---
Unfortunately I didn't take a screenshot üò≠ it was super cool, though.
---
Just reverse the order would be simple solution.  So know plans go the end.
---
As a kinda new player I feel the same. With a low level character my encounters with high levels were usually friendly. Many of them left some ammo or stims for me and my teammate...nice bunch
---
You can‚Äôt get rare rewards until level 50 zzz
---
Fallout 1st should offer new map locations or more camp build area. Ppl would pay for that. Maybe not ppl. I would pay for that.
---
They should remove the limit altogether, and have it more like the gold have unlimited scrip but a spending limit every day would get rid of mules, server load and reduce people stash wright, all on one go.
---
There seems to be a false narrative out there that the game is unfairly difficult. The funny thing, is a lot of these people say it hasn‚Äôt affected them personally.
---
Aww, that's so sad for my noob lol.
---
Yeah, surely it wouldn't be too hard to adjust the current bank of stashbox skins. They'll already have the designs down, just need tweaking.  
---
Although I could be wrong, I'm no designer.
---
You want carnivore, strange in numbers and charred scorchbeast liver ... plus day tripper or formula p.
---
Level 120-ish, stealth playstyle with only level 1 rifleman, shotgun, heavy weapons damage perks, and maxed armor pen perks. I kill level 50s in anywhere from 2-5 rounds depending on what they are, using an executioners lever action rifle. It'd probably be one extra round from a non-legendary. I get around 130 damage on a regular headshot and 60-something on a body shot.
---
I ran the op today with said weapon for ammo farming, and the level 75 super mutants were going down in around 4-5 rounds each. I switched to a heavy weapon for the final boss. Came away with a profit of around 300 rounds.
---
Do you have armor penetration perks? I suspect they're more important than ever.
---
I would never have expected that
---
I think OP is asking for if they want to move say a building to the other side of their camp, there currently is no way without moving the entire camp.
---
Never played ESO what are are the main differences between that and us.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen an issue. 4x teams definitely move the bar faster. Had a 5 min 14 second run yesterday with a 4 person team. Best solo time was just under 8 min.
---
We need a permanent increase. Today I was overencumbered as hell, then I realized I was at max scrip, so I made the trip to the rusty pick. 
---
My mule was not amused.
---
Believe it or not, the game pass works on PC
---
hell just a freebie heart mixed with a camp emote that makes you do the heart animation, sure its a recycled animation but if its free :)
---
Is it a bug that I can never find the Imposter Sheepsquatch after completing &lt;quest name escapes me&gt;? I know generally finding legendary bodies to loot is annoying but I have never found that particular body after completing the quest roughly 8 times.
---
What is the legendary effect? What mods are on the shotguns. Not enough info here.
---
Although there is a gold bullion limit of 5k lol.  But they definitely need to make some changes here and fast.
---
Yesss!! Give Biv once more a time to shine!
---
Overpriced yes, kinda scummy yes, a scam no
---
Call of duty shooty shooty ppl don‚Äôt love it? Better add a new dance like they have in the Fortnites. That‚Äôll fix it.
---
Yeah. For that type of thing the blueprint budget is too small. Best I do is to blueprint the decorations as they are into a few sections. Then I manually rebuild the structure and place in the blueprints.
---
Up
---
I‚Äôve only solo‚Äôd it once and it wasn‚Äôt particularly fun if I‚Äôm being honest.
---
We do.  They've consistently added new events that award more legendaries yet never once upped the daily script allowance.
---
This doesn't seem to be working properly anymore unless they nerfed the ammo capacity of gatlings from 1000 to 500 when using Power User
---
Should we go back to 25,000?
---
Yeah, but you can hold unlimited gold tickets that's what I meant sorry should of been more specific.
---
&gt;	One Wasteland is poorly balanced to low level players.
---
Why does everyone keep saying this? I‚Äôve been playing with a new character lately and it honestly feels like more of the same.
---
Highlight it in your pip boy then inspect the chassis (R3 on ps4), then press the touchpad (ps4) to rename it. No idea what buttons do it on other systems.
---
Ah yes got you, maybe I just need more coffee this morning lol.  That would definitely help out a lot.
---
Just highlights how incredible a surprise human leader more sinister than MODUS would be to introduce. Perhaps that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre holding the executive wing at Whitespring for
---
Yeah, I mean they give 95% of their wealth to charity? how about fixing these fucking bugs Bill and Melinda... Bring on the Bill memes now that Bill controls all of the decisions at Billthesda
---
Mines been done twice. First time I was about level 20 and some dick came along and just blew it up and killed me several times as well.  Second time I was about level 100 and some low level came up to me at my camp and kept hitting me, so decided to end him after his 10 mins of him annoying me.  Next thing my base got lit up by 3 level 400s hiding outside üòÇ
---
Public teams most of the time are used by players to gain the team buff and benefit from team based perks and mutations. Most people will join a team, share a card, and go on playing solo. Honestly this should be your first step, just join a team next time you are on.  
---
As far as anxiety goes, ask yourself "Does it really matter? An hour from now? A day from now? " to help put things in perspective instead of just reacting to the situation and getting overwhelmed. Also, sometimes it easier just to act against what you are feeling and just jump in head first into a situation. Yeah sure you get overwhelmed, but then you sometimes end at the finish line and realize it wasn't nearly as bad as you were making it out to be in your head.
---
So like every DLC for FO3, NV, and FO4 you just go to a new spot.
---
oooop made us waste coins on that survivor legendary perk then, for shame
---
Confirm it‚Äôs an issue
---
No worries tbh the whole system needs a rework. Rep should carry over to all characters, legendary perks and gold bullion weapons should also. All character should be able to share plans and have a way to easily swap thing to and from.
---
Seeing as I don‚Äôt experience any of these long-standing bugs... keep releasing new content and fix any issues that come up as they‚Äôve been doing. I feel like I‚Äôm playing a different game than a lot of you.
---
This seems the best solution, I‚Äôm 100% sure if known plans got hidden, people would freak out when they can‚Äôt find item x y or z (not realising they own it already).
---
Cool beans, thanks for clarifying that for me! 
---
I hope we see some of the annexxed Canada at some point. Maybe Toronto/Niagra Falls/Buffalo?
---
Honestly I would have been happy if I got a robot legs plan from the daily ops. I've been looking for one of those plans so I can finish my final possum badge.
---
Meat week?
---
But I still see people running them frequently.
---
There is a current bug that halts the progress until the correct team member leaves the circle and comes back in.
---
Yea I can't live without it, ever since both of my mates got the exact mutations they wanted and proceeded to walk into my rad shower I decided I'd always keep starched genes on
---
Before the latest patch I would have said wait till level 50 - Now I'd say go for it.
---
Remember to partake in the meat week events, as long as there are other players helping you should get quite a few legendarys that you can rebuild your scrip with.
---
Ya, I think you can get the loss damage back through legendary perk cards though. They have one that boosts stealth damage by a significant amount. Downside being you need to be high level to obtain it.
---
I did at level 20 and it was fun. Enemies do scale down to you so you are able to participate. That said, you need to be level 50 for the best rewards.
---
Omg that would be heaven.  She says as she is currently tired of doing the rep grind yet again......  sharing between characters should have been a no brainer really.  Like in ESO.  Limits need addressing rapidly because the wasteland is not the place it was on release yet nothing has changed to reflect that.
---
Second question, should i roll 2* or 3*?

The explosive one can be lethal to you on close range kills and is also like a glass cannon and breaks too often.. 
---
I‚Äôve got a non ex ghoul slayers fixer which is perfect for areas like the golf club and capital building.. hope this helps üëçüèº
---
YES.  I would use this every day!
---
Yer I'm only 40, I just thought because when  I do primal cuts in savage divide the other day it was all level 60 monster so assumed that the daily ops would be higher or same level as that.
---
Bad idea imo , unless you're struggling to stay alive  , the first levels go by quickly and so the weapon will be obsolete soon , my advice is to keep the scrip for lvl 50 , if you're about to reach the scrip cap (1000) before lvl 50 use a bit just to fill daily amount of 150 &lt;--- just person opinion you're always free to play how you want :))
---
There are plans at the fair ground in the south.
---
Should be a system where every single item is available but you can redeem one or two per month. So you don‚Äôt miss out and don‚Äôt get nothing like right now.
---
Yeah, gave up praising the gamma gun, it's an amazing weapon, it doesn't fucking heal enemies with thge radiation and it also does a shitload of ballistic damage.. Gunslinger perks and now the tank killer perk... fucking awesome weapon. But with all the B2525 fixers around, why try anything different durrrr lol
---
My main is level 425 I have 4 mules on this account. All full and I bought my son the game so I have another 5 on his nearly full lol üòÜ. I'm a horder I just cant drop them unless it's to another player which I do regularly. My friends all use me to get there daily scrip. I used to walk around as a food build with 600 weight capacity. But the new update I need my damage perks on to kill stuff now.

What's the difference between eso and this? I don't play so.

At least this time it's not Bethesda's fault

It happened once in 2100 hours. And it was in the first 100 hours.

Really? I don't think I've ever seen them there and I go to Camden a lot.

I'm somewhere around level 88, is that enough ?
---
 You reach a stage when you don‚Äôt need to sell items anymore as nearly always at max caps. So you camp isn‚Äôt shown on the map and hidden from the nobs  causing trouble üòÄ

They are good. Unless robots and/or the burrows are involved. Then they arent as fun.

Ones looking up ones looking down

Survival shortcut is fantastic, freed up 3 perk points since I can get rid of thru hiker. Highly recommend.
---
Oh, yeah, now I see it, thanks for telling me.
---
Roll 2 stars to start out with. You get more bang for your buck.
---
Once you have good gear roll for 3 stars to upgrade and trade.
---
Oktobivfest
---
Iv been in it, was a presidential machine that needed tokens to dispence stuff and another room I couldn't figure, probably for ops or something.
---
Neither do I anymore but when I did there is a bank in every town.  If you deposit stuff in the bank it can be accessed by all of your characters.
---
Gotten it a couple of times, I think it‚Äôs because the match you were joining was ended early because not enough people were found by matchmaking or some such. Annoying as hell since for me all I wanna do is the daily challenge...
---
My guess is they have done them, got the top reward then thats it as you only get the top reward once a day. And since its not all that hard to get elder rank they only need one run. 
---
Just a guess.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone.  I don't think it's to do with other players at the event as when it has happened in the events I named I was doing them alone.
---
I think it's different to the Prime Cuts thing, as that forces you into 'danger' for the whole event, like the Daily Ops.
---
It seems like it's probably just the increased perception of enemies, though considering how high my agility is, and how far away from enemies I was (at One Violent Night I was upstairs in a corner with no enemies near) they may have over-egged it a bit.
---
That would be great.
---
Yup, there are three different spots in the bit with the raiders. I've seen all sorts spawn there including marine wet suit and helmet and some robot ones.
---
Probably has something to do with the strange reasoning for limiting F76 servers to 15 players at any given time.
---
SBQ droped me a aa/ffr/15r Gat Laser which i modded to ultracite and with 2 fusion cores made into 9 ultracite fusion cores it goes a long way against queens.
---
Someone more knowledgeable could well correct me but I would suggest 2 star for now - more chance of getting at least one attribute you like with more overall rolls.
---
In saying that I always go 3 star rolls but I'm over level 50 and have a couple of solid weapons already.
---
I have always favored gatling gun over minigun unless the minigun is magic in some way. Otherwise the minigun just tickles enemies while the gatling gun hits pretty damn hard
---
Not Whitesprings, but I can consistently (about 4 out of 5 times) crash the game by running by a specific building in Pleasant Valley Ski Resort.  It is really weird.  Once I figured it out, I just steer clear of that pathway.
---
Make enough money with just selling the game to continue services for years to come, add content etc?
---
I know what you mean. I'm also autistic and it can be hard at moments but it helps me a lot in games like this.üòÅ
---
People are not smart
---
For this game to survive it needs new content.  The bugs are frustrating but I personally can deal with them until they eventually get fixed.  I've played this game since launch with about 2000 hours under by belt using shitty satellite service on XB1, so lag is my main issue.  I need Starlink to improve my gaming experience since I live out in the country with poor internet coverage.
---
Before OW, during the Season downtime: "Oh huh I got a magic shotgun armor piece, let's play around with that before they inevitably fix it with the patch"
---
After OW, which did not fix any magic effects: "shotgun is life. Shotgun will carry us to the promised land"
---
ok thanks, I'll go check it out.
---
Scrip
---
I don't have it, I just don't hoard useless scrap. Don't get me wrong, I pick up literally every bit of junk I see, but every week or so I'll go through my stash and clean it out, getting rid of excess steel, wood and cloth etc. I can keep it around 600 weight worth of scrap and the rest for weapons and armor pieces. I'd love to have a luxury like fallout first but the cost is too much for me to justify. I can't justify ¬£11.99 a month on a game I already paid full price for. If they lowered it to maybe ¬£4 a month or something I would say it would be worth it but until then I'll stick to just managing my stash
---
My quad explosive handmade ruins everything that isn‚Äôt a boss, breaks after like 2-3 events though, even with max Gunsmith perk card.
---
I use SS Unyielding without helmet and the perks works fine with bonuses
---
My Quad DB Shotgun is Hayloft
---
My Gauntlet is Lights Out
---
Guess the musical references!
---
Yeah pretty much
---
I keep getting my Fluffy the Deathclaw shot at. I always give a thumbs down when they do it. I‚Äôm about to put up neon letters ‚ÄòDont Shoot Fluffy‚Äô. Worth the $450 caps
---
i dont have any pressing need to do it further, will easily complete the season without the points it gives
---
thats great, thanks for sharing! üòÇ
---
Nice! Another tip for farming ammo is, use your grenades. Enemies killed by grenades while you have a gun equipped will still drop that gun's ammo, even if you never fired a shot.
---
You don't have to even subscribe to know what is being offered every month. Just spend no money but check once a month to see if the rewards are something you want.
---
Agreed, for the amount of time i put into the game it's a steal. Never understand people who say it's expensive. I think a lot of people have a problem with the idea of pay to win, which this barely qualifies for. If this was a single player game it would be ridiculous, but an online game that's aiming to keep new content and development needs revenue.
---
Gauss are explosive so try the perception and intelligence perks for it. Also fireproof in endurance so you don't blow yourself up
---
And you want gun fu on too in agility. It's amazing with shotguns.
---
It might depend on daily OP, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm surprised you saw level 60 enemies in divide though. I would have expected those to scale down. Seems like a bug. FYI level 50 is top level for weapons and you have access to all normal perks at that point so you are almost ‚Äúmax level. ‚Äú
---
Pipe is life!!! LoL
---
Essentially in ESO the banking system works like our stash but it‚Äôs shared between all the characters. You can deposit your items, gold, pvp points, crafting credits, etc.
---
You can then log on to another character and still access those same items in that system.
---
Hell, we even have NPC you can summon to you that ARE bankers. No need to run or fast travel to a damn CAMP, tent or train station :/
---
There is a delay for the perk to proc like 1 sec. No visual. It works with tenderizer but seems to cause bugs with suppressor perk
---
That sounds so good.
---
There's a shotty perk that increases reload and cuts weight. Also shotty perks in perception and agility (Enforcer is super useful)
---
minigun has become a pea shooter since last patch imho. I now only use it to blow through my 5mm bullets. 
---
I definitely prefer the gatling gun.
---
I figured that out the hard way. Now need to figure out how to work it into my perks for normal use. Have usually had the disease/rads perks for food/drink active.
---
It makes life in ESO so easy.
---
It‚Äôd be nice if the scrap boxes worked like the crafting bags too. That‚Äôs shared account wide too.
---
Always carry at least two weapons that suit your play style (preferably with different ammo types too).
---
That‚Äôs the house I mean. After I do my lead run, I go there for the books (cloth) and that ensures that the first items I picked up in the run will respawn.
---
I love the survival tent and the scrap box, but they aren't worth paying for every damn month. I got 1st in August, decided to keep it another month, and I might decided to keep it a third month, all in the name of cramming as much scrap into the scrap box before canceling. Hopefully I'll have enough in there to not have to pick up junk for a long while. I would say it's worth trying out and doing at least a month to load up on scrap.
---
I love my QE HM!
---
I had that already for the combat shotty pre one wasteland.
---
Invest in What Rads and don't worry about diseases too much. There's a drinking fountain in the white springs gazebo that removes all diseases and simptomatics are becoming more common in player camps. Diseases suck but the perk slots aren't worth it imo, especially when you could just not eat raw food you heckin feral

So if you take down any wall and floor decor category items before you move/blueprint, the building, workbenchs, beds and other stuff usually place no problem.

The Real Money Auction House pretty much destroyed Diablo 3 - that game didn't become enjoyable until the RMAH died.

The trading subs (which I have not used, but do follow) are apparently useful and fun.

I did this too...

But then kind of started to like my 4th and final alt

And to inform new FO1st members and remind old members. the "Specials" tab at the end of the Atom Shop's ribbon is where they store all the current FO1st freebies and offers and not in the FO 1st section in the lefthand menu

I‚Äôm sure the numbers are down. I solo joined the other day cause the daily was placing CAMPs and couldn‚Äôt ever get a lobby.

dont worry he was just a little prick
---
Had that yesterday. But it didn't help to go away and back (we tried). Left, made a new team, same people joined, we smashed it in under 6 minutes üòâ I really like those daily ops! They're quick and even if something bugs out, it doesn't feel annoying somehow... Just restart the instance and try again.
---
Really? 
---
Can you just run the game pass without actually owning a console, just an account, game changer if I can.

Why didn‚Äôt you stash it immediately?? Never walk around with bulk. There is no need.

This is why Radchooks &gt; Brahmin - even though they don't do anything but make poop.

I thought the miscellaneous task would be quick and ez, ended up getting attacked by several molerats lol it kinda is my fault but I thought I‚Äôd just respawn and get my loot bag again

hah really? Well I guess it must have been right before I started playing. That sucks because it sounds like it was a blast
---
What Platfom are you on?

I haven‚Äôt been struck by assholes using explosive bait (if that still works) but I had several over the months after launch would try.

But it‚Äôs been probably a year or more since some asshole has legitimately tried destroying my base.

100%! Going around a Raider camp in Fallout 3 or NV and seeing the FUCK YOUs everywhere, the little nuke explosion graffitis, and just colourful scrawls. Must have it.

Yeah I heard that it‚Äôs useless, I‚Äôve still not bought anything yet, didn‚Äôt realise it was all so expensive

Yer I know meat 6 days lol is helping. Yer normally they are my level. By for some reason at primal event it doesn't scale down in the last couple days.

That really sucks.  I could help you out with this but I won't be home for ~3hrs.
---
A good rule of thumb is to not join party invites because apparently they can get your ip though that.
---
Oh ok. Thank you!
---
It's called immersion. Fallout New Vegas had the same mechanic in their survival mode. It adds stress to an otherwise stress less game. We might as well get rid of everything else that gets on our nerves too. You know, like radiation. Shit let's get rid of damage too.
---
You probably know what to do. New players and many people here doesn't. I haven't tried to play with my low char so I don't really know about the balancing.
---
Never walk around with junk
---
It's been broken since launch. The gags rifle originally had the same bug. Was never fixed. Then they add the shotgun and bows, which have the same charging mechanic- they obviously ctrl + c + v the code because they have the same bug.
---
It will obviously never be fixed. They have better things to do like sell you. broken weapon racks for $10
---
Have you tried doing a VATS critical first? Just an idea to consider if you can set your meter to full before using the

---
A vamps, faster swing speed (FFR?) chainsaw would be awesome. I haven't tested my flaming chainsaw since the update, are they still useful?
---
I never really do walk around with junk honestly unless I‚Äôm doing some type of mission and I‚Äôm scavenging for junk. But it‚Äôs bc I was gonna do the exams for the fire breathers and I seen a miscellaneous task pop up on my screen, I thought it‚Äôd be a quick xp but it turned out to be a lot of mole rats attacked me inside some church.
---
That is genius :D I'll do that too
---
Never

I usually just message the person "nice camp bro :)"  on xb live.  But yeah an emote would be nice.
---
I've stopped playing for now from all the glitches. 
---
I played for 4 months solid on PS4, every day and never had an issue. Since Patch 22 I couldn't be on for more than 10 minutes without getting a blue screen, or even worse the new black screen, where you're still there but now blind. 
---
I think the black screen happens whenever I'd use VATS to target something slightly above and in front of me, it locks on but then everything goes black except my UI (health bar, reticle etc) I can still hear the game, still spin around or move, even shoot, just blind. Fast traveling didn't clear it, server hopping didn't clear it. Only complete restart of game clears it. 
---
After getting 2 black screens and a blue within 30 minutes I just decided to take a break while they smooth these issues out.
---
I‚Äôd really appreciate it bro, I‚Äôll be on again at like 10/11 if that‚Äôs cool with you
---
I can give you the bulk stuff if you want, in about 30 mins if youre still around. Its not in bulk but I can bulk it for you if you want?
---
It's an annual event so there should be one next year too.
---
I‚Äôll still be on bro, I really appreciate it if you‚Äôre serious and thanks in advance

Welcome to Fallout 76
---
I've ditched Bloody Mess. When you use Tenderizer the additional 15% from Bloody Mess makes no noticable difference to justify using a card that costs 3 points to equip.
---
Half/Quarter Foundations, Walls and roofs would be also cool.
---
Yeah makes me wonder if we will get a Pitt dlc. All the settlers keep yapping about it when I visit Sanctuary/Foundation.
---
I‚Äôve tried everything to handle the anxiety. I was the most easy going dude on the planet once, long ago.

Brain damage while in the military got rid of that and replaced it with a big ‚Äòol dollop of social anxiety. (Remember, just because you‚Äôre paranoid, doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt out to get you... )
---
Hapenned already but if you happen to be on ps4 I could give you Fasnact plans I have left over.
---
Before the update I took on the SBQ with my flaming chain saw as a joke, I got loot. That's even more impressive if you consider I could only do damage when she landed. I continued to kill many high level things with said chainsaw. Did the previous meet week with my chainsaw.
---
I'll be sleeping by then (night shift worker).  But if you look me up this weekend, I will get you a care package.
---
It just works
---
Sounds good man, thanks again
---
&gt;pay to win, which this barely qualifies for.
---
I dunno, I had a nice "talk" a week ago with people who think that \[unlimited scrap space is literally pay-to-win\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itjy07/bethesda\_for\_the\_love\_of\_god\_add\_a\_ammo\_box\_for/g5gmi97/?context=8&amp;depth=9](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itjy07/bethesda_for_the_love_of_god_add_a_ammo_box_for/g5gmi97/?context=8&amp;depth=9)). It's almost like they pick out phrases that are generally considered bad and apply it to any situation that they're not getting the best out of.

This is my point. A lot of people post his who haven‚Äôt even tried it yet.

Mole miners in Welch worked for me. One spawned glowing and counted for the daily.

I have to admit that I did the bunker solo run before the one wasteland patch üôÑ

Tell that to autocorrect and not enough coffee lol

It seems to work right about half the time for me. Pretty much unusable. My combat shotty puts out more DPS.
---
It‚Äôs fun, a little overhyped IMO though.
---
Not a problem, just the steel, adhesive and rubber? I am serious, I've had it happen to me. I've seen posts like this before but the difference being you haven't immediately asked for someone to give it you back. I think some ppl abuse how generous ppl can be in this game, you on the other hand I believe. So it would be my pleasure mate. Send your gt and I'll join on you in 25 minutes. Maybe less. üëç

All I ask is that you store it immediately. Take care and see you soon.

There are fish in Thunder Mountains Lake. Used to have a boat house out there and would see tons of fish swimming around.

Supposedly if you have the empty pails from the Mole Miner Treasure Hunter event (earlier this year) and you craft them now, they access the upcoming Mole Miner event (Oct?) prizes and plans. Any crafted ones from before Patch 22 still access the older prize pool.
---
lolololol,   
---
I seriously have a hard time understanding where some of these people are coming from. It¬¥s literally a cost of a one lunch meal. And depending how much time you spend on the game you could pack a lunch once or twice a month and have enough for it. If you play daily it's a great deal.
---
Your hp isnt increased by additional END provided by gear.
---
Yes in my experience, far less damage Then Before, but way more then non magic ones
---
PC master race ftw. Btw we kicked you out for your tratiorous words..... goodbye
---
You mentioned Xbox and if that's what you are playing on, hacking is very unlikely. Exploiting maybe but not hacking. Consoles are generally not hacked on because they are closed systems and aside from potentially lag input devices console hacking is not really a thing. PC, that's a different story.
---
While I think this is a positive change for the health of the game, this really needs to be part 1 of many of the process. They really need to push out balances at a faster pace than the glacial speed they normally do for updates. People are going to lose interest because their build suddenly became garbage tier and it becomes too much of a slog to fix it to enjoy the rest of the game.   
---
First thing they should focus on is player damage scaling vs enemy health and armor scaling which is really bad in some level ranges. This issue can be fixed with some changes to numbers in a table and should be an easy and quick fix.   
---
Second they should probably either cap some creature types or regroup them so they do not scale as much as other creatures. Level 100 molerats and stingwings with 1000 HP should not be a thing, its not challenging its just terrible.   
---
Third they can spend time working on rebalancing weapons and legendary effects to bring some VARIETY back to this game. In Division 1 there was a build called Strikers that was King by a decent margin but there were still a number of usable builds to complete content with. Bloodied right now is the strongest but after One Wasteland does it really need a nerf? Most of the other effects are VERY lackluster by themselves and a buff/rework to those would help bring some variety back. If they really want to shake things up they should introduce new legendary effects into the pool for people to mess around with for a few months.  
---
Fourth is a personal issue that is probably not bothering most players but as a level 450+ everything I see is level 100 and looks the same. Though it becomes a problem because it is very hard to determine threat level of enemies. Before I could look at an enemy and make decisions on what could actually do some damage to me and what I should eliminate first. The best example of this is Daily Ops with robots; the Handy variant does seemingly no damage to me, the Major Gutsy does a little damage to me but isn't too much of a problem, then everyones' favorite Colonel Gutsy rolls up to the party looking like the first two fools. Except, he does armor penetrating damage considerably higher than a group of the other two variants. This is currently the only game I play where I can't look at an enemy and know how dangerous they are at a glance, ironically Fallout 4 was one of the best at it.   
---
TLDR: One Wasteland was great first step, but other steps need to be taken to cross the street and not get hit by a car.
---
This made me giggle a bit.
---
I have at least 5-6 of those and must have scripped another 50 or so but get shit rolls everytime
---
Which would then auto force PvP if you shoot at a player because the ricochet would be tagged as coming form the player you shot at :)
---
If resources would be treated like, well, actual resources instead of individual items, that could help on the server load too.
---
You overpaid a lot for that stuff, the travel costs to go to the places to gather it would have been about 100 caps. Mappalachia and junk farming guides will make it so losing junk doesn't really matter.
---
I always waited until I was level 50 on all of my characters. I couldn't see why I'd want to gamble on a low level item. Also the limit of scrip you can hold is 1000 so stock up.
---
Does actually a bit more damage but by the sound of  it breaks a lot more quickly.
---
No, we should go up to 50,000
---
I did one similar to this, i was playing an instrument at someones tent and they moved it while it was playing, then i could walk around but the animation was as if i was playing it still.
---
I‚Äôll definitely look into it! Thanks for the tips
---
I feel your pain. I quit FO 76 for quite a few months when my game kept crashing during and worse at the end of the SBQ fight and didn't get any loot. Maybe Microsoft buying Zenimax/Bethesda will improve things. I like the game but it's half assed at best from a game development perspective, on a broken game engine.
---
Yes. I am a hoarder who cant help but grab all the junk. Its a godsend. What I do is set down my survival tent outside a location....go to location and grab every piece of junk....scrap it in that stash box for scrap, and move on.
---
As a higher level player (200+ on two characters) I‚Äôm really enjoying being able to explore the world again instead of being locked to certain areas, I can now help newer players on the tougher quests without taking away from the experience for them thanks to one wasteland. Overall i think it was a much needed communal update regardless of the nerfs added with it
---
Treat them like farm animals you raise for slaughter...don't name them.

Yup, happened to me a while back. On an event, nice fresh kills all-around.....

Then I looked at perks shared by a team member... oh!

That's why I use the thumbs up emote followed by the heart emote

Haha.. this made me laugh thank you üòÄ
---
I'd save them.
---
That‚Äôs very true, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to the game, but nothing‚Äôs perfect so I can‚Äôt complain. This is the first time my game crashes though, usually the servers stop responding and I can just quit the server but this time, my whole game froze and I had to exit the app.
---
This. Launch a private server, and take over ammo factory. Wait. Profit??? Go back to people land server.
---
Hear me out, build a new boat house out there, but try to get a greenhouse flat roof in as a floor piece so it is like one of those boats with a glass bottom.
---
50, I believe. But you can also clear names from items you're not using any longer.
---
You are right, the damage increase is small, I just like to see my enemies being torn apart...
---
this game is so weird when it comes to logical answers how perks and gun modifiers work.  
---
someone only needs to check angry turtle and you will see how much "strange" stuff happens in that game.  
---
you wont believe how much "strange" stuff isnt even common knowledge for most of the playerbase...

i was happy to see someone asking this. would have probably asked this myself later. especially because the perk card rad sponge doesnt kill mutations.

never stop asking guys!

If only...Bethesda last i checked patched building in water long ago. I kinda miss the boathouse now.

Also the Charleston Fire department weight room! Also there is a huge weight room in this roach motel place with a pool that I found the other day that I cant remember the name of. Easy to miss.

During the Holiday Scorched event, I took over all the workshops and built Santatrons.  Lots of presents delivered for me.
---
I comment ONLY in response to the fact revolvers can't be silenced. They can't work like that because of the way a revolver works. They blow gas back out the cylinder in addition to out the front of the barrel. Normally you silence something by slowing the gas out the front of the barrel. When the revolver blows gas out the cylinder to it makes it much more difficult to silence.

If you're on PC, hold the left CTRL key while you're scrolling for faster scrolling.

Yeah that's what I usually go for, but I realised afterward my tesla auto rifle was out of power cells, so I ran back at the beggining and repaired my rifle. (attempted throwing all my explosives too, did not that well)

Dont hold onto guns you are going to scrip. Just get rid of them otherwise you keep making the pile bigger for no reason.
---
No chems. I'm more of a VATS/Crit build. The accuracy with this Western Revolver out performed my Gauss Pistol so I stuck with it. Once I hit the first headshot in VATS, Gun-fu and Adrenaline kicks in and I empty the chamber on whatever crowd is standing. Just be warned there's no silencer so every shot is like ringing a dinner bell. Escape Artist is another must in case you're in a pinch.
---
Xbox
---
200, actually. But you can probably find a crate that dropped earlier still there as well, which is lootable. So that's 200 easily.
---
üëßüá∫üá∏your comment is mine now.
---
Apparently you can, but I haven't found the recipe yet. The hunt begins!
---
Shoot her with a fatman lol
---
Thanks for the question, I just got this, and was wondering what it was.
---
Nooo she's sleeping. Its not easy being a deathclaw. Let her sleep some more.
---
Haha i feel ya
---
It's not hard at all just need better awareness and spend more ammo, or your meta is shit now and need to change it,  dont expect to win every fight like it's a walk over.
---
Ypu diappoint me...member
---
No different just gotta spend a little more ammo.
---
I wish there was a queue for group option so that you could group up when enough players are ready to join the instance. Then the run starts and finishes and your group is disbanded. They should have copied from Blizzard.
---
42 here. That's awesome. You shoulda showed us lol a middle of nowhere BBQ pit usually ends up some of the best places to stop by. Plus, how cool to be served by a person instead of a Mr handy variant. Hmm I may try this when I get better blueprints.
---
LOL ive done that too. I ran around looting like 35 guns from super-mutants for mats and mods. I refused to drop any so I walked back to my camp. Took me a long time.
---
Same as every other weapon for me
---
PC
---
* try not to use credit card. Even when you cancel on PS4, they still deduct the payment if you didn't cancel on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net). I us wallet top ups and then pay with wallet. Something similar might be the case for Xbox.
---
* I let my Fo1st run out twice now and the longest I could do without was about three weeks. The game is so much better with FoSt.
---
* Tent + scrap box is amazing for looting
---
* only real downside to having fallout first is that you'll hate playing without. when I didn't have it anymore I tried to change my gaming style to 'retired wastelander that doesn't need to pick shit up anymore because he is getting to old for that shit'. But it still hurt too much to leave all that sweet loot behind so I caved and resubbed after about three weeks.
---
* So what some people try to do is getting the subscription for a month, loot like crazy and then unsub to use that loot in the coming months. I find it easier said than done but some of my friends are perfectly able to do it like that.
---
* private server is really nice, especially when you run with a group that is larger than 1 team. We server jump regularly and having at least one Fo1st member in the group makes sure all 8 can jump to his/her private world without getting queued. Some days we switch from private to private so we never run out of available nuke silos or have noobs ruin the difficult events. (for example project paradise can easily be ruined by noobs so doing it on private server makes sure everybody in the group gets top rewards every time we do the event. Succes rate is waaay better)
---
* private server is nice for dailies like kill a deathclaw. You're sure it will still be alive on your private.
---
* Private server is a lot safer to transfer items than on a public world and you don't need friends to do it.
---
Actually it was in the base game, along with an unfinished harpoon gun that had a clip, which was based off of an old concept piece (in the link provided, show being held by a helmeted spike armor wearing raider with a trident in the bottom left of the picture). It was for a discontinued questline based on a vault under the sea. The harpoon gun we did get is based on the "harpoon mounted cannon" that was depicted with the Wharf-Rats concept art (found in [http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/0a/Fo4\_raider\_armor\_concept\_art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151216012506](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/0a/Fo4_raider_armor_concept_art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151216012506) ).
---
"My little friend"  it's a TSE 50.cal :)
---
Get a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù gauss shotgun if you‚Äôre going to be using vats. And also try to go into vats, exit out of vats, then go back in, and then shoot. You‚Äôll have a much higher hit chance on that shot
---
I've repaired other people's turrets and walls for them....not sure about whole structures, but it would make sense that we could.
---
I‚Äôd personally run herbivore, I like the ease of getting cranberry cobbler or relish and the soups are good.
---
I run carnivore on my commando and need to swap it out. I use herbivore on my bloodied heavy main too.
---
Sounds like a magic effect on the gun. Angry Turtle did a good video on magic shotgun but I don't remember the specifics of what triggers it (even though I play shotty)
---
That's a great idea!  I'll take some screenshots later and post a link. Good thinking.
---
We also need to be able to put stairs on the side of floor pieces, not just the middle, and to be able to apply the floor textures from the shop to those prefabs. Would also be nice to get half-stairs.
---
Diseases aren‚Äôt dangerous, they‚Äôre just a nuisance.
---
Didn't you post this yesterday?
---
It might be time to go outside for a while and get some fresh air. üòÇ
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I didn‚Äôt take it that way :) just wanted to share a method to maximize XP if more people are participating.
---
Thanks and you too :)
---
Yes, and cut out floors for stairs.
---
Sweet! I'll be sure to keep an eye out
---
I have a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbells!
---
Drop something to show your appreciation! Like purified water. Or ammo. Or a nuke.
---
Pretty sure you can, pal
---
Yep thats called cylinder gap. The space between the cylinder face and forcing cones lets gas escape usually a .002 - .010" space. One of the reasons to be mindful of hand position when teaching folks how to shoot six guns.
---
-A real life revolver enthusiasts
---
Wiki says it's a cut recipe...but I have it somehow o_O
---
It's Cram, Mirelurk Egg, and a Tato IIRC.  Might be some razorgrain in there too for the bun.
---
Carnivore is better if you ever plan to dip into melee from time to time. Otherwise herbivore
---
Please! God, finding nice camps is my favourite part of the game! The amount of wonderful friends I‚Äôve made bc I‚Äôve stumbled across their lovely camp and told them.. ahh it would be so much easier with a nice camp emote!
---
This is a really cute idea!
---
You might want to look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) since you are an adult that has gone through some shit. Basically its just analyzing your behavior and setting up plans for new positive behaviors. I burned out hard from a doctorate program and the CBT helped a tremendous amount in just getting me back to enjoying things I liked again. Best part was no drugs with shitty side effects. Hope things get better. :)
---
I'd say let Biv host it, but also have Grahm show up an be shown drinking a large makeshift stein of beer. Could even toss in some Raiders who'd be there as well since they heard there was free alcohol.
---
Also why not add settlers to Fasnacht as well. Could have them joining in the festivities, but then have them scatter whenever the enemies show up or even joining in with helping us.
---
Dude,the foosball table is so cool
---
Yeh I run around and heart at things I find particularly neat and I like to think they understand? But this would clear that up haha
---
If so I say only one thing... Get that board done boys
---
1) every level up you get a point you can add. At level 50 you stop getting points but can start moving them one by one or getting a new card
---
2) mirror ball, cookoo or nuka clock, advanced power connectors, rad emitter
---
3) maybe. There is an event the week before IIRC that is scheduled. 
---
4) that was a season reward last time. No longer available.
---
Am Level 928, could have helped you out. But am on PS4. Best of luck out there :)
---
Or dick with the team wide rad cure
---
Ever stop and think, maybe these people just enjoy a different play style? That literally no one is seeking power in FO76 except xShxrky on xbox? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Wasn‚Äôt the armor bug patched?
---
Herbivore ftw for ranged.  
---
It's more consistent in general because you aren't depending on specific Scorchbeast bits to drop.
---
I got it only for the Elite riot gear, which I have yet to see. ü•∫
---
It‚Äôs playable, at least compared to launch. There are obviously going to be a lot of people still saying it‚Äôs bad but honestly they‚Äôve made a good few improvements. There‚Äôs still work to be done and fixed to be made but if you have a few buddies give it a go :)
---
Nah, literally all things PvE are just weak and boring and require zero build thought to fight off. 
---
Even the leveled ones now just seem like the number over their head increased, and that's it. Got top ranked 1st try with randoms on my team for the daily OPs. 
---
Nothing PvE in this game requires a PvE build except maybe tryna kill the queen as fast as possible without magic weapons.
---
It‚Äôs fallout. If you like fallout 3/4, you likely would like this. Is a multiplayer spinoff. Not a ton of choice/consequence but it‚Äôs a fun world to explore in the fallout universe. Lots of weapons/armor to customize, enemies to kill, events and missions. 
---
If you have game pass, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to check it out.
---
Wish I could buy ‚Äòem off of you. üò≠
---
there's a lot of space on the north (and a huge mountain there though that one you can't reach) after the hills/mountains. I could easily see a few small towns there.
---
tip jar we can give people 5 caps
---
I tried to keep it basic, but you've got your facts straight!
---
I did that season 1 but now with legendary perks I just work in my main now lol
---
Is it still playable solo? I‚Äôm older now and work overnights so I‚Äôm usually gaming alone.
---
Same bro
---
Okay man thanks :)
---
what? i thought it was 24 ?
---
Thanks man
---
Thanks buddy, but am on PS4. Would have been fun to visit and pay for the food via vendor ;)
---
what they should do is let people redeem 1 item a month and have every item up for grabs that way long time players get something and new players get something with neither side feeling let down
---
Dude I can give you a few but about to sleep. Will be up in 7 hours or so. IGN same as this. HMU then if you still need any kind of flux.
---
It's fun. I aged on and off on PS4 to about level 20 and just reached that on pc (gamepass)
---
There's lots to do, the atmosphere and locations are interesting and I love the customisation abilities.
---
The only downside is the persistent online part. I spend a not insignificant part of my time scavenging to maintain my hunger/thirst/supplies which can take you out of adventuring for a bit.
---
I'd love a backpack with a spot lamp on it so I could just wear whatever hat i wanted
---
1. Up the daily scrip limit!!! 400 would be great. Thats 10 3 star weapons.
---
So many legendaries and no way to turn them in. Now so many items are tied to modules and vault steel as well. 
---
It's one of the few game loops that sustain me playing. 
---
It would boost exploration,  event participation,  player vending, etc
---
Lmfao - bruh. Sad that you care about dying in a video game to another player.
---
Excellent and getting better
---
It is but it's more fun playing with people even with strangers on public severs
---
Laser or plasma?
---
Il try all your suggestions, Thanks.
---
Its just extremely disheartening. This game man........I wish they would focus on making a product polished.
---
You can definitely play solo. I usually do 90% of the time, or join public teams for a little support if you want.
---
Laser
---
Teslas and railways are whatever. It's the jetpacks, magic weapons and tesla lag that are the main issues. That and the colas. Colas post damage nerf are just dumb.
---
It‚Äôs a decent game overall, graphics aren‚Äôt the best especially compared to games which also came out in 2018. The new patch was quite successful. It still has its day 1 bugs though in some areas such as the ‚ÄòNo respawn‚Äô bug which is annoying. It‚Äôs definitely worth trying out though. There‚Äôs loads of content.
---
Build water purifiers and plant corn. Done :) takes nothing out of the adventuring time
---
1. After level 50 and costs 1 point to move 1 special point to another. When going into the skill tree after level 50 the option willpower up to either select a perk card or move a point
---
2. Grahm does have some hard to find plans. Here are some,
---
Plan: Mirror ball
---
Plan: Metal picnic table
---
Plan: Park bench
---
Plan: Radiation emitter
---
Plan: Starburst clock
---
Plan: Stone benches
---
Plan: Domestic kitchen tables
---
Recipe: Chally's feed¬†(only during Meat Week

3. Nothing is on the community calendar. You can look here for the latest news and upcoming events. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news
---
4. The hanging cage was a reward for last season. That was the only way to obtain it that I know of.
---
Thanks for the reply I‚Äôll check it out!
---
And as an added kicker to spending my time and resources building a broken piece of junk.
---
I now have my weight out of control, which thanks to script daily rations, will take days to get back to normal levels. Especially as most things I do in this game gives me MORE legendaries. 
---
Im going to have to start dropping stuff.
---
i have 2 questions 1 why do you hate it? 2 why do you still play it?
---
They should appear. Probably experiencing a bug
---
Apparently not. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It was hundred for me(just checked).
---
It ain't such a grind with everything lvl 50 to 100
---
Not with there STILL being Christmas stuff in Nuclear Winter lol
---
You can join Public Teams and still play solo taking advantage of the bonuses. About the only time I want a Public Team to actually play as a Team is during Daily Ops otherwise its more about bonus xp, health etc and sharing perk cards.
---
Ye, idk how ripper can do more dmg than a fu****g double burning chainsaw
---
same
---
Are there any prizes that you did receive?
---
I don't know why, but unlike in singleplayer fallout games, having romantic relationships with npcs in fallout 76 feels wierd and creepy...
---
[heres nother list where to find which junk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)  
---
also keep in mind that you can get tons of steel from scrapping weapons. super mutants at huntersville/west tek/... dropping assault or lader rifles are a great source of steel and plastic. also make sure to use the scrapper card from the intelligence perks.
---
They need to up it to at least 240 (it‚Äôs the best divisible number using all the different scrip values) which is only a 90 scrip increase but that will go a long way for many players
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs not happing. 
---
I‚Äôm part of the furniture. My first home computer came unassembled and with 1k of memory... 
---
I‚Äôm hoary and wise enough to know it‚Äôs just a wheel. Home computers dominate, then consoles, then home computers.  I reckon I‚Äôm on my seventh revolution of it by now...
---
Thanks dude I‚Äôll add you
---
all good points so far ‚òùÔ∏è but as far as usefulness and if with limited caps I'd get the fusion generator and handmade plans
---
I‚Äôm almost always solo so if it wasn‚Äôt I‚Äôd be worried
---
Sniper sneak builds are broken. I had to start a new Heavy Gunner toon as thats the only one left that works.
---
I was 18 months into it, then lockdown hit. It was helping, but slow going due to the mechanical injury to ol‚Äô noggin.
---
Class Freak ‚Äúnot working‚Äù is just a visual bug.
---
Yeah, do both sides up to the ‚ÄúSiding with...‚Äù quests.
---
The only three perks I can see can see this replacing are sun kissed (though not for me, since I don‚Äôt have anything better to use two of my four endurance for), rad sponge (which can be stronger in the right situation, but that doesn‚Äôt beat just preventing rads in the first place) and whatever the rad resist perk is.
---
It does synergize somewhat with ghoulish still, though, for solid healing.
---
I use carnivore for everything because your food comes to you and all you gotta do is put bullets in it.
---
What I would give to have another chance at that Elite riot armor. They pulled some fucky shit with that one
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been happening to me too. Although, it has been happening for a long time even before Meat Week. At West Tek, I‚Äôd find the items of super mutants just in a pile also.
---
When meat piles despawn, they sometimes leave items on the ground.
---
I was pissed when I missed the desert ranger armor by like a month
---
Scorchbeasts...the door dash of the wasteland ‚Ñ¢
---
Cheers!
---
Good to know!
---
Like I said, all the cosmetics, camp upgrades, icons, atoms and caps, yes.
---
I hear you hear.  And I think, why should I have to dump stuff I've earned just to play lol.  It's getting crazy uncontrollable now.
---
I end up pausing the game when trying to open the map on FO4, now.
---
lol
---
What happens when you reach 30k caps?
---
I got a good roll ts one and it's useless my normal shoguns do more damage now.
---
first thing: there are people who kept their mole miner pails from last event and when opening them now, they can get the new rewards. people pay out of the earth prices for the new stuff - which looks quite cool honestly.  
---
what do you mean with "boot me offline, common on xbox fo community"? i play on xbox, got about 400 hours in the game and never saw a cheater/hacker as far as i remember.   
---
and last point: if someone says give me all your stuff or i'll hack you its to 99,9999% kiddos trying to be cool or whatever. if they could, they would just do....when coming across strange people, what happend really really rare to me, just change the world and let them be assholes on their own. dont waste your spare gaming time with assholes.
---
See i agree, not asking for an insane increase but it would make a huge difference.
---
Just the weapon itself? Not much. Maybe like 500c. People can just craft them
---
The non legendary version of it probably isn‚Äôt worth anything as the plan now exists, but a legendary variant with great prefixes could be worth quite a bit. I think the mods are still pretty rare to get, not entirely sure.
---
You could use the mind blown emote from the Season? But good idea.
---
So the plan would be worth how much?
---
Maybe you would have to like choose 2 things
---
Do you perhaps mean meet sweats? That's an effect you get when turning in prime meat with Graham
---
Id be happy with that
---
Yeah, the plan is worth quite a bit at the moment.
---
Guess I have all your Caged Bulb Lights plans...
---
I wasn't certain about the inability to learn the plan for it. I had assumed that was the case from the lack of a Known Mods \[x/y\] in the workbench view, but I have still scrapped a lot of them in the hopes of learning it.
---
Just jokes on my half. 
---
When a low level buys at my camp I try to fast travel back in time to get there before they leave and give them a care package.
---
My prices are low to help the lower levels. Well except the rare items.
---
sorry for the late response, i was asleep 
---
that sounds really cool, maybe give those consumables a bit of a boost to their buffs so they have a bit of gameplay utility to them aswell
---
I am awake. I can help.
---
It makes more sense to craft your own serums and lose class freak since if you keep reapplying the serum there are no downsides
---
When un-looted enemies de-spawn, I don't know the timer, their inventory becomes free loot for anyone!
---
Nah, afaik it was always unlearnable. Way back in the day you could even apply the found mod to The Dragon - but that is also no longer possible :c
---
Wait is that the auto axe from the pitt dlc in fallout 3
---
I would be happy just to be able to plant cranberries.
---
The only issue I have with Minecraft of today is the continual need to add stuff to a world that really did not need this much in it. 
---
I sat down to play it the other day on my Xbox and there‚Äôs just way too much happening in a world that I would never want to play it on anything but peaceful. Underwater zombies, baby zombies, a bunch of new nether spawns. I don‚Äôt think I ever cared about hierarchy with the villagers. 
---
Or granite. Or quartz. Or colored clay blocks.
---
Yeah, doing events in a lvl 10 area is pretty boring for high lvls. Can't wait to see what happens next year now that One Wasteland is out! Lvl 75 Super Mutants and a lvl 100 Legendary at the end!
---
Well that kinda is exactly my point...the added convenience
---
Do you have grenades or mines? The legendary armor reduces the weight of those too
---
My usually reliable 10 cranberry plants at Aaronhold haven't respawned in days. Some disappear as I get to them if they respawn at all.
---
Definitely my big arse gun shouldn't be tickling enemies to death that not how big guns work would you you rather get hit with a 50 Cal or a 45 I know the 50 should do more damage per shot not dps.
---
Glow sights is a good one
---
Probably much messier to make work since your body can go flying when you die.
---
Likely Meat Sweats. You'll see it under the Effects tab of your SPECIAL part of the Pipboy.
---
Still gotta collect bloodleaf and soot flowers for healing salves ü§Ø I have a good amount of stimpaks but I want to stockpile further. 
---
Plus you only get purifiers a reasonable time in.
---
Ah right that was it. I thought I was supposed to get scrips? It‚Äôs a temporary effect?
---
It‚Äôs got to the point now for me that I sell them for dirt cheap at my CAMP like 50 caps per star unless it‚Äôs a good one and once I‚Äôm out of stash space I sell them to vendors and drop them for low levels to keep or scrip
---
Lol my bad
---
No scrips?
---
You also get scrip. Yes it's temporary, don't know what it does though. Never bothered looking
---
I like both, depending on situation.  I always carry both a Explosive and non-explosive (preferably fire rate) on all my characters.
---
Why logout? Try redeeming them while in the game.
---
The hunger/thirst really only effects low levels (well i mean you learn how to handle it as you play). I'd say lvls 1-20 are "wow this game is amazing", then lvls 21-40 are "Gosh damn do i hate this game!", then lvls 41-50 are "okay this game isnt so bad", AND THEN lvls 51-X are "wow this game is easy"
---
Fire proof or ghoulish
---
I already did that to one kit bundle, still nothing.
---
If you are bloodied then I'd say Radicool purely for the Carry Weight.
---
Downloaded the game three times :')
---
My guess is that they either haven't been claimed or you are looking in the wrong place for them.
---
So if you go over to nexusods you can make her a real mumma. There's a mod that gives deathclaws tittied. It's hilarious
---
Fuck yall lucky ass PC users. There is no reason they didnt ship perk load outs from launch.
---
Damn near every blood eagle is carrying a stimpak.   Flatwoods has crates of them.  
---
Mole miners drop miner suit scrap, which breaks down into black titanium.
---
Use stealth instead of plowing into welch guns blazing.  It isn't that hard.
---
Glow sights is in perception.
---
Then yer missing something man. Purifiers are easy to get if you do the main quest. Run the rivers and forest for blood leafs and spot flowers. Stimpaks you need to break down to diluted with the chemist perk and you will never run out. 
---
Come on bro, it's not that difficult.
---
Revenant is good in team situations. Especially with Earl and Queen.
---
the plan is worth quite a bit. id say dont sell it below 15 to 20k caps/ammo. when you keep it a while until meat week is over some time, prices will get higher as it wont be obtainable ingame anymore.  
---
the actual weapons get really expansive with the faster swing speed major and +1str minor, depening on the legendary effect. if you manage to get a B or Jfss1s tenderizer (perhaps AA also), it would be called god roll. youd get nearly everything for that.
---
I have nvidia gtx 1650ti, i don't think problem happens because of the video card. I have the latest driver.
---
As others have said, theres nothing special about it other than the bit of armor, rad protection, and stealth. However if you run a PA build, then it compliments that perfectly
---
Fallout 1st members barely get anything other than the release benefits, the survival tent &amp; the scrap box. :(
---
When I reach the next rank I claim then instantly. Nothing shows up and then I try logging out, going back in, still nothing
---
There are people on at all hours :)
---
There's a few in the Mirelurk invested water hazard at Whitespring. Agreed, they look very generic.
---
Sadly this is finished! I might go back and draw a really in depth one! This was just based on a patch hence all the negative space.
---
Public groups were made to combat that LFG anxiety. You don't need to speak to anybody in your group. I join a server, make a public daily ops group or join one, do my ops within 10 minutes and then leave without speaking to anybody
---
Radicool, fire proof, or rejuvenated are all good.  Could also go cannibal even with survival shortcut since u get healing and satisfaction from eating humans.. Yum.
---
Oh lol. That's what a baby does to you haha
---
The dog food perk is pretty good
---
Shhhhhhhh and it‚Äôs synth over here üòâ
---
I don't know what you mean by "nothing shows up".
---
I thought it was 50? I mean, I've seen more than 15 camps on the map before now, and surely not everyone has a vending machine.
---
Yeh, it misses all the time, i have to manually aim with my gauss shotgun.
---
Charleston DMV.  Lots of drug dealers.
---
The Tenderizer plan and mods are valuable. A tenderizer with a decent main perk and faster swing speed should also be able to find a buyer.
---
That's what most of us assumed
---
I gave a wad away this morning at the translation to someone that came along.  Crazy isn't it.
---
I saw someone nuke near Top of the World once. Don‚Äôt know what level they were, but I still felt kinda bad for them.
---
Can someone explain to me how you even get scrip in the meat week event? I've done the cookout thing multiple times and I thought you had to put the prime meat you get in the center barrel thing to get scrip but I have never got any.
---
You guys are the worst part of reddit. You love to argue everything but you're always so fricken dumb with the worst arguments.
---
Look under MISC. They're probably in a container. I haven't claimed any of that stuff yet because I don't have the space.
---
&lt;chortles in minecraft abandoned mineshafts&gt;
---
Other than the weapon damage being nerfed excessively, the rest of the update is pretty solid.  I'm not struggling too much with enemies, and the extra XP is nice.  If they'd give back about 30% of the damage that they took away, I'd give the update 10/10.  As of now.. 7.5/10 because with the anemic feeling weapons the fun factor has definitely diminished.
---
if you dont use dog food or nuka cola and arent a bloodied build, id go for fireproof. its at least something if a car blows up next to you or the enemies in the daily op got the explosion mutation.
---
After I claim the reward I check my inventory/stash - nothing. It says in the reward description that when I login in adventure mode I'll receive. So I log out, log in again and still nothing. That's what I mean, I hope you understand
---
Here here!!
---
Nice, I was using an executioners fixer for a long time. The problem with the lever action is just the firing speed, its so slow.
---
I was a hold out from playing bloodied for a long time. I had a full armor set to put on when I bought serum recipes so I could get the price down. But during the mumbles sale, I was given a BE vats crit handmade, and a BE vats crit minigun. One right after the other, which is some kind of luck.
---
But don't get me wrong, the game is fun as bloodied, fun as full health, fun in general to me.
---
I like that idea.
---
It'd be nice to load a workshop up with all the plants I need for chems and just turbo fert the shit out of them. It's probably why they don't want to let us do it.
---
At least there are 2 easy areas to gather all the ingredients for over a hundred mentats and berry mentats.
---
You have your answer, but if you really want to know what sweet meat is than it's not really anything more than an old word for candy. 
---
Unless you look it up on Urban Dictionary. But even then it isn't even all that bad.
---
I totally agree. And I hope nobody post about legacies on this. Not everybody has or can get a legacy.
---
Even those miss with this bug. Frustrating.
---
I love Fallout. It's arguably my favorite franchise, not that I've played a ton. With that said, I wasn't looking forward to multiplayer and with the game not available on steam and having terrible reviews, I held off. Finally it shows up on a steam sale and I bought it in July. It was the right decision. Multiplayer wasn't the big deal I thought it would be. The community is great and the game is buggy but still a lot of fun and very well done overall.
---
I only recently started using my two shot gauss shotgun. It rarely misses the first shot. I find it to be completely unusable without VATs though. It seems to take 8+ shots to put anything down without VATs, but in VATs it's like a sniper rifle.
---
Man as much as I hate to admit it, it took me about 45 minutes walking around the white springs bunker to find the nuclear keycard, only to find I had to try and destroy a FLYING FUCKIN CARGO BOT
---
The only reliable fix I've found is to lock on VATS, cancel VATS then lock on again. If you practice it you'll get good at the triple press it requires. The second lock on seems to almost always hit as advertised.
---
Both herbivore and carnivore get the same buff foods, only differences are...
---
Carnivore gets melee damage food exclusively.
---
Herbivore gets crit damage buff food exclusively.
---
Neither of these affect you as a heavy gunner, so go with the one you prefer. Carvivore is imo simpler as you don't need to worry about growing veggies or going to fields to pick them up. With carnivore you just eat what you kill.
---
I saw someone else on here say the same thing a while back. I've just been ignoring that one until they add a reward for it!
---
Oh, ok, I didn't know that. Thanks mate
---
In a world where its perpetually a week before Halloween, I beg to differ that time matters at all.
---
Yeah happens to me just about every day. I have to completely exit the game to get it to stop
---
Thanks for the reply I‚Äôll definitely check it out :)
---
Yeah I do all that, that's what I meant. If I'm doing all that I'm not adventuring, you gotta take time out to gear up. Doing it efficiently with the right set up is great but you still got actually do it!
---
You have to do that in every MMO. Seeing as how inferior this engine is to those games that will never change
---
This! Melee can still take out the trash just fine, but for any tanky boss you can't even keep up with ranged damage anymore. The trade-off for having to be up close was supposed to be increased damage, but now there's just no advantage to playing melee. That goes double for bloodied melee.
---
As well as, please give us like ‚Äúinterior wall‚Äù that‚Äôs able to have wallpaper on both sides.
---
its happening since a while. very annoying and hopefully they hotfix it soon.  
---
workaround: when started the game, check your progress on the title screen in the lower right. if it says 1/1 and the bar is filled, open the scoreboard once and and go back. it should show your correct rank now and work properly.
---
This game isn't capable of something like that as nice as it would be.
---
I would love this I have 4 characters and I hate having to jump out especially if I have a good map where people are doing events and stuff but I‚Äôve maxed out on how much weight I can carry from legendaries I pick up or I have max scrip or something I just swap characters but it is such a pain.
---
I was probably in a minority then. Ive been out of the loop and didn't know what it was. Especially since I didnt know The last event was cancelled due to bugs
---
My guy, there are bugs from Skyrim still in this game. Don't get your hopes up.
---
I hear ya. I'm just saying it doesn't take that long to prep. IMO. Sorry I wasn't trying to be a dick haha
---
Yeah I'm investing in a few of the cards that increase thirst/hunger quenching levels. Real qol stuff üëå
---
It was such a great event!! I had just started playing and I got so many legendaries to help get me on my feet. That event is a million times better than meat week. The whole server comes out and participates (or just hangs out). There were so many high levels just dumping dozens of plans and extra legendary gear, I ended up with so much stuff. Ahh I have such fond memories of that event.
---
LOL :D
---
People need them for a possum badge. I‚Äôve seen them in vendors for up to 20K
---
I‚Äôll try that out next time
---
Does 1 star ghoulish regen much hp?
---
I'm wondering if it would even work if I have high rad resistance with the what rads legendary perk.
---
I'm full health so radicool wont work and I've cut the fat and have am around 190/376 weight so dont it.
---
The purveyor who gives you currency (scrip) for unwanted legendaries and let's you spend the currency for a chance at a more specific legendary (armor, melee or ranged weapon).
---
Public teams
---
NPCS, new quest lines
---
Daily ops
---
Legendary crafting (unlocked after completing new main quest)
---
Legendary perks
---
I'm sure theres more but those were all really big changes
---
jup rank 1 fireproof is  better than nothing.
---
I wish you did know why because both could be seen as pretty weird to a normal person.  Not sure what the difference is.
---
Yes you can get a two shot explosive gattling gun, it's not legacy though. They can still drop
---
Lol not all that awful!
---
I would wait. You'll probably end up with junk anyway and it will be low level junk so no one will want it. Just keep scripping and leveling up.
---
Yeah the ratio of adventure/resupply is still firmly in adventures favour. 
---
Every so often you gotta go back for r&amp;r, dump scrap etc. Plus if you get a really nasty fight where you run out of ammo/chems way quicker you end up going back more frequently. 
---
It's just another layer of time investing to be aware of in the game. My usual session start involves running through flatwood to mass gather (with green thumb) soot, bloodleaf and random other bits for food, repair and restock ammo and then see which quest I fancy ü§ó
---
But some folk might get put off by this, I guess.
---
Have been saying this since beta.
---
You can plant 5-7 melons in your camp and have a completely sustainable food and water source as a herbivore.
---
That's pretty dang simple.
---
You mean play the game with those that use  frog legs and know where all the good weapons drops are who rove in packs of 4 practically one shotting everybody? No thanks, there is a reason I always last as long as I do.
---
Not gonna lie, I was hoping for something along the lines of sexualized cannibalism. What a disappointment! Ha!
---
They are trying to free up perk points and trim the fat.
---
People dont yet really know how the legendary perks affect things
---
Oh that‚Äôs hot ü•µ lol. Do you have any friends that are traders? I have quite a few caps I‚Äôm looking for a gun to get the best out of my build.
---
I've been overloaded with scrip weapons since Fasnacht.
---
That‚Äôs bait and switch which is not FOMO. 
---
FOMO isn‚Äôt a scam either but a marketing tactic. And it is unfair to people who join late. FOMO is built around scarcity and digital goods have no scarcity as they aren‚Äôt actual physical goods with limited inventory. 
---
Timed digital gear should be offered for sale to 1st members after it is a free giveaway. They have the free atom to spare and the potential interest, so why gate it around genuine removal from the store? If you make people spend their free atom on 1st exclusives they have to spend actual money on other items.
---
Oh so it's more graphics glitching on you than mobs being stuck.
---
If that's happening ,try updating your video drivers to the latest ones off the manufacturer's website. There's often a lot of fixes for specific AAA title games they put in there over time that you may be missing fixes for. Or it could just be the game :/
---
Yes, if you want to spend camp budget on it.
---
Ah, ok, then you have every right to be annoyed.
---
You know the creek that runs through the forest?  If not, it's the one that passes by the Wayward.  Lure Weed grows along it.
---
I think there‚Äôs a few that spawn in the Flatwoods agricultural center, but that‚Äôs it. And they aren‚Äôt plants, just the item.
---
Once and my buddy killed him seconds after. I've played 200 hours and been off and on active since beta
---
Hmmmmmmmm wonder if that would be a thing to try...clear it on a slower rank. Then do a speed run. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't each rank have a % of a rare. Wouldn't it make more aense to run it 3 times on each level to try ...or is the elder all 3 levels of % added and that equals 80%?
---
like which?
---
Unless they've changed it for some reason, the corpse will (should) reappear where it originally died at as a gore pile. Regardless of where it ragdolled to. This usually takes a couple minutes but sometimes it's quite quick.
---
I'm over on xbox so not really. Head to
---
 r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 without the periods for all your trading needs
---
Thank you so much! Take all my upvotes I‚Äôd give more if I could.
---
Pistol vats agility builds are great at looting runs
---
I equip my 2 shot explosive revolver with all pistol perks, gun runner, action boy and a few other bits for ap regen. Also use 1 piece of chameleon armour for going into hidden. 
---
I can blitz through the prison and most events by vats spamming and jumping around continuously. I don't even have to use stimpaks since as soon as my health is low I just hide with my armour for a few seconds and I can fully heal up with mutations. 
---
Even big events, I'll tagging enemies the instant they're in range to make sure I get the loot. It's good for other players since I take a good amount of health but never enough to completely one shot, unless they're weak enemies and I shoot to quick.
---
I've specced into strength aswell for my shotgun perks so I can switch to my 2 shot explosive sawn off
---
Pistols do need a bit of a buff though, I've been running/building this build since the beta and have been nerfed countless times.
---
This has been happening to me too, since yesterday (Sept 3), on xbox.  If it helps, it first happened at the end of a daily ops, and I had to restart the console to get it to stop.  The problem started to happen again this morning, but then stopped.  I was not doing a daily ops, the SCORE level up was from glowing creatures.
---
I always waited till 50 but a few days ago I decided to start a new character and rolled for 2 stars at level 20. Got a decent junkies power attack melee and it sure makes farming XP easier. With one wasteland it can be a little tough in the mid levels without a good weapon, I say go for it. I would go for 2 star at first since all the critical damage effects are 1 or 2 star rolls. The third star isn't as critical. Better to get decent gear quicker then try to upgrade
---
Yea the armour i think is 26 lbs. I know the chest is 9 alone.
---
That was just last week, [this week has a new thing every day in the last tab.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3k2GGXBgyZ5pjsFeSp52ID/atomic-shop-weekly-update-september-22-29)

[love is love](https://imgur.com/a/R0uancv)

It could be interesting.  That perk definitely needs some changes.
---
That was the was I did it before WO.

I see no reason to throw those card-points onto an alt that I'll never play, and with the lvl-"balancing"...

Public Teams are built for the antisocial in this game. You're not forced into anything and can pretty much go about your business, earning the bonus of the team and bringing in your own bonuses as well as some money for every quest completed. You're a valued part of the crew even if you never see another member. 
---
The exception would be Daily Ops teams which are really set up to help people playing Daily Ops by joining them.
---
One Wasteland has surely made it easier to level up. Hell, I used to struggle to level up more than twice in a week, but last night I played so much that I ended up leveling up 5 different times.
---
thanks ill check it out
---
ill check it out thanks
---
Ever had a Scorchbeasts corpse follow you around? Scortchbeast are just fart bats on a Skyrim dragon coding.
---
Frankly, anything would be better than the current version. It also would make its admittedly nice looking particle effect show up in gameplay.
---
It really means a lot to us camp builders when we have a visitor and we get a heart emote....I fully support a less ambiguous emote.
---
u/Ne0nP1nk , This is happening to me today when I finally got around to building it. I wonder if Beth took it down due to an exploit or stacking bonus situation?
---
Well there is a global pandemic going on right now IRL and some people are truly displaced by it financially, sooooo, the base game as it is now may be all they can afford to commit to. I mean my Xbox Live is paid for though next year, so I‚Äôm not going out of my way to take on new expenses.
---
Yeah traveling there hasn‚Äôt triggered anything
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Any caps earned disappear, 30k is the max
---
I have a .50 cal myself that I'm about to consider priming. Hell, I have the resources to prime all my weapons. Not to mention the Ammo Factory legendary perk and the Ammosmith stack with it will produce 900 Ultracite .50 cal in a single craft
---
If you're on PC, hit me up in about 2-2.5 hours (Lamorak\_2000). I'll help you out if I can
---
I‚Äôve talked to both, Rocksy talked about loyalty, and wren just says random speech too
---
Same here, helped a couple of new players run their daily ops, joined every public event that popped and did some of my own questing on a character I was over leveled for pre one wasteland and actually enjoyed replaying the new content. For me personally the game has been revitalized
---
Thanks so much, let's hope they fix it.
---
People seem to want them with the right prefixes of course, and if it has faster swing speed and +1 strength you shouldn't have any trouble selling. I purposely avoided learning the plan bc I don't want to get any of those monsters üòÇ

I'm now picturing someone laying on the ground with a hangover, tapping their pipboy like a key fob with the fusion core noise playing from the ditch next to them.
---
I wouldn't mind a C.A.M.P. Size increase either
---
For general use I still prefer my .50 or Gatling Gun, but fights vs a Boss the energy weapons are very nice with the large clip size and economical ammo.  I see no reason to take one over the other when I can have both.
---
Quack mask also has a headlamp/flashlight beam.
---
Yeah I feel that. I've been enjoying it more often than just hopping on, doing daily tasks for 30 minutes, then hopping off.
---
Submit a ticket to support with some proof, see if they will compensate.
---
As a yearly subscriber, I agree we should be able to access all first content. You can't make an exclusive club if you're going to keep people in different rooms.
---
Foosball would honestly make more sense as luck, if you ask me, since the game is more about having the ball go to the right place and reacting to it.
---
But yeah, the shooting range definitely should be buffing perception.
---
The view scoreboard from the main menu works initially but when I increase SCORE level again during play, it's back to the 15 minutes of receiving the SCORE noise and pop up box over and over. Mistiming a map/world view brings you to the Scoreboard, which is irritating.
---
If you log in and it says 1/1 in the upper right, go to the Legendary Run option from the main menu, view the board, then go back to the main menu and check it. It should then display the correct rank and you won't get the spam.
---
Just make a habit of checking the current rank before you enter a world until they fix it.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Thank you, this makes sense. I am pretty sure my SCORE was at 1 this morning (after console restart last night).  I try this later today.
---
I want the Corvega water thing and the regular Vault-tec benches. are those 1st things? or is beth just dumb with their Disney-esk fake digital scarcity nonsense?
---
Give em back. Lol
---
Same! Lol
---
much like IRL, "fashion" is subjective and highly dependent on personal preference of what looks good.
---
Why would that be such a complex feature? All I see is data that leaves the server and new data that joins while the overal account data is still retained by the server. A private server keeps you tagged while you leave and re-join with another character. That one single less step would let us switch directly inside it.
---
Theres a max of 30 plans to look through and you can scroll down the list in like 1 second. Its not exactly a laborious task.
---
And if you hide known plans you could miss some bargains.
---
I always try to make mixed scorchbeast meat stew after scorched earth but always seem to be one organ short.
---
Would be a very nice improvement.
---
Thank you, I will do this.
---
In my experience, Stealth Commando is viable whether Bloodied or not. 
---
Not Bloodied bashing,  but it's not for me.
---
And has a bright light. I use it for burning mine special ops
---
TIL. Thanks!
---
Do you know how ridiculous it sounds to shame a consumer in defense of a corporation looking to profit off of FOMO marketing tactics for digital goods?
---
There is a pure digital inventory here. Your grocery store example does not apply. 
---
Pretty much every other point is valid. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt owe anyone timed skins but they also should not keep it limited.
---
It took me 2 years after launch to even find it
---
I have the exact same issue with the Gauss Pistol. Every single first shot in Vats will miss and fly over the targets head.  Only when I charged it up and then used Vats would I be able to land a shot. 
---
You would think fixing the newer Wastelander's weapons are somewhat high in the priority list for Bethesda.  Fingers crossed it gets fixed before the end of the year.
---
More of a meme. Those guns pretty much suck
---
I thought dropping a nuke on a camp was the universal "nice camp" emote? /s
---
Things breaking slower. Dr er after 350 means very little in this game
---
local maps were garbage. zero effort should ever be put towards them again.
---
Let's just scrap the whole fallout 1st
---
Give everyone their moneys worth back in atoms along with the free ones they've already had. Put all the items on a huge permament score system which all players climb with optional ranking up with atoms kept so people with fuck tons can just buy there way up.
---
So you incentive people to buy as they want to reach a certain piece but at the same time new players are also following along. So it's one big giant race for the best camps, skins and items.
---
Not the best idea but would be alot less aggressive than it is now
---
The grocery store running a limited time offer is the same fomo used in limited time offers in the game. There is no difference, the grocery store controls the prices, Bethesda controls the release of limites content. Either can choose when they want to offer and remove. Its not in defense of, it's matter of fact. Consumers are not entitled to any more than what is offered. Plain and simple.
---
The problem is as soon as they do that, they have zero excuse to not keep the higher cap going. You may as well ask for a general increase.
---
I've been a member since day one, and I had no idea new members couldn't get past items.  I was under the impression as soon as you joined you'd get the full list of items.  I guess it kind of makes sense that it doesn't work that way (from a business perspective).  
---
What do new members get??  Do you guys get the mothman and robo dance emote?
---
It does well on regular mobs but useless on bosses and scorchbeasts
---
a solid bloody build shouldnt be dependant on 20 more damage so go for slower break.  
---
i switched bloody mess with ricochet to test in on my bloody commando (non stealth) and will leave it like that. the damage reflection is better then a little bit more damage. i go by the maxim: as long i down 95% of the enemies with 2 shots, its enough damage.
---
Ok so your point is? There is literally no point there? Other then stating a fact. I understand that some people can‚Äôt afford it and things are rough in some sectors. But that is also true about all products. The fact that some people can‚Äôt afford a service has nothing to say about said service. If you are employed and live in the 1st world you should in normal circumstances be able to buy a 14$ subscription. If you can‚Äôt you can‚Äôt.
---
The b.o.s jumpsuit is rare I totally threw that away
---
Hope you will come out of this pandemic on your feet :)
---
I'd also like the Power Attack for Chainsaws from New Vegas!
---
In the long run you‚Äôre not going to use explosives, if you enjoy melee, then a heavy guns/melee build might be the way to go
---
I do the blank perk load out.  Works wonderfully.
---
I play on PS4.
---
It‚Äôs 20 fps while sitting next to a jet engine or die
---
My instigating handmade rifle went from 1200 sneak attack headshots to ~250. 
---
Also sneak is whack right now so you only get one sneak attack. 
---
Also there is still the insane damage rollback if I shoot my semi-auto handmade too fast.
---
I'm not having fun while playing so I quit, simple as that.  If you aren't having fun then find a game to play where you will have fun.
---
There are plenty of mods that give armor penetration though, he probably should try and grab both the mods and the perks he needs
---
I don‚Äôt think legendary ones drop - at least from meat weak - it‚Äôs just a regular one. I do have the salt and pepper plans so I could mod it but not sure whether people would care
---
Is makeshift warrior worth it on max rank or should I go with it on 2 and stuff like night eyes and aquagirl?
---
Ya there are some armor penetrating mods for weapons as well as perks, usually for guns it's the different types of magazines
---
I just fired mine up again... GPU usage only 4.3% sitting on the menu, roughly 17% while playing sparky.
---
I'm set to 2560x1440 windowed (i have a massive ultra wide, so this sits windowed with stat tracking spreadsheets on either side), 60FPS max limit, High AA, and everything else turned OFF. It's butter smooth... MOST of the time. It still chokes/studders once in a while.  and I'm using a 3900x, 2070s, 16gb, SSDs.   
---
My wife's has the same settings (lower res in her case) on her XPS13 with Intel IGP, and it's butter smooth even on that... most of the time.
---
Arena's graphics options are very poorly optimized, turning them off helps even higher end PCs surprisingly.
---
Now of course this doesn't address the fact that it appears your GPU isn't being used. Make sure you grab the latest drivers off nVidia's site and do a clean install option.
---
They could totally code it.  I mean the excavator power armor grants more ore, so the logic is there.
---
Glad you got some advice. I use mine pretty regularly on bosses and it's definitely doable. The community manager here said it is something that is known to the dev team and is going to require major work on the VATs system so I wouldn't expect a fix soon but they are aware of it.
---
It's the tall cooking pot on the central campfire. Wait until you see the prompt and spam E. you can get 15 scrip per event I think
---
No I only have a camera and shotgun in my weapon menu
---
That got annoying once I happened to run into legendaries that popped into a million pieces and I couldn't find the remains to loot. :)
---
Honestly I haven't noticed a difference (flaming longbow version).  The numbers are still super low, but seem to cut through enemies at about the same speed.
---
I don't know what logging in and logging out has to do with it.
---
Ohh if it's not legendary then get your 11 caps and be done with it. Legendary versions do drop btw, if you know the plan.
---
Is makeshift warrior worth it on max rank or should I go with it on 2 and use stuff like night eyes and aquagirl?
---
Good tips - long as I'm sub 8 I'm happy
---
After you learn the recipe to craft them you can get a legendary one (recipe drops from meat week as well)
---
I love Rejuvenated.  Fireproof is probably a stronger pick overall, especially if you plan to run the Uplick op regularly.
---
Drop the explosives and go two handed melee, right i would say unarmed but updaye 22 needed that into the ground.. meat week can drop the tenderizer plan which makes you able to get it legemdary, very good 2h. And the daily ops drop the godly war glaive. Enjoy
---
I just unequip them normally and dont have a backpack and this only happens for weapon weight legendary armor parts not the aid ones or the junk ones
---
In a similar vein, can we add letting us put wallpaper on the garage door wall piece?
---
I'd love to plant and grow cranberries, which I find useful all the time, as opposed to razorgrain, etc., which only seem to be useful for certain quests.
---
im not really into melee builds but forget about aquagirl, thats one of the most useless perks overall.
---
Some generous person just gave me one thank you for your offer but save the flux for your self
---
The brotherhood outpost thing on the scoreboard would have made a perfect tent replacement.
---
I'd love the Deliverer from FO4
---
Yes please. The only time I ever get bounties is when people do the glitch to put the ammo factories from corvega in their bases. I pick all the locks and take it all from every machine so they aren't able to claim it. Maybe it's mean but they shouldn't be glitching, so I, as a loyal member of the enclave, feel it is my duty to confiscate it for our use. Plus, I can just let someone kill me after and go clean out the machines without getting a bounty at all after that unless they realize and relock them. I especially dislike it when they sell this ammo in their vendors. To me it's a big no no so I take action lmao
---
Auto launcher is a lot of fun, fatman is ok too if you can get a whole bunch of mob together, but all explosive weapons break super fast and they work like wet noodles on the queen and earle. Normal SBs can still be killed quickly using an auto launcher.
---
Possibly but maybe that is the solution, an overall raise.
---
I never said they were dangerous
---
Ahh right that makes sense, thanks.
---
yeah that‚Äôd be more useful than the non legendary drop - I‚Äôll just dump it then. Seems totally worthless and I‚Äôll hold out for the plan
---
Only if my health were to ever drop. Full health pa build here.
---
Thanks for you‚Äôre response!! I left that world quick and continued my night lol and to explain myself i come across a lot of people online on the lfg on fallout I know I expose myself to them IP wise but I just like playing with others and actually mainly find good awesome people to play with but sometimes I run into some dude that shows off he can boot and this and that, whenever I hear something like that I leave party and block immediately I hate that, another example,  I made a post on lfg letting people know I have trade-able items and out of nowhere I get a message saying ‚Äútake the post down or I‚Äôll boot you‚Äù i guess it‚Äôs just people you run into or my personal experience to be real
---
My build uses Fist weapons and Heavy guns with the Explosive legendary mod and it is my favorite build in the game. Blow things up, then punch them. Grab demolitions expert and grenaider for extra damage and explosion radius then grab yourself a nice auto grenade launcher and have a grand ole time! If you really need to tear into a boss then forego the fist and hop into a nice set of PA and use the stabilized perk and grab a minigun or some other fun ballistic weapon!
---
I want to relive my Farmville days üò§üò§ gimme dem crops

Well thanks so much for the help fellow wastelander maybe settlers aren't so bad after all...
---
If they‚Äôre smart, not much. While it‚Äôs a rare reward, it‚Äôs from an event that isn‚Äôt limited time. 
---
If I didn‚Äôt already have a few, I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than maybe 1k, at most. And that‚Äôs if I was near max caps already and hadn‚Äôt sold my junk today to get my 1400 vendorbot caps.
---
I‚Äôm talking Heavy 1* that just eats up stash
---
I don‚Äôt believe so.
---
Na people who pay for Fallout 1st deserve a new armor every month for free and weapon skin since you know we pay.
---
The reason you can't get the old stuff is because if you could, people would sign up for a month, binge all of the exclusives, then cancel and wait to sign up again once there's a bunch of new things available.  The timed exclusivity sucks but it's there for a reason.  I do feel like FO1st is not providing much in general though.  I don't use the private server ability.  I'm really only getting the stash box, the atoms, and maybe one item a month out of it.  It's nice, but I feel like they ought to be able to do better than that compared to what I see in ESO Plus.

I have had this happen to me too. And I am pretty sure it happens with my first gun when I first start playing. I switch to a second gun, and it works.  And when I switch back to the first gun, the "no ammo" problem is gone.  It happens pretty sporadically.
---
Brain fungus at the purveyor haven been  
---
Respawning for me.
---
I'm not far off man. My stash is full. My inventory is pushing it. And that's just with 3 star stuff. I just have a hard time dumping it
---
The cash register at the purveyor or the ice machine at Whitesprings Station are where I dump my extras.
---
Imagine how great that friendship would translate if we have options of creating group based town settlements, with a member being classed as leader and saving that workshop instance to his character. You could all build, log off and then join together later when he returns and continue. It could work pretty much the same way camp's work, someone took that workshop? Want to change servers? 
---
Personally id impose a 1 workshop limit with blueprints being available for future building. 
---
Everyone can choose to be a leader at a workshop and save the work. So if your friend isn't online you can have your own workshop with another group. Turn camps into ways to point people towards a settlement you've built. The longer you keep the settlement going the more things you can build. You can tear it down to relocate but you will have to rebuild again. Even workshop daily rewards for travelling to your settlement and doing something could be implemented
---
It really annoys me how useless workshops in the current state are. They're a pointless feature and only used by PVPers who want to grief new players struggling to find resources. Workshops are the worst places for it
---
Thank you!!
---
I have this issue almost daily, and when I go to check the SCORE board at the login screen, the board is completely black. I always have to enter the game and complete a daily, then it goes through all the levels. Checking the SCORE board at login doesn't work at all for me.
---
I tend to dump my trash legendaries next to a scrip machine, either at whitespring or the rusty pick for people to dig through.
---
Nope. You can't get coins back
---
Unless they fixed it, it doesn't spawn anywhere. Visit the restaurant in The Whitespring. One of the Vendors in there sometimes sells it
---
Thanks for the sense of relief!!
---
Not only is it not a limited time event, this is an event that you will need to do every day to get score points. So, people will pretty much be running this every day for the next two months just to rank up score. At that point, it is almost guaranteed that most people will have at least 2-3 sets, if not more, assuming they are reaching elder rewards every day.
---
No you can't. Just like you can't downgrade a normal perk-card.
---
It is worse. I believe the rankings are war glavie, sheep staff, tendy, super sledge
---
Man how do you get all the ingredients for that stuff and keep it fresh? I never bother cooking because I only have the ingredients for simple meats and soups. By the time I gather enough stuff for sweet rolls or s‚Äômores or whatever stuff starts spoiling!
---
So all those perk points are just gone eh wow
---
Can we get a damn workshop update, they're absolutely useless and have way more potiental than tiny camps.
---
Word, I‚Äôve heard of the register at the pick but I just want to make sure it gets in someone else‚Äôs hands. I hope everyone checks it like I do everytime lol
---
Thank you for the advice. Just submitted and will try to reply if I get a response from Bethesda.
---
Promotions of real world goods using FOMO are based around scarcity. If inventory was available to satiate an audience completely, it would not be FOMO. Sneaker launches have FOMO. $.99 a pound brisket is not. It will go on sale again later or will be marked down further if it does not sell well. 
---
FOMO is entirely based around some people not getting a limited good.
---
Dudeee people can be childish, he sounded grown too and the girl had me very confused where the toxic vibes were coming from smh
---
That's a problem for me as well. I just sell all my 1\* and 2\* items to vendorbots now.
---
Absolute legend! Stealing this, thanks for the lolz.
---
Keep running Daily Ops, you'll get it eventually.
---
I will keep it on, I would hate to accidentally stumble into a decontamination arch.
---
Same here, when I scrip every day, I make sure I do the heavies first. Still seems like I‚Äôll forever be full though
---
No everyone prioritizes video game subscriptions in their budget.
---
Good luck! Hope to hear some good news soon.
---
Which seems to be getting easier and easier. Last night we finished at like 6:20 I think. 
---
Teslas work really well against Cloaked enemies.
---
I must be missing them by the read of things, I normally get them all
---
For sure, I probably have like 50-75 90% weight lol
---
Yup, its the main reason I refuse to buy anything from the atom shop anymore. No excuses for shit like this anymore. The foosball table is all I wanted and I even spent a few atoms to get it earlier. You hear me devs? Shit is getting OLD.
---
Tenderizer is a clout weapon. You use it for appearances. And you better get 90% reduced weight because it it‚Äôs heavy
---
Oh my god you're right. How did i never notice that
---
I suppose you were going to say not? Ok then that‚Äôs their deal, now what does that then have to do with this service? Why do people complain about it? Because they want it for free? And again what‚Äôs your point?
---
I've been lucky with my VFFR tesla in Dailly Ops so far... Knock on wood... üò¨
---
Technically all builds are viable. If an all-in food build is viable, an explosives one is too.
---
The latest patch seems to have help with the effectiveness of explosive but I get the sense that a pure explosives build would mostly act in a support capacity during large public events.
---
Fireproof also protects against scorchbeast sonic attacks, which is nice.
---
Once.    This was way back when the game first came out.     I had a camp in the mire and two guys came to my my camp and starting shooting stuff and trying to get me to fight them.    I just quit the server before they did too much damage.    This was way before vending machines were a thing.    
---
Other than that I‚Äôve had people show up at my camp and just try to shoot me.  I have pacifist mode on , so they are not doing any damage.  I have a mic and tell them but they still will keep shooting.     ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
if you think about it all the plants we can currently plant are plants that existed before the great war (minus mute fruit that one makes no sense to plant) and would explain why our planting list is limited.
---
except pumpkins, why can we not plant them?
---
Well the legendary perk card keeps its upgrades in case you switch it back on later 
---
So it's not like it's actually completely wasted
---
 they don't care about patch 23 because of cool games? 
---
Sounds like they're bored with 76
---
Not to sure about this anymore, changing between sentinel assassin combat armor and leather make a huge difference in pvp when it comes to tanking energy weapons. Then there's the normal lasers now shredding...
---
Also in heavy leather I can withstand 3 max level assausltrons beaming me up in heavy leather without Stims, but I can't in combat, or scout.
---
I think Dr is actually working properly or atleast it's got better with patch 22. Can't just be a coincidence, to many factors.
---
What they are.
---
Oh how I‚Äôd love to not have to go to Aaronholt twice a day lol
---
Yeah I‚Äôve just been selling them too now - getting far too much scrip and can‚Äôt even get rid of it - it‚Äôs getting to be a bit of a pointless mechanism
---
Fallout 76‚Äôs equivalent to Skyrim: Become Horse glitch.
---
I‚Äôd love this to be traded or make the weapon tradeable
---
Gone? No, you keep the level of the cards.
---
Ghoulish is actually amazing with what rads, as you do take some rad damage, but if it's under 6/sec, you heal from it instantly.
---
Thus you'll get some passive healing, even in combat from rads.  I'm running max ghoulish, so I have no idea about the benefits of one rank, but this is just my thoughts.
---
In your situation though, I'd probably just go with fireproof just for explosive resist and scorchbeast screams.
---
This is a good idea but fails later when you find yourself constantly at max caps daily nothing left to spend it on lol.  Yep I'm there too.
---
I do like running ops, but I can see after obtaining elder there is little incentive to do it again that day. I don't particularly need any more scrip weapons. 
---
Imagine when people have received all the rare rewards in the coming weeks, wonder how hard it will be to get anyone to do them.
---
I'm level 419, i still run from a mini gun mutant if it trys aiming at me
---
Tbh, glaive looks pretty clout too with some of its attachments 
---
But yea I'm a hammer boi so I'm trying to get a nice tendy soon haha
---
If I get Elder Rank I usually stop doing it.    
---
Tonight I‚Äôm going to do it using my fixer to stock up on ammo.
---
If Bethesda would just release the Heavy mod for SS...
---
Have some emotes been removed? I used to have the salute emote but it's since vanished from my character and not available in the atom store.
---
Blueprint cramming on a farmable tile is very helpful for an adhesive farm, just imagine if you could make it a relish farm üò≥
---
The Fallout community is so weird, for a wasteland everyone is way to afraid of some PvP. I was wanted for over an hour because nobody would even attempt to kill me. I had to wait until my friend logged on to kill me. Why this community is so afraid of PvP I will never understand.
---
It's way cooler to actually hear someone say wow nice camp them to see a lame emote.
---
When it's winter, of course
---
I use the cash register at the purveyor, the trash can next to the bathroom at train stations or I'll drop a bag on top of the stash box, the first aid kit in Ward's trailer, and occasionally a bag on the desk next to the Fertile Soil completion terminal.
---
What's?
---
I just dumped  around 10 1*s at the white springs train station. 
---
If this gluttony of legendaries continues, we are going to be back to where we where a year plus ago when any commonly used container was full of legendaries.
---
That thing on All Rise
---
Access the scoreboard before entering a server on each session
---
I don‚Äôt think you even need to make it free. Just make it available for those with an active subscription. 
---
I‚Äôm more than a little sad so many people are okay with forced digital scarcity, but there‚Äôs plenty of people who purposely build camps at power stations for free fusion cores that take forever to grind out instead of just scavenging for them. 
---
Your money, your time, but don‚Äôt denigrate people who understand how this model works against consumers.
---
The family sharing has always been a thing for ps4. Thats why I have two, double the games, one copy for me, one for my son. It‚Äôs great
---
I usually drop my unwanted stuff at train stations. A lootbag in front of the vendor can easily be seen, perhaps someone will make good use of them.
---
Yea but im changing from my unarmed build, so now those points are wasted
---
Agreed!! My commando for the plan but my melee is still grinding for it, go figure
---
No i have it in asking what people will give me for it
---
I will certainly try this, thank you.
---
thanks! really appreciate you taking the time to write all that
---
Yeah I found out recently that thats actually what happened, weight benches were disabled due to the stacking
---
Yesssss!!! And a broken version also üòÇ
---
Your welcome! I'm always helping people by taking their junk so they are no longer weighed down with all that crap. Its tough work but it is very rewarding!
---
Honestly, since you could already build a character for solo or team play that can out heal the damage it takes(more so now with "What Rads?"), it'd be hard for Blood Sacrifice with what it currently gives, to be broken no matter how it triggers.
---
It's the most useless Legendary perk.
---
I saw on the discord auctions one went for 250k caps!! People are crazy man
---
I wish we had a set order of operations for this. I've been grinding ops for scrip and i get really really thrown off when randos join and go to beta first for some reason when I've been doing it Alpha then Beta for 3+ hrs
---
I don‚Äôt see the point when there‚Äôs still so much of this map under utilised or not even used at all.
---
that would be awesome
---
just DO it. the game throws so much legendaries to scrip at you with the time that you will get stash problems...
---
I dropped bags full of them at every meat cook yesterday.
---
The Auto Grenade Launcher is good, but it breaks quickly and explosives do jack shit against SBQ.
---
I'd use a flamer as well, but fuel is expensive and flamers do not break so much slower. There is also that range bug that cause the need to re-mod everytime you change server.
---
Sneakers are produced in limited supply intentionally, its not as though there is a lack of resources. A sale is a sale, no matter which dress you put it in.
---
Scrap kits are good for emergencies like that.
---
Third time for me... still no symptomatic
---
It's dependent how many rats you take so I don't think tank 1 would be that beneficial. I would just go with fireproof.
---
The word ‚Äòmeat‚Äô used to just mean ‚Äòfood‚Äô. It wasn‚Äôt specific to animal flesh. 
---
Just like ‚Äòcorn‚Äô used to just mean the most readily available &amp; common crop in that particular area.
---
The firemine and the sewer seem to have a clear linear path but the Vault is a tossup everytime.
---
Cranberries are kinda hard to grow in the real world if you're not living in the right climate so it would be cool if they made special planters for them so we could have them in a greenhouse or something
---
Keep spreading the good news!
---
This. It's the plasma grenade plans all over again. May be rare now but give it time &amp; people will have trouble selling it for 10 caps.
---
fire proof
---
I would name it Goes To 11.
---
we're quite nice but keep losing our stuff and need someone with guts to help :D
---
Biv and Graham at the Wayward.
---
We aren‚Äôt at that point already
---
Why can't we catch fish and use their meat in food recipes and what not? Fallout needs a fishing mechanic similar to Red Dead Online. It would work perfectly for this engine that is desperately in need of an overhaul.
---
I will check this out asap, I was unaware. I mostly used it to counter my Mutations negative bonuses. In the SPECIAL stats its still going positive I will have to check and see if it doesn't work for hp at all, or if there is a chance it at least counters the negative from mutations at the very least.   
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Idk, but you know what? 
---
All photos are crop-able!
---
Does that mod actually do anything? I just thought it was cosmetic
---
yeah right, forgot to mention that.
---
Errybody look out for that vault-tec bag, I‚Äôm giving out charity lol XB1
---
I‚Äôve not seen any posts saying it‚Äôs happened so I‚Äôd guess just rumour
---
Very crazy. 
---
That‚Äôs like anyone selling the Treasure Hunter Outfits for 10k. Just because the plan to craft them was a rare drop doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs a legitimate price for one outfit. 
---
I craft all four of those (TH Outfit, TH Hat, Insurgent Outfit, Insurgent Hat) and list them for 10c in my vendor. Just to screw over the price-gougers.
---
I know, but i prefer msg more. Lul
---
I always do it Alpha then Beta unless its the burrows then I get really lost. For the vault B last seems to be better because the enemy group spawns close to the point otherwise its a little out of the way to get back up there, same for the burning mine but slightly less so. Burrows doesn't really matter but B is closer. Haven't done valley galleria enough to really tell there.
---
That‚Äôs actual FOMO marketing to put behind a sneaker drop. 
---
That‚Äôs how FOMO works. Intentionally limited supply. 
---
There is no limit on digital goods. Its digital. 
---
I‚Äôm glad none of you work in Marketing
---
It's what makes All Rise All Rise.
---
 I desperately want to fill my camp with toxic root flowers. They are just so beautiful to look at.
---
This year....u get down voted!!!!!
---
Unfortunately the only way to buff energy weapons without buffing legacies is to raise the possible level cap for them. It makes sense to me that energy weapons would go to a higher level than ballistic weapons and with ballistics being stronger already the energies higher level cap would just bridge the present gap while phasing out legacies
---
They work like regular perk cards. You probably should have looked it up before investing in a build you were planning on changing
---
But that‚Äôs your decision. Whatever you upgraded is not yours to keep.
---
 Endurance also is supposed to effect **Poison resistance**, **Radiation Resistance** and **Healing** in 76 so I will equip/unequip and log out and in to see if anything changes.
---
Well cranberries are super useful, i hate having to travel just to get some
---
I got a B3350 fixer for mine. Seeing them go for 10-15k caos on Xbox now üòù
---
Throw it for sale on your vendor and see. The longer you wait, the less valuable it will become.
---
to get deeper in the mechanics of the game, go with AngryTurtle, he does a lot of great guides and explanations.  
---
and i like to watch RifleGaming, he does things like nuking overprized vendors or dowing earle with cursed weapons only.
---
Not a fan of heavy guns. Explosives I use for crowd control. Nothing worse than getting rushed into a corner accidentally and taking damage while trying to reload. I figured I can carry one rifle to draw targets in,  explosives for damage as they get closer, finish with melee. This is more a reaction to my experience in Daily Ops. Plus I‚Äôm going non VATS/power armor for now. Roaming the wasteland is a piece of cake. Close quarters is where things get tricky.
---
Seems like you treat this game as a pure 1st person shooter. In that case I understand why pve would feel boring, because yes, whether it‚Äôs a pvp or pve build, if you minmax it, you‚Äôll be melting everything.
---
But fo76 is not just a shooter. There are so many different ways to play it. Looking down at food builds and destroying their camps with sandman attitude, while spamming duped quantums and stealtboys is not my definition of fun. And it does not take much intelligence or imagination either.
---
Alright, the other perks in my build are fine then?
---
No proof = rumor. The last time this happened, people actually came forward with proof.
---
There is no limit on the actual goods either, Just one created by not producing more. It is literally the same concept with digital content, they released it for a certain period of time and then removed it. It is exactly the same thing.
---
 Besides this is not the original point I was making, I was comparing examples about sales which is also a FOMO tactic. 
---
Idk what field you actually work in, but you don't understand marketing at all.
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs not the power armor sprint?
---
Visually yes lol
---
But it keeps its legendary effects if you change the mod 
---
I get what you're saying tho, it's got the wow factor
---
I‚Äôll admit I was initially turned off by being essentially useless as a stealth build, but as long as I play with other people, it‚Äôs still fun
---
Be a Good Doggy
---
I was thinking the same thing lol
---
I‚Äôm a day one player coming back and I have no clue what any of those things are
---
Mini nukes and grenades going off when your trying to loot bodies in an event? No thankyou!
---
All good points to consider
---
Can we please get major holiday events that last for a month?
---
One week right before the holiday isn‚Äôt enough time imo.
---
It would be cool if there was something like a one-sided stash box where you could drop some nukas or sugar bombs at camps you like.
---
At least that one gives a useful bonus.
---
I like to see the map scale larger to a more accurate size in real life. More buildings and streets in Morgantown, slightly wider flatwoods, hills and mountain get higher, more grounds between locations overall too.
---
Not very often, but this week my base is in a prime meat event area all the creatures attack it.
---
At least those had a very long time in which they were actually rare because of such a low drop. 
---
There are 14 rare drops. Assuming that you only use one level 50+ character each day, *on average* you should have all the rewards in about 3-4 weeks.  That‚Äôs a very rough estimate, so if someone wants to do the math to determine how many occurrences are needed to hit a 50% chance to get all 14 rare rewards, be my guess. 
---
But even if it was twice as long, the fact that the event is repeatable every single day means that in a relatively short time the market would be saturated. So the only people buying. These just don‚Äôt want to wait. 
---
And to be honest, that‚Äôs fine. If they‚Äôve got that many spare caps/items, and the buyer/seller come to an agreement, more power to them. 
---
I just personally think it‚Äôs a bad decision, mostly because it encourages price gouging.
---
Ghoulish recovers health at a rate of 50% per rank of incoming rad damage.  I've never tested running 1 rank on a high RR character, but rank 3 with 1000 RR and the 98% rad damage reduction from a Chinese Stealth or Hazmat Suit still heals really well.
---
For example, I could run through a nuked WS killing ghouls in a Hazmat Suit, with around 200 DR from perks/mutations and and I never needed to use a Stimpack, but did need to use Radaway's every so often.  There's a cap on how far you can reduce Rad damage, so adding What Rads? to that situation wouldn't reduce the incoming Rad damage much if any, but it would quickly heal your rads allowing you to not need to use Radaways.
---
If you could spare the points to get Ghoulish to rank 3, I'd highly suggest it for your build.  Not sure on only 1 rank though.
---
Razor grain for ballistic bock.
---
If you hide them, then the cause of inventory weight issues might not be obvious.  How about just an option to put them on bottom of list instead?  Personally I like them at the top of the list so it prompts me to drop to drop the ones I don't want to sell in some high traffic area or near a low level toon I happen across.
---
Yea, I had this same problem. I ended up solving it by leveling up an alt. So now, whenever one character starts getting overloaded, I start focusing on playing the other character (while simply logging in daily to scrip with the overloaded character). This has worked for me so far.
---
Naw dude we all about cranberries now
---
*I have a bad feeling about this...*
---
Yeah, sending players ahead is key to completing this very quickly. A solo player can complete these in under 8 minutes. A team should be able to cut that time dramatically by sending players ahead to activate beacons and the boss fight while the rest of the team is making their way to the objectives.
---
They "broke" VATS, when they "fixed" another bug.  
---
You used to have a split second, when targeting any body part in VATS, where it would be 95%.  
---
This lead to everyone snap-firing in VATS, for easy kills.
---
Most weapons don't have this issue, anymore.  
---
I do see it happening with bows, as well.
---
I would seriously love to have cranberries planted in my camp
---
Sigh.  Yeahhhh
---
Where you getting mods from Nexus? I havent messed with modding yet. i figured bethesda had it locked down
---
Of course they managed to fix that LMAO
---
Platform matters I believe but on PC people are paying 2/3* bloodied/AA/V rifles and heavy guns for pieces
---
Nah, I want to craft legendaries. Like the rest of the gold items
---
Why are we pretending that this hasn't been asked hundreds of times already?
---
Now if only I could do the same thing with my 7 month old..... But sadly she neither plays games or cleans the house.....
---
That's awesome though! Welcome to the fo76 family!
---
You do realize games have not adjusted for inflation for over 30 years? They should rightfully cost about 150-200 dollars. So they make up it other ways.
---
Why are you still paying for it.
---
I guess it would be kind of cool for some people if you could craft legendary perk cards for half the cost of the upgrades that you bought for them.
---
Let the Downvoting Begin!!!
---
after a Queen event, I always go up to Watoga to the train station bot.  People sell scorchbeast meat all the time.
---
Put the prime receiver on yer gauss mini, ammo needs crimson flux, but you make way more when crafting, also does more damage!
---
Not a newbie but I‚Äôd like one of each. Don‚Äôt have either yet.
---
Yeah I realise that. I don‚Äôt think the guy who I was responding too understands that
---
Why cant my carrots sprout flowers?  You can grow pepper but you cannot grow salt.  Salt must be mined or harvested
---
That‚Äôs so awesome!!  Welcome to the community!  
---
Most of us are very nice.  Some of us are quirky. And on rare occasion, there are a few that are... better ignored.
---
Let us know if you have any questions!
---
What platform are you on, by the way?
---
For most other guns I prefer explosive. However for the fixer, it seems that my B2525 is better than my BE25. Just can't put my finger on the why, just *feels* better...
---
I will give you a stimpack
---
Reminds me of Monster hunter - time to put down some explosive barrels and let her rip.
---
I just seem to get cages lamps over and over I've got 3 spare so far
---
Never thought about letting the night stalker live to keep the event going. Though in public servers the chances of that happening are slim to none
---
THANK YOU
---
Said every single fo76 player ever.
---
The other option is charging everyone a monthly fee or charge for every dlc.  Servers and programers cost money.
---
Only under "laboratory" circumstances.
---
Not viable in open game play. So you're ok to keep your machines.
---
If they did not lock their collectron bot you can drop stuff off there.
---
Thank you! And don't rush her, mine started when she was 9 and she never stopped... She's in her twenties now. üòÇ
---
I think stabilzed, grenader, and demo expert are the only things that effect that weapon. So get those and the rest is up to you, though be warned it is not a strong weapon
---
It is when it is a two shot mirv üòÅ
---
This is having the unfortunate effect of locking us into our builds, both with the unrefundable perk points and the scrapping of perk cards. It's fine, though, because they reward us for playing alts. Oh, wait, they don't.
---
All this is true and I am not complaining since I like all the events.  But, I am at the point that I roam the map to find low levels (under 100) to drop legendaries to ease my weight problem.
---
Blue suitcase at train stations.
---
True but some ass could just steal it. We need like a deposit box or mail box.
---
what does that even mean? marsupial still got -4 intel even use serum though, no? u/LCTC
---
Alcohol
---
It better have the same reward pool from last year. I missed mischief night and was looking forward to it this year to get some of those exclusives
---
Thankfully (for now) no one ever does it, so whenever it pops I always head there for that sweet sweet solo XP.
---
I find by the time I log on everyone has done them already.  Also you can infact get rare rewards more then once a day just has a stupid low chance of doing so especially when you can only obtain initiate more then once a day
---
The price goes down everyday. It's a permanent event that people have to do for their score challenges anyway
---
All five of my characters came out great, but my lowest level is 180 . Most of the complaints I've seen have been players below 50.
---
I'm not that far yet... im almost to the foosball table, though, which will go great in my second floor game room above my diner!
---
Thanks for easing my mind on that, now ill be able to move those points into a separate card without thinking twice!. As of right now I'm using a hunting rifle I scavenged and the machete i received from two NPCs outside vault 76. So ill just keep the machete lose the perks.
---
Fuck yea you would, everybody dreaming of that cran life
---
It stopped a short while after the tse wars.  People changed, things got broke, bounty were set and claimed, and the game was totally different.
---
Basically they changed the pvp dynamic, and you couldn't just blow up a base without initiating pvp. So it magically stopped
---
4/5 times when I see it there's always a few folks there farming xp haha
---
I got at least 3k flux, fixers and handmades, be90 miniguns for my sets, really insane deals but they're really not worth anything as they have a really high chance of dropping and they'll probably be there infinitely. Value goes down every day.
---
Pretty sure.  Being able to get around more in PA is far better, especially if you don't have Full Charge 2.  Remember that AP use in PA drains the FC.
---
Now, it does lose some use once you stock up on FC's, but I'd still say it's worth it, especially when a run in with a high level cryo floater burns through 7+ FC's in the time it takes to kill the damn thing.
---
Just shoot me a message on Xbox if you see me on.
---
It varies, a lot, depending on the buyer. 
---
Buyers that want it now will pay quite a lot. 
---
Buyers that are patient will end up getting it for a lot less. 
---
Get what you can now if you don‚Äôt care for the outfit or are smart enough to realize you will be able to get it again from the Spec Ops.
---
I'll give you a Junkie Explosive LMG.

I would really appreciate a bear arm plan. I'll be on around that time as well. I'll message tonight to see if you still have one.
---
AA heavy energy guns is what you want. Also priming them is very cost efficient now, AA plasma or UGL should deal with enemies no problem.
---
100% I would hate for events to lessen.  They bring a nice refreshing change to the usual routines.  Just let is do something about what we earn from them lol.
---
Gat Gun for regular mobs just farming.  
---
Minigun for big boss fights.   
---
That‚Äôs how I roll.
---
VATS is ass for all shotguns. Miss at 95%. But Guass is the worst. Just enter and exit vats with a Guass SG. Cause when it does work pretty much one shot
---
One of the reasons I don't use my Gauss Minigun as much is because the health rubberbanding is ridiculously.  You'll take a big chunk out and then they'll get a bit of health back. Never have that issue with my .50 cal.
---
As you level up you will notice that explosives is pretty weak. Early game they are viable but not in the long run. But at The end of the Day its about having fun and if you enjoy explosives than you go for it.
---
This was the case with the original too. Required crazy specific shit to happen and I believe was only possible when you used exploits to get over max camp budget anyway. Normal people were never affected by this
---
Thank you! I met some of her online friends and they were definitely quirky, hahaha. 
---
I'm on Xbox!
---
The trick is having the refrigerated backpack mod.
---
Furious prime fast fire quad gattling gun ftw
---
That tripped me out.
---
 The timing to it was perfect. 
---
I Was wondering what on earth that yelling was about then they just ran past.
---
It was like in slow motion.
---
Then i almoat choked laughing.
---
Love the random encounters in this game. This one is one of my favs.
---
Is AA the new meta everyone seems to be after them im sure my mules are full of them have to have a look see what I have.
---
fuck that guy
---
IIRC Power armor displays are in the pipeline. I wear that helmet pretty much 24/7 though.  It's a fun faschnact souvenir, not the new "best in slot".
---
Good luck in your adventures good sir!
---
Can you get a mic
---
Both. Mini for harder things (SBQ, daily ops, etc.) Gatling gun for day-to-day super mutant slaying etc.
---
Would u be willing to give me a fixer plan?
---
I gotcha. To be fair. I already have a Vampire's Prime Gatling Laser so I just may stick to the Gatling Gun for mobs.
---
I do have a mic, I shouldn't be forced to plug it in when a message or emote would suffice :)
---
There is no war in Ba Sing Se.
---
AA energy guns were hit the least from damage calculation changes so when everything got worse they stayed mostly the same, since there aren't many multipliers for them to begin with. I give it a week till some YouTube video comes out and they will be all the rage.
---
EDIT: also core crafting got changed, so instead of crafting overcharged cores you now craft more of them, which in the end gives you more ammo for your mats.
---
Fireproof and Lifegiver are always good
---
This helped me alot, i appreciate your time to write it all, I checked out your sniper build and have to say I really like your choice of perk cards and think I'd really enjoy it. As for vats I wasn't planning to use it much since I will be trying to kill target from a distance and maybe rely on it when I get swarmed for the little crit chance % I had. But I think I want to try your build as it suits me better and looks really well put together.
---
depends how high your DR already is. There are some people saying that diminishing returns are less severe now with the new patch so it could matter.
---
slower breaking weapons is something I would ever equip. Because of weaponsmith. However you should play the way you want so if you get bothered a lot with you melee weapon breaking fast, go for it.
---
You'd think they'd look to successful MMO's for how to handle these holiday events. You'd be wrong.
---
Damn, why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
---
bloodied fixer sneak here.  I don't use PA either.
---
You'll need all the unyielding armor pieces to make it really worthwhile if you don't use PA and want to go bloodied. Just start vendor hopping and get all remaining pieces as cheap as you can. Then over time keep vendorhopping and look for upgraded pieces. The important thing is just getting all the pieces, even if they have crappy stats, even 1 star is fine.
---
Since you mentioned more carry weight, make sure to shop for your cheap unyielding pieces with those that have weight reductions on junk/food/chems/etc. Getting one of each reduction really helps. Also make sure your backpack is modded with one of the two faction mods for either chems or food (can only do one at a time). Not carrying a boatload of weapons (I have several, fixer, combatshotty, 10mm, handmade) helps too, though you're going heavy guns, so that's gonna add some weight for sure. Every bit of reduction helps.
---
If you can't find the unyielding pieces with weight reductions, just get any pieces, the cheaper the better. You can then focus on upgrading them after you have at least a full set. I run 4 pieces of unyielding and 1 chameleon, all with weight reductions for various things. HUGE quality of life improvement.
---
Also, because of unyielding and no PA, you can run stuff like Barbarian, Iron Clad, etc which all give you a bunch of resistance back as well. I can take a surprising amount of beatings with only 45/248 hitpoints LOL. 
---
Running Bandolier helps as well as traveling pharmacy, even a level1 of each is a massive improvement. staying level 1 will afford you to use more perks in that stat too if you don't max them all out. 
---
Also, if you're not into chems, then the only thing you'll need for survival for bloodied is the lesser weight diluted stims and radaway. Even radaway you won't need many of, maybe a dozen at any given time, sell the rest. diluted stims I drink like water. Sell all higher/large stims, they are worth a lot and also very heavy. If you do use chems, you'll need to spec perks or weight reductions for that.  I only carry chems to sell to the vendorbot each day, using only the two mentioned above.
---
Also, forget all the fancy legendary perks. Focus on the legendary stats only and upgrade those to give you more slots for more perk cards. Most of the legendary cards are garbage anyway. Unless you're using a high rate of fire gun or something ,even the ammo legendary perk is a waste IMO, you would be far better served by getting more legendary stat perks in there for more regular perk cards.
---
Make sure to full build out your regular perk cards first, don't use any of the legendary perks until you're sure of what you'll need extra stat points for, it's a costly mistake if you don't plan ahead.
---
Hope some of that helps.
---
Once you learn it they can still drop
---
Honestly,  your link doesn't work for me so I couldn't check it out.
---
Awesome, thanks man!!
---
I'm actually doing the opposite right now. Used to have like 2 endurance, but because I'm trying to play a tank, I've upped my base endurance to 4 and am ranking up Legendary Endurance for an extra 5 points. Lifegiver, Fireproof and Rejuvenation... though I've been debating dropping Rejuvenation and moving the 2 points to Charisma and then taking 5 points in Legendary Charisma as well, which would bring me to 14 and let me share most perks.
---
But for a 1 Endurance build... either Radical if playing Bloodied for the extra carry weight or 1 rank in Fireproof. Even with just 15% reduction it makes a big difference.
---
Radicool is great if you‚Äôre bloodied for carry weight/strength purposes, but otherwise 1 rank of fireproof has always been my go-to.
---
The only ones that won‚Äôt drop are the plan for the Stein and the display case. But those are no drop/no trade anyways, so it doesn‚Äôt do you any good to get a second one.
---
Big explosive builds were rather disappointing pre patch 22.   I would just imagine it‚Äôs even worse post patch 22.
---
Exactly this. They were hyping that perk load outs will give us a chance to experiment on the fly, except now they won't since i scrapped any card not related to my current build. The legendary perk system has locked the mid to mid-high levels into a certain build. Sure, if you are level 1000 you can have all the perks to experiment with, but the rest of us have lost nearly any chance of experimenting now.
---
They didn't touch anything with the camp budgets so I'm not entirely sure what is going on here.
---
Yeah just shoot me a message on Xbox when you see me online.
---
For one hour after taking a sirum there are no negative drawbacks.
---
Ok thanks
---
As long as you have one character above lvl 50, you have legendary perk slots unlocked on all characters.  Sounds like OP is having issues on his main.
---
That's my thinking, you are in a very active server with nukes, populated events and want to try other build, or you just found something in a vendor for your other character. It would be great to quickly switch. But you see by the downvotes, people don't want the game to be better, they just go "this game could never do that" and that's it, so they can keep complaining forever ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôve only used this gun less than 10 times

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c3778b8&amp;d=s32sr2sq2sg2pe2ek1ej4eu0ce0c13cu1ir2ic4a72a12a04lu2lt2la2x80x60&amp;w=l71
---
The math is, if you believe you can earn back 1000 scrip (the highest amount you could save up) before reaching lvl 50, go for it. Roll some low level legendary items. Or else the scrips are just sitting there gathering dust.
---
Ah sorry I thought you meant like mod mods, not weapon and armour mods
---
I‚Äôd settle for a ‚Äústop shooting me and bugger off, you can‚Äôt convince me to fight you‚Äù emote.
---
Although it seems like a waste of luck points, good with salt has been a game changer! I'm blown away by how long my food stores with that perk. Coupled with the thru hiker perk, my character never goes hungry.... Nor do my allies or strangers I encounter :D
---
Then half of the year would be taken up by holiday related events. 1 week is plenty of time
---
lool maybe one day
---
Nothing wrong with keepin it basic , is a video game sub after all. They say a picture is worth a thousand words ü§ò

Mind the gap.... https://imgur.com/a/BcDwbxI

Shots like those always puts a smile on my face
---
Thanks dude really help this is my build can you take a look to let me know if it is good https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c3778b8&amp;d=s32sr2sq2sg2pe2ek1ej4eu0ce0c13cu1ir2ic4a72a12a04lu2lt2la2x80x60&amp;w=l71
---
Rename them to rolls on them like J33/25 Fixer or whatever the rolls are
---
Bingo. So he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs easier to craft your own serums and just reapply than spend the perk points.
---
Energy weapons are perfectly fine. My gatling plasma and ultracite gatling laser can easily take out any normal enemies, and even my good laser rifle can easily take out lvl100 super mutants even though I‚Äôm not a rifleman build.
---
I was giving them away in mass drops during the event as soon as I learned the plan.  3 Cloth and 1 Oil?  That‚Äôs cheap to craft. 
---
I even crafted a bunch to sell to vendors when I was running low on sellable items.
---
It feels like thanks to the Tank Killer overhaul, pistols are similar if not slightly better than before since despite losing out on the multiplicative damage stacking that turbo-nerfed most builds, they didn't benefit much from that anyways and having armor pierce kind of puts them in the same spot. This is good when considering that nearly all other builds got worse, so pistols finally have a small, still-not-that-good win.
---
*Major* holidays like Christmas and Halloween would not take up half the year lol.
---
It can work, clearly get all the perks that benefit explosive weapons but the big difference making it viable is the legendary roll. You need a 2 shot MIRV with 50% limb damage or another magical perk. If you get a magical one it can be really fun, not practical but fun.
---
Brilliant idea!
---
ü§îMaybe camp unit with hearts around it
---
I just do the easiest ones-- survive 10 minutes (Bush Wookies Unite!), Set Camp 3 times, etc. Otherwise, I don't bother.
---
Make it longer and let me hold a bolt pistol on the other hand.
---
Well then there‚Äôs only 2 major holidays, and only 1 that people actually care about. Nobody gets into the ‚ÄúHalloween spirit‚Äù and looks forward to it unless you‚Äôre a little kid
---
Which always makes me laugh
---
Bzzzzzt haha
---
I'm guessing simply renaming them is just too much work?
---
Yeah
---
Fishing is last thing the game needs...
---
Perk loadouts and a text chat is what we need. Not BS like fishing!!!!
---
Damage is not the only factor here, durability and general use also applies and with other fallout titles from what I recall Laser rifles had lower durability but higher damage.
---
I tried the foosball table today and the noise it made attached itself to my character. Fast traveling away and scrapping the table didn‚Äôt make it go away. Had to leave the server.
---
prettttty sure a datamined wood only skin is in the files for screaming eagle ! idk when or if it‚Äôll be used though:

Lmao, so only ‚Äúlittle kids‚Äù can enjoy holiday things.
---
Nice gate keeping.
---
Sounds like fun!  DM sent. Let me know if you need any starter supplies and I‚Äôll be glad to help out.
---
I've never made cores how did you craft over charged one?
---
It's too bad it sucks so much.  I'd love a legendary one.
---
Fireproof or rejuvinated would be my choice.
---
Need nukatown
---
Couldn't have explained it better myself
---
If I remember right ammosmith and very high int would overcharge them, same as when you fix a weapon/armor and get that second bar. Now you can easily go to 3x cores crafted, which means 1 flux for three cores.
---
I would prefer a assultron maid than dog meat
---
this is shit of me but i want a fixer skin that converts it to something else because i don‚Äôt always love the way it looks... ive been using my handmade for the screaming eagle even if its slightly worse lol
---
but yeah since we didn‚Äôt get a new rifle with wastelanders i bet you‚Äôre right about a new commando. i can‚Äôt wait to grind again! modules on the ss armor have already been brutal oof
---
He said you can buy perk card packs in gold bullion stores. Is this true? I haven‚Äôt seen it anywhere.
---
Yes! I want to farm cranberries, silt beans and snaptail reed...
---
Make us foodbuilds happy bethesda!!!!
---
Also crops should not fill up ur campbudget *dream*...
---
We all have preferences, but that would be cool too
---
Think I'd rather have an overcharged one double the ammo with out reload.
---
Definitely has potential
---
Once you get mutations, it‚Äôs a lot different, there is no ‚Äúclose quarters‚Äù it‚Äôs just you jumping around spraying and hitting enemies, I seems like you‚Äôre looking at it to in depth
---
I'm asking because I thought I saw in a thread someone had a fix but I can't find it.  If i find it I'll share the info with some friends who play and have the same problem.
---
Hey nice co.. camp
---
Welcome gamer mum. That's pretty darn awesome.
---
I remember once making a CAMP right next to the Morgantown Airport farm where the dozen pumpkins are, just to have a pumpkin pie bakery. Then i saw the need for mirelurk eggs and promptly gave up trying.
---
Its addicting and I love it, we've got a lot of cool content recently
---
With Ammo Smith and Super Duper and now the New legendary ammo perk, all you need is a once a week run through Lucky Hole Mine with excavator PA for lead ore. I used to run once a week to keep my .50 cal stocked, but with the new legendary perk 1 run keeps me stocked for several weeks.
---
on pc I join a public team, then force close the game. this lets let's me relaunch the game going to the same server (play with team) with a different character. helps when in on a new character and someone drops a nuke
---
Very Guernica
---
It's fine. The annoying part will be having to switch perk cards. In Perception your gonna want Skeeto Shooter.
---
Yeah, now if they worked correctly you would be right, but for Gatling lasers for example it caps at 999 with power user anyway so a regular core is enough cause it gives 500 when full. Plasma doesn't work for it, but plasma is plenty powerful so in the long run it is cheaper than .50 cal for example.
---
Bummer, well it‚Äôs odd that when you scrap something your budget stays the same. Maybe they didn‚Äôt touch the camp budget, but there does seem to be something bugged.
---
That's why my combat shotgun does a lot more damage than anything else...
---
Unless you're using an lmg the ammo for big guns is cheap to craft. Don't buy it from people, if things could be sold for less than one cap this ammo would be.
---
I love the galleria. You can totally hide under the beacon on the floor above/below behind stuff and still ping the beacon. I find fire proof is an invaluable perk n
---
Yeah and you‚Äôre paying for your subscription. 
---
Scarcity is not the answer to profit.
---
Becket  haha.  Auto correct.
---
There are a few NW challanges that are stupid easy, like place your camp 3 times and survive 10 minutes.  I do those and then run into the fire and back to Adventure mode.
---
If you have serious supply of flux, then yes this works. I started like that as I didn't like using luck points. Gets kind of expensive.
---
So if I use power user my ammo goes up im so green when it comes to energy weapons.
---
Thats what happens when the dogs are higher level. Get better armors or don't let them hit you.
---
Agree 100%.
---
Big Guns do devour ammo. There are some exceptions. Gatling uses 5mm ammo, and shoots like once per second. So this is a ammo efficient weapon. Pair it with a minigun, and they use the same ammo, gatling for every day normal things, minigun for events or when things need to die yesterday.
---
Rifle build with a low health unyielding armor set doesn't really need perks, as your agility is very high. And since you are a stealth sniper/commando, you shouldn't expect to take too much damage (except in daily ops). Ammo consumption on commando builds is high, but not big guns high. Bloodied commando is what many run, due to high DPS and damage per shot, along with the stealth bonus. Things can't hurt you if they are dead, and since they die quickly, you don't use that much ammo.
---
You can plant pumpkins. I think they're in the C.A.M.P. menu as gourds but you can do it. Melons too.
---
Truth. The new electric absorption is awesome too. My cores are always fully charged and I‚Äôm an unkillable tank if they are shooting me with lasers.
---
Iv had this on my railway rifles, combat/fixers, handmades, and gatling plasma for ages.
---
What i never understood is , why do AP actions cost fusion core charge ? And if it should cost fusion core charge why does it need to cost AP too ?
---
There's no way you could actually have watched that comment in the context of the overall interview and come away with that impression. They clearly care a lot about the game (and patch 23 in particular), but they also need to take care of their team, who presumably are entitled to some number of days of leave per year. We don't expect any business to do a major release on December 25, so we similarly shouldn't be surprised if a lot of game devs schedule some leave for November 19-20 this year which might mean having to move a patch forward or back by a week or so.
---
Playing the game without first is like playing demo mode
---
personally speaking, they should allow the PA jetpack skins to work on the SS armor, maybe downsize the model a little to make it fit
---
If you mean Wendigo Cave, that's the one that gets me lost.
---
I know a way to increase your camp size! Destroy those 5 turrets you have and leave only one, or two pointed to the enemy spawn. That secretly increases your camp budget by more then 30%!
---
I think it's awful for the level 50 super mutants in the forest region,  you ever see the poor guys trying to reload their hunting rifles, anytime now lol Beth should revert the forest region back to where it was, it's silly the way it is now.
---
Oh wow, that sucks. It‚Äôs super annoying when your only a couple of rounds from killing your enemy and bam, reload lol
---
I got the meat sweats
---
It's triggered manually (launch a nuke at the mine)

There are fish in every body of water in which you can submerge yourself I believe.

To this day I'm still hunting for an insurgent hat on Xbox...I got incredibly lucky with the outfit at a vendor one day, but have never found the hat to go with it.

---
It really wouldnt be hard to put some safety deposit boxes in/around whitespring and make a shared inventory with maybe a 200Ib limit and either 30k or 150k cap limit. This game desperately needs it.
---
Don‚Äôt for get you can get lead on the first floor of every silo
---
When you rolled your new character it seems you put all your points into wholesome.
---
Bloodied IS viable, obviously. It's not an opinion. 
---
Look folks, you aren't telling me anything I don't know and there's not anything some salty food builds have tried with a pistol build that I haven't also tried. 
---
My pistol medic started life as a full health build. That was over a year ago and the damage was never enough for solo play. So, I adapted to what works. Braindead is putting no thought into a build, changing nothing when what you want to do doesn't work, and expecting the game to be altered so you can do damage on a par with people who DO change and DO put thought into a build.
---
I eventually said f&amp;$k it and just handled the negative reprocutions. I'm a bloodied so the stat drop really wasn't a big hit. Once I maxed out that legendary card I use class freak and starched genes. Previously I just danced with all the weird genetic problems it came with.
---
Only for fusion cores, yeah instead of 500 rounds per core you get 999.
---
For a long-term player of the game, these softball interviews are immensely frustrating. I think a big part of the problem is that none of these interviewers are long-term players, so they know about the problems in a broad-brush kind of way, but not enough to press for justifications or specifics. 
---
Not to say there's nothing of interest here. Mostly stuff that confirms suspicions like learning (others may have known, I didn't) that Jeff Gardiner only really had experience working on single-player RPGs, so having him as project lead was a yikes moment right off the bat; him emphasizing that they are making the Creation Engine perform as something it's not designed to be, and it's a minor miracle that it even works at all; his striking opinion of how much longer the 'beta' should have been - about fifty weeks longer than the two it actually was.
---
So yes, I spent a lot of the time going 'Argh! Press him on that!' whenever an opening came up, but have to accept it's not that kind of interview. Some examples: 
---
"We put something out and immediately know how it went and can react to it" (a creakingly long list of examples of issues that have been totally ignored and never revisited.)    
---
"Now that we've stabilized the game...." (another list of examples of how the game feels pretty far from stable.)
---
"Some things seem easy but would break tech pathways," (Even taking into account the accepted differences between a mod and official software, it doesn't justify how the modders are so quickly achieving what is taking you an age - such as perk loadouts.)
---
"You'd be surprised how few people engage in PVP" (that's because people found FO76's PVP system to be clumsy, with little reward, and you had no support for factions.)
---
Suffice it to say, I could go on but will stop there. I said a big part of the problem was that most interviewers probably aren't players, but here's what I think is the other part of the problem - Fallout 76 isn't popular enough to justify a hardball interview, risk being labelled a trouble-maker by Bethesda, and potentially having your future access limited.
---
There was some one on here the other day who actually messaged the person in the game and told them he had proof I think ü§î
---
XBox. I think it's endemic to this game LOL there's a lot of fiddle farting around. Someone always has to repair armor, or grab more ammo, or cook food
---
Think it's like a 10-15% chance to have it drop. If you're on xbox I have a spare you can have
---
Yes.  It's been happening for a few patches now.
---
Oh that's good to know thanks so much.
---
Down side is I use that flux for ammo.
---
They don't want the caps, they want blood.
---
I am indeed, that'd be really cool. Do you want anything for it?
---
I like to buy bulk adhesive and other stuff when I'm at max caps but there is a stash box at that very station you buy them from!
---
The huge amount of adults that love Halloween and decorate a month in advance would disagree with you.
---
Thank you! ‚ù§
---
You're calculations don't take into account that you can get 7 perk packs from this season. So that's an additional 56 perk coins. If they do that each season that's like a free rank 2 perk card. 
---
They are legendary perks, and taking till 500 levels to max out 6 of them actually seems that horrible. More so, with the 1WL update, getting those levels is much easier, because now creatures give more experience for your level.
---
This. The drums help slow the meter degrading. 
---
One of the best tactics is to pre-fill the meter with drums, let one or two people stay on the drums, and two people do the cleanup circuit and grab greens. The cleanup helps slow degradation as well. 
---
Then one quick circuit by the two ‚Äòhunters‚Äô for critter chunks. And then dump meat and greens all at once.   Usually, that will finish the event within about two minutes. Add in the two minutes of ‚Äòdrum prep‚Äô and that‚Äôs why a lot of the Meat Cooks are done before the five past the hour mark.
---
No problem, just don't use mods like plasma flamer or tri barrel for them cause while it shows good damage they are ass to use.
---
Not sure if it's effected the rest of your math but every 10 levels you get 28 perk coins, 10 levels=20 coins, 2 packs=8 coins
---
Aww, thank you! ‚ù§
---
If you learn anything here on Reddit is that you are not alone as a "late in life gamer".  I am 59 years young and level 413.  At least in the Wastelands I can keep up with anyone lol

100%. Everytime I see a newer jetpack on the atom store I get a little excited and then quickly let down when I remember they don't work on the SS jetpack.
---
I'm actually saving ammo now, and not by doing OPs, as crazy as that sounds.
---
I'm a rifle build, and pretty much everything I encounter (level 50 stuff) I deal with a power fist, it can easily 1-2 shot most stuff with no perks in unarmed combat!
---
Loot all the ammo, instant saving. Ammo then get's used for the more dangerous encounters, the rare OP I bother with, and the occasional end game boss that might pop up.
---
With my rifles, most stuff takes a similar amount of ammo to deal with as before (never had a meta build), some a bit more, but farming materials for ammo is easy enough, combined with the small amount gained by the awful ammo convertor.
---
If your at max caps I would jump.made my last playthrough very easy leveling up with a good handmade. You will make up the scrip before you hit 50 again probably

---
Iv never had a issue with it. I see it as 2 perk points for 4 extremely helpful perks. I run speed demon, carnivore, adrenal reaction, and marsupial. I dont even mind have another 3 points in class freak to negate the negative effects. People just want everything but thats not the point of the perk system. Theyre doing something right if you have to make tough decisions about your build

I‚Äôm running a bloodied combat shotgun non-PA build currently, and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. The gun itself doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúmagic‚Äù prefixes, but I have the armor prefix that activates magic In VATS. (Reduce damage while blocking I think??) Even after the damage nerf, I can take out most things in 1-3 shots at close range.
---
I am experiencing some miscellaneous bugs (e.g., enemy HP rubber banding) and occasionally I have to exit VATS and re-enter it to get the magic to kick in, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm more bugged out than average.
---
I‚Äôve been pretty lucky since the game has launched and not experienced any major issue until this patch. My first login of the day every day I have to exit to the desktop and then open back up. If I don‚Äôt do that, the scoreboard level up alerts endlessly pop up over and over. Luckily restarting the game fixes that
---
Assaultron maid that you can ‚Äúassume the position‚Äù with
---
Yeah my settler wanderer stood there and kept turning her head as if she had a head tic or head tremor.  I had to go in to customize her and then back out to get her to stop.
---
My magic minigun is OP af, but my ffr vampire gatling gun is amazing for my bloodied build.
---
Is that what it is? Since the patch, I've felt like they just slowed down the reload times in addition to buffing creatures and reducing our damage output. I'm going to check what you mention today, I didnt have this happening before.
---
1. Yes, pretty common drop from the queen
---
2. The secret service armour (its not a pa) can use a jetpack
---
I have the Responder‚Äôs skin for my backpack, and it almost always hides the jet pack....a bug I‚Äôm quite fond of!
---
One wasteland should only activate when the player reaches level 50.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had that too
---
Yuppers. You're gonna have to make an alt to get the ones you're missing.
---
Do turrets take up an inordinate amount of CAMP space?
---
Still Love it. Game was wayyyyy too easy and uninteresting. Especially in low level areas. Now most events are actually worth doing (xp-wise). Season one I ‚Äûplayed‚Äú for 15-40 minutes per day for 6-7 weeks until i finished the legendary run. This season I am playing 2-4 hours per day just because it feels good to do stuff. Will get boring again, but it‚Äôs nice to have for now
---
This only makes sense if you have an absurd amount of flux or you consistently generate more than 1 flux an hour.  Not many people are in either category.
---
Id go with good doggy or fireproof.
---
I mean I wouldnt argue against this either.  Anything to change it up.  There are some killer jetpack mods that i wont buy because I rarely use PA.  This brings in a whole new market to non-PA users
---
Could you imagine how painful it would be to breastfeed baby deathclaws? no wonder they are so cranky!
---
It seems to be emptying and then jumping back up to a random number, from what I can tell.
---
Yeah, I definitely feel it‚Äôs a bug. Because I put the 30 round mag on it and it will just reload whenever
---
Tip: you don't have to restart the game to fix that.  You know how they display your current score level at the main menu?  If you log on and see it is 0 you will get the bug when you log in.  To stop this, click on the scoreboard from the main menu and back out and this should sync your rank and you won't all the alerts popping up when you log in.
---
Always check the blue suitcases at the train stations. Usually whitesprings, watoga and pleasant valley. I always put my extras there and i often come across some already in there from other players. XB1.
---
How many shots before it breaks, maybe add gunsmith to slow that down, and luck of the draw?
---
I keep my daisy cutter unique on me for the occasional shenanigans or faschnat.
---
Not to forget Gatling laser/plasma can be used on swap. They are very cheap to feed.
---
By the time you do that someone else has 1-shot the mob.
---
Hearts and thumbs up always works for me.
---
Did Bethesda give a reason why they don't implement a chat? ESO has one...
---
Well the logic is that they can use What Rads? to recover Radiation without the risk of losing Mutations freeing up space for something better.
---
However, unless they are fine with eventually getting ever Mutation, or randomly trying to get rid of the ones they don't want, it's still better to run Starched Genes.
---
It's unsatisfying, but I just vendor them now. I have backlog of three-stars with bad rolls that are just dying to get recycled so now I just vendor every one star and most two stars.
---
Sweet, thank you! I will give this a try when I log in today
---
Thats our Christmas tree haha
---
That‚Äôs not it at all.. As I can assure you what I‚Äôm saying is true, I mean I go to college for this shit. The creation engine Bethesda uses is NOT capable of a feature like that.. ESO isn‚Äôt, SWTOR isn‚Äôt, Destiny 2 isn‚Äôt, no MMO is.
---
Will it remove your Wanted mutations if you have the starched genes perk applied?
---
Would really hate to use it at any given time and loose my mutation...
---
I meant physical size, not just budget
---
RIP... AND TEAR
---
10% a piece
---
I saw a fix posted here on reddit a bit ago. If you go into the score menu before earning any score for the first time on a server it will update and prevent this. While not perfect and I don't remember to do it every time. I have gotten into the habbit of trying to go into the scoreboard before I start playing on a server.
---
I'm a casual stealth player that mostly uses Chinese stealth armor.  I've been using a  suppressed 3 start bloody shotgun since the update and it's working pretty well.  It's able to 1-shot lvl 75 ghouls and scorched when using VATS.  Lvl 75 super mutants were 1-shot for the first few days after the update, but something changed and they now required 2-3 shots.
---
Ever since the one wasteland update lots of weapons won‚Äôt display on walls. Fixers, assault rifles, .44 revolvers assaultron blades and shishkebabs are a few I can name off the top of my head. I made a neat little gun shop and logged on to find stuff missing from the racks in several places, still there. Just invisible.
---
Fallout 1st advertised discounts on shop items too, but dont exist
---
This is the first time I have ever hit my scrip limit lol, I have dozens upon dozens of treasury notes too lol. It‚Äôs been good to collect all this, but I am out of storage and full to the bring with shit
---
Yeah exactly most of the people downvote because they only have one character and don‚Äôt understand the struggles. I would agree to fix other things first before doing this but this is an amazing idea for when they have the game running smoothly and not crashing every other nuke
---
I had it go off twice back to back yesterday, too. I also had logged out of a world when it happened the other day, only to have it going on while I was in the freaking game menu and when I logged back in.
---
"Magic" is a playerbase term for glitched effects, NOT legendary effects. The "magic" shotgun is a very weird glitch where if you have a piece of armor that with the "negate 15% more damage when blocking" effect (aka the most useless effect in the game), it causes shotguns in VATS to deal their full listed damage PER PELLET rather than for the entire pellet burst, essentially causing them to do 7x more damage. I have no idea why this specific effect causes this specific glitch on this specific weapon type, but it's honestly really funny and not as OP as you'd think because the high AP reliance causes this to crumble against swarms.
---
You can 1-2 shot lvl 60+ enemies with a bog standard, completely normal, unperked shotgun as long as you have AP, allowing for builds that can completely ditch damage perks for QoL and AP-based perks instead.

Do laser seriously work now? I‚Äôve been holding onto a b2525 laser rifle forever hoping this day would come. Is bean splitter still the move even without explosive?
---
Wow! And here I was thinking my daughter's level was high, she's level 405... I think it's going to take a little while until I get there. üòÇ
---
"An zesty drink" -jeremy clarksson. He used that alot i as im from sweden i learn from english speakers. He uses that from time to time and i thought is was for comedic emphesis(just being funny). Enhlish is not my first language why do everyone gang up on me for this?! Fucking hate reddit sometimes
---
Adamantium skeleton and fireproof are some of the best perks in the game. Endurance isn't the most exciting to perk into, but in my experience high endurance builds are the strongest.
---
I mean the legendary loot pool is random so you‚Äôre guaranteed to get trash items sometimes. But imagine getting a bloodied chainsaw or a furious one. That would honestly be great and would make me want to use it in combat.
---
Sniffed my first at the yellow house next to Slocum Joe. You can find fascinating stuffs there. Good luck üòÜ
---
Firecracker Berry traps!
---
I was thinking like NW and private worlds there could be an option for Fallout Light. Maybe give a larger building allowance for people who enjoy building and exploring with out a massive fire fight.
---
Is she within the bounds of your camp?
---
I‚Äôve never seen mounted head plans and at level 197 I have no idea where to get them, but I found tons of them just dropped on the ground in whitesprings. I guess I can thank people duping them for why me and my friends learned the plans now.
---
**13** perk card packs from this season.
---
104 Perk Coins
---
Oh, right on! I thought you were saying this was a sketch that you were going to finish in paint. Keep up the awesome work!!!
---
My first instinct upon seeing it was to sniff and I was so happy the game approved
---
That's interesting if you do it on purpose. I only recall happening when the game crashes, so it is in fact a way your data is saved on the server.
---
I could see the chainsaw working with slugger as it‚Äôs held with two hands, but it could also be heavy weapons (don‚Äôt know about that last one but I think it could work as a heavy weapon too)
---
Let me plant fire caps!
---
Yeah she stands at the door and does it.  Some times she turns in a circle but I think she uses day tripper when I‚Äôm not around...
---
My grandpa keeps running around the exterior of my camp like he‚Äôs looking for a bathroom. I put him in a chally the moo moo costume with backpack and it‚Äôs the best thing ever to see him zoom around.
---
Why did people down vote this? His actually giving away a rare drop. I do not understand reddit. Might go back to lurking.
---
"you wont believe how much "strange" stuff isnt even common knowledge for most of the playerbase"
---
You mean like how having a Junkies weapon equipped is currently boosting the damage of throwables?
---
I'd be willing to donate to a camp tip box for some of the really cool builds.
---
Not tried without the beam splitter but yes, just been melting all enemies in prime events. Well an hour ago, but yes sir, they are good. Automatic that is, beam splitter, also adding a prime receiver adds nearly 20% damage, then obviously a big bonus to scorched.
---
My Junkies was at 70 odd, added prime and it jumped up to 90. Also the build I tested this on doesn't even have commando perks lol.
---
A tiny paper shredder literally does more damage than a fucking chainsaw with flames on it like WHAT.
---
Ah i thought there was crossplay in this game my bad. Thanks bud
---
This is why the bos should take or our nukes...
---
do what Angry Turtle does, shoot them down to 1%, then bash them for the melee death
---
No motivation to do it. U dun get guaranteed 3* for achieving under 8 minutes. And chances that U will receive the same rare plans for the hard work is a turn off. You cant sell nor pass to another character. Waste time to do it over and over again.
---
Moreover, there is a scrip limit n storage limit, so, whats the point of continously grinding?
---
Not being negative, but I find the planning of the game mechanism weak to keep us feel fresh or motivated.
---
A good game but...
---
Wow a live dinosaur I thought they where Wiped out during the 2019 Fallout 1st atomic blast
---
Thanks!!
---
Highly doubt it. There is plenty of empty space to build on. Seriously, I highly doubt they would invest in designing new geography at this point, it‚Äôs already huge.
---
So much win in this thread.
---
I had like 3 replies typed out and deleted them all. Can't make this stuff up.
---
It also doesn't take into account,that nobody at lvl 500 is gonna scrap literally all his cards,to max 6 legendaries.
---
If you are concerned about fitting all your mods...
---
Rename you mods in your data folder and in your Fallout76Custom.ini file.
---
For example, instead of PerkLoadoutManager.ba2 use PLM.ba2
---
Bold of you to assume that cranberries didn't existed before great war.
---
My calculations weren‚Äôt meant to take that into account. But yeah it‚Äôs nice to know you can get more that way.
---
Hey, look at that. I didn't realize the last three give multiple packs! That's great!
---
Jet packs become useless if you run marsupial mutation
---
PS4, sadly, but thanks for the offer.
---
Good idea! I haven‚Äôt tried paints yet only worked with colored pencil and marker! Not sure how I‚Äôd fare in painting!
---
tatos are combinations of potatos and tomatos though..
---
[already did](https://i.imgur.com/AffvVmn.png).
---
just curious of how much i could expand it.
---
thats.. how salt works isnt it?
---
You get 3.6 Perk Coins on average per level. 2 from the card you pick at each level up. 8 from the perk card packs at every fifth level.  That‚Äôs 18 cards every 10 levels. 36 PC/10 levels. 
---
Improving a legendary card to Rank 4 costs 300 PC. So that‚Äôs 1800 PC for all six. At a glance, that‚Äôs 500 levels. 
---
But you‚Äôre forgetting a few things. 
---
- 13 Perk Cards available this season. 
---
- 13 Perk Cards available last season. 
---
- 50 free Perk Coins for hitting level 50
---
- The fact that you get some perk card packs more frequently than every fifth level early on.
---
And there are perks that work just fine without being maxed out. The more of those you take, the fewer perk coins you‚Äôll need.
---
That could work but not xp I‚Äôd want to see better equipment locked behind the harder mode. After level 120 or so your build should be more than capable of doing everything easily. Beyond that levels don‚Äôt mean a crap load and certainly at 302  for me I‚Äôm not bothered about gaining levels
---
Those are gourds, not pumpkins. Can you turn them in at the pumpkin house or use them for pumpkin recipes? I don't believe so, but maybe I am mistaken. I grow 6 of them myself as they are an ingredient for XP-boosting cranberry relish.
---
Ironically, a gourd is generally used as a descriptor for an inedible squash (the pumpkin of course being an edible squash).
---
I was just thinking this morning: now that they have One Wasteland, could they have a setup like Diablo 3 where you can choose your difficulty whenever you feel like it? It would be nice to be able to set it lower occasionally just to have a relaxing mat-collecting day in the apocalypse.
---
Ohhh I never even realized! Shading and contrast with pencil is for sure my strong suit! Thanks for the comparison!!!!
---
The beauty of the Secret Service jet pack is that it only drains action points, because you‚Äôre not using a fusion core...highly recommend!
---
I‚Äôm level 800 with full set now if unyeilding sentinel secret service armor with every non hacked cheating weapon you could want, and there needs to be a hard mode.  I‚Äôm unkillable even with 18% hp nothing can hurt me, not even poison now, and everything dies instantly.
---
I would really like an endless defense type of daily op that would just get progressively harder with better rewards.  I think something like that with a bigger time investment also worth the amount of time farming ammo chems and food, and give us rewards like every 10 waves.
---
Definitely not true.  You can't jump that high with marsupial.
---
I think you forgot to account for the perk pack being scrapped. Perk cards are worth 2 perk coins each.
---
10 level ups = 20 perk coins
---
2 perk packs 4*2 = 8 perk cards = 16 perk coins
---
20+16=36
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of awesome!
---
I keep gourds around for cranberry relish but just recently got rid of my corn, crops take up wayyyyyyyyyy too much budget.
---
What are your two easy areas? I know a couple of decent places for the Starlight Creeper, but not enough for 100 Berry Mentats, even with Chemist.
---
How is it 500g a day shouldn't be 1700g per week
---
Gods I am glad Reddit has a "block user" button. Have a nice day!
---
Good now those stealth snipers won't join rad rumble and I can solo in peace.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look again I was going to all the shooting ranges that I could think of but nothing worked
---
Once you read the plan, SS amour drop as legendary loot. And can be chanced at legendary vendor.
---
They did?
---
is the Lucky Hole Mine an event or location?
---
Of course not, it would probably be closer to 600 levels. This was just an exercise to give an estimate.
---
Do you know how scams work?  They literally tell you what you get up front.  Its not like you are opening a random loot box like in Apex (which IS a scam).  The main focus of Fallout 1st is the Atoms and the scrap box.  The fact that we get exclusive items is pretty much just considered a bonus, at least for me.  If someone buys Fallout 1st thinking otherwise then they didn't spend enough time looking into the service, which is a mistake on their part not Bethesda's.  Hell, they even tell you that you can cancel at any time and KEEP the items from the time you had the service.  Don't get me wrong, I also would like to see an FO1 exclusive atom shop with all previous and future content put there for people to buy if they so choose.  But FO1 is not a scam in the slightest.
---
You've literally just typed a rude paragraph to me because I made the suggestion that the developers are bored with the game. Idiot
---
Gotcha. staying stocked on Lead and Steel was my primary issue but thing have been resolved. thank you for your input!!
---
:c
---
Yh I agree with most of it but I guaranty if they removed cap limit people would find a exploit in the first 30 mins to get to 999999999999999999999999999999999999 caps
---
You know whenever I try to write a helpful guide, I try to get the right info first.
---
I think I'm going to go with big guns, it seems I've just been resource managing wrong. thank you for the dissection!
---
Not in the calculation:
---
You get 50 perk points at lvl 50
---
There's always that 1 person who sits outside and just 1 shots the night stalker where it spawns
---
Can we get a fix to be able to remove/move the stand with pumpkins, please? You can't select it since Wastelanders.
---
No I miss typed and miss read haha. Saw the 18 perks and read that as 18 coins
---
In my personal experience,it's more like mid 800,unless you really want to cut all your build flexibility
---
It was 24 on release, so, clearly they have no idea what they're talking about
---
Sorry, forgot to add strange in numbers
---
Yep, all those things will certainly help with the grind. My math was not meant to be exhaustive, just something I scribbled down and thought some people would be interested in.
---
Damage numbers just lie.  My energy weapons all say they are doing less damage but I am killing enemies much more quickly than before with them.
---
If only we had target dummies for our camp to do actual accurate DPS tests for our builds.
---
You're going to want to google this stuff....important end-game currency and gear.
---
Welcome home!
---
The whole point of those weapons/builds is so we can 1-3 shot most things.  Iv spent years getting the collection I have, hours figuring things out, just to have it change every few months because part time players think it's too hard!!!  Or not fair!! 
---
It's not fair I gota keep changing my guns and armour and perks slightly to keep up with the moaners, but I do it
---
That‚Äôs a bug that would then need to get fixed. It would be in their best interest to actually fix it, but sadly they find it easier to just cap it and let players deal with it. Also, a Cap limit is fine, but it needs to be way high than 30k. At least 100k would be sufficient.
---
Seriously, I halfway consider rad sponge to be griefing now.
---
Yes. My two-shot combat rifle likes to reload itself with between 5-9 rounds left, always at a really bad time.
---
Thanks for your comment. I completely agree about the XP, especially with the regular buffs and lunch box‚Äôs.. for me it‚Äôs just far quicker to level from 2-3,3-4 and 4-5, then delete it.. Does Beth really think players are grinding a level 700+ character for 250 score..
---
You are correct its 200 per day and 300 Per Week from Smiley will correct. Thanks!
---
This game is wack
---
Ah gotcha :)
---
Bethesda: Give us money and we'll give you more atoms than you paid for, a tent, private servers, a scrap box AND free stuff every month.
---
You: Okay, that seems fair here's my money.
---
\*Bethesda gives you 1st\*
---
You: OMG WHY AM I NOT GETTING MORE THAN THIS 1ST IS A SCAM! 1ST IS A SCAM! 1ST IS A SCAM!
---
very helpful thanks
---
I actually really hate the heart emote. Most of the emotes if I'm to be perfectly honest. They're the most annoying and immersion breaking part of the game for me.
---
Yeh totally agree but I was taken back when I started to shoot things, OP for PVE anyway. I'd like test dummies, hopefully one day. The division 2 has a few good things that would be good for 76. The range, rerolling armor and weapons etc. Well stats on them.
---
Never. I destroyed a camp on my own once when people actually activated pvp once in a while. That‚Äôs about it since beta
---
Maybe we could also put armor on them to test against different resistances and stuff
---
BIG GUNS-
---
Pros: Highest damage per second. Not reliant on sneak for high damage. Can ignore normal armor for Power Armor. (Pretty much meaning you can ignore legendary armor entirely) Best weapon choice for boss/raid enemies. Strong damage no matter the situation
---
Cons: High ammo consumption. Ammo isn't easy to find off bodies. Damage difference only really shines in raid scenarios. Heavy weapons overall
---
RIFLES-
---
Pros: High damage per ammo value. (You'll spend very, very little ammo thus you really don't need to hold as much on your person.) 
---
Cons: Outclassed by Automatic Rifles/Big Guns in most cases. Lowest damage per second. Useless in raids
---
AUTOMATIC RIFLES-
---
Pros: Good damage all around. Sneak damage is strong, and consistent. Not as heavy on ammo consumption as Big Guns. Plenty of solid weapon choices.
---
Cons: Very reliant on sneak perks to keep up with Big Guns. Still requires a lot of ammo for constant use. Some ammo is annoying to craft in bulk. (IE .45 rounds)
---
I know this is late, but carry around a tesla gun. it can kill things through walls/floors.
---
Mutant squirrel simulator xDDDD
---
Now that's a 200 IQ play right there!
---
I would suggest upping your Strength to 15. Blocker is a must have defensive perk and is waaay better than Ironclad, which at 5 points for 50 DR is bad. Take the point from End. You only really need Fireproof 3 and Radicool. In Int, lose Gunsmith. 5 pts is too much to waste for a mere convienance. You will (if you stick to heavy guns) eventually need Batteries Included. In AGI, lose dodgy. It steals all your AP, but only gives 10-30% damage reduction. Only use if you don't ever want or need AP. Also, 5 in Adrenalin can be fun. I keep a 5 and a 1 and a 2 in Adreneline so I can move some points around. Born Survivor 1 and Escape Artist are super useful.  I have 9 pts in Agi. And add 3 points to luck, you absolutely must have Bloody mess, for a static +15% damage to ALL damage output is a no brainer.
---
My favorite thing at Thanksgiving is always the cranberry sauce.
---
The game makes me want to try and make cranberry relish.
---
There's a responders backpack?! :0
---
So I‚Äôm actually going to be finishing the wasterlanders vault break shortly. I get the SS gear comes from gold bullion- so am I looking specifically for a stand alone jet pack or so I need a torso to go with this? Don‚Äôt want to spend it on X when I really needed Y if you know what I mean!

---
This a pretty standard rifleman/sneak sniper build. It‚Äôs what I use now. Strength is a toss up as you can tailor that to your needs. Same with endurance. It kinda comes down to what you want as a unique feeling for your build.
---
With a Jason outfit
---
Just because they had better damage in older games doesn‚Äôt mean they have to in 76
---
No worries!  
---
I‚Äôm actually hoping they add ‚ÄòPerk Coins‚Äô as a reward in Season 3.
---
True. But even with that, it's a good source for XP.
---
Challenges -&gt; world, scroll down till you see the tadpole badges. You can tag them so you get notified when you make progress, but joining nuclear winter unsets the tags.
---
Possum badges will be there too after you graduate from tadpole
---
I think one of the tadpole wants pictures of animals, which a bunch of spawn at the meat week cookout conveniently.
---
Hell yes
---
Very much depends on your playstyle. I like Follow Through on my gunners, Hack N Slash on my melees, use SPECIAL legendaries where it makes sense to add perk cards, Survival Shortcut and Ammo Factory are nice QOL choices.
---
I always ask a wanted player near me if they want me to kill them on the ps chat app.
---
I don‚Äôt have issues with caps, because I just buy plans and stuff when I‚Äôm getting around 20,000, but legendary scrip can be quite debilitating, and it affects everyone
---
You can rename any weapon or armour. The option is at the bottom when you highlight the weapon
---
tank killer, bloody mess,  crits perks in luck, concentrated fire and all rifleman cards. are you bloody or full health? stealth or not?
---
I wish my mom played video gemes with me back in the day :(
---
Do you wanna be my mommy?
---
Yeah, they need a way to make the grind a bit easier. Maybe pay some out through events too.
---
Thank you, I‚Äôve been hearing that as well. I might just use my legendary cards for the increase in my SPECIALS
---
I guess I don't want it enough to deal with buying it. I think it would be cool if meat just universally stayed with the corpses regardless whether you were part of a kill. Seems more realistic. Maybe only one instance of heart/lungs/brain etc.. but I see a big corpse so gotta be meat there right? Take enough and the corpse disappears.
---
Hitting elder rolls all 3 chances. Been explained a hundred times already. 
---
It‚Äôs rng - you had no luck so far. That‚Äôs all there is.
---
For me scrip and daily cap limits are the worst for sure.
---
you guys are all so helpful!!!! I think I am going to run big guns, I want to be a big part of SBQ, Raids, and events
---
Jesus how do you have 28 mods on here? I have like, 4 maybe if that
---
What 28 mods are worth having?
---
Also mutfruits are well, mutated fruit.
---
Last I tried (a year ago or more) Brawling didn't actually add any damage for me. Pip boy or actual. May be worth looking into. Could get a couple more deep pocket mods.

So then why choose a lower durability weapon with zero bennifits that require exclusive perks for mods which also lower the durability with lower gains when compared to other weapons in its class? It makes no sense at all when you could easily have less perks / int and spend less resources for a better weapon, whats the incentive to use laser when the gun is more resource intensive with zero advantages?
---
Finally, someone with the guts to mention this.
---
It's a location, near fort defiance.
---
The min has many lead ore nodes, and with excavator armor, you can get 4x the yield per gathering.
---
I don't recall which pieces exactly, but if you with a full set of excavator PA, you get 4x yield and the +100 carry weight from the full set bonus.
---
[https://www.kevduit.com/best-lead-farm-in-fallout-76/](https://www.kevduit.com/best-lead-farm-in-fallout-76/)
---
I normally come out with 400-500 ore, so you need like 200-250 acid to smelt it and will get you 1000+ lead scrap, more depending on how often super duper perk kicks in.
---
Then you just need alot of steel and gunpowder.
---
Thanks very helpful
---
Between my two characters, I think I have like 8 extras....I'll take them, over another cursed Harpoon gun.
---
If you don‚Äôt like laser weapons then just don‚Äôt use them
---
Could you test damage with a friend or is player vs player damage calculated differently?
---
Yep, and let legendary NPCs use the weapons/armor that they drop.
---
Ah man you just made my day. Cheers!
---
This is the first Fallout without a dog.  Yeah, i know you can train a mongrel or mutant hound, but i wouldn't want to tame a pet just to have it die.  A dog tied to a dog house, like the Brahmin and the wheelbarrow would be awesome.  Or one with an ally object!
---
Yeah, my friend and I suffer from the scrip limits - we do uranium fever and radiation rumble almost every time they show up, as well as meat week events, and I do upwards of five daily operations a day, so the crummy legendaries really pile up
---
(I‚Äôm looking at you, one-handed melee weapons and armor with like 12 defense)
---
Because they don't want people to have easy access to more caps than they've already allowed.
---
The economy in this game is already shit, the only thing keeping prices "low" at this point is that it's difficult for people to charge more than 30k for anything without having to use trades as a substitute.
---
Having a higher cap limit just means that instead of people demanding 30k for their god roll legendary they'll demand 120k.
---
Where was this said? Not doubting you, just curious.
---
Beat me to it damn. Yeah biv is the logical answer to this. Maybe get some new steins and lederhosen outfits lol yodel emote XD
---
[Just run hybrid.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1843fa&amp;d=a12ss2se2l71lu2a72lt2ce0eu0ee2ao0pe0sg2aj2eh2x83lk2sd0so0sp0s92cu2ir2an2la2lv0a00as0&amp;m=01c29fe8gh7b3)
---
That's what I usually run. Mostly for unarmed melee, but shotguns in a pinch. You can go scattershot instead of shotgun damage perks, or drop melee perks for shotgun perks when needed (perk loadouts couldn't come quicker, pls). I drop glow sight for skeet shooter sometimes. I also drop tenderizer for party boy sometimes. As well as fireproof for chem fiend in boss fights (have backup asbestos armor). And you can drop sneak perks for adrenaline 5 and enforcer 3 if in daily ops. 
---
Tbh, if you got a magic shotgun accidentally it doesn't really matter much what perks you're running cause you'll still 1 shot weak stuff and 2 shot buffier stuff while using VATS.
---
Well I was say Master Infiltrator is nice because you get lock pick and hacking 3. As you continue to level you could free up those perk slots if you have any of those perks used. 
---
Ammo Factory is absolutely amazing, and pairing it with Ammo Perk in ability should take care of all your ammunition needs. I also believe you get 50 perk points right off the bat so you can rank any card to 2 stars.
---
What Rads is a nice card as well if you are having rad issues.
---
I would say either Ammo Factory or Master Infiltrator would be your best bet. You can also unequip a perk for the cost of 1 perk point.
---
The area around Lost Home for brain fungus and carrot flower, pretty much the lower part of the bog is great for carrot flower and brain fungus. Then the large area between slocum joe, gorge junkyard workshop and the the hill leading up to arktos pharma have the starlight creeper, firecap and firecracker berries.

No worries mate, have fun. üëçüòâ

Of course! Always wanted more kids! ‚ù§

It‚Äôs the first mainstream game to not have a dog :( 
---
(I say mainstream because who the heck remembers the Fallout Tactics or Fallout BoS series)
---
I think someone was able to solo earl post patch with a junkies 10mm but I don't know any more details sadly:(
---
People think the economy is broken now, imagine if there was no limit to caps.... Bugs or exploits aside the limit is there to keep things moving, not to stop exploiters.

Junkie‚Äôs The Fixer
---
Gotta admit, what you have become!
---
mostly (4k) re-textures,  soundreplacer and QoL stuff. 
---
i know someone who is able to port and create new mods.
---
Junkies is magic. So is 50% limb damage if that is what is on the AA and Bl. That is why they are performing so well.
---
Same with SS Armor...
---
It just doesnt make sence.
---
Caps for sure need a limit, but the limit we have now is too low.
---
didnt they confirm thats its literaly been a year ingame since we got out of the vault when wastelanders launched though?
---
It's visual. If you look it goes from zero and back up a bit.
---
WHHHAAAAAATTTT That sounds awesome! I'll look into it!
---
Which perks are the ones that work fine without being maxed out?
---
Definitely appears to be the case - a few times, I‚Äôve been able to cancel the reload by sprinting for a moment to continue shooting, but it‚Äôs still weird
---
Welcome to the game. You're not the only "elder" playing so you'll fit right in!
---
You'd think the ultimate real life time sink would be just the thing they'd want to put in the game.
---
Bloodied stealth
---
This is wholesome lol. If you're on xbox and need any help, feel free to ask. I hoard all my supplies like a madman so my stash is loaded and I would be happy to share anything you need with you. Welcome to 76 :)
---
It could just be all talk haha, I've been trying to find the run too, my friend refuses to use anything other than pistols and he's been depresso espresso since the patch, so I thought it'd hype him up haha
---
It was good when I had no caps. The tent as a free travel location and a way to dump junk was great. I cancelled it this month. I don't need to be paying such a high free for this anymore. It's useful because they programmed the problems into the game to begin with.
---
Slask_Tratt btw!!
---
Daily ops is my favorite thing they added to the game. Even when dealing with those resistant bitches. 
---
I solo it and finally got elder yesterday.
---
Ugh! That suuuucks.
---
What gun are you using?
---
Reason asking, how ranged it is, close or long/mid range?
---
Str
---
That said, do you need blocker, are you getting beat up by melee mobs or can you shoot them all down before they reach you. If you can kill them all without them hitting you mostly, then I'd drop this card for something better.
---
Per
---
Do you use VATS or not? (again, I don't know what weapons you're using mostly)
---
Glow Sight has limited use, what else could you put there instead? Or can you put a lvl1 glow sight, and 2 other lvl1 perks there to boost stuff all the time, not juts when you see a glowing creature, which is not the majority of the time.
---
End
---
Radicool/iron clad, must haves, I run those.   Rejuvinated, you can do without. It adds more HP... which you don't need being bloodied. You want less HP overall... more HP just means your health meter is stretched out farther.. maybe giving you an extra HP or two max on the low end after nerd rage kicks in.
---
Char
---
looks good, easy to swap stuff in and out here.
---
Int
---
Nerd rage and at least some level of gunsmith a must..depending how fast your weapon wears out, you can even lower gunsmith to lvl3 or so and still get long use out of it. 
---
Agi
---
I don't run dodgy, I run evasive instead, but I'm also running 14points of agi too.
---
Luck
---
Looks good. Starched genes and class freak are a must (helps negate all the -STR stuff that everything else uses). That leaves you 
---
for the legendary perks... just hold off on upgrading those any more until you really dial in what you REALLY need for regular perk cards.
---
It's a good start, I run most of the same stuff.
---
My fixer 3-5 shots most things (used to 1-shot before update)... and my magic shotgun 1-shots everything but giant creatures and bosses.
---
Thats something i didnt know. You are right.
---
I was on about normal perk cards but thanks
---
Wait we can use mods with this game
---
I‚Äôm honestly glad I‚Äôm to the point where I have basically all the gear I could need with good enough legendaries so I can just sit at the scrip cap and be fine. That being said, screw the cap. Bullion and caps are both fine since caps are being used for fast travel and bullion can be stored as notes infinitely, but scrip needs something, even if it‚Äôs just that we can convert them to vouchers or something.
---
You will need to use the SS armor chest piece jet pack mod, which can be purchased with the gold bullion.
---
The back to back thing was really bad, I thought it was never going to stop.
---
Fallout is crazy. Do you still have all of that in your inventory? If so then it‚Äôs a Bethesda thing. If not then something went terribly wrong and you should probably contact them.
---
Yeah, if the base of you camp is really complicated, the chances that everything will sit flat on another piece of ground are slim. I don't typically move my camp, but I did move it recently with the intent to ditch everything and rebuild from scratch. I had nothing blueprinted, but when I moved my camp, it automatically blueprinted my whole house, and I had the option to try to place that blueprint or to destroy the blueprint and put all the materials in my stored tab
---
since beta, yes.

What's follow through?
---
The real reason that they probably won't? They probably can't. This game is spaghetti code...
---
My 18 month old turns on my Xbox, and proceeds to run around the house with the controlled killing its batteries. Gotta change em for the charged set like every other day. ü§£
---
serendipity, nerd rage, dodgy, sneak, fireproof,starched genes(adrenal reaction mutation is great for bloody)
---
I never even thought to check. Any good recommendations?
---
Ok I‚Äôm finishing lunch then I‚Äôll add you!
---
Yep, definitely gonna try that tonight, thanks.

Free 100 caps for killing a few bits since no one did it you didn't have to do any pvp.

As someone who lives in a town on the banks of the Ohio River I have always heard stories of monster cat fish the size of school buses that lurk at the bottom of the river.  Would be cool to actually have that in the game.  Problem is, the river in the game isn't very deep and would not really allow for large scale irradiated fish.
---
Added ranged damage on same target for 10 seconds. Great for bosses but useful even for mobs if you‚Äôre not already one-shotting them.
---
That this even needs to be said its kind of scary.   The layouts are very simple after doing them just one time.
---
Ive tamed cats, and they never make it to my camp.
---
&gt; Extra credits: if you can tell me what one can be compared to 2 other locations on the map, for the same things... 
---
Sorry, I guess I get no extra credit, I cannot decipher your statement.
---
Alr thanks I'll get this or nerdrage not decided
---
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Took it back, and I‚Äôm a pirate so good luck getting my comment again.
---
How about we 10x that idea and make the lamp the gun leg from ‚ÄòPlanet Terror‚Äô?
---
F
---
It's extremely active.
---
It's rare a big event doesn't get completed. Of course this also depends on your time zone too... slower in the day, super busy at night, etc, etc.
---
I know it has been beaten to death but the SS plans suck to buy multiple times on different characters. They need a way to transfer stuff like that over, along with weapons with skins applied.
---
For sure! Well let me know if you find it. I'm looking around but am not seeing much.
---
With greenthumb pitcher plants give you 8 adhesive each, you can rack up a lot of adhesive quick just with them. If you've got nothing else to spend caps on it's not a bad thing to buy though.
---
Wow, they start younger each year! üòÇ
---
True, but with the ammo factory legendary perk and ammo return from daily ops it's the best time to try this. Of course not everyone can sustain this, but we are talking about min maxing here
---
The 50 is crit damage and Laser Rifles are not magic.
---
Magic weapons are guns with fire rates over 200 with said prefixes and majors, some other weapons but with the blocking effect on armor, or in vats. Something like that anyway, I'm certain they can't be Magic.
---
I do know that ER is being penetrated properly now as it wasn't before patch 22. That's one of the reasons the Qffr tesla has become popular in pvp again, people realised it was doing good damage, even at full health. As I did, that and what someone said recently. So I tested what I could and it's nothing to do with magic weapons, Bethesda fixed something without a band aid.
---
when doing the daily ops, Core based and Melee weapons make enemies drop random ammo, getting a fresh core per enemy kill would allow people to gain a TON of easy ammo, even more than with minigun kills
---
Separate kinds of perks. I listed legendary ones which you will have access to ‚Äúat the big 5 0‚Äù. üôÇ
---
\*kidnap to silence before BGS gets the idea to put slaughterfish in 76\*
---
PvP dmg has a cap per hit so you can't test the full DPS of your build as if it were on a target dummy.
---
Thank you!! ‚ù§
---
if you use it during a daily op it will give you ultracite plasma cores at the end as a reward
---
cores don't drop
---
If you‚Äôre worried about tagging a mob, just shoot them without vats once first, then try the vats thing. OP didn‚Äôt seem worried about tagging, just how to get vats to work
---
Ah ok yh ok then f
---
Def gonna get that one
---
I almost got elder solo the other day... 8:03.... Exited my PA by accident.... Still haven‚Äôt managed elder....
---
What does ESO offer?  Is it a better deal?  Its disappointing they wouldn‚Äôt make them comparable.
---
For my fellow XP farmers: one violent night is the most overrated event in the game.
---
Sweet! 
---
Well that‚Äôs my mind made up: upgrade the PC, get Xbox pass, link PC to twin 4K TVs...

most important:  
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) (perk loadouts for up to 12 saves for each individual character, requires SFE)

[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) (Better Inventory, makes inventory management a huge chunk less pain in the ass. also filters unimportant items like keys etc).
---
Where does it state that END helps poison res or rad res? It helps disease resist, and reduces the action point drain from sprinting, and is supposed to give hp.
---
As somebody who is thinking of signing up for a month just for the cosmetics and some atoms, this would seal the deal for me.
---
Yeah they could just insert text that our pip boy calendars are malfunction al. Easy peasy
---
I believe you get a couple of cores at the end of the event as rewards. Adding cores as loot from regular enemies would make you get literally dozens of cores per run which for obvious reasons is not something Bethesda wants.
---
Still not enough
---
Yep, great idea! Even as a First member my storage box is sometimes almost full with legendary stuff. Can't imagine, how a non-paying member does handle this. Maybe this is the reason, why i recently found some paper bags with legendaries in it?
---
Thanks im using a bloodied gatling gun

I have had no problems with brain fungus by the dumpsters at the Whitespring Service Entrance.

In this interview he did https://youtu.be/OI1JIwuV554

When has Bethesda been able to lock *anything* down?
---
Ok I added you, I‚Äôm online rn
---
And it makes the drops have actual value and desirability, as they REALLY would be rare.
---
True, yet if you spend any time in the trading sub that shall not be named you can see that you can get hundreds of flux quite easily
---
I like to keep one cryolator just in case you don‚Äôt have a lot of manpower for some tougher enemies (SBQ, imposter Sheepsquatch, alphas in project paradise or daily ops bosses). You can freeze them multiple times to really slow their movements down, letting you go all out with your high dps weapons for much longer without getting hit. It‚Äôs all personal preference though
---
I sold my Ultracite Gatling Laser because it would constantly leave me with piles of fusion cores with 50-100 shots in them.

I was just going off the wiki haven't tested anything myself yet.

https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Endurance
---
id say keep it until you can get a better one, like a quad one
---
How was the durability though? I only use my legacy laser in Ops now because of the durability buff in the Ops. Outside of Ops it breaks super fast. I realize the legacy explosive effect is part of the problem. Wondering if they are usable without the explosive though.
---
If Power Armor Reboot activates, you don't die, you have instant full health

Turrets take up 2% - 3% depending on the turret.
---
I give my 2yr old son my old ps3 controller so he thinks he‚Äôs playin with me when I play lol. But he s catching on cuz now he always wants to switch lol.
---
True, but in the spirit of maximizing damage Ultracite ammo has to used.
---
Before they add more plants (which I would absolutely love) they really *REALLY* need to take a look at the crop's clipping problems. The area around some of them (namely some of the bushes and the vined plants) have terrible problems where you can't even really place them correctly because the game has such a fit if they're even anywhere close to each other. While I understand that it could be problematic to have like 5 razorgrains piled on top of each other, there needs to be a little bit of leeway for how close we can put stuff together.
---
Hopefully with the upgrades the Series X will provide, that won‚Äôt be as much of an issue
---
Cryolator is generally used for slowing down bosses. 25% faster fire rate is helpful for that purpose.
---
The other two rolls are near-worthless on a Cryolator though.
---
Quality post.
---
Don't you have the heart emote? I use that to throw love at camps ‚ù§
---
I definately will haha
---
Yeah I use it, but if you are maximizing damage you should be leaving daily ops with more ammo than you started with
---
Dang sounds like awesome parents in here. My mom and especially dad keep telling me I gotta let go of my video games :'( that I'm too old for them.

Do you like using it? If so, keep it. If not, scrip it.

I really need to start farming my own.just never planted anything aside some basic plants for score..nothing sucks more than running out of adhesive crafting radium rifles trying to unlock mods so I'll take your advice and plant some pitcher plants
---
Do the riot gear eyes light of red ?
---
The very same thing happened to me about 2 weeks ago. I assumed a glitch was responsible. Nothing was missing, but had to reload everything.
---
How on earth...?
---
Well, uh... use one and sell the others, I guess.
---
Thanks for the clarification -- wasn't aware LRs couldn't do so. I have a few other junkies weapons under 200 fire rate that exhibit magic damage, thus the assumption.
---
&gt;I do know that ER is being penetrated properly now as it wasn't before patch 22.
---
That makes sense. I have an AA/25/15 (114 fire rate) flamer that is performing very well compared to a B/E/90 flamer at full hp. If only it didn't break when sneezed on.
---
Hack and slash seems to be proccing about right for me I think, maybe it does feel slightly less often then it should
---
I was able to do uranium fever, and 3 prime events plus clear harpers ferry before it broke. The durability was just over 120%.

yo thank you!!!! you're a g. I would have never went into this location had you not said anything.

 Currently I have Plague Walker. Twisted Muscle and Bird Bones. I‚Äôm only using dilute Radaway. So far so good. Playing at 1/2-3/4 Health is tough at this low level. Thanks to this Reddit and YouTube I‚Äôm figuring it out
---
Nope. Nor should they be downgradable. I mean the abuse would be to far rampant with ammo factory alone and it would allow you to bypass the purpose of the legendary perks which is all about the xp grind slowly opening up new slots and making fun, creative, min/max, or efficient builds.   
---
We all had time to plan what would be best or most viable especially if you like to swap builds with the inclusive of SPECIAL perks that alone with all six max level opens up 30 perk points if you move around SPECIAL points.

---
Sneak commando/heavy gunner, it is more to show what can be done than a do it this way.
---
I think this could also be a really easy add to the game but it‚Äôs been overlooked for some reason. I could see how there might be issues with language from users (hate speech and what not) but there‚Äôs ways to counteract that in text chat
---
Aside from explosives and non automatic weapons, how often do automatics hit the damage cap per shot though? 
---
Testing automatic rifles and heavies with another player should be possible right? Not ideal though, yeah
---
When I would pick them at my camp they would pop up in my inventory as pumpkins so idk
---
It‚Äôs all experimentation and fun
---
I know, I used to play with someone who always said they got the best 3* in the burrows.  I say charleston, but it's just luck of the spawn
---
Atom shop skin, not sure if it‚Äôs still there
---
If somebody wants to pay 120k for a GRL they want bad enough, then they should be able to do so in a free market. Who are you to decide what somebody spends their caps on?
---
Yep, took me some time to get all parts together. The positive thing was, that you have not to buy all the mods for all parts again, but can use them on all. ;)

Eh there‚Äôs enough people in the servers most of the time already

What

I've heard the helmet doesn't give environmental protections so I'm putting that much lower on my priorities even though it looks awesome.

So I won't be joining Ops for a bit.

If you haven‚Äôt experienced any bugs so far, then that‚Äôs awesome! Shows how Bethesda has made a lot of progress since Day 1 release of the BETA, and I‚Äôm thankful for the changes/fixes they have made. Unfortunately myself and a large portion of the population of 76 have experienced bugs that can range from annoying to game-breaking

You're never to old to enjoy the things that make you happy, c'mon!

... but I still tell my kid to lay off gaming for a few hours a day, if I don't she just spends the whole day there. üòÇ
---
Gunsmith or anything?
---
Junkies laser can be magic with the beam splitter. Multiple projectiles makes it proc.
---
It‚Äôs the future tech camp skin. If that‚Äôs what you have in your camp, all allies will just stand outside your camp. Sometimes when they engage enemies in combat, they may move to your camp and just stand there, but they don‚Äôt act as intended (don‚Äôt use their own camp object or other usable objects). Only way to fix it is remove the skin then replace your camp
---
Oh. That is good to know. I was on the fence about it.
---
Usually is.
---
 Or a clue.
---
Yeh I love my AAE but damn it breaks to fast!!
---
That said I was able to complete 3 prime events, clear Harpers Ferry and almost Uranium Fever before my regurlar laser broke. At the end of the day they could be Magic in some other way, maybe broke after the patch.

Ahh fair enough, I did not know this. Appreciate it.

Mine started Skyrim at 6 and was in fallout by 8. It won't be long lol

You‚Äôll need the plan for the torso, and then the plan for the jet pack mod. And when it comes to Wastelanders, remember one thing....greed is good!
---
I'd be interested in buying one off of you.
---
It's a little more expensive but they have special ESO Plus only offers in the store for the loot chests and cosmetic goods.  I really thought FO1st was gonna get us access to special deals in the Atom store.  Kinda disappointed that it doesn't.
---
I think this perk is fine the way it is. Saved my ass a couple of times now.
---
I'd like to have a ROFL emote of some sort. I often see things in the game that make me genuinely laugh, so I'd like to express that joy. Mostly though when people waste a ton of ammo trying to kill me &amp; it takes them 3 reloads of fusion cores to realise I have Pacifist mode on. That always makes me laugh! But the teddy bear scenarios &amp; some awesome quirky camps (like a plushie sitting on an electric chair)... you get the idea üòÄ
---
I will often wear some outfits that hide the jetpack altogether. I think the brotherhood scribe outfit hides it. There are definitely others that do too
---
No, the character I used the lasers on is messed up. I kept switching with perks so I'm in the middle of rebuilding it.
---
I have one of my camps on the river on the west side of the map, and one of the times I fast-traveled in, it spawned me in the river but past the ‚Äòyou cannot go that way‚Äô point, and I made it to shore before I realized I was on the wrong side of the river.

I‚Äôm not sure how far west the territory actually goes (didn‚Äôt want to risk it) but there‚Äôs quite a bit of land over there, I was able to walk from across from the Silva homestead all the way up to the other side of the bridge at Point Pleasant. There‚Äôs nothing over there right now but some fallen logs, but they could easily expand into Ohio.
---
Would also love to see them open up more of the boarded-up buildings already in the game though, like they did with the frat houses.
---
If you kill the final boss in ops you get 2-4 cores
---
That's the next step, probably within the next year. Did that on my 360 when my nine year old was little.
---
I want to use laser weapons, I would just like them to be more viable whether that means damage or resource cost
---
I mean, the cap is only 110 and many automatic weapon builds can break that threshold.  There's a reason why bloodied was bad in pvp with the cap.
---
I‚Äôm level 339 and I scrapped every card I will not use. And I had 28 perk packs saved and still have 80 level ups. I was able to max out the ammo one and can fully max out another and the other 4 are at least on level 2 but one of them. It‚Äôs going to take me awhile to max it out but oh well. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. The grind is def real for this one
---
I buy and sell a lot of weapons daily, sometimes rolling over my cap max 3-4 times a day, that‚Äôs like 90-120k caps... I feel I‚Äôm a valued part of the FO76 economy, as I spend all those caps at other players venders as fast as I get them.. Usually got between 90-110 sweet weapons for sale at my shop.. I would totally love it if the cap max was raised or abolished.. I‚Äôd like to sell the high end weapons in my vender too, not just trade them.. Vending is super fun for me, and really keeps me playing..  It also gives me piles of legendary gear that I give away to low/mid level players.. Same for daily limits on script and bullion... Pretty please Beth?
---
I haven‚Äôt played 76 in a little while so is this a item you have to pay for in the atomic shop or can this be earned
---
Reminds me of family reunions. My daughter does that to her cousins, hahaha.
---
I have never seen the riot gear so I am not sure.
---
Of course! You've just joined one of the most friendliest and supportive communities!
---
Granted, you'll run into the occasional bad egg, but a large portion of people who play this game are wonderful.
---
Even despite the setting is post apocalyptic, lol
---
Oh, wow! Will beat my kid in a few months for sure! üòÇ
---
You could if you could put a cap on the dummy though. Like in the division 2 you could switch enemy type, only in 76 you could swtich to a player and the armor he or she was wearing as an additional option.
---
If you put beam splitters on them they work as "shotguns", that means you can trigger magic on vats without 200FR (you still need one of the legendary effects that triggers the magic) the same goes to plasma rifles with splitter mod or tesla with charging mod.
---
Yep, this is the one I want. Wish they made the layout a bit more complex, but awesome award.
---
It's always good to see people at every age enjoying video games, especially Fallout! Atom guide you on your journey throughout the wasteland!
---
Starched is a boring perk that felt like a mandatory pick if you wanted to run mutations, which are themselves nearly obligatory for most high level players. What Rads presents you with the option for replacing it with another perk, which is great because the Luck stat has a bunch of fantastic, interesting perks in it. So, it‚Äôs something to try and test. I find it weird that it aggravates you so much.
---
A decent amount from selling plans, I list most everything pretty cheap, 50 - 100 caps. Selling some weaps.
---
But to be honest, I think I get most my caps from selling Aid items. I have like 25 stimpacks banked, and keep 25 on me, so am constantly selling off extras. 
---
I also loot every food item from mobs and cook and sell, a lot get you 5-7 caps per.  I have 4 basic water purifiers so I'm also selling purified water (again, just keeping a few on hand)
---
The Radaway drops from the Ops go there as well.
---
Ah, I'm in ps4. I hope someone gets it then. Good luck getting rid of it
---
Most ppl are not like that, you will find a few ppl that are complete dicks. But most will help out new ppl, as I have every time I can. A level 18 shot me on accident yesterday I didn‚Äôt kill him, I could‚Äôve but didn‚Äôt. He then tried dropping me 5 radways I didn‚Äôt pick up but then I dropped him plans from meat week, plans from acp, stims, rad x, chems. Everything he could need. But you will find some here and there and some a little more lately being there is a bug with a legendary perk that allows ppl to do stuff like that. Just go into setting and change yourself into pacifist mode
---
Sweet. I've got a few lasers I've been saving for when non legacy laser stopped sucking. Great news!
---
As long as you put on pacifist mode and don't take workshops or be in the area, you will be fine
---
You can have it for free
---
Well I'll be dammed, had zero idea. I've not had or used any magic weapons to my knowledge. Well knowing this I have now. Appreciate the info, thank you.
---
Wait for one of them walking in arch decontamination
---
If half the people I meet while on Fallout are like you guys, I'll be very lucky! ‚ù§
---
My bloodied shotgun guy can switch to bloodied melee with points allocated like this:

---
Awesome psn? I have a couple extra plans if you wanna take a look as well
---
very rare -  i give low levels free gear all the time and you cant damage camps unless in pvp or use an exploit like the explosive bait
---
I‚Äôve never used it
---
My thoughts exactly. Spamming heart emote isn't exactly what it means. People might think we just liked them or enjoyed buying stuff from their vendor lol.
---
So cute :)
---
Cant say I've got too attached to companions in this game but I remember being very fond of them in fallout4
---
Most of the griefers in this game are those with hacked weapons stealing kills and xp from other players. I haven‚Äôt seen much problems in regards to ppp destroying bases. Although you may have trouble with higher lvls enemies jottings your base with the new patch. Those Chinese bots tear you to shreds very very fast....
---
From the sounds of it, he was talking about *a* Halloween event, but it doesn't directly seem to be Bombs Drop. Not saying you're wrong, but to me there's room for interpretation.
---
Caps should be limited, for the afore mentioned reasons. The other, non tradable currencies absolutely should not.
---
I find getting elder easy solo only one i couldn't solo was the first one
---
Does it do more damage with AB rounds?
---
This makes me think of the chainsaw &amp; drill. Chainsaw states 2dmg even with the flame mod &amp; longbow mod, but honestly, that thing shreds the heck out of lvl 50 enemies. I dropped one for a lvl 24 player a couple days ago &amp; took her to the lvl 50 Mr Farmhand near overseer camp, she downed that thing in seconds. 2dmg my butt! It's crazy good.
---
I‚Äôll definitely keep it them to give it a go
---
Ahh, I always believed and heard it was 10%, perhaps that was last year and they've adjusted them since then. My bad.
---
10 more dmg with the AB rounds.
---
Much less thanks to the updates that make PVP harder (unfortunate but necessary thanks to trolls and toxic players). Turn on passive and anything short of a nuke wont destroy your base from players.   
---
The one thing I saw recently was a buddy on my team accidentally shot someone right at the end of an event and they used that opportunity to kill him and loot his junk. I told him to turn on passive mode and no more issues since.  
---
I had one guy come after my workshop recently (legit for pvp). Needed a bathroom break so just went afk camouflaged (#marcoPolo) he shot his tesla for about 27 min nonstop trying to find me. Just jumping spinning and firing trying to lock on. He destroyed every object in the workshop he possibly could.  I just stayed hidden to watch what he would do. No idea how anyone has that much ammo to waste....
---
Last I recall it was on one of the kitchen counters at the General's Steakhouse!
---
Just go get the legendary perk ammosmith max it out then use the reg perk cards ammosmith and super duper. You can get 9 ult cores for only 2 plasma cores and that‚Äôs not counting super duper hitting so you get almost 18 for 2. I barely use gat plasmas but I have one bloodied and one junkies one that I changed prime being it‚Äôs so easy. I have 50 of them for just have 10 plasma cores. I just put of a couple hours play and some events somehow picked up 17 plasmas. So if I change them to ultrice I‚Äôll prob have 100. It‚Äôs easy, if you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll drop you a bunch.
---
Earned. I think it's the level 50 reward on the legendary challenge run.
---
Creature workshop items, where you at?!? Surely they're in the game files, it is amazing how much easy money Bethesda turns down.
---
(points at Armor Ace-themed Vertiguard power armor skin)
---
Haha that makes sense. I'm just glad my fiancee is really cool about it. I told her I'd be playing games till I'm 80 and stuff XP and she was just happy I'm happy ^-^
---
Just remember to take note of their screen names and block them directly through your xbox account. The 76 "block user this session" thing is SHIT, they can still find you on map and still abuse your base if they remembered where it was.
---
Only happens to me on my Gatling plasma, but happens every time
---
Hey that‚Äôs like me getting 3 vault 94 outfit plans in a row. But I did not get them all on same run lol but at least you struck gold on hitting it for 3 rewards. Guess Todd didn‚Äôt wanna get you to happy so he gave all the same shit
---
Caps are money. For most ammo you'll need to collect scrap steel, gunpowder (acid and paper at chemistry bench), and lead. Lead can be difficult to find but it's abundant in gyms (yes there are several scattered about) and lucky hole mine (you'll need acid to "smelt" the ore into scrap). Ammosmith is a 2 rank perk card in the agility category that will help produce more ammo. Super duper is a 3 rank perk card in luck that will give a 30% chance to duplicate crafted items (with a few exclusions not relevant to this post). 
---
Later on you'll discover legendary perks. There is one called ammo factory that will combine with ammosmith. (super duper will not duplicate the extra ammo provided by ammo factory but will still duplicate ammo from the ammosmith card).
---
GLHF. (Good luck have fun)
---
Shotguns and harpoons with the flechette mod function the same way. Main thing is hitting the same body part.
---
Before pacifist mode, it was a problem.  My alt is still under lvl 5 as I didn‚Äôt want attacked, as under lvl 5 you couldn‚Äôt be slap damaged to death.
---
As far as I know, brick wall doors and contemporary walls doors can be double placed. Just switch them to walls after you place them down
---
You get the purifier plans pretty quick doing the main story and finding the overseers stashes at key locations.   If you go to Fort McClintock in the forrest the stash there has either the large or industrial purifier plan in it iirc
---
Welcome fellow gamer mom!
---
Thank you for this, I was really \*sure\* this was a perk thing, and I was wondering why I couldn't get anything but Pacify in the menu. 
---
With a Junkie build and my choice of chems, my charisma was at 2, so I thought maybe that was it. But one addictol later, Charisma was at 6 but I still couldn't Tame.
---
Then I finally watched your video, and when I went to the first random spawn place, found a megasloth that I was able to Tame and send to camp.
---
So all you dudes still having trouble, it's totally the perk card and \*random\* that makes it work.
---
how? every time I apply bright light to a mining helmet, it changes to white.
---
They're both quite disappointing. The light is very dim they're not going to brighten up your camp much. Also the light is more orange than pink as the atom shop display would have you think.
---
I reluctantly switched from rifleman to commando and my damage instantly improved, simply because I was firing far faster. (And chewing through ammo faster too...)
---
The problem is that any change to your rifleman (eg a better weapon) is going to be even better as a commando build. Literally all you need to do is swap the damage cards over and mod the guns with an automatic receiver and you‚Äôre set. (And, again, craft way more ammo lol)
---
I hope we can play together again someday, hunting rifle... üò¢
---
What do you mean by double placed?
---
Did they buff the durability of laser guns? I knew they perform pretty well with beam splitter but they break super fast so mine have been collecting dust.
---
Man, that guy would *looooove* my super decked out house when it's Halloween and Christmas season.
---
Buzyscrugs. I‚Äôll be back on in an hr
---
did not know you could add the light to this helmet!
---
I‚Äôve never understood why they take up the same budget as the full floors, and have far fewer options.
---
One silent night has always been great farming, legendaries, maps, chems and scrap for days! You always get a player who refuses to do it though, don't really get why they don't want in on all the sweet loot. At least in survival mode you could kill the party poopers
---
Yesterday I ran it solo. Was doing amazing, last boss with a minute left I pull vampire gauss mini out, that mother trucker fires I swear 15 rockets all at once. Bam 803 finish, I ran with team next time. I feel for you lol
---
I think there are plans for a water purifier at the Charleston DMV office....
---
What legendary effects are on the fixer? Concentrated fire at rank 3 might be worth trying. I ran it in PvP with a railway testing it and it made the difference in downing him versus rank 1 not.
---
You might consider going to Commando, I heard non automatic rifles were one of the hardest hit nerfs with this update
---
You can place them down in the same place. Like 2 walls in the same spot, so both sides can be wallpapered
---
I believe they changed it a while back when they put a limit on how many turrets you can place down.
---
do not scrap it!  you will not learn the plan to craft.
---
Think there is a plan for the water purifier in a hut on top of the hill (crossbow training) at the scout camp in toxic valley.
---
Could be wrong tho ( it's been a while since I got the plan)
---
Hey hey! That is epic! You're gonna love it here in West Virginia! Don't pay too much mind to the occasional ~~troll~~Raider, they pop up from time to time. Everyone else here is friendly and happy to help where we can! I need to gather some more flux first to craft it with, but let me know if I can drop a Shielded Vaultsuit your way, help boost a few of your stats from the start! I am on xbox too! Just let me know if you are interested. I will even craft you a fully modded and silenced 10mm pistol for sneaking around buildings with! Got any low level legendaries but need them modded? If I got the plans learned for it, you bet I will boost it with the mods I do know. And stimpacks! I can drop a good handful that should last ya a while, too! 
---
Like a tiny fish, just let minnow!
---
Welcome to the fun! It may not be a perfect game, but boy is it fun. Love being in the world of Appalachia Fallout and the community of people.
---
I never bothered with the AB, tried it &amp; it was pretty bad. Now, in Fallout 4, I have a modded one that can do one-shot kills on any enemy. Yes please!!! Give me that one!!! 
---
It does need some love, I agree. It's a cool weapon but barely functions as such. It's a shame :(
---
I hope so. I love the game but I'm ready to go further now.  NV and Vegas both had expansions in new areas.
---
What do you mean "What"?
---
If you have a Junkies Weapon equipped and addictions, the boost is also weirdly applied to any and all thrown weapons.  And not just the kinetic damage, but energy and flame damage(don't know about rad/poison damage).
---
I take it the imitation seafood doesn't do it for ya?
---
I think rifleman got hit the hardest with the damage shuffle. You're much better off going commando. The rate of fire will increase your dps. You're already invested in the right perks just need the automatic fire cards and ground pounder. Similar playstyle.
---
I didn't know this and went to see it, and yea..... this is just another tease for those that really want this imported from far harbor.  Ty for letting me know btw.
---
If its hard to import it as a separate suit due to the fact that rad suits are 4x better, all armor is better, and we have perks and legendary modifiers that replace the breathe underwater of it, they should **Just Make It An Armor Skin (preferably for all armor üòâ, and in different colors).**
---
A little liberator clinking along with me would be nice.
---
Maybe
---
**Master Infiltrator**. Rank 1 frees up six perk card slots and lets you auto-unlock level 0 locks/terminals.  The mini-games are easy enough and until Bethesda adds a confirmation button keeping this at Rank 1 helps avoid accidentally unlocking player doors or containers for those that move too quickly to see the lock notice. 
---
**Funky Duds**.  The only poisons I‚Äôve run into have been a minor annoyance with just on piece of Poison Resistance gear (25). So Rank 1 of +50 PR should probably suffice, until Bethesda ramps up Poison Damage. 
---
**What Rads**.  While the higher Ranks are great, for many players just having a little extra RR combined with Automatic Rad Regen is plenty. Some builds may want more out of this, but Rank 1 will clear out all your Rads at no cost. 
---
**Survival Shortcut**. One of those boosts every 30 minutes is plenty. And a max of 5 is a good backup.  Again, depending on play style, this is often as much as is needed. On one of my alts, it‚Äôs hot-keyed and I never have fewer than 3 it seems. 
---
In my opinion, each of these gives most of the benefit of the perk for free so spending 300 PC on them to raise the benefit marginally is diminishing returns.
---
awesome! my wife loves playing this game too.  it‚Äôs one of the most co op friendly games ever made
---
Nah.  I'm directionally challenged generally and I figured it out. 
---
Just ran around in there for a few minutes after a daily op to get the lay of the land.
---
You know, there's a reason they call it fishing and not catching.
---
They really should call it drinking in a boat, though.
---
I think virtually everyone agrees honestly
---
I believe they count as that part of that list you've got to fill up before getting more. Aren't plants just containers with specific contents from the game's POV?
---
Thank you! I'm loving it, and I just started... üòÇ
---
I got through 3 prime events, Harpers Ferry and nearly finished uranium fever before mine broke. Once I get on I could tell you how many cells exactly as I'd just crafted 2000 then passed them to said character to use.
---
Edit: my durability was a little over 120% give or take.
---
It's been a LONG while since they were more. It was one of the first adjustments they made to camps.
---
My children are still babies (2 years and 10 months), but all I can say is that I can't wait to game like that with them.

Welcome!

A handy guide for 'Is it just me...?' topics. It is never just you. Not unless you want a camp companion that is a pickle sandwich which speaks fluent italian.

Now I kinda want that XD

Your clip is emptying. It just magically refills partially once the reload animation starts. Watch it closely next time and you'll see.
---
That's like, your opinion man.
---
I like the way it is now.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs worse than ever. My Gatling laser tries to reload when I have 600+ rounds left.
---
Yeah have easy mode where xp is only like 10-20%
---
A bloodied PA heavy armor is more reliable in my experience, but if you‚Äôre going for a bloodied shotgun build, get a shotgun with one of the magic effects.
---
- The plans for building the industrial water purifier can be located at Camp McClintock in the overseer's cache.
---
- The plans for building the normal water purifier can be located at Charleston Capitol Building in the overseer's cache, just inside the doors of the Charleston Capitol DMV.
---
Are you bloodied or not? What‚Äôs the difference in damage for you?
---
Not many people do Colossal Problem lately since latest patch so all the loots from that event sell quickly. It has to be triggered with a nuke, enough experienced players will participate, and hopefully beat Earle and hopefully get it to drop for you, not an easy task.
---
Have you tried it against a player in either CHSS or PA?
---
I prefer reduced vats over explosive for all things except trashing Ward's office.
---
Okay adding
---
I tried to give the basic tenderizers away last meat week like 5 times with people not picking them up. It‚Äôs kind of a hard plan to just give away, let alone sell. And given the weight, I wouldn‚Äôt craft a bunch and keep them in your vendor.
---
Bffr
---
I am and I'm seeing very similar damage numbers for both below nerd rage then they become equal with Andrenaline perk. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Elder runs in PA can be a bitch if you don't have the run speed, the AP, and the weapon to melt the boss.
---
It took me a while to work on these factors before I got elder solo.
---
Not saying I haven‚Äôt experienced any bugs. I‚Äôve been playing since November 2018. Game runs good for me now though.

I'm also an "older" gamer at 55 and I'm up above level 455 now...but I've been gaming since the stone age. ü§£

It's a bug.  The counter isn't updating properly, at least in Handmades.  Been that way for months on them.
---
Whoever the designer is that came up with this idea... isn't paid enough. Shoutout to that person! Also shoutout to the team leads who ran with the idea! Great game design! More of that please!
---
Wow, great resource!

I've only played a little with my daughter's friends, but loved ir so far!

Upvote for the civilized title alone.

That sounds familiar ü§î my dumb memory acting up on me lol
---
I had a moment last night on XB1 where my quick-swap, quick-heal, favorites wheel and draw/holster and attack buttons wouldn‚Äôt work. I could get into my Pip-Boy though. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it was coincidental, but when I changed from 1st person view to 3rd person view and back, then it all went back to normal.
---
Space lady kept talking about Mistress of Mystery so i gave her my mistress of mystery set to her

405 is very very high.
---
The current engine, for all its faults, does things that no other engine currently does. To modify another engine to do what the Creation does would be a massive undertaking, which is why nobody does FO or TES clones (in gameplay terms). This would also require converting all tools, changing the development pipeline and modders as well as developers throwing out all tools and knowledge base.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Once that‚Äôs done you then get to deal with whatever issues the Unreal Engine has. This is why most developers and publishers keep updating and tweaking an existing engine rather than make a new or license a new one. Beth has been updating their engine every game, the biggest hurdle is fixing some super-core fundamental coding issues that haven‚Äôt been touched because of the massive undertaking for little evident gain to the consumer. You would have to sit down and explain it to them, otherwise they won‚Äôt notice a big leap.
---
This explanation is not something I like, it just is, and I was disappointed that FO76 didn‚Äôt try to address a lot of this since they were ripping up the engine anyway. I‚Äôm really hoping MS will fund what is needed.
---
I can‚Äôt even log on PS4... No region ping!
---
I'll try it out! I figure I like my couches way too much lol may need to take them out
---
This reads like a test question like trains leaving stations.
---
Very similar situation to yours - I found just before uplink 2 finishes there is a lull in the enemies and you can always pop some honey, medX and psychotats or similar to get you through the last wave and end boss without dying. I‚Äôm sure you will do it!
---
Nice, mine could never last one event lol. Last time I tested my ultracite laser rifle at that pond to the south of Watoga station, it went from 100% to broken before I could finish off the mirelurk family.
---
Lol, it's been mentioned since launch
---
Almost 40. Gamer for life.
---
It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a real dick move, especially if they‚Äôve been asked not to share it, but it ain‚Äôt griefing.
---
Good call, I just thought I remembered reading something about them offering their own mod stores for games and not allowing 3rd party stuff. 
---
Its been a while, so I could be off.
---
I‚Äôd say if you plan on ever going full health for certain events or permanently in the future, then two shot, since you‚Äôll be full health and have great damage comparatively. If you plan on staying bloodied, then I‚Äôd keep the bloodied.
---
Lol, yeh I've been there but I got through a fair few cells and enemies before it broke. üëç
---
üòÇ
---
If you're on Wi-Fi, try turning everything else off.
---
I had a bad router before and kept getting kicked because I didn't have enough of the router's attention to keep connection.
---
I dunno if that applies to you, but that's all I got.
---
What Rads is essentially useless in practice
---
Pacifist Mode always existed, even in BETA. That‚Äôs why trolls used slap damage; to get past Pacifist.
---
They do
---
It's not much of a respecc. Same Specials used for Commando vs Rifleman. 
---
And yeah, very playable without bloodied or junkies. I just started using Junkies weps... it's not that huge of a difference. My play style doesn't mesh with low health, so I won't even consider bloodied. 
---
My damage numbers are fine (triple digits on crits) and that's plenty good enough for end game content.
---
I wish you a lovely experience in the wasteland! üòä
---
The Mothman pack is mostly stuff I don't want, except for the emote. I wish they would list the emote for sale by itself.
---
Yes, they still seem to work.
---
sounds like an isolated incident rather than a problem with the game
---
just open the scoreboard once before entering a world.
---
Thanks for the tip! ‚ù§
---
Ran headfirst in the joke and still missed it.
---
I only remember it because I suddenly had a lot more budget after a patch one day.
---
I‚Äôve got a lot of stuff that i guess you switch out situationally, and I also have all the crafting perks maxed in Int
---
Junkies is magic
---
Sounds like you've got your answer then.
---
Even so jetpack is higher
---
That‚Äôs great news, time to make some ash piles lol üòÇ
---
You already got plans for the bunker?
---
But my fire rate is below 90, how could it happen?
---
Dogmeat isn't from fallout 4, he came long before 4 existed lol but I get what you're saying. I'd like it but with this games track record it would probably be bugged as hell
---
Yes. They did. And its still October.
---
Before Patch 22, I couldn't handle the ghouls. Follow Through has been a difference maker for me.
---
Anyone who feels like downvoting you should probably bear in mind that there was a recently posted interview, in which the project lead himself said 'some things seem like they'd be easy but would break tech pathways.' So you're most likely correct.
---
The explosion doubles it. And if there's a splitter that also counts. Each time it hits counts towards the fire rate
---
No it would add more ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù
---
I drop a lot next to my vending machines, made a free stuff place and happy players.  
---
It's hard to stop hoarding but when you succeed it's a very big relief.
---
Noice
---
But I thought putting the splitter on it made it magic. The big question is were you using vats and/or blocking armor. 
---
I've done much what you have with many of my "magic" attribute lasers, auto with splitters, just not primed. My bloodied destroys, my others not so much but they are more impressive then the general misconceptions about energy weapons. They may even be some of my best weapons if it wasn't for the poor durability. 
---
However, I've been getting questionable results from all my magic items. I'm chalking it up to internet issues I hope to resolve next week.
---
It is possible. I have always had them ready, but I only went there every 3 or 4 days before this week.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, I‚Äôll give you an X-01 set with jet pack attached, I only use Excavator for farming materials
---
I just sell mine to the vendors for caps and have done with it. There will be plenty more where that came from.
---
PS. The word is "Scrip"
---
| I‚Äôm looking at you, one-handed melee weapons  
---
I'm actually looking for a particular 1H melee - SS vampire switchblade.   
---
So far, RNG has not smiled upon me, and it seems like Momma Mrgph has granted me just about every melee weapon except that one...
---
yeah, just use the ADS feature on guns to apply the damage bonus
---
I'd love to have a small mob of invulnerable cats at my CAMP.  This would not be broken because they would totally ignore threats to my water purifiers, crops, and generators.  Bonus points if they sit on my workbench while I am trying to whip up a batch of 5.56.
---
Heh
---
Instances interiors coming to the PTS next week already! 
---
As someone who was actually very skeptical about this feature, I just had some faith restored knowing we can have one of each instanced interiors at our camps (3 will be available in the PTS), each with their own budgets.
---
I checked on one of my characters with a 10MM SMG, and it actually emptied the clip. But, I still feel like the reload animation is slower. I just wonder when they fixed that thing with the fireworks mine where it would make you reload faster if they didn't screw up the regular reload times.
---
Nope. Both original and desert paint variants do not glow.
---
Thanks!   Of the ones you listed, I only have Funky Duds.   However, I can't decide between keeping it or going for Ammo Factory instead.   I could use my alt to make ammo for both characters.   However, it's a hassle transferring items from one character to another.   QOL vs. poison resistance....    I have one SS piece with poison resistance already also.
---
I think some minor adjustments make sense.
---
Cap limit could use (another) small bump.
---
Treasury Note trade in limit makes sense to keep the reputation plans in check, perhaps a small increase on the daily trade in limit would be reasonable now that it's an established currency system.
---
Scrip Limit should be considerably higher, with a limit on spending instead. Whether it's a specific amount of scrip spent or a certain number of transactions with Sweet Mama Mumbles Idk which would make more sense to keep it reasonable. I like the spending limit over the transaction limit, but I'm sure an argument can be made for both.
---
It's important to understand the gates, as annoying as they are in this game, were intended to artificially maintain economic health and bridge the gap between casuals and sweatys. With that said, a threshold has already been crossed with such rampant duping and some effective farming methods established I think it's time the dev's or the higher ups, or whomever makes these calls in this instance, take a double shot of reality because there is a real QOL problem in this game that goes ignored patch after patch after update after update.
---
Still love the game. Still playing since beta testing. Still excited every Tuesday. Still concerned for the game's future.
---
You don't have salt bushes where you live?
---
If you have a magic armor piece you want TS FFR with penta for consistent magic damage, want to play the game normal mode with sometimes magic if wearing the armor piece use the Bffr.   
---
If a bloodied build and in PA use BFFR.
---
If you‚Äôve got recent scrip limit concerns....
---
Pls pumpkin and cranberry‚Äôs
---
No console needed, just a Xbox account aka a Microsoft account.
---
Also to even push why PC is better, the new 1 TB expansion cards for Xbox x is going to cost $220.
---
For PC 1 TB for a ssd is going close to $100
---
Oh I see! So can I say JE is better for boss and BE is better for normal mobs as I don‚Äôt need magic for normal mobs?
---
I have a similair issue with the plasma caster. It says "required missing ammo" even though I have 2000 ultracite plasma cartridges. If I switch weapons, then switch back again it works. However, instead of having 20 cartridges before I need to reload it has 500.
---
These violent delights have violent ends.
---
Good choice, welcome to the master race.
---
Or like hydroponics like they have in No Man's Sky
---
It's a fine line between camps having too little utility and too much; personally, I think if you added all those things then camps would have too much utility. There's a reason why dishes that require ingredients like salt and pepper are among the better buffs. The game has been balanced(ish) so that there's a trade off between inconvenience and reward. Plus, let's be honest, once you know the more plentiful locations of these ingredients then it's not a huge hassle to swoop in and farm them every now and then.
---
I want pets
---
AngryTurtle had mentioned the topic of primed energy guns a bit more in his recent video about the gatling plasma. But apparently primed energy guns are really outperforming primed ballistic weapons at the moment.
---
I love to see new people join fallout.
---
I'd love if my mom plays fallout but I've tried and she doesn't like it.
---
A je is plenty for normal mobs as well man. They are both super over  kill
---
Immersion? In my Fallout 76?
---
If you shoot the SBQ with a I/ffr minigun, and a team mate shoots her with a b/25/25 fixer, how many seconds will it take for the mirelurk king f- you up?
---
How you can determine 100k limit is the right limit? 
---
You say there needs to be a limit but at the same time what stops from people asking for even higher limit  in future if we get this 100k? Players won't be ever satisfied.
---
I lol'd for all the wrong reasons!
---
i think it's probably to stop people from putting down a load of plants in their camp, nuking it, and farming a ton of different flux all at once.
---
I think the scrip limit and the legendary trade in system came to the game when legendaries were still very uncommon.  Nowadays we get waaaay more of them and higher starred. We need a high scrip limit in general. I‚Äôd say at least to 200.
---
Sony and micro soft charge for updates and stuff. So it doesn't make sense financially for them to run a pts where things need to be changed often on consuls
---
On a mildly unrelated note you might like a subreddit called r/momforaminute
---
I've been rolling  for a 50 cal furious for a while and no go. Anything but in vendors as well.
---
Its not easy for console.  Frequent updates aren't simple.
---
Its not cost though. That myth was quashed last gen, specifically cert costs money.
---
Passing cert repeatedly for little changes is probably the main culprit.
---
Man reading the title I was expecting some basic plans to get new players going.  
---
But bear arm and fixer.  U are a good person.  Cheers.
---
I know it is, but it's just... Here I am looking at all of these level 405+++ üòÇ
---
Yep yep. My uh (forgot the name) science pew pew laser pistol reloads a lot.
---
It's a fucking pain
---
Trying to find a better solution and a better balance is better than doing nothing. 100k might be too much. Maybe 40-50k makes more sense.
---
crap knew i forgot something in that list, take an upvote while i correct my error
---
Because they can push updates easily, they can't do that for consoles since the updates have go through sony/microsoft which usually takes a long time.
---
On pc they own it themselves, at least on the bethesda launcher, that's why there is also no PTS on steam.
---
Oh man the shelters sound so cool! Unlimited build limit? Give me please!
---
They havnt come back yet. People have the old ones still
---
Now that Bethesda is under Microsoft PTS will also be on Xbox maybe at some point.
---
A flaming s‚Äômores is my vote for nice camp icon
---
Oct 15th-19th is treasure hunter weekend. Then just look for the treasure hunter miners around the map. I guess they won't be in high traffic mole minor spots this time around. And I think if you wanna just buy the pails they will be alot cheaper this time around
---
why? you can trade those plans, it would suck if it was the war glaive plan 3 times, because you cant trade that one.
---
That's Awesome!! I'm really happy you found a pet, and a mega sloth to boot!
---
Thank you...going to miss my rifle üò≠
---
Multiple shelters in your camp... OMG! This sounds amazing.
---
Sony and MS have an approval process for any updates loaded to their services, in addition to extra charges, which costs time and money. PC, Beth can just sideload some servers and add a menu option.
---
It's good, if your are full of legendaries it's because you farm too much and farming is not enjoying a game, it's addiction.
---
All those limits prevents me from playing too much cause lottery is a big addiction and then i just enjoy roaming the game, finding legendaries on the spot is so more enjoyable!!  
---
Found two 3\* ghouls in the same room at sunday brother's cabin, i said: "ok then, die !"
---
Try going into the Atoms Shop and equipping it. Click on it so the little symbol shows up in the top left of the item.
---
This is adorable. Wholesome posts like this are always great
---
More damage.
---
Use the 200% repair perk on weapons and armor.  If you are crafting the weapon, equip the increased durability perk.
---
  My most used used melees (switchblades) take a very long time to break, especially at 200% to start with.
---
You can also try equipping white knight before you repair.
---
I bought the Fence aswell. It would be really awesome... If I actually got it. :(
---
true life hacks, teach your kid cleaning is fun and reap the rewards till they hit 14 :)
---
then they start realizing that the game was rigged from the start.
---
I do have that at rank 3, some reason during events and ops, even in VATS, the rifle just hits terrible.
---
That's awesome man! I have a feeling I'll BE the same üòé
---
heres me hoping this will change with our new microsft overlords.
---
Ohhh, I do like it! Thanks!
---
Seems to be the concensus, thank you.
---
Ugh, that must be a pain in the ass
---
I enjoy just listening to Graham‚Äôs wisdom
---
Thank you, going to have to bite the bullet on this one
---
No I see it at 15 rounds left and it reloads
---
And rare chance to spawn a Honey Beast.
---
You either claimed it last season, or currently you buy the plan off of Sunny/Mortimer I forget which one forsure.
---
Make sure you read the plan if you didnt get it last season.
---
I've been lucky in the 2-3 times I opened the wrong thing and got wanted, I had friends on playing that happily killed me. First time, I couldn't beg someone to kill me, even people much higher level than me. This was back in the early days and people thought I was trying to bait them into some griefer thing. (sigh)
---
The ones you see now being used by players are the crafted ones from last treasure hunter event that people have saved. And because of bughesda reasons, they contain the new loot that are not supposed to be in the game yet. You can't obtain the new ones yet normal ways, until next treasure hunter event begins.
---
Ada !
---
Hellzyeah.
---
Looks like the model for the chainsaw was the baseline for this thing. Sounds the same too. I wonder if the chainsaw was just a proof of concept that has been forgotten about.
---
Hopefully if we ever get the auto Axe it‚Äôll actually have decent stats, because that thing is cool as hell.
---
I would like a physical size increase, but unfortunately that would make fighting for camp locations even worse. I think the instanced camp add on should help with size constraints. Would be sweet if we could plant crops inside our instanced camp add on.
---
Don't forget about teh gold you get after breaking in.  That reduces the time it takes as well.
---
I hoped we'd test the Bombs Drop event, and that we could give a shot at Mischief Night to see if anything could be done before Halloween.
---
Okay thanks, do you know when that is
---
Also please give us a recipe for sugar bombs. We can already make sugar, just add bombs :P
---
Well they probably tried to avoid the ‚Äòpay to win‚Äô label. 50% is the same as Good With Salt perk isn‚Äôt it?
---
Still no perk load outs or a fix for the S.C.O.R.E notification issue?
---
Yeah, your days of long range sniping are over, a scope on an automatic Fixer is useless unfortunately. You‚Äôll still be able to sneak and get headshots on most enemies thankfully!
---
It's also people like you who keep this community strong.
---
Thanks! ‚ù§
---
Nuclear winter lasers still hit for 200 damage
---
It would be nice if either they added it to What Rads, or how about a new Legendary that say, combines Starched Genes, Class Freak, and maybe Stranger in numbers.
---
I usually craft 30 carrot soup. I keep 15 on me and 15 in the fridge. By the time I‚Äôve ventured out and cooked food gathered along the way I‚Äôve forgotten about the soup which after a few hours is 60% decayed. So for me the best way to utilize the fridge is when I come back to my camp after a grind and just raid the fridge and eat everything on the spot to max out my food and drink bars.....so I can then make more food for the future lol
---
There is no Mischief Night this year
---
There needs to be a meat week every month.
---
The bombs drop event is for a whole month.
---
Yes! Exactly right. I went more for reputation so I only started with 500 but you are correct and if you start with the 1,000 its a big headstart.
---
They have build limits from the sound of it.
---
Maybe after she sees you playing for 16 hours straigh... That's what happened with me! üòÇ
---
That's why I said "If anything could be done beofre Halloween".
---
The intent was to hopefully fix it in time.
---
I still need the tenderizer plans and the xp is nice now that I need legendary perks
---
The Fusion Generator can be bought for roughly 230 caps in a few places. IMO, getting this one doesn't stagnate you in what you can build with limited generators as they take up more space and don't provide as much power.    
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Fusion\_generator](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Fusion_generator)    
---
That way you can have a few going to get a steady flow of Purified Water. They sell for a LOT at vendors.
---
I feel like it's best for vats. The projectiles are to slow to really snipe with it
---
Does it work at night as well?
---
It's not really a "bug", it's just that in the last patch Bethesda updated the loot table for them in preparation for the upcoming events. 
---
They probably didn't count on so many people saving pails from last ~~year~~ time
---
Friggin finally! I wonder if we can put vendors and such in there. Make a store, a bar, a museum...ü§î
---
Adjusting mid-game enemies is nice and all but I am still hoping for **an actual combat update**. All One Wasteland did was change how damage bonuses were calculated. What I want to see is buffs to the base damage of weapons and changing the way durability loss is calculated from ‚Äúper hit‚Äù to ‚Äúper shot‚Äù instead. The last one alone would fix the problem of many weapons and mods not being used because they break way too fast.
---
Good with salt rank 3 is 90% reduction. I feel like convenience is okay to have as a pay for option. Having slower spoilage on stored food isn't really an OP addon.
---
How does the space inside the brotherhood bunker compare to the communist bunker? Is it equal or smaller?
---
Ive played for 12 hours straight one time and she was just concerned lol
---
This is my favorite event for these reasons :)
---
Thanks for this. Skipping NW today, it seems.
---
Don't you mean Leatherface?
---
You‚Äôre talking about farming being a bad thing as if this game wasn‚Äôt designed to be farmed. It‚Äôs literally design to keep players playing for hours every day. Addiction is a problem with gaming, yes, but farming is not an addiction. If you personally have a problem with addictions/gambling, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt play a game like this. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to punish the entire player base though. You can reach the scrip max in just a few hours or less with the daily ops. With meat week available at the moment, that time is even lower.
---
That's some really great RNG you got there friend, at least you can get started building a set of Troubleshooter's armor, if you don't have a set already. Then, maybe you can fix those leaky pipes at your camp!
---
We already have a thumbs up and a heart, what more do you need? 
---
There's so many things the game needs before this, please.
---
I've always had the Camden Park stuff trigger when I cross into the Ash Heap *region*.  It could be from any angle.  Just entering the area that would normally trigger the "You have discovered: The Ash Heap" triggers all of that.
---
To that end, Camden Park is within the Ash Heap.
---
I have a ffr one and compared it to a non ffr one. There's less delay between shots otherwise you can go aim damage if using free aim or vats critical 50%.
---
It's not a "free market" though. It's quite literally their game, and tbh I wouldn't want to play the game with people having their vendors and items priced so stupidly. It would be an immediate turn off. If I had day 1 been checking vendors to see prices like that I would have been playing something else. Trades are an appropriate way to handle things that people want to charge stupid prices for.
---
This is where having a trusted group is beneficial. I have Ammo Factory in only one character, and my wife and a few friends simply give me their lead and gunpowder and I craft what they need. I don‚Äôt charge them anything since they‚Äôre supplying the materials, but it‚Äôs agreed that I keep 10% as a convenience tax. 
---
When that means that they get to give me 600 Lead and they get back 8640 5.56 rounds, everyone wins.
---
Glad you are getting use out of it :). For me I would just craft like ten at a time when I didn't use good with salt. After grinding for a while I would just go make 10 more if I needed to
---
That is a quick 30k caps though.
---
People buying them for 10k a pop
---
There is one dog that I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs not mutated or anything, I don‚Äôt think it can be tamed as I‚Äôm not familiar with that aspect of the game. He chills out on the cliff tops across the river from harpers ferry. Pretty sure the corpses near by may have been his owners.
---
depends.  For one of the Scout badges, you have to build robot armor...
---
So if you are not a scout yet, that plan actually helps you.
---
Don‚Äôt forgot the material usage is specifically for those in the PTS, and that as players we will need the raw materials to decorate.
---
Free aiming the caster sucks because the projectiles actually have quite a bit of spread. It's really suitable for mid range play free aiming or vats.
---
I'd honestly go for the regular gatling gun for a slow ROF and heavy hitting weapon after using a bloodied, junkies, and instigating caster before.
---
I just sell them to vendors or drop them. 
---
I realized long ago that if I always have so many in my inventory that they are not hard to get, during regular game play, so why bother keeping them.
---
The current ones are sperate from the new ones coming, so no point in getting them when the new ones will have higher drop rates.
---
Thats not what im asking
---
I've read this three times and I still don't understand it.
---
Whats your platform?
---
I just want to build my own robot companions honestly. They had it in Fallout 4, I know they can make it happen in Fallout 76 with some restrictions. Just make it happen Bethesda!
---
Oh my bad, yea Good w Salt is 90% slower, if I buy the fridge and it‚Äôs also 90%, that saves me three perks that I can replace with Bloody Mess. That‚Äôs a lot of convenient that I‚Äôm willing to pay for too.
---
You're not lazy, the dev who put the known plans first is.
---
Can you imagine all the time spent and lost browsing the plans because of one dev, multiplied by all the players it can be huge as a life time.
---
I'm not sure about the instanced interiors.  I have hundreds of hours of building in FO4 and 76.  I LOVE the building aspect of this game.  Buy why put us underground?  You have an art team that has built one of the most beautiful and incredible landscapes in gaming in West Virginia/Appalachia...but we're going underground?  I just don't get it.
---
I expect to get downvoted, it's cool, just my 2 cents.
---
I'd love for more CAMP budget so here's hoping that they also up the budget a bit with this update.  Improvements to CAMP building is always welcome.  Guess I'll be downloading the PTS next week to check it out.
---
Last year? I thought the first time was 3 months ago?
---
Why does it desperately need it? Because Beta people are maxed out on caps and inventory? Welcome to Fallout. It's literally ALWAYS been that way since FO1.
---
Sorry I meant last time
---
A false table you can't play, it's really in our head that it feels great.
---
Two nights ago me and two other vault dwellers where doing daily opps in the burrows when uplink beta progress got stuck. We continued the game and I popped some lunchboxes. The enemies keep on coming in huge numbers. After one hour and fifteen minutes the progress suddenly resumed and we end the game with killing the boss. No special award of course but: almost two levels up, scoreboard almost three levels up, 9000 5mm rounds and four ultracite plasma coresüòÇ
---
I would wait for official confirmation closer to the full release. Giving us 3 separate instanced interiors is possibly just a PTS feature so they can fully test each. I would love to have 3 when it releases, but only getting 1 per camp feels much more likely for some reason.
---
Sure does!  Presumably there's a capacitor or battery or something.
---
Are you serious?? I‚Äôm on PS4- that would be beyond awesome!
---
She's gorgeous. &lt;3
---
We can have 3? That‚Äôs fantastic
---
I'm just getting into the game (level 40 rn).. it matters where you drop nukes? I haven't even come close to being able to drop one yet, but I was wondering why they're always dropped in the same few places
---
Username is Toxic-Ogaboga_yt
---
Best tip: play with other and you'll do it in 6 minutes each time on the first try.
---
Looks like I'll drink a Nukashine and hope for an adventure.
---
The only thing I've been able to figure out about how to make this thing awesome is being in third person using VATS.
---
Charge the weapon
---
Lock on with VATS, ALL THE WAY
---
then fire
---
Even that doesn't seem to work all of the time. If there's anything like a blade of grass between you and your target, it's going to go over their heads or give you that wide spread attack that does nothing.
---
Craft...salt?
---
LOL Yes.
---
Second farming as a dog shit lazy game design trope that needs to die, but being full of legendaries can happen without having actually made any progress towards anything because the scrip limit is so damn low and RNG for any kind of good legendary is bullshit.
---
I made a similar suggestion once and it was shot to shit. I agree with you 100%. I hope it happens.
---
Rifleman is good for exploration (head shots). But with mobs and events using commando, heavy guns, or melee has the most effectiveness. So long as you‚Äôre committing every perk card available to those builds and you have a decent legendary weapon to compliment the perks. 
---
Hoard ammo. Make it, buy it, hoard it. 
---
I run full strength perception numbers that allow me the ability to flip heavy guns/commando to melee/rifleman if my ammo runs low.
---
I‚Äôm probably going to move my house underground and just use the above ground for my town
---
Np
---
What platform are you on? Maybe we can help each other with the annoying challange
---
I thought they were already out for consoles
---
no one is selling a god tier roll for 30k caps, the price is not predicated on the cap limit. the rarity of item does that
---
&gt; be on Xbox may
---
Hopefully
---
CAMP building is gonna be lit. I cannot wait.
---
Lvl 300 something fo1 subber enjoyed it yesterday lol saw him going from the suitcase to the vendor as i pretended to put more things in it... lolll triggered the cig dispenser open animation too just to check and lo and behold the guy just had to see what was in there lol. Well at least someone might use all those cores ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No problem....psn is TheBiPolarBear25
---
Next thing you know she's playing in your account, hahaha.
---
It's situational. Bad for ops. Good for other things
---
My parents are in their 70's and kick the Wasteland's ass a little every day! Both about to hit level 150!
---
Welcome to the Fallout community family! üòÉ
---
In the ‚Äúweapon‚Äù tab of your pip boy you literally only have a shotgun and a camera? No grenades, no mines, no throwing knives?
---
You know how you can accumulate as many Treasury Notes as you want, but can only turn in 20 per day and carry 5000 Gold at a time?
---
I think he wants to be able to turn in as a many legendaries as he wants, have no limit to the ‚Äòscrip‚Äô he can hold, but have a limit of how much can be spent in a day?
---
I think that‚Äôs what he means. I‚Äôll have to read it again to see if I understood it.
---
Edit:  OP wants to add in a step between turning in legendaries and getting scrip.  I think that‚Äôs far too convoluted. 
---
Just remove the 150 limit from the scripping machine and institute a 150 (or better yet, 200) daily spend limit at Mama Murmrgh.
---
The real question is are these going to cost atoms, caps, gold bullion, building materials, a new in-game currency called Bolson Bucks?
---
I'm almost a week ahead of the pace, I can afford to skip a challenge here and there. Thanks though.
---
If the L10 legendary is a "ghoul slayers" that would explain it.
---
For example, I have mutiple legendary switchblades, all the same level and all rated about the same dmg in the pip-boy.   (Mutant slayer, vampire, and ghoul slayer. )
---
All will kill anything, but against their specific \* enemies, per hit damage is 2-4x what the non creature specific blades do.  (eg, against a ghoul, I get about 150 per from the vampire, but the ghoul slayer does almost 400.)
---
Didn't Jason use one too?  Either way, one of them.
---
Or they could just remove the daily scrip limit for scrapping legendaries, and give us a daily spend limit. 
---
Or they could just remove the limit all together and let people progress on their own time.
---
This seems like a slip for something that might be coming in the next patch.  We'll probably find out in the PTS soon enough.
---
It would make sense, though.  Other than Lunchboxes, I'd love to have some kind of repeatable Gold investment, because I don't have that much interest in the actual Bullion items.  It would be even better if they cut out the middleman and just let me buy Perk Coins, though.  That would also solve the problem of people like me who like to keep some levels banked, but also want Perk Coins.
---
If that's the case, then yeah that's a pretty good idea.
---
Ok, so this is supposed to be more of Gatling gun then? Cool. I think I‚Äôll be happier with a B2525 then.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying though, not worth the effort. I‚Äôm really only rolling a plasma caster cause I need to spend the scrip somewhere.
---
Wow, and I thought my level was high
---
I ment to say that they WON'T just be in mm high traffic areas. I'm sure that's probably still the best lace to look. Ash heap area. But they will now be in ramdom spots around the map also.
---
I‚Äôve heard a lot of other people complaining about it you havn‚Äôt been kicked off
---
Looks like a very drunk squirrel XD
---
Alright
---
Or they didn't think that far ahead... :-)
---
Yeah I totally agree. We‚Äôll have to see what they do later. They did mention that material cost being free is only in the PTS but didn‚Äôt say that for the multiple interiors but you‚Äôre right, one seems much more likely

Underground means they don't have to worry about exterior wall dimensions, windows, etc.  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to have double the build budget and size and/or persistent workshops on my private server.  I'll sure take this though.  Order of Mysteries base!  Failed vault!  Sinister mothman cult lair!  Huge pile of pillows for cats!
---
never knew that! thanks
---
Did they say we will get three different instanced interiors? That‚Äôs... weird? But cool I guess? Strange to not just have one. Hopefully they‚Äôll be able to be connected to each other so you don‚Äôt have to go above ground each time you wanna move to another one...
---
I‚Äôm jumping on now if you‚Äôre around
---
Because you shouldn't need some sketchy service to transfer 1 item to a character with another build. Cap limit is too low for the worth of most mid-high end weapons. The difference between fo76 and every past fallout is this one is an mmo and therfore needs a system like one.
---
really hope bunkers can br accessible via a door, not clicking something on the ground
---
Thanks but my equipment is great all other games work great this one nope I get kicked to the home screen
---
Pipe? Bomb? wtf!? In since launch, don't recall EVER seeing either. First time hearing about them. Gawd...2 years it's been...still so ig-nor-ant!
---
Fallout tech is clunky.
---
Chally's backpack hides it.
---
Just shows he focused heavily on xp glitches because that ain‚Äôt legit.
---
So next week Monday or Friday?
---
It would be nice.  Not having to rent someone else's servers, and having access to a world-class option native to your own company, could only benefit the game's performance in the long-run, if you're willing to invest in transferring it over.  For all we know, that step could be quite difficult.
---
Wow
---
I think ffr May be the way to go then. I did roll the b1015r but I didn‚Äôt realize this was more of a Gatling gun than sniper rifle.
---
how does the jet pack make you do more damage?
---
I MUST FIND HIM NOW
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
I wonder if there's a main door to an instance, than within that instance you can put the other two doors, Instancedception.
---
And while we're at it: Pillows. I know they exist, I've both seen *and* scrapped them.
---
I would really appreciate a skin that turns it into an electric guitar
---
Perkcoins?
---
how many is a lot
---
I do enough damage without the mutations. The reason I mentioned the jet pack is because of the most popular mutation being marsupial
---
PS4.
---
This was also specific to FO76 for me, so I thought I'd mention it.  Good luck.  ‚úåüòä
---
In two spots on the map if you nuke one of those spots it spawns an endgame boss, Scorched Beast Queen or Wendigo Colossus. You can nuke anywhere, Whitesprings used to be a popular spot as you could farm many different fluxes there.
---
Well, again, I don't see how that's a "need" it just seems like a convenience for people to complain about not having. Cap limit is fine, maybe people should just not overvalue high end items? 150K for a gun in FO is just stupid. Doesn't matter what it is.
---
I would like it to be killable. So long as it isn't pathetically easy to kill. If it is like codsworth then it can be repaired.  If it is like dogmeat I would like it to be like the puppies perk. Have a mechanic and dog breeder npc either out in the world or as a camp ally
---
Yeah exactly! That would be so cool!
---
The only mutation the SS jet pack replaces is marsupial.   Das it.
---
I have a build, but it's very expensive.
---
Plasma pistol with flamethrower barrel blood + rate of fire
---
Plasma pistol with sniper barrel blood + crit or blood + rate of fire
---
Western revolver blood + explosion
---
Armor set uny+AP+sentinel
---
Yeah. But I used 200 points to make a max rank legendary perk only to learn my damage for unarmed is garbage. So now I'm stuck grinding for month on months to get those back. So yes. They should be downgradeable. Esspecially if they keep murdering builds to try out there new additive system.
---
That‚Äôs true but having those 5 additional perk points placed back into your build can not only offset the benefits of mutations, it can exceed the benefits
---
Now that‚Äôs a good question but none of my other online games kick my off like this game does
---
he‚Äôs talking about the higher jump mutation and how he doesn‚Äôt need it because he has the jet pack, idk where he‚Äôs going with this though.
---
Allow me to comment nonsense and waste both of our time
---
This is awesome. Thank you
---
Thanks for the workaround its annoying as fuck. Ill try it tonight. I am rank 26 and while it ranks ups, which takes forever, if i try to see the map I will end up in the scoreboard. I have to time my map time which sucks.
---
My god. A bunker within a bunker!
---
I run a junkies build unfortunately. But this looks pretty nice.
---
Man, not to mention there's a fantastic in game reason why this could happen!
---
Is he, because he‚Äôs talking about saving perk points and building a character without mutations.
---
I suggest you go back to a single player game then. Economies are complicated and the prices aren't completely based off of whatever the community thinks they're worth.
---
Yeah but you can reset your skill points just like every other mmo! Oh wait you can't do that either
---
Camp Krugerrands.
---
Some emotes have multiple emotes in the same spot, on Xbox you can hit the right bumper to open it up and select the others, dunno what it would be on PC.
---
There are more gamers your age and up then you would think
---
I‚Äôve proposed that in the past. It fixes the carry weight issue but still lets Bethesda control to time-gating. 
---
And the 200 is better overall. That‚Äôs 5 3-star weapons, for example.
---
The hardest thing I‚Äôve had to manage is keeping others near the beacons. Only engage mobs that you really need to, and definitely don‚Äôt go chasing them.
---
It‚Äôs nice, but it‚Äôs utility. The jet pack can replace that, but won‚Äôt replace others like Empathy that can reduce damage, or egg head for XP gain
---
Wholesome 100
---
Wut
---
In my experience it‚Äôs really needing to reload; the ‚Äúammo left in mag‚Äù is really a visual bug. I started paying attention and watching the count drop while I did auto-fire, and it basically fired off the expected number of bullets (20), then started reload, and then the count said ‚Äú9‚Äù remaining. 
---
So I‚Äôm fairly certain that, mechanically speaking, you‚Äôre getting what you paid for. The count during reload is just a visual bug.
---
I think I did that right! This is super cool!
---
NP, post back if it works for you. Lastnight was the first time i got the bug. Mine didnt stop at rank 29 either, it restarted back at level one and started all over again lol.
---
Well whose fault is it that you dumped the points? Whose fault is it that they didn't test it at the "free" level first? I know it is not Bethesda's fault, so who could be at fault for that...
---
Not sad at all... I never understood the rush to level up... especially once you hit level 50, and then get your build squared away... then why? There's no cap!
---
Thank you so much! It would be great to have other friends in my list (I'm on xbox too, same gamertag as in here)! My daughter's friend gave me a really nice gun, a level 5 laser rifle-- it's really good to kill high level enemies. And I sure would love some extra stimpacks, I use them a lot! üòÇ
---
‚ù§‚ù§
---
Just keep in mind that if you ever want to play with your daughter on a different device, you will have to start over. You can't transfer saves to different accounts.
---
I am!
---
if you are trying to do the archery challenge....at pioneer scout camp: it is on the southwest side, about half way up the hill.
---
This happened last season, too.  I always checked the board when I noticed it so didn't know about the spam.
---
Can confirm it works.  üëç
---
What I am saying is I think the math is wrong or the execution on Beths part is wrong. If we complete the elder run we unlock all three teirs. We should be getting all 3 teirs worth of loot since we cam not go back and try again for it. Which means the % of elder should be all three together. Since 1st is 5% 2nd is 10% elder is 80%...that can not be added together...otherwise that would make 1st and 2nd only worth 5%. So running elder should be 95% since all the loot should be from all 3 levels.
---
How does it give me 150 energy resistance? Run faster and reload faster?
---
That is most likely JUST for the PTS so the 3 different instances can be tested more efficiently. I would not expect to see this on the main server.
---
For me, placing those 5 additional perk points back into my build gives me better flexibility. I‚Äôm pretty much a full combat build. No perks for anything else. Those 5 help me top it off. I‚Äôm also a loner so there‚Äôs that to consider
---
Someone explain what the hell he‚Äôs talking about
---
Yo if we can possibly help each other out, I'm on ps4
---
automatic piston plan is at watoga station along with some scopes
---
I think the quack outfit goes okay with it.
---
Glitch with the future tech camp skin. You have to remove the skin and replace your camp unfortunately
---
It‚Äôs a heavy hitter although the projectile travels slower. B2525 is very good even against flying SBs, the damage numbers are in the hundreds, seems higher than my BE gatling.
---
Did anyone else have a hard time finding the emitter to repair in this one?  I started alone and for the life of me couldn't find the damn thing so I just left.
---
I made my limbs ultralight on XBOX last night.
---
Given how bad my aim is, changing it to per shot would slow me down immensely, although I do concede this is a more realistic manner in which degradation should register.
---
If you click on the discounted items it should tell you what‚Äôs discounted for FO1st
---
Perk load outs are pushed to 2021...
---
Probably only on the PTS for testing purposes.
---
Most people would only need rank 1 lol
---
what perk points are used towards marsupial?
---
Visual glitch. Keep an eye on your counter, you‚Äôll see it goes to 0 and THEN switches to a random number while reloading
---
Over 1300 hours, thanks mostly to COVID but now I am back to work so moving a little slower.
---
I mean why else would the jet pack make him not care about mutations? his favorite mutation is probably marsupial and now he doesn‚Äôt need it because he has the jet pack instead. Now he can use those extra perk points he had in class freak or whatever on something else, I still prefer mutations though, just how I understood this post.
---
They are locking every player into a stat build. Making us scrap all our perk points for an absurd amount of coins to upgrade legendary perks.  After a promised system to have loadouts its pointless. No one is gonna have anything to switch to until you're level 1000. Wow, I messed up and dumped my points in a system that wasn't explained I wouldn't get them back. After they made me use all 200 of my levels to do so. Horrible system that locks people into their build and only caters yo players level 500+ at least.
---
Siltbeans, they are required for tons of recipes but you cant plant them.
---
Anything I get that I value between 2-10k caps goes into my vendor to sell, anything less then 2k goes to the scrip machine and anything over 10k goes into my stash for trades. Even doing this I‚Äôm overloaded constantly.
---
Got it!
---
Thank you! I'm still level 8, but I'm learning fast, I promise! üòÇ
---
Much rather have 4 more CAMP units and allow me to pick which one I want to load before joining the server... I want to build more camps... not tear them down...
---
Enclave officer I believe goes quite well, especially for those high-ranking raiders among us.
---
If its tfc or tlc I'd understand
---
Maybe legendary perks? I think they help with builds but im not sure
---
yeah, but the burning mine sucks, and learning it while doing the mission is not much fun.
---
What five additional perk points?  You mean Starched Genes 2 and Class Freak 3?
---
That‚Äôs a small amount to pay for the following benefits:
---
* **Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of 23 extra stat points.**
---
I‚Äôll trade 5 perk points for 23 extra SPECIAL any day of the week. 
---
And that‚Äôs not including all of the other benefits:
---
* *+50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, +20 pounds carry weight, x2Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons.*
---
Feel free to eschew mutations for personal reasons or role-play reasons.
---
But mechanically?  Allocating five perk points for all of those benefits?  There aren‚Äôt five ranks of perk cards that duplicate the value of those benefits.
---
Just the damage resistances alone that I cited are better than Ironclad 5 **and** Refractor 4 combined. (+50 DR/ +90 ER).
---
It‚Äôs a good doggo, I think my next camps is gonna be small and I‚Äôm gonna put it up there so I feel like I‚Äôve got a dog in my camp.
---
So to further how bad I am at this- how do I find you in the world!?
---
It's under "Defense" tab
---
Cool.  I collect a fair number of robot and robot mod plans and I try to keep them stocked in my vendor.  I know a lot of them have sold recently,  but there may be some left.  Not sure if I have any on my char.  psn aj-ninetyeight.  camp is on the acid node just S of monongah power plant and E of bolton greens.
---
The acid node makes it a popular location - my camp is elevated, contained inside the power transmission tower.  Nuka-quantum light and grognak throne on the roof.
---
I can switch to three totally different builds simply by switching out cards. Max builds. It‚Äôs my opinion that the investment into the mutation perks give milder quality of life benefits
---
I was daydreaming today at work about a fun crop idea. 
---
There could be a potential rare reward from Daily Ops in vault 96. Pre-war seeds.
---
Planting them could trigger a 30-minute or so minigame / event where you‚Äôve got to keep them alive (fight enemies, water with non-radiated water, etc). 
---
If you keep them around for the whole time, you can harvest them for some sort of useful material or interesting plant.
---
I‚Äôm joining you now
---
Exactly!!! It's not undoable, just tedious.
---
You have my vote, but Id prefer it to be called thunder thighs.
---
Ehh frankly I grind levels occasionally to rectify/fix any mistakes I made from being an absolute n00b and choosing perks that weren‚Äôt very good or viable. 
---
Also makes it nice to build up a few different sets to then be able to switch your builds for a different playstyle with different groups. 
---
Currently (Mostly) a Tank/Auto-Rifle while trying to work up on building my Supp/healer build for daily ops and the legendary boss events.
---
There‚Äôs a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù tab in the pause menu that will display your friends
---
Class freak is useless. Should only have been using 2 perk points to begin with in my personal opinion.
---
Field scribe
---
Oh no way, lol. I mean i feel this has been the least buggiest update and I appreciate it but fuck, when you have this and the fast travel glitch the game feels unplayable to me. Yesterday i just turned it off and didn't do my daisy's. Now I feel I am missing something.
---
hunter's long coat
---
True they could just store the currency in the machine, no need for notes then let us claim the 150 when we use the machine.
---
This breaks the game lol
---
I think I can help you out more. I used to do this a lot more before, but sounds like you'd appreciate upgrades and equipment.
---
With the amout of double score events planed I really could care less for the NW events... especially now that I've finally hit lvl 100 while bush hiding (took me one year)
---
I did that! I am able to one shot ghouls with a revolver headshot, no crits or perks.
---
This multi player shit is a whole new world lol I think I did it!
---
Great idea, but the name needs work. My suggestion: Atlas Unleashed
---
Thanks I‚Äôve tried the whole hill noting over by where you said I just found a little camp with a scavenger
---
The FOMO is real man lol. Bastards got us where they want us. Todd damnit...
---
I just hate the idea of a currency for my currency, if you know what I mean. There's enough of that in this game already.
---
No worries. Until recently there was no wrong way to play Fallout. That's still kind of true I guess, but since the last update if you don't at least somewhat optimize your build you're gonna have a bad time. But the lower levels should still be fairly manageable.
---
Lol I‚Äôm at your camp
---
I run a quad ammo, 25% faster fire rate, &amp; +33% vats hit plasma caster with prime capacitor &amp; aligned sniper barrel. 
---
I‚Äôm a heavy weapons, PA build  
---
Ideally a two shot plasma caster is the best roll imo
---
Not true. With 15 strength and 15 perception you can have 3 full builds on your character. (4 full builds but I‚Äôm not including rifleman as an effective build) Then you still have enough perks left over to ensure balance from endurance through luck. It‚Äôs all about the perks and how they work together
---
Coming!!
---
Ideally it would only lose durability when a shot hits an enemy so you don‚Äôt lose durability when shooting air like now. The problem currently is that weapons with TS, explosive, beam splitter like mods and/or fire multiple projectiles by default (like The Dragon) simply lose durability way too fast compared to anything else.
---
I doubt we will see any actual and meaningful combat related changes anytime soon though, if ever..
---
My mic won‚Äôt work- I was attempting to thank you in advance like a normal human but again- way too shit at this
---
But I am slowly fast traveling lol
---
I play them as I can. They are always the last one I do, if there's time. Admittedly, my CAMP is patiently waiting on the Greenhouse building set in order to be completed, so I'm in kind of a rush lol
---
Yes I do. Thank you!
---
Any idea where barrels might be? Mine does 400 damage per shot but has a terrible barrel
---
Feel free to add me and you should check out /r/PKOA
---
r/PKOA is the Peace Keepers of Appalachia, a sort of unofficial guild that my best friend and I joined. Have only met amazing helpful fun folks so far.
---
Nice thanks for the info, now I know
---
I just heard chatter from other gamers saying legendary was same as magic. 
---
But now I know that I can throw a pice of armor on with that perk for my shotgun build
---
I still think that 5 points to get the following benefits is worth it:
---
* Increased weapon damage at lower health (even if you aren‚Äôt full bloodied, helps get you out of emergency situations)
---
* Double the effect of Meat or Plant (which themselves can give you things like increased XP gain or help boost your damage)
---
* +25% Bonus Critical Damage 
---
* +150 Energy Resist
---
* +50 Damage Resistance
---
* 20% faster reload
---
That‚Äôs just a handful of the possible mutations, all of these are useful in pure combat situations (they can be swapped around to be melee/unarmed focused).  
---
I mean to each their own, but there‚Äôs a reason most people don‚Äôt talk about playing as non-mutated, there‚Äôs no actual benefit to it.  You don‚Äôt even need to really run Starched Genes if you use things like What Rads, Brahmin Milk, or Nuka Cola Grape (with Cola nut, removes 1200 rads)
---
Just found him yesterday. We don‚Äôt deserve him (angry turtle).
---
What can I do to help/ give you? I have crap :-/ I‚Äôm a builder who is grinding caps and plans from meat week lol
---
Shit, seriously?!
---
This is a great interview.
---
Luv it
---
The underground nature of it is likely to reduce server load given the greatly increased budgets.  They could have servers dedicated to interiors that don't have to worry about mobs, combat, or more than a couple of players per instance at a time.
---
I just hope that they have a way to fast travel to wherever the venders are.  I don't want to have to go through two loading screens in the my search for .308 only to discover that they player's 10k advertised ammo is all .38, .44, or 10mm.
---
Oh I'm sorry, was my off the cuff general example not precise enough for you my lord?\
---
The bottom line fucking stands, if you give people access to more caps the primary take away will be that they'll just charge more for shit because they can now.
---
elder's battlecoat, communist spy outfit
---
Imo I like the Confederate Uniform and the skull gas mask.  The South will rise again, or something, (idk, I don't play racist).
---
I believe that too. Without that incentive to innovate why would anyone bother ? Yes they got bought out but in the majority of the cases they want to be bought out . It takes some big balls and a whole lot of luck to turn into Microsoft or amazon . Most people just want to be filthy rich
---
interface already gets sluggish with 350 carry weight in items...think the inventory system just needs an overhaul, why there isnt a separate tracking mechanism for keys, tapes and notes is beyond me, but having 100+ items on a character with no actual items just seems kinda dumb
---
Agreed. Wasted opportunity
---
He may be talking about only marsupial, but it didn‚Äôt come across that way. Marsupial is great, but it‚Äôs hardly the most important of the mutations out there.
---
there so only a short and a long barrel i believe
---
agree
---
Buy modules instead.
---
Hop in
---
I didn't play yesterday. It was my girlfriends bday. I was fine 
---
*itch itch*
---
Dang, PC player here
---
Then howd i get an extra display case plan ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
it cant be carried by 1 or 2 geared and built toons like it could before the patch.  You actually have to contribute now, not just hang on the coattails of whichever 300+ bloodied shows up to smash him down.
---
People are doing it on private servers with pre made groups, like the Queen was after 1st released.   
---
People dont want scrubs screwing up the run for them.
---
Are you ducking me?
---
It's not just sad - it's surprising, even for Bethesda.  You would think that if your big grind's new weaponry all suffered from this well-known defect - and it's not new, the Gauss Rifle itself had this problem too - you would either want to address that defect, or choose weapons that wouldn't exacerbate it.  Instead, they did neither.
---
Yes. I have one on my vamps medic for when I need to output damage. Helps that it also never breaks and you never have to reload lol.
---
Is there an easy way to join with others? I have done a couple and when i join a Daily Op its just me.
---
THANK YOU KIND SIr!!!!!!
---
I skin my gear with atom shop skins and if I can't do that I'll favorite it. You'll get a notification asking if you're sure about scrapping it when you try.
---
I have blue screened, black screened and frozen more since the patch than I ever did before. I'm not sure if it actually has anything to do with that or is just a coincidence, but it's been frustrating. Likes to do it during daily ops and sbq.
---
If it's cool enough, I'll just message them! An actual compliment with maybe what you like about it is pretty genuine and feels good for the person who worked so hard to make their camp! :)
---
Glad to help, happy flying!
---
Awesome! Welcome to the community. As others have said, it‚Äôs an great group of people who play. I‚Äôm a female and almost 40. Started playing about a year and a half ago. I hadn‚Äôt played video games since I was a little kid on an NES with my brother.
---
This is such a wholesome and amazing story. I'm s glad you're enjoying this game and don't let anyone tell you that you can't have fun with this game. The reason I say that is because there is a lot of blind negativity towards 76. 
---
This game will forever be in my heart and it makes me really happy when I see or read about other people loving the game aswell.
---
This is way too cool man- thank you again
---
If you haven‚Äôt learned it it‚Äôll keep giving it to you.  I learned that the hard way, thinking I‚Äôd farm them for my alts rather than switch them around, I had a bunch for me and my friend.
---
Once I learned them, they stopped appearing.
---
No one is ever too old to learn new things in life. I'm glad you were able to find something that you can enjoy with your daughter. And to be honest, the mechanics of this game are taking me quite a while to learn and get used to, as I just don't have the time and the patience for some games anymore.
---
I did the easy ones on my main... Didn't realise robot things were so rare. I usually ignore the plans. üôà
---
The problem is that this is just poor reasoning. If games really do need micro transactions or subscriptions to be profitable at their current price point then we would never see standalone single player games, but we do. Clearly companies aren‚Äôt nearly as bad off as some people here are asserting. Add to this that FO76 is one of the cheapest AAA live service games ever produced and has several types of monetization and it becomes a lot harder to sympathize with the devs.
---
I would love that! Just let me know if you want my PSN!
---
The Enclave approves.
---
But yeah, I'm currently running a energy heavy weapon build. No mutation, no rad, no addictions just 100% 'murican with a big honking plasma gatling, caster and rifle.
---
on the map at the pioneer scout camp (by grafton steel) there is a drawn tower and a cabin....drawn on the map. the archery range is right below the cabin drawn on the map. (bottom left corner of drawn cabin)
---
Good name!
---
just FYI if you wear the nuka girl outfit it gets replaces it with the one on the outfit...
---
Yes it‚Äôs such a good game but this is getting a little to much
---
Eyebot Earl just vibin with me as I be would be great.
---
How many power do they give you? I havent gotten the plan yet.
---
Thanks for your Feedback!
---
Really cute story, thanks for sharing.
---
I ditched starched genes, I can make the serums so I‚Äôm not worried about losing a mutation.  I also can avoid bumbling into a rad shower by accident. Also the rad resist/ regeneration is enough that you rarely become irradiated enough to risk picking up another mutation that you don‚Äôt want. It‚Äôs only been a week but I have not lost or gained a mutation yet.
---
Now that one wasteland is here and resetting the game play baseline, I think they should spend some time evaluating the entire financial ecosystem. It needs a major overhaul that better represents the current state of a two year old live service game. We‚Äôre getting more legendary drops, but they are, 99 percent of the time, garbage drops or items that do not fit our builds. The fact that we even have to scrip so much is a problem nobody seems to want to talk about. I personally think the quality of the drops need to improve to reduce the volume of legendary recycling. But that‚Äôs just the start. Spend limits, earn limits, and currencies all need a fresh look.
---
I've had generally great results even in first person... when I had a fully UY set and 20% health making my perception god-tier....  VATS sniping used to be a viable thing with the GS.  I feel like that got nerfed as much as damage in the last patch.  So I just started going full health instead.
---
I've noticed it's firing every bullet and then displaying 12 rounds left instead of the gun being empty.
---
No worries, you can pay it forward at some point to someone else!
---
Lets say you just did 3 daily ops and was rewarded with 6 3\* legendary weapons.  Now 6 3\* legendary weapons is 240 scrip, but you can only claim 150 daily.
---
If we got notes you would put in all 6 3\*'s, and get 240 legendary notes.  You could then turn in 150 of them for your daily 150 cap, and still have 90 notes for tomorrow.
---
This would keep you from having to lug around 3 extra legendaries and also find a few 1/2 stars to get that 150 daily limit.
---
A few players have stated that we could just have the machine hold the extra scrip as pending which is also a great idea, I just went with notes due to having a way to track them on our character, as we can always check our treasury notes and current caps the same way.
---
Agreed.  It becomes second nature if you do it enough.
---
Marsupial is great, but its not as important as Healing Factor or Adrenal Reaction.
---
Prove me wrong.
---
I scripped a three star two shot yesterday after firing it once delightedly seeing my one mini nuke ammo come out as two
---
Ideally but the idea of getting additional ranks is for those whom go adventuring for hours.
---
ah fair one, in FO4 99% of the mods I had added new things (which obviously isnt possible here... yet) so i just have a few essentials on fo76 like ore glow and perk loadouts
---
I‚Äôm starting to teach my niece and nephews (all under 6) how to play some games. Not Fallout yet since there‚Äôs a lot of scary stuff, but they‚Äôre learning Ark at the moment since they‚Äôre all obsessed with dinosaurs right now. :)
---
It is hard to enjoy when you're reloading the game and losing loot all the time.
---
I use a LOT of vamp heavies when running low health build. Mini is tops to stay alive. Gat laser is good but it's little quirks can get you in trouble.
---
Soon we‚Äôll be able to create a bunker door that takes us into a new room like when you enter a building and have to go through a loading screen, and this room will have a separate build limit.
---
Or Mother Load, I‚Äôd love it too.
---
Why would I try to prove you wrong?  I agree with you.  I have mixed feelings on Healing Factor, only because I enjoy heavy use of chems - but I completely agree on Adrenal reaction
---
Bummer as I‚Äôm on Play Station. Wish they did cross platform! You will meet some new friends for sure!
---
I‚Äôve gotten legendary weapons this way hehe
---
where is the point emote fgs
---
I completely agree with this.
---
And while we are at it can we get some headlamp options for Excavator please? Its the only power armor with no headlamp options and the default one is fucking trash.
---
It is a system for those high levels it is not aimed at the casual player.  1800 perk points to max them all. By level 100 you should have your SPECIAL points and all cards you want You then get 20 perk packs and 100 points per hundred levels which is 360 perk coins. So at level 600 you should have all 6 done. This does not include the 50 coins (so 25 levels) nor the perk packs from SCORE so even if you fuck up you should be done around 660 or less.   
---
It is the legendary system not the lowbie scrub system. You should feel legendary when you have high levels, you should be above those that are lower than yourself.
---
now make that 500, I'd love one of those in my camp
---
I am 39 years young and struggling to find the willpower to get from lvl 26 or 27 to 30 so that I can equip a Fixer that someone had given me. i think i did really good in season 1, powering through to lvl 39 or something on the seasonal board.  i'm just not understanding the crafting mechanics correctly. I have fairly limited weapons, armor, and aids in the stash but i'm constantly running out of space in it. what am i supposed to do w/ the 700+ pounds of scrapped junk  and ammo? if i dont use a certain ammo, am i really supposed to sell it all? can i do anything else with ammo besides the ammoconverter? I have some mini nukes that are just wasting tons of space.
---
I'd love one that did no dmg (but runs around as part of the action), couldn't die, but does act as autolooting extra storage space (autolooting select items types such as legendary items, ammo, meat, etc on a toggle).
---
The last one was easy to reproduce, but this time you need to access the machine on a laggy server, while someone is spawning in...
---
Magical junkies explosive Gatling plasma. Fire rate doesn‚Äôt matter when the splitter plus explosive drops the fire rate requirement to around 50 for magic effect.
---
My 19 month old knows what buttons do what and knows when she has a controller not connected and gets pissed. The first thing she does when she gets a controller in her hand is press the home button to see if it functions.
---
My game crashed twice today and im running a decent rig without any problems before today. Its probably bad servers.
---
They're underground and instanced so that they're separate from the server and not increasing the load on it. They're already crappy at times, I couldn't imagine adding that much extra build space and budget for 10+ more people on top it.
---
If you are sleeping and the bed is removed you stay prone and slide around like the ghouls used to do.  I also had a death and respawn in the burning mine. I fell into fire when I got hit and went down, so I hit give up to respawn quicker. I came back on fire.  At least I was not in God mode.  I actually seemed more susceptible to damage and you can't see much of anything in the burning mine when you are on fire. Just kept running to keep the flames behind me.üôÇ
---
I genuinely can‚Äôt wait to do that- you‚Äôre a good egg!
---
Bro, i have the queen killer and it still does all the damage.
---
My kid's friends couldn't shut up about their builds, they really wanted me to convert to their bloodied ways. Honestly don't know what to think... My kid's a junkie, and she's really proud of it üòÇüòÇ
---
West has a very large undiscovered area bigger than the ash heap in its area. They could make a glowing sea out of it(?) Technically it's part of Columbus as the river divides the two states.
---
They could add the Pitt from Fallout 3 as it is north of WV or  expand South for Virginia
---
What gun is it?
---
Not saying they are bad off. But for a live service game there needs to be a stream of revenue
---
Some things need to be re-classed. Like make Gunpowder a junk item that can be stored in the Scrapbox, Hardened Mass should be storable in the scrapbox without breaking it down to Ultracite, Mainframe and damaged Mainframe cores need to be scrappable/sellable, Floater grenades need to be at least droppable, Keys and Passwords needs to be on its own "keyring", Ammo such as the Fusion cores, Plasma Cores, and their ultracite versions on them need to be grouped together if within similar charge.
---
Theres a lot of things that can be done to ease the burden and load on the servers as far as inventory management goes.
---
Name is rubbish :-) And you can remove the word "instantly", when you gain something with a perk card it's assumed to be immediate, you dont need to specify that.
---
But this is covered by perks and backpacks already, simply more carry weight isn't legendary and quite unnecessary really...
---
I didn't say it is. But surely it is not intended this way.
---
Thats a good suggestion!
---
Indeed! Seeing how it's one of these things that has been swept under the rug and all of my threads have been ignored.. I am seriously starting to believe that they don't know how to tackle this (among other well known issues that have existed since time immemorial) I also recall reading that this specific studio wasn't very experienced with this Frankenstein of an engine to begin with. Anyway, I just want to be able to respec back to my favorite kind of weapon, and don't even get me started on shotguns in general. I JUST got a bloodied explosive pump action shottie.. AND FOR SOME REASON IT MISSES 9 out of 10 VATS SHOTS! This one is completely new for me, but I wouldn't be surprised if it existed since launch.
---
That was a bug, which was fixed a few patches ago
---
Does FFR work for gauss minis. I‚Äôve heard it doesn‚Äôt. Can‚Äôt test atm.
---
AAAAAAAAA
---
Awww! Thank you for the love anyways! ‚ù§‚ù§
---
I would much rather keep anything Halo related out of Fallout.
---
Thank you for reading!
---
Well its a small sun so it might appear white
---
Too much convenience at CAMPs is a bad thing.
---
Same to me, an hour lost to put again the items on the store. I didn't list anything. -
---
Is this camp adams
---
I know its somthing I was thinking about when I was at work yesterday. Id figure id throw the concept out there.
---
HELL YEAH
---
And...? What's wrong with that?
---
I‚Äôm currently wearing the West Virginia Drifter outfit and  shell shocked backpack with mine, since I missed the Raider Scabber outfit and back pack.
---
I have a bloodied FFR one, and it does pretty well up close and personal, but still is hit or miss(literally) at a distance with VATS.
---
That was a joke im sorry. Hahaaaa bad joke I guess.
---
Throw on some demo expert perks and the TS will be slightly better than the bloodied. Some weird post patch 22 effects are going on wit TS and explosive effects. Angry turtle showed that a tse heavy weapon actually outperformed a be heavy weapon when using the same bloodied build. So maybe a meta will be low health ts with explosive. 
---
When you compare them don‚Äôt pay attention to the pip boy numbers or the numbers for damage that show up on the screen with each hit. Compare how each weapon reduces the actual hp bar of the mob. With rapid fire explosions there is usually unlisted damage that only shows up in how fast a mob dies.

---
A blanket nerf, leaving some weapons unviable is not balance.
---
Good morning read. Thanks
---
I got locked in someones CAMP and picked the lock to get out.  Needless to say I was wanted after that and just went to the Whitespring Rail Station and gave the Come Here emoji for someone to take me out of my misery.  Next time I just beam myself out to another location.
---
Uhhh, time has not stopped. There's Halloween decorations because that's when the world ended. I'm pretty sure the survivors and vault dwellers still celebrate holidays within their respective months. It's a wasteland, not a time loop.
---
We could use use tarberry pools.  It would be something we would need to build.
---
Ordinarily I would say no cause it seems a bit OP and people need learn better inventory management but I actually like this idea. Under one condition... it has to be called Loot Pi√±ata. I love Players that carry lots of goodies
---
I usually keep the crafted one because you cant sell Them and the crappy one i sold for caps. The really good one i trade with my other toon.
---
I make another character and dump them in that one and now that character I have over 1600 weight of legendary stuff that does not have any use to anyone at ALL
---
I like to do this when I'm at my camp and people visit. I try to offer both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and a snack of some kind.
---
on anything that's not a scorchbeast, colossus or sheepsquatch, rifleman is more effective than commando.
---
I'm still one-shotting most things with a QE lever, SuperMutants take 2.
---
Concentrated fire for headshots is still the only way to go with rifles.  If you dont use the perk, that is your problem with rifleman.
---
Rifleman, Commando, PA Heavy, Barbarian Heavy, Shotgun, 1h Melee, 2h Melee, Unarmed
---
Far more than 3 builds with 15STR and PER.
---
Cheers thanks...and now to bang some drums at meat week!
---
And if you find tge odd sleepable bed in the wild that has pillows? Sleeping in it will make the pillow shoot out from under your head and across the room.
---
If there are some that I think might sell, then I try to sell them at my vendor. Otherwise, I hang onto them until I can scrip them. There may be one or two times I've dropped a 1 star weapon that weighed 10+ pounds, but I avoid that unless absolutely necessary.
---
When she first started to explain the game I had to ask her to slow down a bit, so much information... But it's been really fun so far. I mean, I'm level 10 now but I'm having a blast.
---
I‚Äôm gonna sound stupid but how do you get those tags like (Xbox raiders?
---
Only worse feeling is to solo under 8 minutes and get zero rare rewards.
---
That sounds like a good idea. But I dont have Fallout 1st to swap in a private server.
---
I usually just put them on my alts for when I want to start a new build, so I can accumulate scrip consistently while I level up
---
*grave isnt lootable the toy alien is the looting*
---
Agreed, they would have to make the system show how many you have on you though.  If you have 900 and are immediately given 150 when activating, you then loose 50.   Currently like the vendor 30k cap dilemma. 
---
If we have the option to withdraw the scrip with a slider though, then unfortunately that would take just as long as turning in the notes.
---
Drop them on the ground near the machine or in the rusty pick. Hope someone else exchanges them.
---
I love it! We will take all the gamers we can!
---
Unlikely to actually be available on the console itself, but perhaps in the future more players will be able to be eligible for the PTS on PC regardless of the platform they normally play on.
---
It was exactly what you were asking actually.
---
You get completion rewards - doesn‚Äôt matter in which time you did it.
---
Then you get three different rolls for completing the tiers - elder being a 80% roll. If you complete all 3 first try you roll 3 times and can get a maximum of 3 rare rewards.
---
Exact numbers are to be found when reading one of the other threads on reddit. But you can‚Äôt just add chances. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äûif I flip a coin two times I have a 100% chance to get side A since it is 2x 50%‚Äú. That‚Äôs not how math works
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôve Eldered it every single day and still no rare reward.
---
I put them on my vendor for sale, stash what I can, hold onto what I can, and eventually just start throwing them away because what else are you gonna do with it. Then I spend the next week logging in, getting my daily scrip, spending it, and logging out until I'm ready to stock up on my next weeks worth of legendaries, which usually doesn't take long.
---
Right now the best place to farm is Graham‚Äôs feast camp. There is a cliff just to the side of the camp that spawns all the critters. People hardly ever know this so you can farm a crap ton of meat. Don‚Äôt forget to equip the appropriate perks :). I‚Äôve gotten dozens of meat just today
---
Find the current best in the business stealth commando build and then follow these steps
---
1. Remove any Bloodied based perks and mutations (serendipidy/Nerd Rage/Possibly Life-Giver/etc) 
---
2. Add in some perks to support your addictive tendencies (increase alcohol effectiveness/chem effect duration etc)
---
3. Get an armor set that supports the shrouded mod that includes the HTD while sneaking legendary modifier. I would go for a Vang Primary since you'll likely be working with a full health build, if not use unyielding even if it won't fully proc because you are at high HP. 
---
4. Consider converting your weapons to Ultracite for a damage boost
---
5. Select your addictions (I think the buff maxes out at 5, I forget which ones are best).
---
6. Start Killing.
---
oh yeah this random encounter spawned riiight next to a fissure site lmaoooo
---
:/ welp
---
Your not running your mutations correctly then.
---
You will never be able to show a non-mutation build that is more effective than a mutant.
---
Thats why the first thing people do at lvl 31 is stack mutations.  they are that powerful.
---
It's so annoying having very lows script's limits (I hope they increase that soon), but I do 3 things: 
---
If their weight isn't much I keep them until the next day. 
---
If I have 1* who gets me at least 200 caps from the NPC vendor I sell them, if not I'll keep them until the next day and so on. *me still with like 70 legendaries waiting to be turn into the machine * üôÉ
---
Not the best idea, but that's what I do. üòÖ
---
And make it a target dummy at the same time.
---
Im on ps4.  And rn im struggling to just build decent things.  Most of my time is spent scavvaging watoga for scrap.   Everytime i find gear its lvl 50 and i cant use it
---
Just a figure of speech.
---
You can have 15 Strength, 15 Perception.
---
S15 P15 E9 C9 I15 A15 L8 can be your SPECIAL if you want, for example. 86 ranks worth of perk cards to equip. And then you can also add another 23 SPECIAL on top of that from mutations. 
---
S15 P19 E11 C9 I22 A21 L10, with 86 Perk Card Points to spend
---
That‚Äôs a lot of build variety. More if you want to lower Endurance or Charisma, the two most common dump stats. Take 5 from Charisma (so you can still run &amp; share SiN and have the other three for HB3 or Insp3) and 2 from Endurance and *voila*, you have max SPECIAL in five stats. 
---
- S15 P15 E7 C4 I15 A15 L15 base
---
- S15 P19 E9 C6 I22 A21 L17 with mutations. 
---
No gear added yet. This is **completely naked**, not even any under armor. 
---
That‚Äôs literally dozens of builds. I can‚Äôt think of very many that rely on high Endurance or Charisma. So with everything else maxed out at 15 base, it think that allows plenty of build variety. 
---
In short, allocating five out of your potential 86 perk points to get +23 SPECIAL is an insane value. 
---
Mechanically, there‚Äôs no reason to ignore mutations. Maybe not all of them are best for a build (Ranged builds don‚Äôt need to take Twisted Muscles, obviously), but they have a lot of utility use.
---
Now not not lol. You can‚Äôt change your build and then complain you want the perks and legendarys back that you‚Äôve upgraded
---
You can get squirrel bits (and a bunch of other useful meats) at Toxic Larry‚Äôs.
---
The only issue I see with this is you will instantly have people going ‚Äúso that NPC is wearing X Outfit, and I can‚Äôt loot it off them but I can BUY it for real money in the shop? Yeah, that seems fair‚Äù. And then inevitably you will start seeing youtube videos and gaming news website articles with the headline ‚Äúfallout 76 locks half its content behind a paywall: can‚Äôt unlock loot without paying real money?‚Äù. Then you‚Äôll also have those players who are like ‚Äúwhy should I pay for an outfit that‚Äôs already in the game? If I‚Äôm going to pay, I want something unique to me, not something every NPC wears‚Äù (like there aren‚Äôt already 5000 people wearing the same thing daily).
---
I‚Äôd love for NPCs to wear atom stuff, or places to show atom decor, but I‚Äôm sure the internet would use that as a massive weapon against the game sadly.
---
I put them in my vendor for 10caps/scrip although lately no one seems to be buying. I think everyone is having the same problem of too many legendaries
---
Aw man. I'll try that, thank you!
---
Do you play on Xbox? I‚Äôm willing to give you some stuff
---
I can't wait to get mine I am going to have a warzone esq camp using trenches with the super gen as the objective point. BoS vs Commies.
---
Try server hopping
---
I understand the figure of speech, it just seems odd to respond to me with that
---
It‚Äôs a different game from launch. Best just to dive in and play
---
my first thought when I was reading this was "I wonder what stupid hoops I'll have to jump through, or maybe it'll require some new currency". I hope this isn't the case but I guess we'll see.
---
I tried but when I Gigi the scoreboard it‚Äôs just black screen - ugh.
---
I was worried we weren't going to see this post today. What a relief.
---
Great job, keep on trucking.

I always create my own team. And when i see someone not joining the ops when i enter and start it, i kick them. Makes room for the people who want to participate.

---
I dont know, but armorer doesnt reduce the cost of crafting SS armor. I think any gold bullion item has a set cost to craft
---
Good idea
---
I did the worst piece I had first... I think I crafted like 40 Left Legs before I got one I wanted.  The nice thing is, it's a lot of light weight 3 star scrip to hang onto, you can dump heavier stuff on the ground and hang onto all the SS armor to scrap all week long.
---
So yo. If you have your points in agility, what I do for shotties is take off dodgy and use ricochet in luck, and run about slightly less than half health. To make room in luck I take off serendipity to replace it with ricochet. Because shotguns seem to hit much harder even if not "magic" per se in vats. Dodgy eats up too much ap, but if you run max adrenaline and can one shot lvl 75 and 100 super mutants in vats, you'll take them down faster than you'd need to rely on damage avoidance perks
---
I mean, it should cost something. But it would be super awesome if it made some kind of in-game sense.
---
I don't know how dodgy works by itself,  I just threw in that whole combo. My AP refresh with AB, armor perks and Vats perks doesn't seem to suffer too much. I'll try taking dodgy off and see if there's any difference. And yeah, that minigun mutant is a pest.
---
I was at the wrong canp
---
Just dump the extra weight.  I know best since I am a hoarder but in the end its not worth collecting and trying to carry everything.  Sell what you can and dump the rest.
---
I'll give you a hint: you don't even need Starched Genes. Bam. 2 perk cards saved. Or, hear me out, put a legendary perk into Luck and you can have all those pesky mutation cards back.
---
Yes it works at night as well.

*The Enclave prefers... controlled mutations. Regulated. Not the... random chaos from the Wasteland.*

*It‚Äôs about controlling our own evolution, and not letting the chaos factor have any control.*

That should be this game's slogan
---
It's all about connecting with your child on their level of what interests them to have more in common.i started playing fallout76 a yr ago at 44(thinking it would give me one more thing in common) with my daughter 21 and my youngest son 16. I still talk to them about the game but turns out my daughter only plays it with her boyfriend once in a blue moon ,and my son said the game is a piece of s***  and refuses to play it, and blames Bethesda like they are the evil tyrant of the video game world. It's still fun though
---
Well, they do mention ‚Äúto your hearts content‚Äù. We have to see what they specially mean by that.
---
Yes but Bethesda has said things in the past and it‚Äôs never happened
---
Idk.  But all i use is throwing knives.   Because tbh they do more damage then any of my weapons
---
There are? There‚Äôs a workbench repair option when you‚Äôre at the workbench under modify/repair
---
FO1st exclusive
---
Sorry if this gets asked a lot, I don‚Äôt follow the subreddit and didn‚Äôt want to scroll through it or Bethesda change logs to find an answer.  I was hoping someone could give me some broad strokes as to what‚Äôs different.
---
I could definitely see them doing 25-50lbs per rank
---
Repair kits are not even remotely essential, and the good ones are drops in the game anyways.  You‚Äôre better off repairing your gear with something like ‚Äúfix it good‚Äù at a work bench for the 200% repair.  The only reason most people have or even use the basic repair kits is because they were awarded free with last season
---
Weapons and armor can be repaired at the workbench.
---
On ps4, you go to the proper workbench, hit triangle to repair/mod, highlight the item you want to repair, hit triangle to get into the repair menu, than square to repair with junk.
---
Fix it Good and Weapon artisan allow you to repair to 200% at max rank.
---
1000+ hrs played and 0 repair kits used.
---
First question: how did you know they can solo ops?
---
I think the real value to underground (from the game's side) is the system doesn't have to render anything except what you've put there. You can have a bigger budget because the system doesn't have to render the weather, whatever your base is around (trees, water, smoldering ruins, other houses, etc), whatever might approach your base, etc.
---
I realize that FO76 motto seems to be "let's limit everything" (scrip, caps, gold, fun). But budget is the one I've understood as a necessity. If they let anyone build anything, you could walk up on a camp covered in thousands of lit letters that would basically drag your framerate down to a crawl. With the space "underground" (or in a building, or whatever), the system will only have to render what's in that space. There still has to be a limit, but that limit can be much bigger.
---
Thats odd considering the enclave sells serums and serum recipes. Derp.
---
Oh look, its beef-fish, again.
---
That there's no materials needed in the PTS. It says each instance has its own build budget. But you can build whatever you want with no material cost.
---
Whitespring there are usually 3 that spawn in between the service entrance and the vendor station. And top of the world off to the right by the huge power lines there are usually 4 squirrels. Throw on butchers bounty and your good to go
---
I've been in situations where I just log into a server and join a 3 person OPs team. After joining, I realize that they are already doing the mission so I click join. It is only after doing that that I realize that they are on the final boss and I get credit for completion. 
---
I wish there was a way to know ahead of time how far a team has progressed into the daily OPs.
---
Agreed, I actually thought they were going to be functional, my disappointment came when I went to this guy's CAMP who bought all the season and I saw both objects were useless, guess it was my fault for expecting something different from Beth. XD
---
I hate treasury notes more than I hate legendary items. In fact, treasury notes can't even be sold to someone else, while legendary items can, even when they have weight you can get rid of them, make small caps, give them to a low level, etc. 
---
So, no, please, no more extra steps. The limit is the problem, not the lack of extra steps.

Well if your level 220 you surely can, I‚Äôm not sure about you but I‚Äôm level 139 and my first op was a solo.( I have awful armor and ok guns)
---
I don't know if what my kid and her friends told me will be helpful to you, but they have "mules" where they dump all their extra stuff. They carry very little on them.
---
Still. I never leave.
---
Um....
---
You can repair weapons and armor at a workbench.
---
Edit: go to a workbench. Inspect/repair. Select your weapon. Workbench repair. This will use junk you collect to repair gear.
---
It's honestly probably easier to just switch to herbivore, as the materials for that item are easier to farm.
---
Sounds like I need one then.
---
Yeah the Fatman is a really sad case. I tried my AA Fatman again during last Fasnacht when super mutants were dropping free nukes and even without the MIRV it breaked extremely fast.
---
So this is where you get into statistics and things get more complicated. Bloodied is by far the highest damage build. There's nothing even kind of close. The down side is you have to operate on 20% of your max HP. You'll usually see people artificially lower their health bar with radiation to keep the damage going. There are also a ton of cards that help mitigate damage so you're not as squishy as it sounds at first glance. It takes many levels and very good equipment to optimize a bloodied build properly.
---
Anti-armor is a good option with no negative effects. You wont really have to do anything special for it other than find an anti-armor weapon you like.
---
Junkies is a weird one. You get 45% bonus damage as long as you're addicted to a certain amount of chems. (5 I believe but look into a bit more. Don't just take my word for it) I'd personally suggest anti armor over junkies unless you actually use chems. 
---
Furious can be good if you use weapons with a high rate of fire. The other 3 will be better because furious has to build up. You get more damage as you attack a single target multiple times. If you attack another target on accident or the original target dies the damage resets. So situationally good.
---
I personally run bloodied/unyielding. Unyielding is the bloodied equivalent for armor. The lower you health (20% gives max results) the higher your S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes will be (excluding endurance which adds HP)
---
Edit: a word
---
It's happened to me twice since the patch, but I was lucky enough to be in Power Armor.
---
No, the trick is to play the Jukebox or an instrument to partially fill the meter, then stop. Let the event nearly run out before finishing it off and killing the Wendigo. The event ends once you do that.

---
I‚Äôm ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to usually get garbage that happens to have a low weight, so I just carry them around with me
---
Gotcha. So that was an assumption on your part. Second question: how do you know they didn't join the Op at the first available opportunity?
---
What a load of nonsense this post is, almost as bad as your reasoning behind it :-)
---
I hadn‚Äôt realized it was 18 levels in a couple days to be honest. I may have done more than 10 today as i was in a groove. I soloed the ash heap prime meats and had a 3 star legendary scorchbeast during the event too. While i was in the event public team but no actual help. The pieces were just falling into place.

&gt; Its not cost though. That myth was quashed last gen

Nope, it actually is. Because PTS then would have be declared as Beta, and you can't have the same title twice in the store, so beth has to either pay to get it listed under a different name (costs money), or list fo76 a beta (looses them money and the a-listing)...
---
Because they just joined like 1 to 2 mins before it ended and just went afk
---
&gt; Ideally it would only lose durability when a shot hits an enemy so you don‚Äôt lose durability when shooting air like now. 
---
Seems like a really bad way of doing it tbh, how would it make sense to be able to fire say 1000 rounds into the sky with no degredation, but the weapon breaks as soon as there an enemy infront of those first 300 bullets  
---
(values are made up for example sake)
---
You need to get starched genes
---
Multiple times too
---
Last night, I saw it at one of the faction vendors in whitesprings - I don‚Äôt remember which one, but a lot of them shared the same plans, so it might not matter
---
yeah tried that like 3 times idk what's wrong
---
also i tried closing app and restarting it.
---
My daughter says she's hopeful about the game's future now that Microsoft bought Bethesda so... Maybe they'll be back? 
---
And it really is fun!!
---
I am aware of that. What op said was to not kill the night stalker since ghouls will continue to spawn. So not killing the night stalker would add 20 minutes of farming time
---
Thats what happens if you let the toaster manage everything thats left. One bucket of bolts opinion vs. two presidents. Don't get me wrong, making your servants and the cannon fodder tougher and meaner is good, but I want at least a generation worth of tests before we start on the top brass.
---
Schrute Bucks
---
No worries :)
---
You think devs pay to list their game?
---
Got proof of that?
---
Like this dude was ready. It was not an accident.
---
Yeah, that's something we all players need, more stash space or carry weight.  Hope they add something like that soon.
---
That‚Äôs convenient, I was planning on making an above ground bunker next time I made a new camp - now it can be underground, I guess
---
That‚Äôs how it works currently, no? Only difference is that now certain weapons get penalized a lot when they have TS, explosive and/or beam splitter like mods
---
Its a smaller amount of exclusive items so it seems like it doesn‚Äôt rotate as much. It rotates at the same intervals as the atom shop. Op was begging for Christmas  stuff in September is the reference.
---
I got a two-shot one, but yours sounds really good in every other regard
---
I set a vendor up yesterday saying "free scrip" in big neon letters on it last night with everything in for 0 caps and watched the first person come to my camp and take EVERYTHING out of it. I'm not too bothered as I wanted it gone anyway, but thought there would be some sort of courtesy in not being selfish lol. After that I just dropped them at Meat Week for someone to pick up.
---
I put them on my mule until he walks funny.
---
It happens occasionally.  Say a curse word and move on.  Eventually you‚Äôll back up into a fissure and loose much more valuable loot.  It happens.  Sorry for this loss, though.
---
That would be pretty cool üëç
---
is the weapon even any good?  I have the plan but haven't built because I don't see how it is a good weapon (maybe I'm wrong?)
---
Third question: how did it affect your game at all? You mentioned you can solo the Op already, and having another person doesn't affect your prizes, so whether he was there or not, wouldn't your result be the exact same?
---
"Poop break"
---
*We aren‚Äôt the top brass, my colleague.  Just because they slapped a single star on our lapel, it doesn‚Äôt mean much.*
---
*Who are we actually* **commanding**, *General?*
---
I want my power armor to play "Love Train" by the O'Jays and Daryl Hall as soon as I start sprinting, but that's not going to happen either.
---
I can appreciate that idea, very cool.  Makes sense to me.
---
I just noticed it for the first time last night when my 50 cal was reloading with 9 rounds supposedly left.
---
It's a pretty fast gun and has the +25% FFR so I figured maybe it was just the display not keeping up with the actual.
---
Or the score auto complete and daily ops auto complete bugs...
---
I have no idea, but either way i personally think it should just be on a per shot basis, so the durability is just x amount of shots fired before breaking
---
If it would add to team perks like inspirational, and if it is a mutated companion, strange in numbers. This would let me solo on private servers with near optimal stats. I would be a very happy camper :P
---
its amazing this is even in the game.  how does this happen?
---
Grahm sells it. Check it next time the meat event starts.
---
Its right near the bottom and doesnt follow the normal naming pattern. Pretty sure it starts with Ultra-light.
---
D/w I thought it was missing too until I stumbled on it.
---
That's not clear if the 3 bunkers \*at the same time\* is for PTS only or not.   
---
The free material is for pts only tho.
---
But then you have a wendigo running around screaming at everyone and dealing damage. By not completely filling the bar first, you still get to use that full 20 minutes, then near the end you fill the bar, summon and kill the wendigo.
---
Also why cant I use purified water as a boiled water sub? This annoys the shit out of me.
---
Give em away!
---
Sell them to a train station vendor unless you‚Äôre at max caps
---
This is correct
---
awesome! I'll check those spots out. Thanks!
---
I can solo it, but it takes me 14 mins and, it may not ‚Äúruin my experience‚Äù but I just find it scummy like if your not gonna do anything than maybe go to your private server and farm other things for all I care but you can‚Äôt just not do anything and not get hate.
---
Good oppurtunity to trade and see what ppl are carrying.
---
Yeah I totally get that's why they are doing it.  They have stated numerous times that CAMPs/CAMPs budget put a lot of strain on the servers.
---
I agree.  I'm curious if they'll allow vendors in the instanced area(i hope not), more load screens to see someones vendor is not my idea of a good time.
---
You are ignoring the issue of stash space, which is the same, carry weight, containers, stash... It all needs to be loaded: it all takes space and resources from the server.
---
300 extra carry weight means 300 extra stash space. I would take the second, if it was possible.
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs a cave and if we can have multiple vaults I‚Äôll put the caboose underground and build another town. If it‚Äôs not like that then I‚Äôll just make a vault with a caboose somewhere in it
---
yea I just benefit more from meat perks...
---
From my experience it empties but displays a random number while reloading. I‚Äôd watch it go down to 0 but when I start reloading it jumps to a random number
---
Thanks for the explanation, definitely better than they told me. But I think I'll stay away from builds for now, just keeping up with the kid. Just building up the perk cards for fun damage for now.
---
Yeah!
---
My mellee build will finally be able to shine a bit instead of standing around getting shot
---
Or at the very least give us an agility or intelligence boost as with the weight bench/communal fire pit/instruments/beds.
---
What else do you use?
---
Thank you!! Really helpful!
---
Yes! Finally a fun place to get fuel for my flamers!
---
I do hope they increase the XP though, it's a bit low.
---
Yeah that is what I want as well but I doubt it will ever happen. The last actual combat changes we got that I can remember (shotgun changes? durability increases?) were almost a year ago I believe.
---
It's about the same really. My friend showed me it cause he bought the whole season and it's a bit small, but looks cool inside. It could be made slightly bigger as the walls are very thick
---
Sure, but still... level 3000?? Ha!
---
But I'm just saying... levels don't mean anything in 76. Not really. :)
---
Right, I totally get why they are doing it.  I just think it's sad that they have add a load screen to increase camp budget.  I have 76 on an SSD and load screens are still pretty long.
---
It's cool for those who like to build camps, but I have zero interest in underground shelters. I barely look at the existing camps (which, more than often, are completely horribles), don't count on me to waste time to zone into your interiors, and the day you put your vendors underground is the day you won't see the color of my caps...
---
You have to stop and think this is a suggestion Legendary perk. Not a regular perk card but yeah it could be toned down but still have to give someone the incentive to take it. You only get 6 slots and there are good perks out there to choose from.
---
Im sure theyre on the long list of things to be done, dont know how ling that list is or where they sit on it though
---
I do! My gamertag is the same as in here. But I'm not playing right now, my kid is. But I'll playing (she'll be watching me this time, ha!) in a few hours.
---
But does your jetpack add an additional +20 carry weight ?
---
Maybe if they made it so simultaneous hits only count as a single hit to durability. I think that would fix it.
---
There‚Äôs a spot near Top of the World that reliably has three squirrels. From the FT point, turn right and head in the direction of the tower, but bear a little left.  That‚Äôs off the top of my head, but it‚Äôs in that area.
---
glowing meat for the increased melee dmg and stuff like deathclaw meat for str...I'm a melee build...
---
well theirs the weed whacker knowns as the mr buzzzy blade
---
I hated it when they patched out the Excavator PA 200 carry weight.
---
I'm not arguing, they put about pvp that I put about nuclear winter. As maybe they weren't aware. All he had to say was I know and I dont like it. Instead he went straight to insults that why I left it after the second comment. I'm all for talking/debating different views on the game ect but soon as someone goes straight to insults I leave it because that not why I join reddit for is to get insulted or insult people.
---
The paid ones only repair 100% where the on game reward o es (free) repair to 150% and the workbench can repair to 200%. Period ü§£
---
Having played the Ops myself, I'm not sure I'd ever notice someone not being there AFK.
---
Sell them to vendors. Then drop them when I run out of caps. Unless they weigh under a pound. Then I keep them.
---
I would like this, preset camps so that you can switch to whichever one you want (I dont know how vending machines would work with it though)
---
Same here for the pumpkins at the pumpkin house for that daily.
---
awesome. Thanks!!!
---
I only started using the improved ones because they started weighting me down.
---
Well everyone has a different experience I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs pretty low if your a lvl 220 and yet you  rely on lower level players.
---
As far as I know Bethesda havent increased the CAMP size or Budget since Launch.
---
Thanks! Is your gamertag the same as in here? Mine is!
---
Love the 200%, but I've switched to using the repair kits all the time because they weigh so much in my inventory and I just want to get rid of them.
---
I'm assuming for aesthetic purposes, there's a few patches across the road from the pumpkin house, I can easily get around 150 pumpkins with the green thumb.
---
I doubt they thought that far ahead. You‚Äôll probably have to access all of them separately from the main camp.
---
I mean, I guess if one of the "units" was a cave with a high ceiling that makes sense.  I really didn't think we'd be able to put any of the pre-fabs like the Red Rocket Garage, Cabin, etc. in the instanced area.  Guess we'll have to see.
---
That would be cool if they had a cave, basement, vault, etc.  Kinda like the DLC in FO4.
---
Assuming that's what was going on
---
The post box at Whitespring Station as its closest to the stash box and the cash register at the Rusty Pick next to Murmghr
---
I added you. I'm online now
---
Such a cool combo. üôÄ
---
You can always buy the plain black backpack from the atom store. I think it is the secret service one.
---
What kind of damage numbers are we talking about?
---
I'm currently level 241... playing since beta with a small break in between... about 1000 hours give or take. Just recently I started paying attention to levels because of the Seasons dailies. Before that, not at all. 
---
But, I also didn't need to really adjust my build all that much.. maybe because I played Fallout before 76? Or I was lucky? Whatever. 
---
Totally understand needing the levels to adjust perks, I'm just saying that focusing on that number seems silly to me because it really is meaningless in 76.
---
What‚Äôre you hours like? I‚Äôm in Hawaii. I‚Äôm usually on late by stateside time.
---
I had an early visit from santa claus. Came to my camp and went into a room I wasn't in and dropped 60 large gifts, 90 purified water, and 30 chicken noodle soups.
---
big yikes
---
True, they can also be useful in back to back boss fights or if you forget to repair before doing a silo run too.
---
Kinda wish they dropped the weight on them, but than Id likely just hoard more.
---
Well I'm sure you know about the basic cards that increase damage based on weapon type by now. A few you'll likely miss are Glow sight a 3 rank perception card that gives 60% bonus damage to glowing targets. Explosives expert a 5 rank intelligence card that gives bonus damage to explosives (this one is significant if you get a legendary with explosive rounds. It just boosts the damage for every shot for those.) Adrenaline a 5 rank agility perk that builds up %bonus damage per each kill for a limited time frame. And bloody mess a 3 rank luck card that adds 15% damage to absolutely anything. Yes just all of it. Because haha? 
---
I'm just happy to hear people say they're playing with their kids. I don't want you to feel lost and give up. So I'm doing what I can to arm you with information and possibly even show them something they didn't already know. That would surely give them a shock.
---
It might have something to do with flux farming. People plant that stuff in their camps in mass, then nuke themselves to farm it. Server hop, then repeat.
---
But im trying to save some atoms lol i got 1.5k now without buying any
---
You do not get the full extra 20 minutes though. If you don't fill the bar after 10 minutes you fail the event.
---
Use to be you could wait untill the end of the full 30 minutes to finish the bar. But that was changed with WL
---
I doubt it‚Äôll be that big but I hope it‚Äôs maybe somewhat comparable
---
Now make her run your dailies as part of her chores
---
You fool. It‚Äôs clearly a warning!
---
I already did that. She made me an account, so we can play in different consoles-- if we ever buy another one. üòÇ
---
Ok it just seems like a lot I didn‚Äôt have this issue before maybe once and a awhile it would happen and that‚Äôs fine but this just sucks so bad when your doing something
---
Do you know how I unlock the mods for it?
---
I use improved repair kits 99% of the time. I agree that they shouldn't sell the crappy ones in the Atom Shop but who would buy those. I sit on anywhere from 30 to 100 of the improved ones from the Queen  drops. The only reason I'm down to 30 is because of Earl and Meat Week. Starting to fire back non stop Queen rus after Meat Week.
---
Excellent! Once I get hold of a handful of pure cobalt flux to make this with, you'll be seeing my friend request sent your way! I am working on finding some right now, but Uhhh...nobody is doing nuke launches TwT 
---
I am gonna figure all that out on my end, it's the only ingredient that I need to make this vault suit. But I will get it done! 
---
(If anybody else reading this wants to make this super easy and sell me some cobalt flux they already have, that would work too!)
---
I‚Äôm not assuming, while we were doing it we literally saw him sitting there afk.
---
I am extremely careless and WILL walk into a rad shower accidentally if I remove Starched Genes.
---
It is too much of a gamble, I would rather do something safer like drink from a punch bowl that has lots of marquee arrows pointing to it.
---
I mean, I do actually like the Confederate uniform with it, I think it looks cool.  Obviously I don't condone the Confederacy.
---
Good call, maybe 3 different sizes is to test the PTS limits and then pick the best one that performed. I can‚Äôt see having 3 separate ones for each player once it goes live.
---
I feel like the only time I ever use throwable explosives is on ghouls, cuz you can lead them around and get them in a big group
---
I am afraid that is exactly why the fridge is only 50%.
---
If you want "elite refrigeration" you have to pay the price with perks (which I do because I enjoy my 10+, herbivore boosted, bonuses). ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If I haven‚Äôt sold 1,400 caps worth of junk to the robot vendor I usually give him my legendary weapons and armor. 
---
Unless my gf hasn‚Äôt reached her daily script yet, I give her some. 
---
I usually hang onto the armor that‚Äôs weightless so I have stuff to scrap the next day without being over encumbered
---
I'm sorry... I have to....
---
Laughs in Runescape.
---
 I was replying to what the previous person said...and if there was an substance to the thought. I was under the impression that the 3 levels were added together  since we unlock them all at once if we do elder. Thats all. To me that should be level 1 rewards plus level 2 rewards plus level 3 rewards. Personally I think it should be a 100% chance for 1 rare plan if you get the elder completion much like others who have the same thing.
---
Sure is!
---
Espescally in interior locations.
---
Have this problem when I've been logging in with a quad db shotgun, says "missing required ammo" and I have to switch to another gun and switch back.
---
Where are my pumpkins, Bethesda?? I need some silt beans too for all that Appalachili I'm always making
---
Yes on goes the struggle and even if I bitch about the game I like it to much to quit playing for long
---
What happens when you're in power armor? Do you not die? Are you able to fast travel out?
---
Absolutely this, and with 3 charisma you can share and make everyone a bit stronger.
---
Ah, yeah, I might‚Äôve misunderstood. If we‚Äôre talking about grinding exp just for the obsession over what number level you are then yeah, I can‚Äôt entirely understand it either. 
---
I will say - I did play previous fallout games as well but... idk, never actually put lots of deep thoughts into what I selected. Always just went with a ‚Äúooh that seems nice.‚Äù And slowly started to realize... yeah, that doesn‚Äôt entirely work üòÇüòÇ
---
My camp is a simple thing. A red rocket station as my shop and a two floor, 2 by 3 building. The bottom floor is a museum and the top is for all your crafting needs. I like it when i'm at my camp and i see a random player take the time to have a look at my museum's collection. Sometimes if i come across some of the rare items i have on display i'll sell them so other people can have one of the rare items.
---
Me too. It's my favorite. Lol...
---
Because if they did drop cores we would have a ridiculous number of them at the end of the op compared to what we used. Op rewards enough at the end to usually compensate for the cores used.
---
I really hope OP responds to someone here. It makes me so angry to know some people think you need to spend atoms to repair gear.
---
From sneak you can alpha someone at level    if not sneak.   Prolly 1/4 healthbar a hit
---
Ultra light armor for the secret service is already out. I have them equipped on everything except my chest piece (because of the jet pack)
---
The guy at the vault has the plans, obviously pay with gold. But it‚Äôs listed under ultralight secret service limbs.
---
Whenever you see someone much above 1500, just read the number as " I cheat" and your'e good :-)
---
Ueah Mischief Night event that happend last year was a good concept but was flawed due to Server Not Respinding, Bluescreens (PS4), -1 fps, etc.
---
Launch a nuke on Morgantown especially southern part to get easy cobalt and fluids and mass
---
Based on the name, was thinking it would be something like running into enemies damages them, the more weight, the more damage.
---
I mean 100lbs would be more desired but who knows what‚Äôs going happen with Microsoft taking over eventually
---
Now question, did you unlock it in the scoreboard but forgot to claim it? Because a lot of posts like the one you did are usually because of that. They unlocked it but never claimed it. 
---
I don‚Äôt remember which faction sells it for gold now, but it‚Äôs worth checking out. If the plan for it says ‚Äúknown‚Äù then it must be a bug and you should I contact support. 
---
But if it doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúknown‚Äù then it means you don‚Äôt know the plan for it.
---
I'm level 429 and 1.2k hours in
---
28 is not really that much, I used to run with a hundred or so. Retextures mostly ofc.
---
I theres already a perk in for that. I think its called Tank Killer.
---
yes beacouse it was really weird when I removed the 2 pieces of armor so I made sure to stash everything besides my shotgun and a camera
---
Yeah i used to have loads just not on this game, since the mods cant actually add anything new
---
What I'm really hoping for is a cat. Random finds could be rough, I don't see too many cats hanging around the places I go.
---
move some to mules, sell rest to vendor bots
---
Any change from them isnt going to happen for at least 2 years from now. The deal is announced but not approved by the Government.
---
I agree with this, but I have a better idea, get rid of those crappy daily limits (gold and scripts at least) and we are all happy because we can progress as we want not when the game wants. üëç
---
If they want to add a limit I prefer a cap of 500 daily scripts to spend on the rusty pick and there's no need for a daily/total limit for Gold bullion as all it's items are untradeable.
---
The only con I see is that people won't sell their weapons/armor, but like 80% of those legendaries you find in vendors are not good stuff, overpriced or both.  So, I prefer Beth to remove the daily limits.
---
*thumbs up emote*
---
*Heart emote*
---
Thank you! My kid and I would sure love to play with other girls! My gamertag is the same as in here, and my kid gamertag is DaniCoelho93.
---
&gt;  We‚Äôre also going to remove material requirements in the PTS, **so that you can let your inner interior designer run wild** without needing to spend time hunting for components.
---
Well, that's nice but, for numerous players 80% of our decorations are from the Atomic shop (which is unavailable in PTS), or locked behind plans we didn't unlock on our main character. If they truly wanted us to go wild with this feature they would remove these restrictions altogether during the test.
---
That said, it's something I look forward a lot.
---
You won‚Äôt die in PA. I usually wear two pieces of fall damage reduced armor to negate fall damage entirely since I build a lot of underground camps and use the SS Jetpack to fly clear across the map.
---
What‚Äôs the exchange rate?
---
I've got a junkies with vats hit chance. Works well.
---
I think the nature of the event (blowing up lots of cars) means that the issue is not really fixable.
---
I'll send you a message on Xbox so you know it's me! I'll be online later tonight.
---
I have this issue but there's a few ways around it:
---
- Swap weapons to cancel the reload animation
---
- Quick-sprint to cancel reload animation
---
- Holster / draw weapon to cancel animation
---
Still annoying af, but not as annoying as having 17 cores at 3% charge littering your inventory.
---
Alright, just respond to this when you‚Äôre on and I‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm on too.
---
There is, pain train while wearing PA.
---
Was thinking this would be an enhancement of that, and scaling damage with more weight.
---
Anyways, it's what I though of when I saw the name he was using.
---
I have plans to carve pumpkins from last year‚Äôs event
---
I know many peoples builds were ruined by the recent changes. This is a great opportunity to change from a rifle build to say commando or heavy gunner. Or like im interested in a smooth transition from a PA build to regular armor. Thats lots of perk cards and moving points. Even if your happy with your current set up having a stash of point changes for future shake ups is advantageous. Or use the cards to rank up legendary perks.
---
Items in Stash dont get debuffs from perks hence why stash fills quickly.
---
Like someone else said the Inventroy systen needs a reclass.
---
Why does a Handmade rifle weigh more than a 50 cal machine gun?
---
Yeah, nah, I definitely want that now.
---
Ok! ‚ù§
---
This works for the start but as soon as you do a score challenge they will loop again
---
What size the largest one is, is what is the most important thing to know as well as the way to obtain it. 
---
Cause without any detail, large can be anyting from the mole rat cave under RRTS to Vault 88 and cost my arm.
---
If it's one of the Tesla made solar panels, it has the added benefit of catching on fire randomly. So even at night, you can get some light from the fire.
---
Thats the one I was talking about.
---
Oooph dangit I'm on PS4 =(
---
The Peace Keepers are on every system though.
---
We don‚Äôt talk about the Mr. Handy Buzz Blade.
---
This happened to me once. I had to log off and back on to fix.
---
Pets that follow you but don't affect gameplay like ESO would be nice.
---
Delightfully wholesome!
---
Vaguely reminds me of Borderlands 3. No thanks üòÇ
---
It's just rng
---
You can just use a friends server. Safer anyway if someone else there in case of disconnect
---
I love finding CAMPS like that. I came across one the was 2 Red Rocket stations next to each other with a platform built between that led to the roofs. On the roofs were the vendor machines and a truly amazing display of "junk". The builder had made  it look like a hoarders paradise. Inside the right one were crafting stations and more junk. Littered throughout it all were displays of rare finds. I never found out what was in the left side, as I was too low level to pick the lock. It's CAMPS like that which inspire me to create themes when I build new CAMPS.
---
dogmeat wasn't very smart though (i mostly remember him from 3 admittedly)...I liked the way the dog from fable 2 acted...helping you find treasure, being customizable, actually semi-competent in battle. oh man, imagine a companion that can sniff out specific ingredients/components and interact with other players' companions. Then we could have people mod it and make them fight like pokemon
---
Riley's Secret Sauce is my magic/bash damage minigun. 
---
Secret Sauce Jr. is my magic/limb damage minigun.
---
I dig it
---
Or sits on the car sniping all the ghouls before they can get into the building.
---
Then they act indignant when the 5 other people at the Event get pissed and body-block them.
---
Not gonna lie, I really hate Bloodied Sneak Snipers. You contribute nothing to groups, sponge all the XP, and die anytime there's a boss or Mirelurk King.
---
Forgot about that, good call.
---
That's why you find people like me that'll gladly let you come in my private world and do whatever you gotta do. üëç
---
Yep. Skipping daily op.
---
We're getting a green house on this score. Make them growable in it
---
How is that RNG? 9 times in a row no elder rewards?
---
u/GamerMom1969 you aren‚Äôt alone
---
Ohhh, too bad. But thanks tho! ‚ù§
---
Seems you put all your points into charisma
---
I don't think they will raise the budget for exterior camp anymore.
---
I feel the budget is already too high, from a performance point of view. The server lag is an issue near big camp.
---
woohoo :)
---
Just the thing my kid told me not to do! üòÇ
---
Welcome to the Gamer Mom clan :D
---
Definitely will! So much work... üòÇ
---
I still have not did my first nuke :(
---
Works for ESO, why not 76? ESO's player to player trade menu would also be great.
---
But that's scrip that weights partially nothing.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I play with both of my parents every Saturday morning. My dad is 65 and my mom is 62 ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
---
Dear God, please let them add group select and remove the ridiculous placement restrictions in these instance things.
---
Nice idea. +2 agility for Foosball, +2 perception for the shooting gallery.
---
She's actually sad about her cat dying because a mole rat killed it. If that has any impact on your sympathy level : )
---
Oh, that might be another interesting detail: my gauss shotgun is a quad, too. I haven't had something like that with my quad shotgun I used some time ago.
---
I drop at least 3000 script worth of them a day. Sometimes around low lvls. Sometimes out in the middle of nowhere. If its a one off or good weapon I will chase down a low lvl but if I did that all the time I'd never get to play the game. I stopped selling and took out my vending a year ago.  Tired of messing with it and just need to dump weight when I need to dump weight. So many other ways to make caps that don't require vending. Max caps is more of a problem than a good thing. I float between 6,000 to 20,000 durring the week. If I wanted to I could sit at max like I use to. But why? I could understand newer players wanting it but I am lvl. 540 with the only gun I want and nice armor.
---
That one's gonna be rough lol but you can do it! Hopping servers will serve you best and maybe hit up locations in the Forest for them!
---
Exceed?   Ur gonna have to give an example.
---
With the amount of comments you leave I‚Äôm surprised you respond to every post and comment in at most 5 minutes
---
Edit: I changed at least to at most
---
I say give us unlimited scrip when selling and you could up the price of the vendor items by 5-10x and I would still be happy.
---
Yeah, cheating and exploiting makes things easy.
---
Just manage your weight. When I use power armor I switch to my heavy gun build and use traveling pharmacy and thru hiker to manage my carry weight. The only thing I‚Äôd kinda like is a perk card to minimize all weapons weight, not just heavy or pistols.
---
I had that "required missing ammo" once, too. But it also did not work without such message a few times.
---
i have been on this lvl 100 mole rat meme far too long and thats only three days
---
Once you get all the drops, there isn't much incentive to fight him.
---
Yea, you're guaranteed a 3 star, but it's faster and easier to just run ops for a chance at a decent legendary.
---
However does it work for lasers too if you have a beam splitter? Or the guass shotty?
---
haha that‚Äôs why many think i‚Äôm a bot xD great compliment tho!
---
Thank you so much! Sure is super helpful! ‚ù§
---
They had these in FO4 creation club as I recall.  Can‚Äôt believe we still haven‚Äôt seen them yet!
---
Depends on how you want to play the game, if you want to play the game in groups and be the medic than invest in charisma, but if you wanna kill and kill only then don‚Äôt like I did, I have 10 endurance and perception....
---
How about a perk that highlights where you can find stuff to mine.    Like inside of lucky hole mine.    Make the lead veins glow or something.
---
Do you mean rare rewards in general or specifically the new stuff
---
Well anything for the elder reward, it‚Äôs said none 9 times in a row
---
This seems like a good reason to do so.
---
Well hopefully you got it sorted out
---
If you were a bot you‚Äôd have to be a future type of AI with the ability to answer posts and comments with a response that is relevant and a human response, so that‚Äôs surprising that people actually believe that
---
Never played that game tbh. I am/was (bf Fo76 full time job with season 1) a Path Of Exile player.
---
By elder you mean "rare" tab, right?
---
They are coming. And for power armor
---
Right!? Seems like a no brainer, they keep putting out these items that have animations but aren‚Äôt exactly usable. I‚Äôd love to have real usable items
---
Been experiencing that issue with Ultracite ore. Glowing green on approach then as soon as I'm near poof gone. So disappointing üòû
---
I do agree with you, yet I‚Äôve almost come to the point where caps don‚Äôt really matter much. I think I‚Äôve got almost all the common plans that I can purchase either from players or robo vendors except the serum plans. Most weapons and armour that I‚Äôm looking for would be considered trade only because caps have no meaning to high lvl players. I‚Äôm having a tough time finding useful stuff to buy and sell, lately the only reason I have to spend caps is I‚Äôm approaching the limit. If they increased the limit or took it away completely I would just hoard caps and end up making a Scrooge McDuck type vault to store them.
---
That's incredible! It's so nice to enjoy some quality time together! ‚ù§
---
What‚Äôs the mutation?
---
You didn't post what bug you are referring to.
---
Thanks for the reply.  Yeah, I had read this but the level of enemies just seemed higher than mine is in terms of averaging or enhancing combat models.  I don't know if they are programmed individually to match your level, but when you are dealing with nine or ten lvl 90 Scorchted it just gets a little old having to always be in power armor and running through fifteen Stimpacks.  Seven Anglers lvl 60 is just impossible.
---
It's great seeing the effort people put into having a clever camp design. There's been plenty of times I visit a random camp to buy something for a challenge and have to stop and say "oh, wow! look how cool this is!" to my SO and do a tour of the place. 
---
I should make more of an effort to reach out to the owners, though! Really cool that you had a positive interaction like that.
---
Happened to me at Watoga Highschool.    A part of the floor was missing in the map.   I could jump into it and I would fall out of the map and land back right next to the hole.   Kinda like in the game Portal.   
---
Weird thing is that the hole only appeared for me and not for my brother who was paying at the same time.
---
Lol. Didn't have any Yao Guai meat.
---
i like that, i could legendize that by having a leggyperk that generates up to X special chems per hour that let you use berry mentats vision for anything ore? basically see any ore anywhere for up to 10 minutes but if you have like five generating oer hour that‚Äôs cool right? bonus points if they distinguish the different ores with different colors?
---
Some wild flowers would be nice too.
---
Honestly I think people aren't really bothered with this meat week. Think they got all the rewards a couple of weeks ago and can't be bothered doing it again. They'll either afk it or just not do it at all. Had quite a few already that have failed through noone actually doing it.
---
Later tonight I will be on I‚Äôll give you what you need gt is kingsites12
---
Yeah that‚Äôll happen in games. Had it happen to me. I made sure I failed all the tiers. Then left abc started over. Got the caged lights, which were one of the things I had a lot of interest in getting.
---
Wow. I know that I will have a lot of perception and agility, since I want to use rifles. But I don't know about being a medic, I die so much! üòÇ
---
I sell the ones worth any sort of caps to a vendor and store the rest. Though soon I'll run out of room for that, so I'll probably just sell until I hit the cap limit then throw away the rest.
---
afk multiple times??
---
in 2 minutes?
---
If they allowed that, you realize they'd change the recipe.  There's a method to the madness.
---
Lmao - people fell for that trap? Buying repair kits &gt;.&lt;
---
Do not encourage Bethesda to release Perk Cards as a bug fix for the fact they still haven't addressed energy weapons. The issue is that DR isn't calculated properly for them. This has been a known and well-documented issue since Fallout 4, but they still haven't fixed it.
---
Not only do they do vastly less damage compared to ballistics, but they also break at least twice as fast as well.
---
I hate it. I love energy weapons, and I use them in game, but it bugs me that I'm knowingly playing with a handicap because Beth has no idea how to balance the combat of their games.
---
It seems that the trade-off they want between Ballistic vs Energy is Damage Per Shot vs Damage Per Second. If they just fixed the way DR works w/ energy weapons, and address the ridiculous durability discrepancy, then this would be awesome.
---
Cool ty
---
so like lead would be bright white since its the most important ore imo, so like that plus blue for crystal, orange for copper, i mean referencing the resource deposit map would cut their work in half on that, somebody has one color coded around here some where
---
Seems like an easy day.
---
What level are you
---
Thank you this is helpful, I took me like 150 lvls to get my main, bloodied heavy PA, where I wanted it with the R&amp;D I did for it and want fast track this character
---
Yup same here, energy weapons with high rate of fire are almost unusable right now, it breaks way too quickly, they have to address that, it‚Äôs becoming annoying
---
Theres no real point to this post, just figured id share haha
---
Resilient sucks, but it does reinforce the mechanic of the daily op: stand in the fucking circle.
---
It's not about the reward, it's about the experience of a challenging mode, isn't that enough for you? /s
---
very good reason :) but i always feel like i never have enough ammo LOL
---
Well as long as you helped finish the event. Twice now since it started back up I had the event fail. Both times I was just joining server and jumped in with only 1 minute left and bar was going down. So either everyone was killing critters or what but i never had the event fail last time. I mean I guess I truly don‚Äôt care as I have every reward but salty mod for tendy and tato salad recipe
---
Now I now what to do with all the wendigo and molerat teeth, open the Wasteland' first dentist office.üòÅ
---
Yo mate, no need to advertise if you go afk when in a DO-group. Just use one of those groups that have the same kind of player you seem to be.
---
Ah, good to hear. I was afraid she had given you one of her saves, and that would have been troublesome down the line.
---
500 scrip for 5, 2000 caps for 5, 2500 bullion for 5, and due to a bug, 1 steel for 50 with the cap on how much steel you can sell.
---
Carry some toxic goo with you, and it'll just be a passing annoyance instead of potentially crippling.
---
round what time ? i'm eastern time zone
---
Weren't there leaked files for dog emotes?
---
I know a legit player whos at 2,900 so its certainly possible
---
656 on my main and above 50 on the other 2
---
maxed out Blocker in Str.
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Also I do need to do some R&amp;D with what I want to be addicted to
---
I‚Äôm also eastern time zone so around 6 pm I‚Äôll message if it changes. Hopefully wife lets me jump on quick
---
If you've never done so before, the best advice I can give you is to hack all the terminals and turn off as much security as you can. It'll make a HUGE difference.
---
&gt;  and the day you put your vendors underground is the day you won't see the color of my caps...
---
I immediately thought of this when i read it, and i completely agree.
---
I hope people wont be doing this, if i go to a camp (even now), Im here to check the stuff quick and bail to the next thing.
---
 So if the machines are not within 15sec from me from the moment i spawn, im outta there. 
---
I'm gonna make a point to not spend caps if they don't value potential buyer convenience.
---
 Im not here to visit camps for the sake of it.
---
I had just gotten away from a melee barely surviving and ran into three level 100 wolves and a mess of lvl 60 mole rats which just seemed insane.  I'm fine with them upping the levels of enemies but at lvl 100 (now 103) possibly varying some of them would be at least survivable since they seem to also be in greater numbers.  Totally noticed greater bonuses for beating them down, but it just takes away some of the game's old joy of being able to pick and choose the level of conflict instead of everywhere becoming so intensified.
---
They won't because everyone would hide the ugly standard backpack and not spend atoms to buy a better looking one.
---
i can give it to you now if you want
---
Honestly, in these cases, just take cover and keep sticking yourself. You don't technically have to kill them.
---
 It should come with free  lunch boxes, repair kits, healing, larger camp budgets, and an even larger inventory space.
---
It's either horrible rng or a glitch, idk.  But other people have been getting them fine.
---
Sad
---
Oh no... I-is it back?
---
If you just adjust your build to tank you don't even need to kill anything other than the boss. Of you put ricochet on, put on a set of PA and hold a Vampire weapon you're basically invincible.
---
She did it on selfish reasons, didn't want to share her itens. Said I need to learn the hard way--- who says that to their mom? üòÇüòÇ
---
I have a vendor labeled as Weapons Storage where I keep all my 3stars I'm going to scrip. I sell them for 800caps a piece (20c per scrip).
---
I manage to sell one every once and a while, but it's mainly to help keep my STASH organized.
---
It didnt help that apparently they turned the robot spawns up to 11 today. I had to fight through 7 robots just to get in the room to repair the booster
---
Then why do you leave the area of the booster? You don't need to kill the enemies to progress the ops. Killing the enemies just spawns more. Use a vampires weapon just to survive, while hiding behind objects to LoS them and make them come to you. Only enemies you need to kill are at the end after signal boosters.
---
Just soloed the event as elder without any issues with a commando build using vampire weapon, no power armor.
---
Daily Ops is the new end game content that is not supposed to be easy (but it is). You just need to adjust your perks and items to different situations.
---
I use unarnoued weapons and mine are breaking WAY quicker also. I always thought it had something to do with the higher level enemies after the patch ü§î
---
I have been getting them fine before this but to not get a reward 9 times in a row is a little unlikely, I was looking around and people say it‚Äôs a glitch
---
My weapons break quickly, even with weapon artisan.  Last week I ran low on adhesive (which never happens) because I was repairing so often.  I just went around to the train station vendors and bought them all out.
---
Great, so I'm not special :) Armor too. I had over 200 improved repair kits for a year that never dipped below 200. Now I'm at 175 in just a few weeks.
---
Personally, I don't want or need a companion pet. I'd be fine with one who stays at my camp and can't be killed by assholes, though.
---
Dogmeat in FO4 was cool but I was constantly annoyed with him being in the way all the time. Eventually built him a nice and sheltered place in Sanctuary to have a home to live and protect and, of course, to be petted when I returned from murdering everything. Never found out if he barked at the old drug addict but I guess he and Codsworth (naturally with a bowler) got along great.
---
If Bethesda gives us companion pets I'll be the last to complain but, please, allow us to tell them to stay home and protect our camps.
---
Resilient
---
Grab some PA and throw on electric absorbtion and just sit there. This is one of the easier ones I thought, even if I fell low eneough, born survivor heals me, I was on my phone for most of it.
---
that would be cool 
---
my gamer tag is CaptSlapNuTzs
---
It‚Äôs not even hard, I complete it under 7 mins solo every time no matter the mutation
---
Well the bug is that I haven‚Äôt got a reward 9 times in a row on each reset on multiple characters
---
You don't have to fight them, just run past.
---
Yeah, yeah...   one word...  autocorrect....
---
Or the weight bench.
---
I was recently doing the quest line for the space lady, and she would always be at random spots on the map. Just non stop running like Forest Gump.
---
I'd get close to her location and then she'd teleport to me. She didn't stay permanently at my camp until I was done with her quests.
---
My comment was sarcasm.
---
Pets are coming at some point. They'll probably just be for your camp though.
---
I'm not sure I understand what happened here. You were doing a Daily Op during the time the Daily Ops reset, and when you were finished the Daily Challenge to do a Daily Op was marked as completed, but you didn't receive SCORE for it?
---
Welcome to the community! üòÅ
---
You guys chose the right game to do it in! This community is one of the best!
---
they made it sound like we‚Äôre gonna be able to have more then one at a time.
---
You are right, I love the Electric Absorption perk as it charges my core. And the ammo drop is phenomenal in thw dailies.üòÄüòé
---
It really is way too quick now tho. Mark it as #5,635 things to fix.
---
Lusty Assaultron Maid
---
your gamer tag ?
---
I love your thinking
---
can you join me? Just aboot to start cookout. Gt: rammadeus. my camp is near top of the world. either join now or after the event
---
It's just way too quick now.
---
Seen this misconception everywhere. You don't reload when your gun is half-full. It half-refills your gun as soon as you hit zero. It's been an issue since wastelanders, the game gets confused when you give commands to shoot while the gun is empty. Very rarely, this lets you do things like shoot black powder weapons multiple times in a row without reloading.
---
This is separate from gatling lasers/plasmas equipping multiple cores, leaving them nearly drained, and displaying the wrong ammo count. That's been a separate issue since launch
---
i‚Äôve been a medic commando with empath.  They fixed empath with class freak so i no longer get 1 shot be everything.  
---
I switched to an unyielding suppressor to try to farm xp.
---
Ha! That's so easy to do though! 
---
Plus in 4... you could eventually have allllll the perks! lol
---
Wendingo teeth have acid.
---
All I can imagine is the squishy players at workshops that would have  1500 lbs of junk!
---
I completely forgot about the Ripper. I don't think enemies even drop them.
---
I wouldn't mind if we could swap them out freely. For had a mod similar to this, and you could always swap out doors
---
True.
---
A great source for Screws and Acid though, if you need those.  Also, the constant influx of Wendigo Spawns can yield good XP.  Remember to stick around after you kill Earle and loot, instead of escaping.  There is *no* reason to escape.  Being in the mine during collapse doesn't count as a death, and you'll spawn outside with all of the junk you looted (although make sure you where PA or something with Rad Resist, because you will likely spawn into a Nuke Zone).
---
Not a bug. Shitty luck.
---
trying now :)
---
Don't go to workshops
---
Don't worry about modding weapons early on
---
Don't feed the Yao Guai
---
I haven't been getting two-shotted by them thank goodness, but I have had one or two Legendaries disappear into the ground like you mentioned. Just dogs and wolves, weirdly enough, everything else seems to not get swallowed up by the earth.
---
I will use my legit drop magic minigun and refuse to feel bad about it.
---
I will,on the other hand, also refrain from bitching if they ever fix this 'exploit'.
---
I'm... Cautiously hyped. I have PLANS‚Ñ¢ to turn my two-foundation mineshaft into an entire Lucky Hole, buuut I don't know if I'm overestimating how unrestricted it'll be and they might need to lighten up on walls clipping into terrain (y'know, so I can place the door) first. We'll see.
---
You should reconsider, some of the most impressive camps I have ever seen have been console player camps.
---
The daily ops only resets for me after about an hour after challenges reset.
---
I know this. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt always work. Especially at camp. If if wandering around the wasteland with a bunch of junk, I am more likely to do repairs at a random work bench. Once I get back to camp, it‚Äôs 60/40 that I may be able to do a repair. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a bug I haven‚Äôt gathered enough material,....
---
keeps kicking me from your server :(
---
It will likely have an extra loading screen either way so trap door, regular door or interdimensional portal, it doesn't change anything.
---
Im personally thinking they'll reuse one of these: the cellar doors, sewer covers or regular trap doors.
---
 But I can farm that elsewhere and I'd feel like a dick just going after the wendigos because I'm not wasting all that ammo on Earle once I get more one meat pile plan.
---
No, I did the daily ops that I already had got an award for, was just repeating it to help out a teammate. When I came out the new one had been updated and auto completed for the rewards so I can‚Äôt try for rewards today.
---
I can still get the score, but I care more about the rewards
---
So much nope
---
Then you won‚Äôt like doing silos being you die you start all the way back in elevator. It‚Äôs always been like this and they won‚Äôt change it
---
They definitely wear "quicker" due to increased usage. Condition is already a bit of an annoying gimmick to start with, now it is approaching just a gameplay annoyance.
---
They've already mentioned they'll be removing the negative effects of being hungry/thristy; may as well significantly buff weapon condition across the board or implement a mobile solution that uses junk instead of the kits if we're moving towards a more survival-lite-lite type gameplay.
---
It's to control imthe amount of caps on the market. If you could store infinite caps, then dupers would quickly inflate the market. I don't like it either, but that is why
---
Well, there is always demand for custom dental implants üòéüòè.. why stop at vampire fangs if you can have wendigo teeth?üòÅ
---
I heard the respawn uses the same type of list that the loot does and you have to push that area off the list by either harvesting junk from places or picking more plants elsewhere. So if you add more brain fungus locations to your list it may make it not a issue anymore for you.
---
Bait and switch is the type of scam, its still a scam. I get what your saying about the fallout 1st, the point I was making is it doesn't give you an advantage in game like its being made out. Plus fo76 isn't the first game to charge for private servers.
---
Why? It‚Äôs just normal lenses. It‚Äôs not power armor hud eye displays.
---
As others have mentioned, why leave the area.  There is no reward for hunting down the spawns if you are doing it for the rewards.
---
If you are a melee character and are getting shot, then you'll need to switch it up and use guns.  Heavy guns uses the same SPECIAL categories as Melee, so get a 50 cal and go to town.
---
ok here
---
Support is actually very easy, I always get my atoms back no matter the circumstance. Also, that would be kind of OP would it not, if it just effected all stash food items?
---
Drop them or sell them to vendor bots. If I‚Äôm at max caps I‚Äôll buy lead or steel and then sell the legendaries
---
It's about teamwork. 1 shoots it to 1% and another finishes it off. To me it's a great teambuilding event. I do have to admit that the Galleria is a bit too open and robots snipe from afar. But with a team they will target the melee-er.
---
you're shooting more in 1Wasteland..
---
My fashion choices are my own business, thank you
---
Ah, well she wouldn't have had to share her items if you used a separate character (each account can make five characters) but this is the better way anyways. This way you could potentially play together someday.
---
They said they would look into making F1st relevant for future seasons when S1 launched.
---
We're already a few weeks in S2 with none of that.
---
What about the 2k jet pack?
---
I am not sure, if Bethesda is making a mistake by just doing modifications for mid-game users. There have been also lots of complains from end game players as well. I had lots of trouble to do the meat week events now, too, because I wasn't able to focus on the level 100 Behemoth, because there were lots of other high level enemies popping up all around me. Lots of molerats, too.
---
I still think that it's okay to level up some enemies for the end game players, but maybe this has too be a tweaked a bit more and does not work in such general increments.
---
I did this for ones I didn‚Äôt wanna get rid of and now I have 4 alts between levels 2 and 10 with 800 stash and almost 1000 weight on them. I gotta start getting rid of shit. I‚Äôm to much of a hoarder
---
Which ones out of curiosity?
---
like if you can do something with caps these days.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs poor sarcasm or ignorance
---
I find myself visiting West Tek just to charge my fusion core.
---
Yeah. I pretty have a list of all the perks I‚Äôm gonna use thanks to Nukes and Dragons. Now I just have to unlock them as I level up
---
Yes I understand that part and I'm not sure why people are downvoting, when there are 7 in that tiny room they tend to bump you before the repair animation finishes.
---
Even though fire rate isn't as effective, I still prefer it over dwa since sometimes I hip fire or vats, if am fighting a big monster am hip firing and kiting them. For me it would be b2525. I have b1025 it's amazing paired with grim reaper sprint for a vats build
---
*Also please fix the floating rule. Its very flawed. If it's green then that means it can be placed, so stop denying me placement of objects. Its not floating if its on the ground and snapped to an existing floor piece.*
---
Holy shit this so much. I was building a new camp last night, and kept having this issue pop up while building over the silver camper thing (from atom shop). I found throwing pillars in helped for some, but others would refuse even when green and snapped.
---
Speaking of that camper thing, the mesh inside is fucked. Placing things on some of the walls makes the item clip halfway through.
---
Why cant i put posters on the back of magazine shelves? It's green. Its supported by the thing *im placing it on*.
---
Be careful when placing small things on the ceiling, apparently the selectable part of the camper will just eat whatever you place, so you cant move some things after placing.
---
I had a problem yesterday but today it seems to work fine.. I have to chase the cargobot a lot though.üòÅ
---
Shortest and simplest answer, The servers likely cant handle it.
---
I just did this last night. I was totally wrong, /u/KonkretneKosteczki and /u/hurzak were right. First event, I had something like 3 wood scrap in my inventory - I had meant to be empty, but I saw a log and clicked on it without thinking as I was approaching the event. Sure enough as I contributed, in the top left of the screen I saw two lines. The first line was something like "3 wood removed" and the second line was something like "2 wood removed from stash". After that, later contributions were a single line stating that the wood was being pulled from stash.
---
Maybe this was a change? Maybe I was just wrong the whole time? Presumably it has always been this way, and maybe I was confused by the messaging where when you contribute a second time immediately after you can't do that. I do not know what the rules are on that - if you can only contribute once, or once per X seconds/minutes, or some other variable.
---
So the wood donations definitely can come from stash. Makes me wonder now if the Chally Feed can also come from stash (not that that matters as much, since it's not like I make a lot - and it will spoil anyway)
---
My son learned it when he was about 8 months old I guess? Now he freaks out when I give him the spare one while I play. He wants the one with the lights. When he doesn't get it he proceeds to start the spare one, pausing my game. (PS4)
---
You can play.
---
Edit: or do you mean you can't play while an npc is also playing. If so that's dumb
---
Do your entire build first. Perks. Mutations. Legendary stuff. Etc. Whatever you want us to see. Once you do all that. THEN copy and paste the link.  The website is constantly updating your information so whenever you copy the link, it‚Äôs for exactly whatever is on the screen.
---
They can charge for whatever they want but honestly, not giving 1st Members the ability to buy all that gear kind of nullifies the potential of keeping that money spent inside the 1st exclusives too. 
---
Incentive to have premium skinned items no one else can have for instance.
---
yeah makes sense
---
No, my bad if I miss worded that I meant to say he‚Äôd join in very late and then go afk multiple times.
---
It‚Äôs is friendly sarcasm of the finest quality sir or ma‚Äôam. üòÇ
---
I don't think itd be OP. There's a perk card that reduces food spoil rate of everything in your inventory. Rank 3 is 90%
---
If you fight them, you are giving them time to gang up on you. From start, run to the first objective as fast as you can, and there will be no enemies there.
---
I‚Äôm rocking those two together right now and I‚Äôm loving it.
---
Honestly, I have wood in my stash and every time I try to add wood it says I don't have the required material or something. Happy that I'm wrong, but not sure why it will let you and not me, bizarre.
---
Are they even good though? The only time I encounter them is during pvp and they do almost no damage to me.
---
This.   Endless supply of script for your mule.
---
However, level up your mule to level 50 before dumping everything.  That way you can at least turn in script from the mule and get max level legendaries.
---
I could see it at best be as big as the main "room" of vault 88.
---
Personally i love rad sponge. Makes walking in a nuke zone amazing with a team.
---
What are the magic effects? I haven‚Äôt really worried about shotguns so I haven‚Äôt paid attention to what effects are magic.
---
I wouldn't say shine, you'll be just as good as were before. The only difference now is that everyone has to get within bashing distance to kill something, effectively making everyone a melee build.
---
One synergy could be that your ranged teammates could bring enemies to one health and you could run around one shotting everything.
---
How many times is always? I was rightfully refunded twice in almost 2 years.
---
true but not exactly. I've run solo on the queen and earl often for months and my weapons never deteriorated this quickly. more usage perhaps but it's definitely a direct result from the patch that's not nerf related.
---
Hi, mom! ‚ù§
---
I can switch builds by changing cards to. Mutations don‚Äôt stop that.
---
And we will... Someday üòÇ‚ù§

---
The tenderize plan is a lot more rare than the mods for it. Keep at it and may RNG be in your favor and give you a tenderizer plan instead if a tenderizer
---
Oh, you want my Enclave Bunker trigger?  The Service Entrance puts you on the upper level in the bunker. But the entrance on the 3rd floor of the hotel, which is obviously higher than the service entrance, puts you on the *lower* level in the bunker.
---
I got 42 damage per body shot on sbq. No sneak and no buffs. I believe I was getting 68 per shot on psycho tats. It also helps that the range is 722
---
The Yao Guai feeds on me... Is that the same thing? üòÇ
---
I guess you haven't played it today? I've ran it 5 times, and every time there where no less than 5 robots crammed in the room with the repair beacon in it. I literally jetpacked straight up to the room in 3 seconds.
---
The Rusty Pick is right near my camp and I'm lazy
---
Thats a smart move
---
Edit: might i say, a *power* move
---
It was better back in the day when you could go the full 30 mins.
---
Hi, baby! ‚ù§
---
Getting the tenderiser weapon wouldn't be worth it because no legendaries would ever drop
---
Glad I'm not the only one. I started to think I was losing it.
---
Different teams
---
Oh, it gets more fun. Sometimes the difference between being able to place and not be able to place is your current point of view. So try to move around.
---
Also, sometimes you can attach a foundation to another foundation if stairs are placed along the side they attach on. It makes no sense but it is what it is.
---
Can con firm its not fixed I got it first try to but my friend doesnt get it we have tried over 5 times :(.
---
I don't AFK in DO groups. I just meant if people tried to invite me or send me a message and I don't answer I'm AFK
---
Why can't you try for rewards today? Daily Ops are repeatable, I don't understand what your issue is.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôll check back later today
---
I did. Like i wrote in my comment on this post.
---
What do you mean it doesn‚Äôt always work? It tells you what materials you need on the right side of the screen. 
---
I‚Äôve played over 900 hours, never felt the need to buy a repair kit. Are you regularly scrapping junk and storing in your stash? You don‚Äôt need scrap on your person to do repairs, as long as it‚Äôs in your stash.
---
If that's the case i don't see a reason to not always pick the biggest one once it goes live. Unless there is some kind of gating either costwise or through some quest/grind completion to be able to have access to the biggest one.
---
Different teams, different studio.
---
The engine is the problem. It's meant for single player.
---
Someone from the sub did an interview with the FO76 lead dev, and he says that's why it's so buggy. Where as ESO used a different engine.
---
Because it says ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù even though it‚Äôs a new daily op
---
Edit: you are aware I am talking specially about the rare rewards right? Not the crap you get just from completing it right?
---
Same here.  I have 4 other chars, 280, 150, 120, 52 so my main could be in the 600 to 700 range if I didn't have the other chars.
---
ESO has been continually developed and improved for 6 years.
---
And unless your a melee build good luck. It's weight is 20 and some mods make it stupid higher
---
You AND the npc can go up to it and activate it. You will both do the little ‚Äúplaying‚Äù animation.
---
I know it was their "B team" but it has been years, why hasn't the team optimized the game for PS4?? What's the point of releasing more DLC if my PS4 only gets 10fps at best in most places...
---
Well the most recent one was I bought the Red Scare PA skin, got a refund, bought the bunker shortly after that, maybe 2 days? Got that refunded as well because they were both buggy messes.
---
You got lucky then. The repair room is straight across on the second floor, I jetpack up and the room was filled with robots. Every. Time.
---
Edit: It takes me 2, maybe 3 seconds to get to the room. If you have some secret that gets you there faster so they arent waiting for you, I'd love to hear it.
---
PR speak, it basically means you have more freedom, but the obvious is that you would never get complete freedom especially as an online game. 
---
They need to keep the thing stable so limitations are to be put in place no matter what. 
---
Otherwise people would just break the thing in order to achieve some exploits or just crash their instances.
---
its been happening on my gat plasma alot. frustrating as hell when I'm ammo dumping the boss and it pauses to reload at 250 rounds. I cancel it most of the time but it still pauses for 2-3 seconds plus the startup. frustrating but definitely not the worst bug I've seen in this game lol.
---
This is adorable and I'm very happy for you. Kind of a surprise you'd start with something as complex as Fallout, but good for you! It's a great series. Have fun!
---
I‚Äôve gotten like 10 peppered between this one and last.   Still no tenderizer.
---
Damn so they must not be doing something right.
---
I'm on xbox too! Mind if I play with yall sometime?
---
i hate Resilient
---
You can keep trying until you get the rare rewards though, right? You can only get the rare reward once, but you get as many chances as you want, if I'm not mistaken.
---
I really don‚Äôt see the harm in that, you still need like radiation fluids and hardened masses to make stable flux.
---
On a side note, if you are not alone in such event, you probably should not use that  Instigating Shotgun.
---
I hold on to them and script the next day.  
---
Or if any of my other toons need script I‚Äôll transfer some.
---
this is the truth
---
I only do them once a day on PS4, but never have a problem doing it. Either I'll see a Daily Ops team and join it, or I'll create one and at least one (but usually three) join the group. So for me, it seems like someone is always willing to do them.
---
I think the only thing that would make Daily Ops more visible is if it wasn't (seemingly) tied to teams. If I could look and see if anyone on the server was on a Daily Ops, or if I could get a notification any time anyone started a Daily Ops, that would show you how popular it actually is.
---
Shiut sounds like an angry bowel movement.
---
I wasn't talking about your gun, but about the cheater I replied to.
---
I would like that as well lol. Matter of fact, I actually roam around without one because unyielding armor is a thing and I try to keep my weight down as much as I can. I feel like most backpacks kind of ruin the outfit that I‚Äôm wearing
---
You are very mistaken, you can keep trying till you hit the top rank, but you only get one chance to roll for rewards at each rank.
---
So when they auto competed for me, I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to make that roll
---
Edit: once again to be clear. Not talking about the ammo, nades and shitty legendaries, but the unique rare rewards
---
I've got a level 110, most of his levels are from nw though. Wanted that hellfire pa haha
---
Why do I even have to redeem them! Free items should just be accessible.
---
I switch to my AA Fixer when there are others there.
---
Yeah, I'm melee and martial artists makes melee weapons weigh 60% less I think so that would be about 8 base weight and with unyielding I have a bunch of extra strength and thus weight. Not really worried about that. But even if it's not the best 2 handed melee I'd still like the souvenir since I keep helping with loads of meat week events per day. Event last time and last year. But last year there was no plan for it
---
I see what you did there....
---
2 days for me.  Got elder 5 times tuesday night and 3 times Wednesday night.  No rare rewards.  I'm thinking it may be a bug.  I got rare rewards every day since the update before that.
---
Did ESO suffer from the same optimization issues after two years? Because that's really my only issue, it runs soooo bad on PS4 and It makes no sense coming from a AAA team.
---
I think I was running 5 days in a row as of yesterday.  We‚Äôll see what happens in my one daily op today
---
Technically you still can, it just requires patience and common sense.
---
Honestly I rather prefer 76 to ESO. They're different games. One is an MMO, this is more like Fallout with co-op. Different styles of games require different design philosophies.
---
The sale say should say:
---
This shit‚Äôs gotta go!
---
It literally explicitly states in the inside the vault message that you will only be able to have one at a time. Not sure where you're getting otherwise
---
Oh man, i spent a stupid amount of time on one of my camps to be a on-the-go blueprint.
---
Turns out one tiny thing was on a slope, so when i tried to place that camp later at a new location, it always had one thing "missing support".
---
Big brain thought Bethesda;
---
If something like that isn't sitting on the ground when you place it, *just force them into position when i place the blueprint*.
---
Or tell me what isn't working and let me remove it from the blueprint.
---
Or tell me what cant be placed, and just place what can be.
---
While I'm bitching about blueprints, why is the budget so much smaller than the building budget?
---
The more the merrier! ‚ù§
---
üòÅ
---
Dropping Starched Genes is silly.  There is no challenging content in this game that warrants that kind of  out of combat overhead.  You're going to waste far more time screwing around with managing your mutations than you'll save by a TINY combat improvement adding 2 perk points that were already lower priority than what you had in your build before legendary perks.
---
This isn't an MMO with a race for a world first raid where you're worried about wiping with some incredibly technical boss under 1% health so you need to spend hours or days of your time to boost your damage by an almost imperceptible fraction.  The hardest content in this game is routinely cleared by unorganized, unoptimized pick up groups not even communicating.
---
Every single person, with a soul, who plays this game wants a companion. Every cool person here wants a dog.
---
Every time I see a stash box I make a deposit, plus I have my Collectron doing its thing. I‚Äôll figure it out. I‚Äôm trying to only carry 2-3 repairable weapons at a time, thinking that perhaps I‚Äôm stretching my resources too thin.
---
Thanks for the correction. But - why wouldn't that roll have counted as today's roll? I don't see how this is an Auto-complete issue. You did the Op and got a roll for it, from what I am reading.
---
Lol yeah it's like underground.  Happened to me.  It had a behind a door symbol on its marker and everything.  Next day it was fine
---
Thank you! I've watched my daughter play the game for so many years that it feels like I've been playing along with her. ‚ù§
---
Because the game is bugged and sometimes auto competes happen
---
It's exactly an hour, and it's that way for every player.
---
I play 76 with my mom and sometimes my 11 and 7 year old. It's so much fun playing together!
---
If you eat tuna you‚Äôre already eating a nice dose of Mercury each time you crack open the tin...
---
Awesome story.   Welcome to the wasteland
---
Hey I have a bout 1000 each of flux am switching to PC so if u want some send me a message gamertag is MONZIVE
---
why keep the limits in place, they where only there to make the game look good to microsoft 
---
" look we have x # of players logging in every day " 
---
they do no good for the game at all
---
Yeah, doesn't make any sense to me neither. Now mid-game players are gonna struggle at level 50 instead of at level 30. The problem is still there.
---
Yeah I guess you're leaving out information or not explaining it very well. Doesn't sound like a bug to me. Just a bad RNG roll and subpar time management.
---
Yeah I saved a 20 lb tenderizer in my stash till I got the plan the previous meat weak. Saw doubles+ of everything else. 
---
If i had got time plan after one wastelanders I probably would have traded it. Gave up melee and went full heavy. Which means unless its 2-3 stars any tenderizer I ve gotten goes straight in the scrip machine. Mixed in with only buying legendary modules from here on out and I'll never see a decent tenderizer anyways lol
---
I'm a night owl so I'm up really late usually. MST Zone
---
Two shot, yes. Explosive? No.
---
oh, feel a little dump not trying this. Will do, thanks
---
It‚Äôs not a plan you get it from the Season 2 Scoreboard, OP probably bought their way through the season
---
Thank you! It's great to play together, so much more fun. Even though we can't play on the same team, we keep watching each other play. I learn a lot by that, always making questions...
---
Just wait until Interior Spaces are released... then we can make Fallout 1 [Lost Hills](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/25/Fo1_Losthills_Entrance_.png) / Venture Brothers [Don Hell's](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/venturebrothers/images/8/88/Don_Hell's_Exterior.jpg) a reality.
---
Shit out or shut up? Confused.
---
I have noticed that. If I don't want to twat around finding all the bits and pieces I need to fix my stuff I'm using up to 4 repair kits in one day of average gaming.
---
No it explicitly states "one of each at a time", so you can not use the same one again and again, but there will be more types of instances you can use at a time. So more then one at a time.
---
I'm not too sure why you're downvoting me but it's okay. I just submitted a ticket with bethesda support for a refund. Hopefully they work with me this time. I'm not really complaining about it too much. I just don't like the way fridges function and I don't like how a lot of things in the atom store are sort of misleading, with vague descriptions, sometimes inaccurate pictures.
---
No, dude. You don‚Äôt even understand the mechanisms of how the rewards work, now you‚Äôre an expert on bugs?
---
Damn and here i am with kelloggs gun getting 800 plus damage with headshots, but yes I definitely agree pistols need a significant buff, I‚Äôm really surprised and happy they made tank killer rifles and pistols .
---
Oh lol....
---
explosive energy weapons are legacy. seeing as the gauss minigun wasn't around then i dont think it has the ability to be explosive. as far as i know it can still be two shot though.
---
Is the faster fire rate perk good? Cause I don‚Äôt wanna make a ton more guns if it isn‚Äôt worth it
---
Rog. I‚Äôd like to try daily ops. Just hitting 50 on my alt. Do magic shotguns work for daily ops?
---
No, i try it after build the table and cant play. Later i watched an NPC playing.
---
Open like 90 other containers and loot them. Then server hop and it will reset it.
---
So you read as well as you explain. Starting to understand what the issue is here.
---
Ahh..haha
---
Oh sure they can do this but they gotta nerf everything... nocturnals trash.. stalkers trash.. beserkers trash.. none of its useful. Nobody runs those .. broadsiders are trash buzzblades are trash.. now just everything is even worse off then it was..
---
Right? It's annoying as hell. If they nerf everything it should be the exact opposite. It should deteriorate slower. Well done as usual Bethesda.
---
Keep in mind, if your character doesn‚Äôt have enough room to get into the playing animation, it usually means that there‚Äôs an object too close to it. So you might have to move the little table thing around. 
---
You can‚Äôt play against the npc or the other player. It seems only one person can use it at a time. But you can take a picture of yourself while doing the animation if that‚Äôs something you like.
---
Well at least I'll be useful in more than shaving time by just hard core sprinting to the objectives then standing there while everybody else vats everything before I can touch it
---
I'll fall all the way down, and when I hit the "bottom" it warps me back up to where I was standing at first.
---
Damn! What a typo that was. Lol
---
Beefy, you are right and wrong, totally wrong about how everything works but right about time management. Probably just need to wait an hour
---
Yeah, I felt totally ripped off by getting the regular fridge... 10 items only?? Totally useless. It looks cool though. But that's it.. i don't even "use" it, its' just for looks... so I guess I got all I wanted out of it LOL
---
I think I'm better prepared than day 1, let's see
---
One violent night isn't an XP gold mine. Ghouls are squishy enemies that don't shoot back which is why you see threads talking about how great ghoul farming is.  But they aren't the best way to farm XP,
---
That's asking a lot from a small indie dev like Bethseda. Remember we only got to use weight benches for like.. 2 days? Before they were disabled for being abused.
---
They are pretty useless, which is funny because there's also a limit of items you can store there. If they made it completely stop the item condition *and* turned the ice machine and milk machine into fridges everyone would be happy.
---
-Fridges would become really useful and many people would start using them, therefore increasing sales of the clean fridge and the other Atom Shop fridges.
---
-New players would be likely to buy the fridge from the Atom Shop after realising how useful it is. BUT it wouldn't be considered pay to win because you could get free fridges easily.
---
-Free players would also get the functionality and be happy while saving atoms. Perhaps stacking foods would even become meta for the Queen or something, and cooking could become more important and viable as a whole.
---
But I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
My 70 year old grandpa has been playing since the game was released and he's almost level 300 now
---
And as I Said, it‚Äôs not the case. It‚Äôs 3 separate rolls on rng :)
---
Maybe a Mine Mule mutation? It would also grow your ears long for better perception.üê¥or an Ox mutation?üêÆüêÉ
---
Gotta graduate from watoga Highschool first
---
I mean it could just be that no one is working during the pandemic
---
It's taken me since release to get to level 220 about 1200 hours. (No that's not a brag I'm shit at the game)
---
ESO is zenimax, 76 is Bethesda. Different studios.
---
76 is what happens when you try to use the same engine from FO4 in an MMO, zeni knew this wouldn‚Äôt work and used a different one.
---
Yes; faster fire rate is a direct boost to DPS.
---
Disregarding the primary effect on a gauss minigun, it would do about 523 damage per second. The faster fire rate bumps that to 654 -- a straight 25% increase.
---
Your new Christmas list---
---
Your Own Xbox,
---
Your Own Microsoft/Bethesda account
---
= Fun with the kids together and show them parents still kick ass
---
And also the part about the explanation being a disaster. I'm definitely right about that too. But at least I didn't embarrass myself by trying to "@" Bethesda on Reddit.
---
Because they want the reboot perk to stand on its own. They don't want revenant to be a required perk card to get the most of out of power armor reboot.  Neither do I. I don't have revenant and I don't want to spend points on it.  What you are talking about would mean people who invest in "reboot" won't get the most out of it unless they spend points on revenant.
---
Yes you can roll 2 shot as I have one. You cannot however roll explosive.
---
G2k
---
Exactly. You'd think it would just passively affect all food in the stash. It's only 50% so its not like it'd be OP imo. The beer barrel holds 15, not sure if just that one holds more or all fridges got updated to hold 5 more items?
---
Welcome to the Wasteland! I want to second r/PKOA I have been with that group since almost its start.  It is a great group and very supportive.
---
Would love some are you in game now
---
Only for fallout first probably.
---
Its still a "rifle" it might have double dipped or been affected at one time, but it was mostly put to an end with meat hooks benefiting as unnarmed and one hander at the same time.
---
I‚Äôd argue you embarrassed yourself plenty
---
Your mistake was thinking someone said they were the best way to farm XP.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that - what does it count as?
---
I've already joined them!
---
It's not a bug, just really bad RNG, I've had days where I've gotten nothing for three days in a row as well. Each tier has a specific percentage to roll something; 5, 15, 80 respectively.
---
And yet somehow, I'm able to go on living my life.
---
Superb!
---
yeah, not my native lang %)  its hard when in your lang is only one W or V (and you dont see\\hear difference)
---
I know you aren't thinking about what "Build" you are going to be, but it is kind of important that you have at least a little think about it.  A lot of the perks you choose when you level up affect your S.P.E.C.I.A.L points and if you get to, too high a level you may find that you have to sacrifice a few levels to move your special points around to fit the type of character you want to play.  
---
You already know about "Junkies" and "Bloodied",  My character is a \*Foodie\* "Heavy" I run around with great armor and a shotgun normally, but suit up in power armor and equip a heavy weapon whenever i'm heading into an event area, as a heavy I need Strength, Intelligence and Luck to be especially high, and other builds will require Agility, Perception or Endurance to be really high, just so you can take advantage of the best perks for your "build".  
---
I play on XBox UK time BeardyGreybeard is my gamer tag, your welcome to add me if you wish, i'm level 49 and my character is level 213, if you need anything don't hesitate to holla out, i'm pretty certain multiple gamers will rush to help.  
---
\*foodie\* a player who choose's quality of life (QoL) perks, and is generally an ok character but not really optimised for the harshest parts of the game.
---
You use more bullets to kill something thus weapons break a bit faster in that sense.
---
Daily ops has an hidden effect where you lose 50% less dura for weapons and gear when your running it as well.
---
Not me guys, devastated
---
Nice! Maybe he even played with my kid. What a crazy ride, hahaha.
---
A rifle.
---
üëé
---
Aren‚Äôt people tired already of answering the same question like 10 times per daily? Do people even try to use the searchbar before opening threads?
---
Nono, not health rubberbanding, straight up bugging out the character into not being able to deal damage other than through melee attacks, grenades or vats attacks, only fix is to relog or wait until it magically decides to work again, which can take as long or as little as it wants
---
Thats talking about the pts. It refers to it in angular when talking about normal usage
---
Don't go chasing waterfalls
---
Pipe rifles still double dip.
---
Why not just make it so that there‚Äôs no double dipping and that weapons count as what they are?
---
I didnt expect a full game, but a small animation or something. Thanx again for your hints
---
YES
---
Dude. Everything from now on is going to be your level. Was kind of the main thing they did with the last patch. A little thing know as one waste land
---
I have only used the AA flavor on PA griefers since I didn't have the B at the time.  It was pretty effective despite the PA high RR.  Nobody seems to engage PvP any more, so haven't had much chance for the others.
---
It's almost like you don't know that the console wars are no longer being fought with exclusives, and that they are becoming less and less relevant.
---
The current iteration of the console wars, Sony V Microsoft has seen the exclusives list shrink console after console in a sizable way. Feel free to go have a look at the 360 and PS3 exclusive list, and then compare it to the mere sliver of games that were exclusive this generation. 
---
Not to mention for Xbox, Exclusives have almost zero presence in their top selling games list. I think 3 of 20. Sony had slightly more at 4-5. 
---
It's the reason cross platform is becoming more and more common. 
---
Now consider 76 specifically. Say MS owned it from the get go:
---
1: Microsoft makes the money from games sold.
---
2: Microsoft makes the money from AS sales. 
---
3: Microsoft makes the money from FO1st subs. 
---
The console wars being fought with exclusives is not a thing anymore. It's why the current gen of consoles feature so few of them.
---
Yeah, that's a great arrangement!
---
How is that a problem? (and it's intended to be that way).
---
I don‚Äôt get fridges for ability, just decor
---
Just crouch and take cover, they will eventually come close to you and you can kill them (if you want) while staying near the uplink.
---
Yep haha it's a bitxh
---
That is a build I can definitely see myself in!  I think my kid used to use that, because her friends keep making jokes about it. She likes her Cranberry Relish üòÇ
---
That worked
---
I‚Äôll echo these sentiments as well once I‚Äôve reached a similar goal. Until then, I‚Äôll endure the grief every time I ask for noobish advice. This community is dope. I‚Äôm at work right now fantasizing about changing my perk cards.
---
Only way to fix that bug is to uninstall the game, my dude. Because that's how the game works.
---
I like the sound of it, but not praising it until I actually use it and see how it works. The ammo converter sounded fantastic too.
---
You could be right, guess we'll just have to wait and see.
---
Bears?
---
That's why you don't fight them but run past
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS, WE FOUND IT!
---
Transfer them to a mule, or 3-4 mules, and max out 5000 scrip for sales.
---
lets be glad the majority of the playerbase is far better
---
most players i meet are very chill and are either super helpfull or just ignore others 
---
had something similar where a guy asked me for help, i crafted him a set of armor and gave him some legendary weapons for his level, even an anti armor faster fire rate
---
he asked for more and more and at some point i said dude what the hell do you want from me,
---
he turned very aggressive in his tone and it all ended with him yelling at me over the mic that i need to give him my legacy weapon because otherwise hell report me for having it 
---
it was very strange and amusing now that i think about it but the whole situation legt me confused more than anything lol
---
I'm dyslexic and y-g has too many vowels. üò¨
---
It doesnt works because of missing space, as you said. Moved the table a little bit and.... didnt shot a goal ;)
---
This is why I come here.
---
Guess so,  anyways I'm all for the hype
---
If she plays on PC then he might have!
---
Ever since the seasons have started,  I've used my fridge to store cranberry relish and brain fungus soup for the xp boosts.  Never used them prior to that.
---
Happened to me in Valley Galleria the other day with a mutant hound -.- was so pissed
---
I was hoping the would have been included in the coming hotfix to one wastelanders, but it doesn't appear that way.
---
Yeah except I haven‚Äôt gotten any core drops. Just burning through them with no drops for rewards
---
Love them.   I'm there for the event.   I don't really care if I get tags on any particular boss.
---
I wish I could use them but after several failed attempts, I can never trigger the magic damage against bosses for some reason. it works against literally everything else *but* bosses.
---
personally I love them because these events are slogs and the very definition of a resource sink. took on Earle yesterday and nobody had magic guns, went through thousands of fuel.
---
annoying af
---
I actually didn't downvote you? Unlike most people, I only downvote if it's misinformation or hate aimed at me or another player.
---
Not necessarily, burned through 10 cores and got nothing in return. The last daily I did
---
No there's no current way to get another
---
Dang that‚Äôs fast leveling. I‚Äôm 250 at 520 hours on that character
---
Down to 80 from 160. I like the extra stash space but it's starting to get rather annoying.
---
You just care that the event gets done. I see.
---
I used to run a junkies heavy build. J/25 LMG, Gauss minigun, flamer.
---
I'm having more fun after switching up to AA/25 or AA/E versions of the same weapons. Time to kill on most enemies is about the same; the difference is the higher HP stuff like mirelurk kings and queens, behemoths, fog crawlers, hermit carbs, and bosses take longer to solo now.
---
Im complaining that they are making it impossible to have multiple builds unless you're level 500+.
---
put it in a suitcase at a trading station for the ones in need
---
I still have mine, but, no it‚Äôs impossible to get it now unless they release a plan for it or do it as a reward again.
---
You can try and find a claw with the exact same effects and rename it.
---
Same happened to me, I had to leave, then start a new one.
---
Understood. What makes them so annoying to you? I‚Äôm really interested in hearing people‚Äôs opinion.
---
Found the cool, yet responsible mom!
---
I mean if you spent the time an effort to make lots of cores, you should get something back. I haven‚Äôt gotten any for completing the daily ops
---
It's been happening with gatling laser and plasma for a while I believe, but recently been happening with my 50 cal and gatling gun. V annoying
---
Nope, I got nothing
---
it wouldn't make much sense to do this. most insides that take long to get from point A to point B are dungeon style. which is what I'm assuming you're referring to. if you respawned close to your body there wouldn't be any incentive to be cautious seeing as you would respawn at the point you left off along with your junk. there are alot of problems to this game but this doesn't seem like one. side note: most dungeons aren't even that big from experience its just the tasks you do to that take up the time. so in theory if you've done all the tasks it shouldn't take that long to get back.
---
You have been impacted by the market... do you figure how different things would be without the exploiting and duping. Imagine how the community would run with people not being 100% self sustaining with their ‚Äúlarge‚Äù amount of supplies. Weapons are priced so high that you have to establish yourself. Caps have sunk in price from Cola dupes. People honestly don‚Äôt care about your vendor unless they want to blow some of their infinite cash pool or take advantage of you trying to make a few caps with an item they view as ‚Äúpriceless‚Äù and trade only. Eh sucks that I feel solo in a game that could of have a closer knit feeling.
---
First get bloody, like 5% health, then put on your weapon. The actual damage won‚Äôt show until you are wearing it and as long as you are bloody enough, the damage should spike sufficiently. Also, two shots damage is included in the damage shown.
---
That bug has been around for a long time. Best advice is to server hop.
---
Nope even if your level 500 you have to change builds from commando to melee or heavys. You could run a hybrid build but I feel you lose to much.
---
Top man üëçüèª
---
I recently became a heavy guns build. And a person on reddit was really nice to give me some of his weapons he long longer needed (since he got the new heavy guns with gold) and he was nice enough to give me the magic gun. I use my bloodied 50 cal and 5mm Gatling gun or regular enemies. I just save the magic gun for the bosses at this point.
---
My daughter plays on Xbox :(
---
Resilient robots ugggggghhhh
---
Maybe I should just skip that one today
---
Thanks! üòÇ‚ù§
---
I have the salty mod but I hear the pepper mod is better?
---
&gt;Order of Mysteries base!
---
Ding ding. I was waiting to build my 'forever' CAMP til this update. Using a portion of the bullion won in the main quest, RPwise, to have a reasonable sized home built and a 'personal bunker' underneath. Now I can dedicate all the overworld budget to making the house look right and really go to town on my Den of Mysteries in my personal instance.
---
Jeez. At least I'm not the only one. As I stated, okay go ahead a nerf everything but it should be the opposite. At least have the weapons degrade slower. For f sake.
---
Savage Divide, Mire and Cranberry bog vendors sell the nightvision scope and automatic piston plans, SBQ drops the prime receiver as always, the rest is learned from scrapping with a 25% chance.
---
Or so says the [Mod and Plan database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/).
---
God I'd even take one that just plays any of them... 8 unique ones would be awesome though
---
Oh dammit, I guess that explains why I couldn‚Äôt find any way in game. I thought they would have brought the mode back or atleast the guns. Still thanks I guess I ll try to see if I can bargain for one with why I have.
---
Duping is whack. It‚Äôs like playing Minecraft on creative mode.... yikes.
---
Well I know it works haha. I've gotten them everytime I hit the boss with a weapon that uses cores. In fact I just got them about 5 minutes ago
---
Finish him.
---
The funny thing is i was at my cap limit ;) i have 41 more if you wait 5 min
---
Shout out. ü§™
---
Yes peppered is more powerful. I got that mod last meat week right after I traded for the tenderizer plan. This meat week only new thing I got was the spicy plan. So just need salty and tato. Which isn‚Äôt a big deal. I haven‚Äôt even had a tenderizer legendary drop yet
---
that's why you should get some as end mission reward. weird you didn't get any.
---
I have had one stuck in a tree and one fall into a fissure but never off the map.  Good luck with that one.
---
if you have the weapon in your hands when you end the OP i've gotten 3-5 Ultracite cores at the end for my gating plasma, or gatling laser (depending on what one i have in my hands)
---
Wait what? I‚Äôve multiple times played on the foosball table with other players.
---
My fat dumb fingers. Lmao
---
Here, sniff my finger!
---
._.
---
The Den of Mysteries shall at last be a reality! I've waited so long. Now, just a clean Garb/Eye outfit in the Atom Shop, pleassse.
---
Use the back door, the front door has been bugged since before they fixed the lightbulb in watoga station that no one knew was out a year and a half ago.
---
If a weapon has a level ending in 5, then 45 is max.
---
i kinda want to make my own robot ally, but a dog would be good for those who want unconditional love instead of cold steel
---
There‚Äôs no way to get that specific weapon with the name unless you buy it or trade with another player. (Often people don‚Äôt take caps, instead they want to trade with a good legendary weapon)
---
You CAN however be lucky enough to find another deathclaw gauntlet with the exact same legendary effects. 
---
I have my unstoppable monster, and since my gf wasn‚Äôt playing the game at the time the unstoppable monster game out. I gave her the regular 3 star legendary. Same effects, just no ‚Äúspecial name‚Äù
---
Did you read everything? They were in the room. I did run past them. But with 7 of them in a broom closet they were bumping me so the repair animation didn't finish. After 3 or 4 tries of that I had to stop and kill them.
---
It suits my play style well, I like to put on power armor, equip my \*Vampires\* heavy weapon, and tank any damage being done to me, as I mow my enemy down.  
---
I leave all the sneaky hidey stealthy stuff to the bloodied and junkies, I did try that style of playing for a while but it just isnt me lol.  
---
\*Vampires\* a weapon legendary effect, that causes a small chance to regain hit points for every  shot that hits the target, I have it on a Faster Fire Rate Gatlin Minigun, so as i'm shooting lots that "small" chance becomes a "huge" chance, so I can go toe to toe with the biggest, baddest bosses in the game and walk away without needing any stimpaks.
---
I have a magic JE GP and use it if needed. Mainly on making sure daily ops stay under 8 min or in finishing off earl or sbq if it feels like the event has lost its steam and turns into a slog. Otherwise I just run around like a normal player with my AA 50 cal.
---
Totally agree
---
Holy fuck cry more please...
---
It says your team is in a DO... It doesn't show the current time they're at
---
He had ZERO clue it was nearly over.
---
Plot twist.  They're actually much more nuclear-warzone useful "ambient radiation panels."
---
I really hope vendors can't be put in them tbh. I don't want to have a loading screen after I already had one to fast travel to someone's camp.
---
I absolutely cant stand enemies scaling with me regardless of what stage in the game i am. Even a level 15 player shouldnt have to spam stims when fighting molerats or propaganda bots, just adressing the midgame does not fix the gameplay and immersion issues One Wasteland brings.
---
It was nice when I got the tenderizer plan I crafted one then got a 1* Bloodied for finishing the event.
---
I can make you as much as you want. 30 caps each
---
He literally joined in last minute MULTIPLE times, like nearly exact same time
---
"apparently I need to know how to make ammo and caps...?" Love it, great stuff!
---
1. Keep those with low weight to script later;
---
2. Sell the itens with great legendary effects;
---
3. Donate the rest. Too heavy to keep, not so great effects. So I leave them in the bag in front of the vending machine for free.
---
98% of the time I dont need the item, scrip or caps. So there is no problem in donating.
---
Gf and I both kept clicking on ‚Äúactivate‚Äù but it would only let one of us use it at a time. 
---
Whenever Sophia or the traveling merchant decided to use it, I tried to use it as well and nothing would happen.
---
I don't rip mine out from the get go but if the event is really starting to drag on I don't wanna waste thousands of rounds when other people clearly aren't pulling their weight
---
If my camp is over cap will I be able to place the shelter?
---
Or. You know who i am now.
---
Best my best by one caged lights plan!
---
I see, so you just mainly use it when you absolutely have to.
---
Go figure meat week is awesome for carnivores!
---
Primal cuts in the ash heap for Sheepsquatch meat, the forest/savage divide for Yao-Guai and glowing meat all over. Good time to make the switch!!
---
You never HAVE to change builds. If your build was good enough. Mine was great. Then update 22 destroyed it.
---

I've found glowing fungus, bloodleaf, snaptail reed walking all the way from the wayward down south to the agricultural research center where the river dries up. No lure weed. 
---
I did start finding Silt Bean after this point if you keep heading west along the dried up river after hitting the ag center. 
---
Can you be more specific, or were you thinking of something else and not Lure Weed?
---
walk up to the handles on one side. two people can "play" at once.. but there will be two balls
---
God dammit I shouldn‚Äôt have give him the gauntlet. I will try to see if I can bargain for a similar one but dam I miss mine, it just feel special.
---
Don‚Äôt go by numbers shown on the gun when comparing those effects. Go out and shoot something and make your judgement then.
---
I can‚Äôt at all say anything about using it with an npc as I‚Äôve never been able to test that (apparently Beckett doesn‚Äôt like playing with me ._.) but definitely can say - as long as you‚Äôre on the opposite side of the table, you can play with other players. Not entirely sure why it wouldn‚Äôt work for you, but it‚Äôs definitely a function of the table.
---
On PC, I use a FFR vampires 50cal heavy. 2-4 sbq/earl per night and run a TON of ammo through that thing. Repairing every few days which isn't bad and does not seem worse. I do not use gunsmith ever.
---
Thank you for the explanation.
---
I have 41 left. You can have them for 500
---
Okay I see. Like the other person that commented. You don‚Äôt use it unless you absolutely have to.
---
If the workbench repair option is greyed out, its because you don't have what you need to repair. Click it and it will show you exactly what you need. Typically adhesive and aluminum are the ones I have to go hunting for specifically.
---
How have I been impacted by the market? I don‚Äôt go being the in-game economy and do just fine. I price what I think is a fair price on my vendor. People buy things regularly. I occasionally buy from other vendors. My armor and weapons are all from enemies or purveyor.
---
That's the thing. Console exclusives are becoming less and less common. Every generation of the Sony V MS console fight has seen the number of exclusives shrink dramatically. From dozens and dozens to just a mere handful. 
---
You actually hit on a valid point regarding game pass. But it's not about exclusives. The console war is being fought more and more with services, like game pass. 
---
And yes. Almost everyone is doing microtransactions. BGS just has a pretty proven track record with them. Shelter has made over 100 Million in MTXs. 
---
So if you look at 76 as an example. We'll shrink down numbers just so it's more digestible. 
---
Say 300 people bought 76. 100 on each platform. If MS owned BGS from the start:
---
They'd sell 300 units. Plus Atomic shops sales. Plus FO1st sub costs across all platforms. 
---
Now say they only released 76 on Xbox and PC. They'd still sell their 200 units. Maybe they sell a few additional consoles to pull PS4 players (Though exclusives no longer carry the console purchase retention/sway like they used to). So say 10% of the potential 76 players bought a Xbox because of this....
---
MS sells a few extra consoles, but loses a much bigger dollar amount in potential MTX sales and FO1st subs. 
---
Fallout will not become MS exclusive. Even looking at Fallout 4. It sold something like 8-10 million copies across both consoles.... Roughly half of that on PS4. 
---
So when MS is looking at making it exclusive they have to think: Will we sell enough additional consoles using this franchise as bait, to make it worth not selling potentially a few additional million copies + additional content sales?
---
Probably not.
---
I put mine away a couple weeks ago. There are so many people using them, I don't really to carry it.
---
Mhmm. That‚Äôs really good to know. Sorry OP if I gave you misleading information. It doesn‚Äôt seem to work for me, but when I get home later I‚Äôll put the table out in the open so there‚Äôs no objects nearby and then I‚Äôll try to play with gf again.
---
Hmm I can't imagine it's a console thing.
---
It's working as intended, it just weighs down your camp budget.
---
So can we start calling duping magic to?
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs fun to blast a way at things and watch everything melt but I am not going to take away the fun of a challenge from anyone else.
---
Ah okay
---
Just because there's fewer exclusives doesn't mean that the method is completely gone. Especially since you probably don't want to factor in Nintendo exclusives lol. 
---
&gt;Not to mention for Xbox, Exclusives have almost zero presence in their top selling games list.
---
You don't think they want to change this? ok then  
---
I'm really not going to sit here and speculate because I have no interest in arguing about this. We'll see in the upcoming years how Microsoft handles this and if they're going to add to their exclusives library.  
---
Until then I'm done here.
---
The one I didn‚Äôt think of trying, usually goes with everything
---
Oh, well oh well. Sorry
---
Part 2 of my pet taming travel guide:
---
- Berkeley Springs Station:  Turn around.  Go downhill heading east.  The event is in the road next to some orange cones.
---
- Sugar Grove - Turn left.  Go east \~ 85m.  Jump down cliff.  Look for an orange lighted camp with a police car.  The event is in the road nearby.
---
- Tree Tops - Turn left and head NW.  Go down hill towards overpass.  Event is either under the overpass, or adjacent.
---
- Robco Research Facility - Head north \~100m.  Cross the water.  Look for a green fungus patch, and a phosphate deposit, behind the destroyed train car.  The event is located there.
---
- Mac's Farm - Head north \~60m.  Event is near the Fissure.
---
(I'm trying to find the events at Creekside Sundew Grove and Camp Venture ; but have been unable to.  If I do, I will add them as they appear to be easily accessible to the spawn points).
---
Part 1:
---
- Drop Site C2.  Turn around and head SW to the open area without grass
---
- Cranberry Glade:  Go towards the cars heading east
---
- Firebase Hancock:  Turn around and head north towards a stream bed
---
- Relay Tower EL-B1-02:  Turn around and head south down the the road and cut right towards the rock outcropping.  The encounter is on a flat rock further down the hill.
---
- Lucky Hole Mine - Turn around and head down road. 
---
- South Mountain Lookout:  Head north, passing the lookout tower on your right.  Go towards the cliff ahead.
---
- Spruce Knob Channels - Head north towards the road.  The encounter is where both roads intersect ~60m from spawn point.  
---
- Foundation - Turn left and go down hill.  Pass the red forklift.  The encounter is in the ditch surrounded by rock walls.  ~40m from spawn point.  
---
- The Thorn:  Turn around and head north about 50m.  The encounter is to the left of the pile of logs in a stream bed
---
- Superior Sunset Farm:  (1) Turn around and look east.  The spot is right across the stream on a flat area.
---
As an example i just did vital equipment in 4 minutes for about 2000xp bonded with 2 players. Between events.
---
I just didn‚Äôt like that the outfit is brown and the hat is navy
---
Now you just need to invest in your own console so you can play together. This game has some dull moments, but if you got a group you play with it's always fun.
---
i was so dissapointed there was no giant fish/sea monster in the nuclear power plant pond on the right side of the map. The lake had some giant fish as its map icon.
---
Right however my state is regarding the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù not the couple sales you make. A lot of our trading value has been taking out by duping. Imagine specific people that farm specific items that you could join and know they‚Äôd have what you‚Äôre looking for. Now it‚Äôs like eh. Random shit in vendors that people hope to sell.
---
There is a mutation in the daily op that all the enemies know where you are at all times.
---
A lot of people might‚Äôve dupped magic guns. The person that gave me this gun said he had like 5 mule accounts full of heavy guns. So if they were duped, traded regularly or not. I have no idea.
---
It can't drop with the explosive effect but it has an unstated one. Equip Demolition Expert and your damage goes up.
---
They for sure should add in non-combat pets/robots at some point.
---
Fair. I like the different colors.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going for basically. I don‚Äôt want to be that person that kills the queen in 5 seconds and nobody got credit for it.
---
Sure you can for some extra $$$
---
Or pay via fridge backpack, which is my choice for all my characters. No extra dr, rad resist, or er, but with SS armor I am fine with all those #s. No good w/ salt perk points.,üëç
---
How does that impact me? I‚Äôve never been much interested in buying from other players. It feels like a shortcut.
---
I've seen one in action, an explosive one. Immortality sure looks nice üòÇ
---
It's ok. You're wrong. 
---
No one ever said it's completely gone. Just it's becoming less and less relevant. 
---
MS stands to make more money keeping BGS multi platform than MS exclusive. That's all that it comes down to. 
---
And Nintendo doesn't matter in the console war of Sony v ms. They have their own section carved out around first party exclusives. 
---
No FPS gamer has ever thought : New console generation..... I'm making Nintendo my primary console.
---
My family is a gaming family, two sons and a wife that are all invested. However my 12 year old daughter has little to no interest in gaming outside of games based on anime.
---
If Foundation can plant/harvest silt beans, why can't I?!
---
Valid point. I wonder if the stash weight limit will be camp/instanced camp wide, or individual. Would help a lot to have some stuff off loaded to the other stashes as opposed to cramming the regular one full of junk, items, etc(provided one does not have FO1st).
---
Alternatively, have a different C.A.M.P. icon for those with underground vendors. Maybe the normal vendor icon with a down arrow next to it or something.
---
Fishing would be cool too, all of us that take the fishing hook spot by whitesprings would love to relax with our mirelurk buddies
---
I will, or my kid will. She really wants the new Xbox üòÇ
---
Thanks for the info
---
Make sure that the gun you are looking at is the gun equipped. The pip boy dmg will only apply some of the bonuses to the equipped weapon. 
---
Also TSE is a lot better post patch. Explosive dmg legendary effect didn‚Äôt get hit by the change and so TSE having 2 explosions boosts its damage respectively. However, the accuracy issues on a TS handmade are bad. It may have more theoretical dmg but you can‚Äôt hit anything with both rounds from further than spitting distance.
---
Search the forum for "Flamingo Units" to see a breakdown of items' budgets.
---
It does.  Scroll to the end.  It's not highlighted well (at all) in the store.

Alright, this is epic
---
Own several, have scripped several as well.
---
I will not use it unless I am solo.  The one exception to that rule I made was a few days ago on a daily op team with one other dude.  Boss spawned at like 7:52 and we wanted to hit elder.   Might consider it if the SBQ is about to time out......but I haven't seen that happen in a long time even when everyone is using legit gear.
---
A herb garden! Bethesda gave Skyrim a greenhouse and the ability to plant nearly every plant, let me plant Soot Flower and Bloodleaf goddamnit
---
Will do!!
---
This. Risk and reward. I love it.
---
It's all good man, no hate.
---
Magic weapons need to get patched. It‚Äôs not ruining the game for other players but it takes out the challenge the game has to offer. 
---
The majority People who use magic weapons are people who don‚Äôt know shit about making a build that‚Äôs viable. 
---
Once these magic weapons are patched I don‚Äôt doubt that people will get on here and complain that they need it because they do shit damage with everything else while players like me who put time and effort into understanding builds and making my own have no problems with the game at all.
---
If you‚Äôd like next time I log on I can give you a more precise location.
---
That's incredible! It's just me and my daughter at home now, my husband passed about a year ago and he was the one who used to play videogames with her :(
---
tl;dr
---
told you I don't care dude, stop typing to me
---
I pay attention, but the other day I was ready to start, and kept doing the thumbs up, and kept getting thumbs down replys. They were just wanting the extra XP for Meat Week, then dumped me. -\_-
---
It is he
---
I'll shorten it.
---
You're wrong and don't know what you're talking about 
---
Have a good day.
---
Please look at the enemy mutation bud ü§î
---
Being that you're both adults I would extend an invite to play with my group. Usually 3-6 of us either questing together or at least in party together chatting about all kinds of random things. 
---
My gamertag is: Walks0nLegos ( the"o" in "on" is a zero)
---
The limits are crap, best FO76 streamer Munchkinjesse has like 4k notes lol
---
Come one dude. Read the daily op mission.
---
This sounds good as well! Sadly, I doubt Bethesda will ever notice..
---
Time to share Team Medic and let the Stims flow.
---
Hahahhaha
---
Awesome!!!!!!lol.. My son samething a couple of months after release. Haven't stopped since. Lol
---
you must be new here
---
To each their own but just because I have one and can melt the queen I dont do it unless I'm in my private server now if I'm doing a queen and it lasts 15 mins yeah I'll bring it out and start to work on her but the 35 second queen kill kinda sucks for every one in a server
---
My assumption is that this is why they chose the three sizes. To see how the game handles each one at its highest capacity. Then they can theoretically give us the largest possible option. 
---
At least thats what I HOPE they do.
---
Didn't really bring that into consideration... yet. I have marsupial (400 caps vs 2k bullion) so I'm covered for now and the cost/benefit over the rest of the mods and armor had me put jetpack and helmet (no environmental protection) on hold for now.  
---
Mostly I wanted to unlock everything else before spending 10 days to get a jetpack, as awesome as it may be.
---
Yes I agree. The only time I see the Queen event not going well is when we only have 4-5 people and they are all low levels.
---
then it will probably mean a lot to her that you also show interest in her hobby
---
I‚Äôve done it 3 times, this time it‚Äôs not working like before.
---
Yep
---
I personally wouldn't remove it, but I could see someone not giving a damn about having all mutations at once just removing that perk and waiting for what rads to do its thing when you got rads.
---
I'm just telling you there's no way he knew for sure where your were at time wise
---
Ok
---
"Feedback" mod: Enemies freeze and cover their ears for 5 seconds. Adds energy damage.
---
She is really excited, says that now I won't tell her to lay off gaming so often üòÇ
---
Did you try uninstall ing and re installing the game? That might help.
---
Thanks for the assistance
---
Forgo missions and level up, you're gonna need that.
---
That's wonderful! I love new players, and it's never too late to start gaming.
---
I have a rule that applies to every game: if I die (or, if dying isn't an option, if I fail a task) then I need to immediately spend a minimum of 15 minutes cleaning or performing some household task. Sometimes it works in my favor, but -- since I prefer to play games on the hardest difficulty -- it usually doesn't.
---
The worst seems to be my Fallout 4 survival playthroughs. I refuse to go back to earlier saves other than to fix broken questlines or go to a save prior to addon install, so whatever is the last save is what I play. I remember one game where a save occurred just before both Super Mutants and a Fog Crawler attacked a settlement in Far Harbor. I spent the entire week cleaning with **maybe** an hour of in-game play. I was so frustrated!
---
Uh, for clarification, I don't apply this rule during Fallout 76 ops. I just keep a tally in my head that I complete once the op is completed.
---
If you like the damage on the tse then go full health with it besides the unyielding stacks it's a win win.
---
nah
---
Good on you and your daughter for having the patience and desire to share in the wonderful world that is gaming! 
---
As someone who plays with my own Mama, I truly appreciate your efforts and if I was richer, I'd for sure give you an award for your post! 
---
**STORY TIME!** 
---
Tl;Dr: Got my Mama into gaming... There were challenges and now she's a Wasteland Wanderer too!
---
My Mama is no spring chicken either and while she played here and there on the consoles/games us kids had growing up, she was by no means a "gamer" and had little desire to pick up any of todays games. She literally had not played anything more than games on FB or her phone in more than a decade when Red Dead Redemption 2 came out. 
---
She watched me play a good portion of story mode and once I had finished that, I started realizing my virtual cowgirl dreams in Online and began playing with my brother. One day, he was getting ready to leave for work and I wanted him to leave his PS4 on so that I could hunt for him and fill his camp. Instead, he handed the controller and headset to our Mama and said "Here, she'll play... I gotta go like 5 minutes ago.... BYE!" and over the course of the next 3 hours, I taught her the basics. A love was born that day. 
---
This became our usual routine. He'd play with me before going to work and then pass it over to her when he had to leave and she'd play with me for a few hours more. It got to the point where she'd actually ask him if he was leaving yet just so she'd get her turn. 
---
In April of this year,  I was able to get my own PS4 (I had been using Remote Play to play through my PC - the physical system being across town) and this allowed her to finally have her own character. She is now over rank 200 and plays every day whether I play or not. 
---
This was not an easy journey... she tends to be, well... forgetful. It took me more than a month to teach and get her to remember how to wave at someone without accidentally shooting them and starting a war without me having to walk her through it. She, to this day, still forgets exactly how to do some things and I have to go over it with her (for the 40,000,000,000,000,000th time, lol) but in their infinite wisdom, whatever Higher Powers there are have been kind enough to bless me with enough patience for ***SEVERAL*** saints! 
---
Then, R\* decided to shit the bed and pushed a patch/update that totally borked the game. After playing daily for more than a year (I'm over rank 400 and have more than 2000 hours) this was the proverbial straw for me. RDO was the only online game I played and being so disappointed with the latest update really killed my drive. I knew 76 was rumored to be just as bad (if not worse) in some ways - bug wise - that I was a bit hesitant to give it a try. But needing to fill the void and having loved previous Fallout games my brother and I both got it when it went on sale for PlayStation. I game share with Mama's account, so she got it too.

With me not playing RDO daily more than hopping on for all of 10 mins to whip out a daily and preserve my streak, Mama was really bummed out... She realizes why I don't play it as much as I used to, but says it's lonely now and she really misses our "game time" together. 
---
To make up for the reduction in our cowgirl-dress-up-pew-pew-pew-ing time, I decided to try and get her into 76. She's never played any Fallout and also 1st person games make her nauseous... I knew this would be a challenge - but one I was up for! 
---
She hated it.... a LOT. So much so that I thought that the first time would also be the last time for her. And you have to admit, there's a bit of a learning curve, with all of the various factors and aspects one needs to remember and account for (perks/weapons &amp; armor/their CND/ammo/thirst &amp; hunger.... the list goes on...) and where I have the benefit of having played previous Fallouts and had at least a basic idea of things, this is like throwing her to wolves that only speak Mongolian and telling her to survive! 
---
I have to thank a good PSN friend of mine that I met playing RDO for getting her to give it another try. She joined us one evening not to long ago and had a blast. The following day she messaged to ask if she could hop on 76 with me... (a first!) and is now working her way towards understanding the mechanics and getting better. 
---
She still prefers RDO, but at least she's broadening her Viddya horizons! 
---
All in all, it was and is, VERY much worth the time and effort (on my part) to be able to play with her! 
---
If your still reading, thanks and I admire your dedication! If you're on PS4 - hope to see you in Appalachia sometime! I'll be the one giving step-by-step instructions to my Mama!
---
Hope y'all enjoyed my tale!
---
Also help with revive in water for tad pole and set me up with a Sympto-matic in my C.A.M.P.
---
Excellent idea!
---
Show him mercy, he's already suffering
---
I accept this headcannon.
---
Ok, this time actually read the instructions, and then try it.
---
Yeah, I don't know. The first time Meat Week was available this year, I just got in the habit of making sure I had wood in my inventory - so I clearly either experienced the same thing you're experiencing, or at least thought I had. So... the possibilities:
---
\- I was just wrong all along, the game has always allowed stash donations (doesn't explain your situation at all, unless you're on another system type, but I don't believe we've seen many if any PS/Xbox/PC specific bugs like this)
---
\- I was right, the wood used to need to be in inventory, but the game now allows stash donations (might explain your situation, if you haven't tried with this latest round)
---
\- I was "right", in that there's some bug (What? A bug in FO76? IMPOSSIBLE) where certain circumstances does not allow stash wood donations. To even speculate on what would make this bug happen is beyond me right now without some testing or info from other players. (would totally explain your situation)
---
üëçthat dude is everywhere
---
Waited an hour re set the console, no luck, womp womp, oh well I was due an annoying bug, things had been running too smoothly
---
I think they will definitely be patched. Maybe next update or the one after that. But I don‚Äôt think these will be magic weapons. And I agree that there are ways to kill enemies without magic. 
---
I‚Äôm running bloodied of course. So with my heavy guns perks and damage perks.  I can pretty much kill everything in 1-2 shots. Big tough enemies might take 5-7 bullets but that‚Äôs pretty much it. I‚Äôve never played anything except bloodied so I don‚Äôt know how other builds handle it. I know sneak is very powerful because I used to run a shotgun and unarmed bloodied sneak build before the patch.
---
you have a 'stealth' commando/shotgunner without sneak perks.
---
huh. no wonder you're getting killed so easily.
---
They said something like different layouts, so it might just be which one is suitable for what youre trying to make. Like one may hav more vertical space, one may be a more open space, and one might have like a sprawling tunnel like layout, but this is just me guessing.
---
That's a pretty good use actually. I usually just use canned meat stew since I went with carnivore and it doesn't spoil and is easy to get.
---
Agreed. Not everybody can do the 1,000 damage to the queen. So it‚Äôs unfair to those players.
---
The objective isn't to kill the enemies.
---
The Daily Ops reset at 1pm EST. Waiting and resetting your console has no effect on that.
---
It's only happening on my Gatling Plasma but it's pretty consistent :/
---
Why are so many such a**holes? One person points me in the proper direction. I can‚Äôt keep up on every post - I am literally dealing with a family member whose house burned down. Thought I‚Äôd take a few minutes to play a game I haven‚Äôt done in awhile. Go f**k yourselves.
---
Hahaa yeah, the problem I always have with "explosive" legendary's is that I forget they are explosive and that the explosion can affect you as well as the enemy, I lost count of the number of times I'd run up to Earle or the Scorched Beast Queen and open up with my explosive weapon, and blow myself to pieces...  needless to say I don't use explosive anymore LMAO
---
I use it during events like ACP, but I try to let people farm the wendigos and get their shots in on Earle, save for the times that people just absolutely suck and aren't doing shit for damage, nor covering me/each other.
---
I guess you‚Äôre right. It doesn‚Äôt impact you. I realize that now.
---
[There's always Copilot for the Xbox One!](https://support.xbox.com/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot) I'm not familiar with kids and their capabilities (particularly so young), but you could probably focus on a single button or behavior while you do the heavy lifting in a game.
---
It's an excellent example of the curb-cut effect; while intended to be an accessibility feature, I know of so many people who use this to play cooperatively with their younger spawn.
---
I think he meant he wants it to function like the dogmeat from fallout 4. Because for example the dogmeat from fallout 3 could die
---
&gt; Before they were disabled for being ~~ab~~used.
---
As I mentioned in my post. The magic gun doesn‚Äôt seem to work on earl. So I just swap myself to sneak bloodied shotgun. My job at that point is to make sure I did a decent amount on damage on earl. But for the rest of the event I just focus on the wendigos and do my best to keep them off the people that are actually doing damage to him.
---
You literally don‚Äôt know what you are taking about, please stop contributing to this thread.
---
Edit: I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so hard for you to understand. At 1 pm eastern when the daily ops updated mine already said ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù which means I can‚Äôt roll for rare rewards, have you been dropped on your head a few times?
---
Only problem is no power armor then. I was tempted to go this route, but I do like power armor sometimes as well.
---
I have 76 on HDD on a launch model ps4 and personally id rather deal with a 3min load screen whenever I want to see a CAMP shelter than have 2fps be the new norm.
---
I'm ok with the size of the CAMP, but man would I love it to be square instead of circular.
---
You don't have to read posts to read simple instructions that are in the screen that you have to go threw to get into the daily ops mission.
---
And that sucks man. So am I. A lot of people in california are right now. Lost mine in the lnu lightning complex.
---
Disabling a number of cars for the duration of the event might help, the PTS would help in determining exactly how many and which ones without taking away from the mayhem of the event.
---
Mine haven‚Äôt worked that well since patch 22. Didn‚Äôt really like to use them anyway.
---
So sorry to hear about your loss! It's awesome that you and her could make a tradition they once had  is now something you two can bond with!
---
Welcome to the Fallout Family! What platform are y'all on? There are plenty of us who love to help new players!
---
Robots aren't creatures. Been that way since Day 1.
---
Mine was great. The nerf hasn‚Äôt really changed it. I‚Äôd suggest yours wasn‚Äôt as good as you thought
---
I pick them wherever I do but I also survive mainly off of brain soup
---
I used to do that, my soon to be 4 year old has gotten too smart and figured it out haha! Now I give the PS3 controllers to my 18 month old twins, they haven't figured it out yet :)
---
havent tried so far, but my guess is that unarmed would be struggling to oneshot things
---
i currently work on a low health stealth slugger and with a B/PA/str bonehammer i struggle to take down level 100 mutants with a power attack
---
im not done yet so it should be possible but my bet is that unarmed simply doesnt hit hard enough so if you want to make it happen, you should probably expect to use two hits (not that thats to bad but you know)
---
When you had completed it what showed in the rare reward section? I only ask as I did this exact same thing where I started before the reset and finished after, the rare reward was blank and didn‚Äôt say none as if to say I hadn‚Äôt received anything but checked my inventory to see I had received a rare reward I definitely know I didn‚Äôt have before
---
That's straight from Bethesda, big guy. Sorry, you don't get to be right about everything.
---
That's a fair point.
---
Is that possible? For some reason I recall that players‚Äô crops in nuked areas wouldn‚Äôt produce flux.
---
I base weather I need sneak on how my screen reports my stealth condition: [Caution] &amp; [Hidden]  not just assuming I need sneak, should I be doing that differently ? Also there are a great many situations where once you're found out its nigh impossible to become re hidden, again unless ive missed something big.
---
     Which sneak perks should i have &amp; U saying its possible to stay stealthed while continuously firing on enemies ? 
---
I'm not trying to sound like a know it all here but id love some reasoning behind your infos, I want to do better in game so hearing Why a different way is better helps exponentially.
---
Oh sweet I‚Äôll check when I log back in, that def happened to me last week and ended up with the 94 stash box but I‚Äôve never had it say ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù before I‚Äôve even run it. I did run it even though it said complete and got the ‚Äúnone‚Äù but didn‚Äôt check my inventory
---
Thanks dude I'm going to try this.
---
I‚Äôd say anything with the settler/raider storylines would be a good start. After you get thru those lines you can start collecting script and bullion to buy certain plans. Script is awarded through various events that you will be doing anyway for other things, so it‚Äôd suck to miss out on it all.
---
You're missing anti armour (armour penetration) perks in both builds. Tank killer for rifles. Dunno if there is one for shotguns. AA is supposedly quite strong now.
---
It happens every time I get staggered by enemy melee, if I have low ammo.
---
Don't have one, infact pistols are my favorite and I don't think they even can cause their fire rate isn't high enough. But in my opinion, if it's in the game, use it. But I wouldn't build my character around it or anything. It's clearly a glitch in the game and should get patched at some point
---
Probably, esp when Fallout 1st is 100% Zenimax since they do the same thing in ESO. So they turned Todd Howard into a liar in that deptartment I guess. I used to play ESO but it's too expencive to keep up with and I hate everything being in loot boxes. Among many other things that would be too much text to read.
---
You moron I‚Äôm not talking about when the daily op updated.
---
What I am saying is at 12:55 eastern I entered a daily op, when I exited the new one had updated, and it already said ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù 
---
I waited an hour as another user suggested, and still no luck. That is the bug I‚Äôm experiencing that you seem to dense to understand.
---
As others have noted, just dump it or sell it. Keep the scrapped junk that is regularly beneficial to you. Ammo cannot be sold to NPC vendors, but you can place them on a vendor in your CAMP for players. I generally sell all of the ammo for either 1c or 2c; I hit cap, uh, cap a lot, so I'm not looking for any large returns.
---
Most of the junk that you acquire can be bundled using a Tinker's Workbench and plastic. While you cannot sell a lot of junk components to NPC vendors, you **can** sell the bundled equivalents.
---
If you're feel particularly generous and find that items aren't selling on vendors in your CAMP, you can also "donate" them to other players. A lot of folk place useful items in at the Overseer's Camp or in containers at train stations (with a particularly focus on blue suitcases, I've found). Don't just dump them on the ground, since those items will disappear when you log out of a server.
---
I recently made the jump from Xbox to PC, and I'm always appreciative of all of the goodies that other players have tossed into containers. Especially ammo. Oof, I miss ammo.
---
With farmable dirt tiles I‚Äôm hoping we can grow larger crops in our camps when instanced rooms become available given those rooms will have a much bigger budget. I‚Äôll be interested to see what‚Äôs possible when instanced rooms come to the PTS soon.
---
Nice players like him make the game so much more fun!üëçüëçü§ì
---
You need to optimize a bit better. If you wanna go stealth you need stealth perks and should pick crit perks in luck to go with it. Stealth fails at some point in most encounters, so you need a way to output a ton of damage without your stealth bonuses (critical hits).
---
If you prefer shotguns, but still wanna mix it up, you should pick other weapon types that benefit from the same stat as shotguns (ie. Heavy guns, melee, or unarmed)
---
Nah, played WoW for 11 years. This game was just shoddily put together from the beginning. Been playing since BETA but games don't want you to enjoy yourself anymore. Devs want you to treat it like a job. I have a job and it is a hell of a lot more rewarding than FO76. Not to mention I don't lose a paycheck because some bug caused it to just disappear.
---
Need to bash 'em to finish them off.
---
Lmao, this guy
---
I'll just be dropping the BOS bunker with vendors in that and door to my underground bunker.
---
Give us the option to build our own robots again as in fallout 4
---
Cures diseases
---
You should try to trade them in case you‚Äôre in need of something else. Assuming you don‚Äôt want them anymore.
---
Auto is commando. Semi auto is rifleman
---
It can cure a disease if you have one
---
Wow really? So glad I have it now
---
Was planing on basically ditching whatever commando perks I needed in order to go full shotty ( im in the process of 'getting that roll' with my gauss shotty &amp; already have a combat shotty 2shot + 50% limb dmg so i wouldn't need tank killer anymore)
---
Cool thanks for the info!
---
free disease cures, applied upon entry
---
I don't care unless they melt the boss immediately fucking the event for everyone else.
---
Thanks for the info!!
---
I ran it and every time there are none in there.
---
i hope they go to the interior budget and out of stash.
---
You have to marsupial up
---
Thanks guys! No more travelling to the fountain in white springs!
---
Im sure camps can be well made i have no doubt, but im just going to a camp for their vendors first and foremost. 
---
I could in theory see something that makes me want to explore it but it's just extra and optional at this point **after** ive checked the vendors. 
---
I don't want to spend 3hours finding vendors regardless.
---
I'd like pets, and I'd also like Sophia/Beckett to have simpler alternative items instead of the console/bar.
---
I like Beckett in my camp, but his bar doesn't match.
---
Oh god why must we suffer like this.
---
Every time I got to fix or craft anything, trade with NPCs, open locks and hack (I refuse to waste a legendary perk on that) I must endure this painful perk menu.
---
My first character was a pistol build. I still have my bloodied explosive 10mm 3 star pistol on my stash box. At this point I just kept it for the good memories.  
---
I eventually switched to unarmed/shotgun bloodied build and I played like that ever since. 
---
I just recently added heavy gun to my playstyle and I love it. Because now I have 3 builds in one character. 
---
But I agree with the fact that they should and most likely will get patched soon.
---
Well they did put the captain cosmos pa in the game so its not like theres any problem with them porting other creation club items
---
Yeah weapons do not deteriorate anywhere close to this in real life, over even in other games lol. Bethesda has dumb ideas about some things.
---
100% agree.
---
Fuck, I got Lure Weed and Snaptail mixed up.
---
Outside the angler pond, and the marshy area around it, you can try the marshy area west of Abbie's Bunker.  IIRC there's also some scattered in the area east of the river, between the Dam and Galleria.
---
I'm guessing this is for the Chew Sticks?
---
Magic weapons take considerable build optimization before they will proc on bosses - and there's been a lot of misreporting of what really is a magic weapon, etc.  Magic effects with a weapon that exceeds 200 ROF without any tricks like a beam splitter is the only reliable magic weapon that works consistently in my experience - that leaves a very small selection of weapons...  basically you need a magic FFR LMG, magic UGL or magic minigun with accelerated barrel.
---
I haven't toyed enough with the gauss minigun (stupid ammo requirements) to say for sure, but the only way I can see it being magic at all likely requires use of the penta barrel.
---
Even with those weapons that work, in my experience you have to be in power armor and have Stabilized.  Not sure if all the One Wasteland changes have made it harder, but if the damage isn't enough, it doesn't seem to get to the magic trigger point.  And for magic to proc you have to land all shots just about on the target too.
---
Wendigo colossus is easier to shred compared to the SBQ - that's because the innate damage reduction of the SBQ is really high.  The imposter will go down too quickly though, leaving little time for others to get tags in.  Aside from the SBQ and colossus, there's really no other bosses...  the lv 100 stuff like grafton monsters, behemoths, etc just don't have a big enough health pool.
---
I've tried to solo SBQ on private server to test out magic weapons and without fully optimizing my loadout, it ended up being a total waste of ammo and time.  This was prior to One Wasteland too.  That was running full health, for better results I would need to retry that with all 3 heavy guns perk maxed out (have lv 1 perks of the 3 cards) but given One Wasteland changes, its probably harder to do now full health.
---
Bottom line - its not as easy or as magic as some might believe it to be, unless you really try to make the magic happen.
---
ah huh. Furious explosive vs. critters want to tell you something
---
This is my shotgunner build with some perks that i swap in and out.
---

---
"I waited an hour"... I am dying to know what you thought that was going to accomplish.
---
&gt;I'm not trying to sound like a know it all here
---
trust me, you're not. you *need* the sneak perk maxed, specially as a full health build. a piece of 'harder to detect while sneaking' legendary armor would also be great, and a fixer if you're going commando. also mod your armor to be shadowed and maybe muffled if you don't need the 2nd mod slot. and don't forget a shielded raider underarmor.
---
&gt;U saying its possible to stay stealthed while continuously firing on enemies ?
---
yes, obviously. your weapons are silenced, correct? except for daily ops, with a full set of chameleon armor and a silent weapon, enemies literally cannot spot you unless you move. and then escape artist will put you right back in caution. a proper stealth build should be able to mostly remain in caution even without chameleon, really.
---
also, are you going to be a commando or a shotgunner? don't double dip unless you're level 300+ and have at least 4 level 3 special legendary perks.
---
Damn not even that aparently
---
I'll make an impenetrable wall of explosive berries!
---
I would love to! And I think my daughter would too! Most of her friends online are foreign (We're Brazilian). My gamertag is the same as in here, and my daughter is DaniCoelho93.
---
I know, right? Sharing widely know information about the game.
---
Personally use all of the commando perks with my Tesla since it has the automatic mod installed. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs energy weapon or ballistic, if it‚Äôs automatic, it works for the commando mods. 
---
Also *definitely* recommend ‚ÄúBatteries Included‚Äù since fusion cells definitely eat up a TON of your inventory
---
The right kind of perk depends on the barrel type you use. The automatic barrel benefits from Commando, the Shotgun barrel benefits from Shotgunner, the semi-auto barrel benefits from Rifleman, and I believe the charging barrel also benefits from Rifleman.
---
More specifically, when you change the barrel type on the Tesla Rifle you are determining what category of weapon it falls into. For example: the shotgun barrel makes the weapon a shotgun, so it benefits from all perks that apply to a shotgun, including Scattershot and Skeet Shooter.
---
Edit: added second paragraph.
---
I know that now! üòÇüòÇ
---
I do this with a full set on vanguards and an instigating swing speed power fist. Just did the galleria daily op in 8:30, solo. I should be able to get that down if I can find a few trouble shooter pieces to swap in and also swap in the auto stim perk. It‚Äôs viable. You won‚Äôt be as op as you used to be but it‚Äôs fine.
---
That's a good point. Plus corn can turn into flux.
---
When I was a farmer, way back before I got my carnivore mutation and then engaged in cannibalism,  I never thought to try to nuke my own place to see if my personal crops would turn into flux or just get destroyed. I wonder if anyone here has tried it.
---
I‚Äôve watched it happen and counted my bullets and can confirm that you aren‚Äôt having reloading early. 
---
What‚Äôs actually happening is when your magazine empties and you reload, for whatever reason, it puts a number back in your magazine. But in all the testing I‚Äôve done it seems to just be ‚ÄúGhost Ammo‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt actually exist
---
The clip is actually empty, it's just a visual bug that shows ammo left after the mag is emptied.
---
Get off the berries and get on the stew üëçüòÅ
---
Ahh, if that's what was meant I misinterpreted I suppose. I'll always prefer the F3 dogmeat to the F4 one. Him being able to die made me value him so much more, he was my good boi and I'd have to keep him safe at any cost lol.
---
We know gun bashing has always counted as a melee attack but it takes up alot of ap so not many people use it
---
I sell them at the nearest vendor bot if they are 1 stars
---
Yes, they are breaking quicker however it isn‚Äôt because of reduced durability. Because most enemies are higher level and have more health we need to attack them more so we‚Äôre losing more durability per fight
---
Cannot wait to get one for this reason exactly lol
---
Lol you are uneducated as to what the update did to some builds. The one punch man got destroyed. Went from doing 2000 damage per swing to 380.
---
The way the post talked about different layouts kinda gave me Pokemon Gen 3 vibes. Loved those secret bases. I'm excited to see what the interiors look like, if there are different themes, how big they are, etc
---
That would be way too good. Maybe +50 per level of the perk and +100 at rank 4 AND the ability to fast travel when overencumbered, so 250 extra carry weight when maxed plus you can still fast travel if you‚Äôre overweight
---
"BRING ME MORE SQUIRRELS!"
---
Satire?
---
Mainly keep the ones I have as toys that hardly ever get used.  Go weeks without even firing them usually.  If it wasn't for bear arms making them weigh under 2 lbs each I wouldn't waste the stash or carry weight on them.
---
Even with one wasteland the game is easy enough with my regular guns that it's just unnecessary overkill to use any of them.  They are fun to mess with from time to time though.
---
Oh I see, I had swapped to my plasma caster because I was actively getting ammo
---
Yeah for Chew Sticks, I wandered around Abbie's Bunker and gnarled shallows which has the actual Anglers hiding and looking like Lure Weed, but I've not seen any actual Lure Weed that wasn't just an Angler. But.... Iknow it exists cause I crafted a Chew Stick a while back just cause i had the ingredients but I don't remember where
---
I wish they'd get rid of that mutation, it's fucking awful and you need to leave the zone to kill enemies, so the bar goes up slower.
---
I thought so.
---
source?
---
Agreed. Even my bloodied gauntlet kills things easily with 1-2 punches.
---
How can you deck out Beckett as a chef??????
---
Excuse me then and thanks for the clarification, ol' painful Betsy gets upset so easily and that really calmed her down.
---
And if it was great you wouldn't have to keep swapping lol
---
Mercy kill
---
I don't really care for them and I believe they will get patched (eventually), so I'd rather just have a legit gun. I've got a Furious FFR Gauss Minigun sitting in my stash, just waiting for more Prime ammo. Though I may end up just biting the bullet and turning it back to a normal Tesla barrel or something as I only lose like 5 damage per shot and its hard to get the fluxes for the Prime ammo.
---
Because that's the way they "bandaid" fixed it. Also pipe weapons never bothered them because they were not 2-3 shoting the SBQ
---
I guess cos it‚Äôs technically been completed after the refresh it counts, same applied to me it said I‚Äôd completed it even though I hadn‚Äôt done the new one of the day. Just gotta remember what you‚Äôve received before and double check to see if you got anything or not
---
Unequip Aquaboy/Girl if you have it loaded.
---
It's glitching Toxic Goo.
---
On Xbox I can't switch to other favorited weapons and always have to open up the menu select weapons and then scroll down to whatever I want. Real annoying, sounds like basic gaming functionality that did not get tested.‚òπ‚òπ
---
Yup, that was it. That's so annoying
---
Because it works for you doesn‚Äôt mean it works for everyone. I‚Äôve done 2 daily ops and haven‚Äôt gotten shit for rewards as far as my ultracite cores. I wouldn‚Äôt of asked otherwise.
---
Yup, same issue, especially in PA.
---
I'm just fine where I am, and yes, 150K for a gun/weapon in FO IS a value set by the community and by people who overvalue what they're worth.  Economies are complicated, there's still no justification for pricing weapons in the game like that though other than greed.
---
I was just telling you man. Myself and many others have been getting cores that way. Believe me or not I don't care. Was just trying to help you out.
---
This makes me sad and not want to do the daily‚Äôs
---
Unfortunately since they are only level 5 they are prone to being killed.  Perhaps since they are so small you can place your camp module on a large indoor area and it‚Äôll keep them inside.  Never found one to test 
---
For so much time and effort to find one, you might be sad when it‚Äôs gone one day lol üòÜ
---
I‚Äôve noticed something similar where I‚Äôll have my handmades mag empty then jump to 12 or 13 while reloading. Happens most with Earles event. But I think it‚Äôs related to the fire rate and I guess how the servers lag a bit. In private servers it‚Äôs not as bad, only happens once or twice, on public, happens way to much. Usually I just put away the weapon and then pull back up and it‚Äôll shoot immediately with those 12 or 13. Same deal with gun bash. I‚Äôm on PS4 btw
---
Just get rid of scrip entirely, exchange legendaries for treasury notes, and have Mmurgh use gold bullion. Same process as you describe, but with one less currency.
---
Same with Radiation Rumble.  Ignore the ore collection, just two-three people can farm the ghouls for the full timer.
---
That may be it. Didn‚Äôt play much first season. I leveled up but I don‚Äôt remember claiming anything. Thought they would be auto-claimed.
---
Pardon me, I had not seen anyone share this information but I've been seeing complaints about "needing to switch to a melee weapon for daily ops". I was just trying to help.
---
Was right there with you a few days ago lol.
---
Absolutely. Will pay to have one of those please.
---
No joke.  I launch on prime a minimum of once per play session.  The last few weeks I have had to adjust my strategy to nuke where I can get close enough to the fissure to just unload on her with a 50 cal the second she spawns in before she starts flying just to ensure I get my damage in. 
---
At least a third of all scorched earths I do now are over within seconds of when she first lands now because of people being dicks with magic weapons.

This reminded me of when I was in my late teens and early 20s. I had so many internet grandparents who adopted me and were wonderful people and just the best. My grandparents died early in my life, so these kind people happily filled that void.

I still refer to one of my internet grandparents as Grandpa, and and we've been regularly chatting for, oof, twenty years?

My mother doesn't game, and my father only uses his console to play NHL. We do however, use the Xbox party system to chat with one another while they're ex-pats working on another continent. It's the only way that we've been able to consistently and inexpensively communicate (I believe that the country throttles or restricts use of certain apps that we would otherwise use).

It does work.

No one sells anything for 150k unless they're dumb. More accurate prices are 45-70k which, when some things in this game cost 20k+ and its really easy to get caps, is a fair price for a very good weapon. 150k comes from the cap limit times the amount of characters you have.
---
Happens all the time with the Gatlin laser then your burdened with a low power 3lb core. This post needs more upvotes, it's crazy this hasn't been fixed by now.
---
Probably used 20+ over the past few days without realising
---
Prime ammo is a little cheaper a to make now. Well not cheaper but you get a lot more now if you have the ammo factory legendary perk. Just in case you didn‚Äôt know. When fully upgraded you get A LOT. Combined with ammosmith 2 and the occasional super duper perk.

Yea but switching costs less ap

You missing tenderizer, bloodied mess, tank killer. If full health go 5x chameleon with one harder to detect, one shadowed mod, one wood shrouded wood piece, 3 ap regen, and make them all ultralite expect chest- dense or asbestos.

Class freak matters now because of the xp needed for legendary perks. Marsupial gives -4 int, it's -1 with 3 in class. Try herd mentality and join public teams. Strange in numbers is good too, inspirational, lunch boxes, food. I don't run empath but a lot of people like it. Found in tests it wasn't for me because I'm not always in a team, helps everyone in the team though.

What's the point of subscribing year-round if you can just subscribe for a month and get everything?
---
I thought the problem was latency but I'm not so sure anymore. because I can trigger it easily enough against big targets like behemoths and hermits. it's just against the queen and earle that it never triggers.
---
I've tried a ton of weapons and loadouts, instigating and stalker's LMGs, both with and without 25% faster fire rate, J25 minigun with the accelerated barrel, JE gatling plasma with the splitter, TSEs with a 15% blocking armor piece. in and out of PA, fully maxed heavy gunner perks and without them. plus all of my characters are bloodied so the damage output should be optimal.
---
the blocking piece actually melts daily ops bosses with my laser rifle. but never the queen or earle, even after I unload 27 rounds on their head with vats.
---
This is why I kick people who share aquaboy with me from my team.
---
Yeah I use a gatling laser sometimes just for fun and the damn thing breaks so fast its insane. 
---
If I didn't have a crapload of repair kits from the queen I would probably never use it.
---
Pacifist mode turns off by defeault at level 5. If you're past it check and make sure it's on. Annoy the ones who do it to you are server hop.    
---
Some people get bored while others lives are so boring it's all they do.
---
Oh great I‚Äôll get on a team and everyone will just use guns and not bash or melee them. And I‚Äôll run around with 20 health and have to melee
---
Unfortunately not. And it‚Äôs a good thing. Because it also rewards you caps, legendary script, and gold. So it would‚Äôve sucked to automatically collect that, if you were already at max caps,script, gold. Essentially you would be have received anything if that was the case. 
---
Now that we are doing the second season, make sure to claim any of the stuff you‚Äôre rewarded.
---
Bethesda - fun police!

The repair kits are literally the only thing allowing me to use any laser/energy weapon

Re-skin of the id booth in the silo, same animation. It takes away disease like the fountain in whitesprings.

A player in this thread suggested it, so I tried it. What is wrong with you dude?

Yeah its the worst one, really don't like it.

The downvote was unnecessary, like you were telling me about your experience I told you about mine. Sorry if it I came off rude, just being blunt about the situation on my end.

"I don't want to spend 10 hours before it becomes viable"

This may not be the game for you, then.

This post right here bethesda

I recommend going to the Wayward and talking to the woman at the bar. It's where the signs and NPCs outside Vault 76 now guide new players/characters and is a solid starting point.

I got my mom to start playing some games too! She loves Skyrim, House Flipper (she‚Äôs obsessed with home design stuff), and Animal Crossing.

Good note. Thanks!

Certain things from in the game not atom shop items tho
---
I've had no pumpkins there a few times too.
---
So my first character was a shotgun build and my second character was a sneak commando build.  I respect you for wanting to do both, but that means you gotta sacrifice a lot of "luxury" perks to make it even remotely viable. 
---
I modified your build a bit here   
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9f158c5&amp;d=so2sp2sd2pg2ph2pi2pc2p00e40c72cr0ib4ic4au2l71x01xb1xq2x71ar2as1ao0an2lt2pp1&amp;m=1c29f    
---
There is one point left to allocate wherever you want. Trust me, Enforcer is a must-have for shotguns, and Tank Killer, imo, is better than ground pounder.  I also added some sneak related perks to make that a lot more effective and deadly. This meant removing adrenaline (which may or may not still be broken right now) but I added bloody mess in luck to compensate for it.   I hope this helps!
---
Beefy I was talking about you, he is saying at the 1pm update everything was already completed.
---
Sounds like a bug 2 me
---
Don't know if it's widespread but Enforcer is bugged for me: used to cripple every 2 to 3 shots but lucky to get 1 in 10 now.  'Magic' armour and shotgun prefixes still haven't been patched though so my shotgunner alt is still OP in VATS. Running a 15% less damage while blocking armour piece with a quad combat shotgun
---
My low HP characters never leave home without it.
---
Oh didn‚Äôt know that thanks
---
You engaged in PVP. If you do that at your camp, watch out.
---
Agreed
---
Oh, yes! Whenever my daughter keeps killing herself like that, she just yells "AHHHHH" and does it again, hahaha.
---
Gamer Mom club!!
---
Its not that bad. You don't even need to kill until the end. I only had to kill 2 bots. One for the boss to show up, and the boss itself. Easy stuff.
---
You literally have a post in this thread where you are wrong about how it works. It‚Äôs the one with the most downvoted if you‚Äôre confused
---
Dude I have 900 hours in the game. If 10 hours feels like a lot, you may want to play something else. The game is all about incremental progress.
---
I work until 5pm. Hit me up after then? Newsman77.
---
I was talking about me, too. I knew who you were talking about. And I know what he's saying as well. But I am getting a lot of laughs out of you both, and for that, we thank you.
---
Maybe not everything but possibly show all the items but only allow for a free claim of one or two.
---
for what its worth, i agree with you.  bethesda doesnt need to have microtransactions when they could instead fund it with a fraction of their skyrim profits.
---
Are you centraltime
---
Cool thank you. I‚Äôve heard both many times and just wanted to clarify.
---
Eastern.
---
Coming from another hoarder, it feels good to have a clear out, I have 2 maxed out mules and currently running 5 weapon weight reduction armour pieces and still maxing out my weight, I did manage to get my weight down to the lowest I‚Äôve seen it in a while but it just piles up again too quickly
---
Unless people are using a hacked weapon, then yes. Pacifist completely protects your camp from other players. 
---
Which I‚Äôm going to assume you didn‚Äôt have on, because if he kept hitting you, and you hit him back, that initiated PVP which is why you were able to kill him in the first place. 
---
If you had pacifist on, no matter how many times you shot or punched the other player, nothing would‚Äôve happened. 
---
Sounds to me like he is one of those players that starts fights, makes it seem like he is weak, purposely lets you kill him, so when he respawn sand clicks on the ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù option, you become hostile towards him, which means your camp is now able to be destroyed as well. 
---
So a few lessons to be learned. If you don‚Äôt want to ever fight another player, then keep pacifist on. 
---
If you DO want to engage in PVP, then DON‚ÄôT fight at your camp.
---
Gaslighting: when you know you're wrong, but can't admit it.
---
I think the best way to do it would be like 10 100 1000 with 3 different tip jars
---
I did lol thanks
---
Ok ill be on
---
That‚Äôs if your gun bash even works with the crappy servers 76 has
---
Hell yeah it was so laggy once the explosions started
---
So how would you like it to be? Once you claim a workshop it‚Äôs your forever?
---
I run heavy PA, which I use for OPS. And keep a bloody combat shotgun for EXP farming. Without any shotgun perks, it can one shot most things due to the magic blocking effect on one of my SS armor pieces. I just run in the golf club or Westek or whatever and VATS one hit them before they can touch me, and that way I get to keep my +30% EXP from unyielding bonus (which you lose in PA)
---
hey sorry to rush in but if your on at any time between 3:05-10:00 expect a little care package from a level 300 named TODD
---
Gramps has developed dementia before I put his chair down. I haven't been able to do any quests he has.
---
I'd rock it just because I think it looks better than the regular one. The real question is budget vs the regular fusion reactor.
---
U kinda agree to engage in PVP when taking workshops.  Hell there is a warning when u take one.  
---
But with that said, PVP should be removed from adventure.   
---
Either update NW or give us some kind of PVP arena with loadouts u can pick.
---
The PTS is a subset of pc users only, and the issues were reported pretty much exclusively from console players. 
---
Jeff Gardiner has already said the PTS won't be coming to consoles.
---
Problem is, your premise is wrong.  You did agree to PvP the moment you paid the caps for the workshop.  
---
Is it time to take PvP out of the game entirely?  Perhaps. But your argument fails to convince me. Sorry.
---
That surely isn't possible, your able to tank constant fire without dying?
---
Workshops are far from the only way to obtain materials. 
---
Source: me, who has played for 1200+ hours and never used workshops to farm for materials.
---
I'll have to drag my spouse on, he speaks a tiny bit of portuguese. He learned it for a work trip to Rio a few years back. One of the great things about this game is even when playing with people who speak a different language you can use the emotes to signal to your team
---
Other day saw a guy with liquid courage run a flamer, just me and him drunk. It was pretty fun but magic does work in there. Try squatting before the spin up, get yellow numbers and stay there. I sit right next to him now and let him kick me for take one for the team. It's over pretty fast usually.
---
So you think you should be able to have unlimited uncontested access to those resources just because you got their first?
---
That‚Äôs why PVP is enabled there.
---
Electric Absorbtion and born survivor are a wonder. I was on my phone for most of it.
---
Edit: even if those weren't enough, I have enough faith in PA reboot that it would instantly bring me back to life.
---
Thanks for the love, and sharing your story! Unfortunately, we play on Xbox. But hey, a new Gamer Mom to the club! üòÇ‚ù§
---
Wrong about what? My games new daily op already showing compete? How would you know what bugs I‚Äôm experiencing?
---
My word, dude, walk away. There is a reason why there isn‚Äôt anyone chiming in to agree with you, nobody else commenting on this thread had an issue understanding what happened.
---
long press on the map to go to your bunker? :/
---
Its possible.
---
All the time mainly with Gatling laser and plasmas. I could have 6 freshly crafter cores and the gun just stop at 80 or sometimes at 100 and drop immediately to zero, really throws off gameplay this has been happening for over a month now.
---
"like any other MMO" but this isn't an MMO, it's lacking the "massive" part of the multiplayer. battlefield servers can hold more people but that isn't an MMO FPS. 
---
also I get it for workshops. it's one of those things that someone could lock down every single one on a server with no way to shake it up. i don't like pvp at all in this game so I wouldn't be sad if this changed, though.
---
Perk loadouts will still be solid.  I run the mod on pc and it is great to switch from crafting perks to combat quickly.  I have a slightly different loadouts for the queen vs what I use on Earl on my HW toon.  I have a loadouts with lockpicking and hacking.  It will still be a solid addition to the game.
---
Resilient is the only one I haven't played against. Not sure if I want to bother with it.
---
I think we just did ops together a little bit ago! I have one in my vendor for 100 caps my friend.
---
Fuck I assume that's today's OP?
---
I'm not trying to do both, I wanted to migrate from commando to shotgunner bc all the hype about the gauss shotty, but are they only OP if u have one of these 'magic' versions I keep hearing about but have no ideaa what that means?
---
Hey I accidentally removed luck of the draw the other day and i had to repair my gatling laser 6 times between 1 silo and 1 sbq fight, this is insanely abormal and normally i could maybe just repair it once if not at all in that time. Luck of the draw is a must and I didn't realize that until then.
---
vampires weapon and troubleshooters armors
---
I mean I do it with just my pa and electrical absorption. I don't use stims or anything
---
They‚Äôre fine as long as people use them with restraint. Standing around pouring thousands of rounds of ammo into a bullet sponge is not my idea of a good time. As long as people don‚Äôt insta-kill and give everyone a fair chance to get their shots in, more power to them. 
---
I have a magic minigun ... I won‚Äôt gank the legendaries, because this is a cooperative game, but I have no interest in dragging out a boss fight for 20+ minutes either.
---
Give us the rusty broken fridge that's been in the ATX files forever for free, pay to win issue is then resolved and people will still be interested to buy better skins than that heap of junk. Then make fridges equal to GWS 3 so it's actually useful, at least to those who know how to make the very most out of food/drink.
---
Literally this
---
The only time I take workshops is for dailies. Other than that, they are a useless portion of the game to me
---
I knew I didn't have pacifist mode on. I usually keep it off if someone is being a wanker. Thanks for the response though, I now have a reason to turn it on. I like my CAMPs :)
---
I don't mind PVP, not super into it though. I don't mind a little CAMP destruction, even though I never do that. I just never knew it could be totally destroyed that fast. Oh well, it's fixed now but has those annoying almost destroyed yellow lines for the few items that remained and were only almost destroyed before I logge off.
---
Happy cake day!
---
And resilient robots no less!
---
At least the map is easy
---
Yes I  keep getting Vault 94 stash box plans, multiple  on some runs, so I have been giving them to the first under level 50 dweller I find
---
Damn this is actually an amazing idea. Now we just have to find the right person in charge either rose or graham. Nah use kidding that be dumb but totally ridiculous to see them behind the counter handling money.
---
For the amount of PVP hate post on this sub is amazing how so many people don‚Äôt use pacifist.
---
And when you're done please switch or leave team
---
No need for accel barrel on the minigun, it's better without imo.
---
I get that, I just didn't know CAMP destruction was so swift and efficient.
---
take the workshop for plans and XP, completing a daily/weekly challenge, then get out of Dodge.
---
In general, you can get more mats faster just adventuring than you'll get from a workshop.
---
If you want to do a defend event, stay outside the zone and snipe the NPCs.
---
If anyone wants to take it, they have to kill the NPCs first (so you still get credit for the event)
---
It is. Mainly for the fact that most enemies are ranged which forces you to go out of the uplink
---
Rank 1 or max?
---
I considered this perk before
---
Send me message,  gamertag Monzive , I‚Äôm at work so I‚Äôll respond when am home
---
I will give that a shot tonight when I log on
---
I am OK with it, don't really enjoy it but meh. I will now turn on pacifist just  'cause me CAMP. :(
---
There is a perk card that increases damage
---
Yeah when I really started messing with perks and armor I wanted to carry the most I could. I prob scrapped armor that was amazing and weapons too. But I wanted to carry as much as I could so I would get the wwr pieces and after building my character I could carry 600 with a food buff. But I just started moving stuff to alts two months ago and that got my main down to 300 which was the lowest I got in a long time. I gotta clear some shit out and start building my alts up. They‚Äôre useless other then holding weapons. But most of them prob aren‚Äôt even good I just always held onto them. Lol it‚Äôs tough but in all fallout games I was like this. But then I finally started building my character to be a damage player. So switched build around and started paying attention to god roll weapons and armor
---
Probably low levels getting mixed up on the two. What rads is for full health builds only. But even that is pretty dumb to waste 300 perk coins to fully rank since you can just buy rad shields and the effect stacks indefinitely. After 1,000 rad resistance you are totally immune to radiation.
---
I agree, never really seen many complaints about it, but this post definitely showing it‚Äôs an issue
---
right right, forgot about that as I never used it lol. I think I shredded it for perk points.
---
I think you are doing daily Ops wrong, don't lick the transmitter.
---
The best reason I can figure is to force us to have to travel to various parts of the map to make areas seem useful. If all in game crops were farmable then basically everyone would have them at their camp, eliminating a lot of fast travel and cap spending.
---
Max, and I don't even use gunsmith so it's even less points than what you're doing. Although with a gatling laser it probably works better than a rifle.. since it hits so much. But it's worth trying
---
Yeah it‚Äôll be interesting to see . I think the plan before the bgs sale was to make NW into a mobile game(hence the year+ beta tag) which would bring in additional atom shop dollars but I‚Äôm not sure now . I think the big thing is it wouldn‚Äôt be just Xbox but Xbox and pc , where as ps and Nintendo are just consoles. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if MS tries to buy a streaming service too( someone mentioned interest in 1 but I forget which one it was) and turn game pass into a super multi media service 
---
Either way though , I hope they don‚Äôt so PS+MS can end the war and allow cross play on all games
---
The Daily Ops usually end up showing completed when you complete them. That's pretty much exactly how they're supposed to work. You either forgot the schedule or never knew it to begin with. That's not really a bug. Just a fundamental lack of understanding of how clocks work. Thankfully, I was able to help provide you with that knowledge. A more well-mannered person would have just said thank you, but, well... here we are.
---
That sucks, hopefully They are aware of the issue and working on it
---
Yeeees! I mean, we speak English but my daughter is definitely better at it than me. üòÇ
---
Lifegiver is a 2 perk base card
---
This is a core mechanic of workshops, and you don't need to engage in PvP while participating. I'll frequently claim workshops to get plans, defend them when the waves attack, and handwave if someone else wishes to claim them. Usually they're doing it for a daily or weekly challenge, will fail to defend it, and then I'll swoop back in to reacquire it in my spare time.
---
With so many other sources for resources, you shouldn't be relying on workshops if you're not interested in PvP. As a heads up, you can tag particular resources so that junk items containing them are flagged for you in-game. On Xbox and PC using a controller, it's a right thumbstick press, I believe. It'll help you narrow down the  junk that you'll want to pick up for specific materials.
---
Thanks for confirming that this isn't possible. Not a big fan of this being implemented this way my personal opinion
---
No build will become viable to you hit level 50 and you still might need some more levels just to get the perk cards u still might need.
---
 hopefully probably wont get addressed until patch 27 or who knows when, they are definitely not the hair when it comes to fixes.
---
So many pumpkins to carve.  So little time

You need to always have a supply of Cram, so if this happens again you can give her a cramburger

Hi, Todd! üòÇ
---
I'll be on in a couple of hours, we can play together!
---
This guy knows what's up.
---
Some stuff isn't in the game because it takes places 200 years before Fallout 4, not that that explains everything...
---
Posting to follow.
---
I was considering switching from junkies myself. My junkies heated sharp rocket sledge just didn't seem to differ much from a vanilla one unmodded one since nerf. Might switch to furious or something.
---
Glad to hear we have a new wanderer.  This game my whole family loves playing from the wife to the 6-year-old.  Feel free to add me if you ever wanna play my tag is LyricDragon7001
---
You better take it back.
---
Okay, I‚Äôll try once more to explain:
---
12:55 - fight super mutants finish in 6 minutes 
---
1:03 - (after I loot my ammo) I see that the daily op has updated to robots and already said ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù
---
2:30(ish): fight the robots, finish in 8 minutes, still says elder is already compete 
---
No rare rewards. And since you don‚Äôt even understand now the rare rewards work maybe you aren‚Äôt the authority you think?
---
This is false, the practice of charging for updates ended with last gen consoles.
---
I‚Äôve been using the slug buster just to fuck around with.  I can usually do a couple of daily ops before I need to repair.   By couple I‚Äôd say 4-5 of them.
---
I dont know that it is purely visual, i use gatling lasers and ot will reload sometimes and ill end up with an extra fusion core with a percentage that is what that number that popped up. So itll reload and then pop as 256 and ill have a new fusion core at like 51%.
---
The game uses a slap system. Taking a claim from another player is a slap.
---
absolutely, it might take me a while to gather the items I will need to craft together your care package but not to long
---
Melee is sick dude u bash people‚Äôs faces in- I‚Äôm a high level melee and have no regrets except sometimes it takes a minute to get a scorchbeast to land
---
Lol there should be a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here for the daily build up a workshop score challenge, give me 5 minutes and it‚Äôs yours‚Äù option.
---
You're on Xbox too? I'll add you as soon as I get online!
---
Can we get a point and laugh emote for anyone we see running around in a ghillie suit or the new horrible looking bos spec ops stuff. I didn't realise this game was the division all of a sudden.
---
Mmmk
---
I don't think so (at least first one). It would be kinda dumb if we lost access to it after we customized it just because we didn't subscribed to F01.
---
Was not aware of that. Thanks for the info!
---
It cures your diseases. One at a time. Free. As many times as you want.
---
Thank you for your reply. In my opinion this is annoying to have progressed quite some bit and then an enemy kills you and you have to go all the way back (some inside places are big) from the entrance of any cave etc -repeat each time you die. I guess opinions will divide on the way this has been implemented. But thank you again for confirming this is by design. I was wondering if I am missing something.
---
I just dump those on people begging for cores, here ya go have 20 cores at 5%. And when I say begging I dont mean people asking nicely just the once, which ill often toss them 2 or 3 full cores for their PA. I mean the gimme gimme kids.
---
Can you explain what a mule character is?
---
I'm wondering if you realize it's possible to not receive rare rewards from Elder Rank. Many, many people can confirm that.
---
It's not cool..this makes me wonder if Beth can even fix/ patch this at the end of the day I'm ok with people having good gear and guns but "magic" weapons is probably where I would draw a line and say we can do without...legacy's are - op - to a point but not like this
---
First run I had today we made to the boss but got over run with the adds an couldn‚Äôt take him down in time for 8 mins 
---
Second run bot got stuck in a wall an we couldn‚Äôt kill it to summon boss boy was it draining my will to live at this point lol 
---
3rd run went off with out a hitch an I got the symptomatic so I guess it worked out in the end lol
---
If the team is full and not doing anything, anybody on said team still interested will swap to a new one if you make it, stop thinking you can tell people what to do, because you can't.
---
Maybe that's a Gatling bug because I definitely shoot all 25 shots from my handmade.
---
That gotta be annoying.
---
I got the reactor plan yesterday. I thaught it was pretty lucky
---
Nah I don't think so. Unless this bug also spawns used fusion cores into your inventory.
---
No problem :)
---
Sorry, was meant as a reply to the comment under mine, you requested something not outright told what to do.
---
It can be, especially when you are left with a bunch of extra cores at like 10% or below. I save them for the eventual turnover into ultracite cores, caise all ot cares are cores not charge.
---
Need more info
---
PvP engages at, what, 5? I know that there's a popup that occurs when it is enabled for a character, but I cannot recall if it mentions the pacifist toggle. \[**Edit:** [tokesone9 notes that the dialog does include some verbiage about pacifist.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iz4480/question_about_camps_and_pacifist_mode/g6gme78/)\] I know didn't learn of it until recently (and nearly level 150!) and only because it was mentioned on Reddit.
---
There's so much information to absorb early in the game that I can understand why many people are not aware of it.
---
I have proof, a clip, a before picture, a username, a gt, and you can check my inventory and I can take pictures of my stahsbox
---
It's possible. I'm running 20% health as a Bloodied Commando and the only perk I use to mitigate damage is Serendipity. Use cover, avoid being an easy target. Don't get bogged down by enemies and move quickly. I run in a Team of 4 Bloodied guys and as annoying as resilient is we still manage to tank hits and get it done in under 8
---
I think Howard has been an easy punching bag. I believe he's the in between point between the creative/money side. Being he's also someone who is loved by the community he is often the most visible and takes the most heat. I suspect having microsoft at the financial helm has given him much relief. I'm hoping it's the case simply because I loved the community crush on him. It's endearing of a man who's run an amazing company and made some amazing games.
---
Personally, I'd just forgo Carnivore/Herbivore and use the Crit damage buffing foods with Awesome Possum Bacon for the best effect.  But that's me.
---
I've done it twice this morning, another time in the afternoon and legit 2 times just now back 2 back . It keeps popping up when I'm in that region?
---
Dude that‚Äôs literally fucking wrong
---
Because it would break the game, give people god mode, or let people have infinite stash.
---
Are you really crafting your cores instead of just collecting them?
---
Playing together will be great, with or without any care package! ‚ù§
---
Welp, skipping NW today lol
---
No chance in hell on getting that on Xbox
---
FO First user go brrrrrrrrrrrt, inventory full, place tent, use junkstash, continue brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
---
I can get through an entire queen fight with my ultracite gatling laser breaking only once, and I don‚Äôt use gunsmith. Is it two shot or a legacy explosive, or both? If it is then there‚Äôs your answer
---
The only 2 weapons I feel are magic is a J25 LMG and J25 UGL.  A V50L minigun with accelerated barrel is questionable - doesn't seem strong vs. the SBQ but probably better than a V-something else version?  Who knows.
---
Magic weapons seem to have gotten quite a reputation but they're hardly magical - the other exploits like god mode bug previously and other stuff plus those that stack stuff can probably output more damage.
---
No it‚Äôs not
---
Google angry turtle magic weapons for the run down.  
---
Just don‚Äôt get to comfortable with it.   I‚Äôm sure one day it gets fixed.  Right?  Lol.
---
Beefy my dude, let me help you: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ite4rn/daily_ops_guide_and_datamined_complete_rewards/
---
Elder has the highest probability of an award
---
I just discovered today that you can bash the robots to finish them off. Just shoot them until they are at their lowest health and bash them with you weapon. Works on the end-boss as wellüôÇ No need to bring a melee weapon!
---
Game sharing does not carry over fallout first. 
---
Fallout first is account based.
---
I would also add to make sure you aren't checking the stats on the TSE while you have the bloodied equipped.  Often applies the bloodied modifier to the numbers shown for weapons that aren't if you are holding one.
---
You do realize that some players can't craft fusion cores and need the shops, right?
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty cringey to use them on purpose but as long as they aren‚Äôt killing bosses in 5 seconds or hoarding every enemy I don‚Äôt really care
---
I would love to build some kind of apiary.
---
Seconded. With the exception of an occasional seeker missile to a Scorchbeast I would never discount smashing things with my hammer.
---
Coming right up! First version will be the exact same model and texture just a slightly darker blue, oh and it will cost 1200 atoms.
---
Feed any missiles, mini nukes and 40mm grenades into the anno converter they are pointless weight
---
And it's also possible to not receive a rare reward at all from Elder Rank. Thank you for proving my point!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure your FPS has to be high. I‚Äôve had my guns accidentally trigger it when I‚Äôm walking around somewhere and not lagging but my normal Xbox one doesn‚Äôt like boss fights
---
you could try your luck submitting a ticket.
---
I think It does tell u to enable it.  I know once I hit level 5 and got that message I went to options and pacifist was turned on and stayed on.
---
Regular barrel, or tri barrel?
---
Where do I do this?
---
oh yeah for sure there are plenty of big places, the burrows come to mind. In my personal opinion I feel it would be too easy but I understand its tedious to run all the way back. especially in those silos. and yeah it definitely is by design. fo76 differs from the others seeing as you can't save but i find that you die alot less in this game than others, somewhat mitigating the no saves. especially late game. best of luck to you though. :)
---
Wow... dude, there's a 20% chance to not get a reward from Elder Rank. Do you know ANYTHING about Daily Ops?
---
Does that guaranteed take them down?
---
If you stop by toxic larrys be sure to stop my my camp! Located just north and prices are dirt cheap :D like 25-75 cap legendaries
---
Sorry that happened to you fella ):
---
Yea.  Not a fan myself. I love PVP just not in this game.  NW is ok for what it is but they won‚Äôt do anything about all the dam hackers.
---
Thank you again for taking your time to reply . Really appreciated. Best wishes to you too :)
---
Jokes on you. I‚Äôve been capped out on caps for months.
---
just RNG.
---
Lmfao who are these guerilla shoppers and when are they stopping by my CAMP
---
If I joined a daily ops I don‚Äôt think the word ‚Äúhelping‚Äù would be applied to my contributions. üòÇ
---
Throwing weapons would be nice if they counted (which they don't) it would be a good way to increase their uses from 0 to 1
---
Right, but I‚Äôm wondering if by me gamesharing it bugs theirs, because it will not let them purchased the FO1 sub. They get a message saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúalready owned‚Äù
---
I've never crafted a core.
---
I love those days. 
---
It happens.
---
About once a week.
---
Chloe gets bugged sometimes and gives a neverending amount of dailies too.
---
Just enjoy the easy scrip when it happens.
---
Rare plan my ass!
---
? I‚Äôve not swapped my build since around 130. Little tweak here and there but that‚Äôs bout it.
---
Curious about this as well! I have played bloodied on my main but wanted to try something different on the alt, and was curious what other builds like junkies hold up vs bloodied!
---
Out of curiosity, how do you get 100% cores?
---
Not sure. It shouldn‚Äôt though because I have a friend who game shares with his wife and they both were able to get fallout first by buying it on their own accounts.
---
This is on PS4
---
Don't trade outside of the reddit market.
---
Here come the flash backs
---
I am straight up laughing my ass off now. There have been so many posts about people going DAYS without Elder Rank rewards. And you've thought they were guaranteed this whole time.
---
My family all play games. Got my 7 year old a Xbox at Xmas and my 4 year old helps me to cook and she always know now when a nuke is coming in. She hears the voice and then she shout queens coming lol.
---
If you're able to, go instigating with 40 power attack dmg. Appreciate they're kinda hard to find but my baseball bat does the trick for most walking around :)
---
If you're thinking for longer fights I recommend anti armour
---
Because it removes yet another small layer of difficulty. If you can plant all crops at your camp, you dont have to put in any effort whatsoever to make cranberry relish for instance. 
---
There are some aspects of this game that should require small amounts of effort.
---
&gt;One Violent Night is an XP goldmine
---
&gt; **One Violent Night is an XP goldmine** 
---
While not word for word, I could see how one would read the thread title, and think someone is saying its an optimal way to farm EXP.
---
It was in the reddit market, my biggest flaw is that I‚Äôm too trusting and always give people a chance I‚Äôm I‚Äôve always hated myself for it but especially now
---
Yes, I literally have multiple comments talking about how I‚Äôve only got rewards 2 days so far, I‚Äôm saying today it auto competed so I didn‚Äôt even have the opportunity.
---
You are really effing dumb
---
Edit: and it‚Äôs in the content of my post, that I have only got 3 rewards so far. (the comments were from the day before yesterday and i did get one yesterday, actually got 2) 
---
How are you this dense?
---
Yes, but then you'd need to glitch DO.
---
Yup that's what I'mma do I guess lmao just wish it wasn't radstag hunting over and over üò≠
---
You''ll be fine on console.
---
As others have mentioned, any crafted item requiring legendary modules is not affected by perk cards. (super duper, armorer, etc.)
---
Yep, i‚Äôve taken some inspiration from many of the camps i‚Äôve visited.
---
Also, it may be obvious but it doesn't work if you hop in PA. Can cause issues if you're a hoarder and need to get into PA for a nuke zone or something.
---
thanks,but i got an ingame trade...appreciated though
---
yeah, it didn't autocomplete. you ran an op and didn't get a reward. case closed.
---
I'm on reddit daily and never saw anyone ask this question. My bad.
---
For commando, bloodied is still king. For rifleman probably the same though I haven't tested it myself. 
---
For unarmed melee... I'll level with you, its piss poor no matter what you do. Unless they fix melee, you might as well leave your powerfist to gather dust :(
---
ok ok ok, will do. cant use them for a while anyway
---
This. Caps are kinda worthless for endgame players. If you want anything good, you have to trade for it on a forum.
---
Weapon weight reduction armor pieces stack up to a total of 90%, i.e. 4 pieces give 80% total and adding a 5th tops off the effect at 90%. This affects all weapons in your inventory, but like with all other weight reduction effects it does not influence the weight of items in your stash.
---
Yeah, but that's a glitch... It would be nice to have REAL interior walls meant for that exact purpose
---
No offense but BBBOOORRRRRRIIINNNGGGG subject over-complained about for no real reason.
---
Still looking for a good two shot launcher, but yeah if you carry enough missiles and use a targeting computer it makes it easier, especially since legendary SB's rarely land in my experience. Demo expert doesn't weigh too have on my melee build at all, so they synced well for me. Especially if you throw grenades.
---
Yea, it is. Hes streamed the entire thing.
---
Noooo it competed before I ever ran the robots. I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so hard for you to understand? And when the mutants rewards came up it had said already achieved.
---
That is the specific bug I‚Äôm taking about. As it clearly mentions in the post, I am fully aware how rewards work and you don‚Äôt get them everyday.
---
Are you arguing fallout isn‚Äôt buggy? I can see a moron like you taking that stance
---
Needing the workshops might be a bit extreme. I cannot craft fusion cores and I'm frequently swimming in them. I don't purchase from players or vendors nor use the power plant processors, so they're all from casual interaction with the world or completion of quests. I also often see them placed on player vendors for exceedingly cheap.
---
It's far less efficient to generate them at a workshop than to identify power armor locations and then loot them in a circuit. A processor will only craft one every ten minutes or so, and can only retain three. Even considering that they're at full capacity, you're looking at 300 energy units over about 25 minutes -- during which time you're vulnerable to attack **only** if you remain on-site.
---
[The Fallout wiki at Gamepedia has a great list of power armor locations](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_power_armor_locations) that may be helpful.
---
**Edit:** Oh, and I forgot fusion generators! Though I have seem to have less success finding fusion cores there than on power armor.
---
ok will do, time to sell the ammo like everyone else. wait so anything i pick up from an overseer's cache was donated by other players? ooo. wow. i'd really like to switch from ps4 to PC but im' not willing to shell out for the cost of another copy. ugh.
---
You literally are building your own vault. The game is literally about vaults. You can already build outside in the world. 
---
I don‚Äôt even understand your complaint lol
---
I have heard that you can use the throwable weapons for the last hit, but i have yet to yet it myself
---
Not sure how we got on the topic of fusion generator.......but a new player might not know that the plan can also be had by doing any of the "powering up..." quests several times. Only for cost of ammo!
---
I don‚Äôt think they will to but just wanted to toss that in lol. The purchase in my opinion means nothing lol but i think since it will be in Microsoft‚Äôs hands there will be a greater possibility of cross play. I wanna play 76 with my Xbox buddys. I‚Äôm in a huge clan on all the platforms and havnt been able to play with any of the others
---
If I do multiple daily Ops and the team doesn't join, I'll just kick them, maybe server hop. I got rid of my legacy for the repair kits. I almost always need backup in daily ops now (just for the boss though).
---
Not to mention that the game is about vaults, so building your own vault ties into going underground perfectly.
---
I heard that only works when you have a melee weapon equipped but I also haven't bothered testing.
---
That's adorable! And really handy üòÇ‚ù§
---
I have a furious, salted, 90% reduced weight tenderizer. What is the caps value?
---
Go and check how many of them are at 100% .)
---
Yoo Why You running uny on a junkies unarmed? i'm in the middle of switching to junkies unarmed, i got my jss1s pf/dcg/knuckles and j pa 1s dcg with je fr and jff fr lmg on the side. not gonna fully commit until i got a full van sent ap set tho. Any tips on dmg buffs?
---
30 minutes of level 75 feral ghouls isn't an optimal way to farm XP?
---
NEVER TURN OFF PACIFIST.  Just don't. Don't.
---
I love when people nuke the Whitesprings! There are plenty of safe spots to pick off ghouls.
---
Neither, sbq fight has gotten much more difficult after the update. There are an enormous amount of ads and if you don't have 6+ people there I don't know how your guns don't break.
---
Sorry... but you won‚Äôt even hit level 30 after 10 hours. If you don‚Äôt want a grind this game isn‚Äôt the move
---
Find them. But I don't use cores, so it's not an issue.
---
Alright thanks, thats kinda what I was afraid of.  I dont have all that gear.  Will look into it.
---
Haha, that was me. ü§£
---
And later for someone this might be not enough and will ask for more...
---
That might be fun...assuming your camp wasn't under it.
---
(I am level 100 and have never used a nuke.)
---
Thanks, helpful info.
---
He probably means people like me hadnt heard about that yet.
---
I hate it.  I‚Äôll just skip the Resilient op unless my buddies want to run it.  A vampire flamer is too thirsty.
---
Thanks, all. Your excellent answers made it very clear!
---
U/wasteland veteran said it was the future tek camp skin causing issues with allies. I will try later.
---
The level 100 mole rats are my biggest gripe. They‚Äôre already the most annoying enemy, now they‚Äôre just kind of ridiculous. They need to be scaled down.
---
Bro, you haven't "clearly mentioned" anything from word one.
---
They should allow it. People should be allowed to do whatever they want with their camps. It‚Äôs their camp not yours lol.
---
Just like that i can build a camp outside right now and hide my vendors, so you can‚Äôt even find them or access them.
---
Do you not? I get flooded with stimpacks during daily ops
---
I'm in a T-51b suit with emergency protocols though
---
I was wondering why my weapons would suddenly feel slower to reload.. I kept checking my mutations to see if Speed Demon was still there because of it, good to know it‚Äôs a bug I guess
---
Oh it sucks, believe me. I completely agree but for as long as games been out it‚Äôs done this. So that‚Äôs why I say it won‚Äôt get fixed
---
Not true, it depends on the weapon type. Things like hunting rifles and pipe pistols can be level 5 but they go up to level 50
---
Umless you use gatling lasers or gatling plasma of course. The return on cores isn't as high.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the neon signs are atom shop exclusive so it‚Äôs not tradable.
---
Sweet!  I have yet to see a Skywalk until now.  Very original.
---
It definitely is I‚Äôve been out of the room and suddenly hear screaming QUEENS COMING!!! Haha. She nearly knows the name of every creature as well by time she‚Äôs old enough she will be fully ready for her own experience of fallout playing a long side me üòÇ
---
Well damn I was told it didn't..... probably should have looked into that one more so that's on me... I guess its going up on my priorities a bit even tho I may just keep the Stealth helmet. Thanks!
---
Eh, just gun bash the mobs to finish them off if you don't have a pair of knuckles handy. Sure, it's annoying when you're trying to solo the daily ops because finishing off near-dead mobs forces you away from the uplinks. But then the ops aren't really intended to be soloed, and on a team of 4, having a dedicated finisher for outlying mobs reliably keeps three people around the uplinks. And with how straightforward the Galleria is, even a PUG team without voice comms should be able to slide in under 7 minutes.
---
I personally find Freezing a whole lot more annoying, to be frank.
---
I imagine this is because of technical issues.
---
Most aren't, I agree. However I can assure you that I generate more than 300 units of power (three fusion cores at 100% from the processors) in twenty-five minutes by doing a power armor circuit. Most are 25%, which means that I'd need to find at most 12 in the same time.
---
And there's nothing preventing me from doing both simultaneously!
---
I'd also mention that you're only prone to attack while physically at the workshop. OP's concern seems to be predominately with high level players attacking them. As long as you visit the workshop every once in a while to scoop up fusion cores, you avoid the issue of being ganked.
---
Ohhh it‚Äôs a thing I have too It let‚Äôs you fire all of the rounds but it displays a number right befor you reload
---
\+1
---
YES PLEASE!
---
You may it have it all now but you can keep it in mind and keep an eye open for it. If you have ss plans start keeping vanguard and troubleshooter rolls you find, and also keep an eye open for decent melee rolls (like instigating or anti armor)
---
If you did last years halloween event, you can carve pumpkins - (There's a plan just about any one you see at the pumkin house.)  I suspect some carved pumpkin plans may be going up for sale before long.  Same with the pumpkin rack plans.
---
You can also make pumpkin grenades, pumpkin pie, or pumpkin soup....
---
‚ÄúSeeing as I‚Äôve gotten three rewards besides being elder everyday‚Äù is In the main post.
---
The same way you didn‚Äôt understand the mechanics of daily ops and thought the rare rewards were repeatable you got this wrong. It‚Äôs an easy fix, just read more carefully.
---
Yea didn‚Äôt even realize Bethesda increased the weight went and took 100 of those out and now I‚Äôm 100 pounds over weight.
---
Same here, and gail has a huge one.
---
Get yourself a gamma gun, shoot at your feet.
---
I just hold on to them until the next day.
---
I've already sacrificed several IQ points to this disaster of a non-issue.
---
The armor you use is up to you, the unyielding is mainly because I run a bloodied junkies, its kind of like a back up plan if my health gets low I can take out whatever it is hopefully before it kills me. Just like Radicool. At some point I do plan on doing Vanguards with Secret Service but that‚Äôll be when I have the prefixes I want on it. I don‚Äôt run a lot of buffs outside of mutation stuff but I would say if you wanna constantly take chems that increase strength or melee damage, then I‚Äôd recommend trying to get the perk card that stops you getting addictions, you can run it with your set of addictions and you won‚Äôt get anymore after that, acts like starched genes. I know cooked glowing meat is usually a good food for increasing melee damage. As said I usually some times don‚Äôt run buffs (and since the one wasteland, haven‚Äôt really needed too yet,) but I would say check a few wikis on food/drinks and see what would fit into your build. Nukashine would be a great drink if it didnt teleport you across the map lol.
---
yeah you probably start to save up to 200 stable fux of some kind or weapon of similar tier lmao
---
Isnt that a call of duty map?
---
Yes, normal spoilage in PA. I stay out of PA as much as possible, don't like the clunky feel. I only spend a lot of time in PA when collecting flux.
---
I agree it‚Äôs a non issue, but man you didn‚Äôt have much to give, sorry about that.
---
Live and learn I guess. 
---
Also don‚Äôt place your camp next to a workshop that you claim. Seen people loose their camp because the contending mechanism of workshops overload pacifist. Apparently you can build you camp in a region that is still inside the pvp zone of the workshop.
---
They're available out in the wild sometimes. They're also rewarded from quests. Offhand, I know that Line in the Sand rewards you with two 100% fusion cores. And while you're there, be efficient and grab that fusion core at Fort Defiance!
---
Will they be paid?
---
That is the exact type of "bar area" I have planned for my CAMP when I get the greenhouse set. Holy shit it looks amazing.
---
It could be, but it didn't reset at all.
---
Should go without saying...you using butchers bounty and green thumb?
---
I recently looked up the real morgantown map, and while I agree, it feels pretty big as it is, especially for NW. But even if they padded it out with a few extra streets of residential homes or apartment buildings it would feel much bigger.
---
They are in case you dropped it by accident but didn't learn it :)
---
Yeah first thing I did on the first day was equip pain train and was miffed it didn't work.
---
It should absolutely count as melee to finish them off.
---
You are the best!
---
Thanks for the response, I wish I knew the correct name. I missed my opportunity at watoga last night but it went for 10k caps.
---
If you want a hand getting into the swing of the game, check out r/PKOA. We‚Äôll be able to help with anything you could need!
---
probably the bethesda website. 
---
or google something like fallout 76 support ticket
---
I made a ticket
---
Here you find it. I think it was 10k caps.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Signs_and_letters
---
They aren't
---
I've only explored maybe 75% of the map, so I wasn't trying to come off as complaining about the current map size. I just wondered about the borders and which direction may be the most likely to be expanded, if at all.
---
It is really expensive but looks cool. As an alternative you could wear the reclaimed miner helmet from ACP ;-)
---
Thanks for the clarification! It has been a while since I leveled up my first character, and I'm ashamed to admit that I immediately closed every popup when starting my new character on PC.
---
Personally I think you should be able to use legendary modules on any weapon craft.   Not just the new ones.   Would make it a lot better I think.  I don‚Äôt think they would ever take a way the roll...but would be nice.
---
The open sign and blue neon letters are a plan you can find on Grahm or at some of the whitespring vendors. It's just not always there.
---
She'll be teaching you new things in the game, you just wait üòÇ
---
If you have any proof of this happening you can get the player blacklisted from the market usually. 
---
Also always check the blacklist before interacting with anyone. Some blacklisted layers will creat new alts to sneak back into the market and continue to scam. This is why the karma score is important.
---
My mom started playing games recently as well. I facepalm most of the time when she screams when running into a rad roach.
---
I don‚Äôt love Junkies builds for rifles because you can‚Äôt get the most out of the grenade buff without missing out on rifle perks in perception.
---
I have picture and a clip. But the clip was taken less than 10 seconds too late and I feel like I‚Äôm gonna jump out of a window. Yo soy idiot numero uno
---
Thanks! I've already joined! ‚ù§
---
Oh nice, do I need to destroy and then repair one to place the 2nd or can I just slap em both right on?
---
We need a plushie for it, kinda like the big sheepsquatch plushie from season1, that requires a jumbo fuzzy to craft.
---
Or maybe instead of the terminal giving us the jumbo fuzzy it gives us a plan to make it.
---
I did go north once and made it to the border of the screen when I clipped through the ground and started sinking. There is a huge expanse of wooded terrain that could handle several morgantowns.
---
Open up a chat with one of the mods of the market and see what they think.
---
Half the time no one kills me so I have to fast travel to my teammate and tell them to shoot me in the face
---
This shits easy man. I'm bloodied and use serendipity and dodgy to tank countless shots as I slice an dice the robots with my dcg. Teammates just bring em down to low hp.
---
Damn you android
---
Thank you very much ü§£‚úåÔ∏è
---
We already see what this ''door'' looks like. It was in the Inside the Vault which mentioned shelters for the first time.
---
It's the hardest daily op for sure but I'm up for the challenge.
---
When searching, make sure you have buffs towards Charisma + Lv.3 Hard Bargain and the Legendary Charisma Perk equipped.  It'll redue the 10k Caps price to I'm guesstimating 8k Caps.
---
The plan is sold by vendors for 10k caps
---
Maybe it's time to move.
---
Yup! It's just finding the radstag sometimes they just either dead from fighting other creatues or they flat out don't respawn
---
Thanks a lot ü§£ When you are finished, please let me know..I love to see other camps üëç
---
Getting food served from a player in his camp should have some result like +2 charisma for 2hrs or something ... so players could reward each other with social interaction...
---
How long has it been in the PTS? Do you think it'll be here soon?
---
I have two minmax characters - bloodied commando and junkies PA heavy gunner. To me the PA heavy gunner is more fun in one wasteland because it still hits hard while being tanky and durable so I don't have to sneak around avoiding damage.
---
It is an interesting thought until I remind you that some people will just dup the legendary modules and get what they want expect they will just dup the weapon or armor instead. Before something like this would be useful, dupping exploits need to be removed first.
---
Good perspective on these I honestly appreciate people that make me reconsider and double check all the effects, especially because I'm half melee. I did end up choosing to go with Egg Head because with strange in number and class freak my negatives are -1 but I get +8 and the XP bonus from INT is helping me farm out those Legendary Perk Coins.   
---
So far bird bones has been a slight detriment (very slight with class freak but noticeable), I ended up swapping a perk card to get the level 1 Adamantium skeleton.  
---
I'm going to test Eagle Eye for crit damage with melee later since with punching melee I can still fairly easily target the head on most creatures.   
---
Thankfully I was smart enough at the time to buy multiples of mutations so I can clear them and start over if I find one I truly hate.
---
If you join a daily ops team, check to make sure everyone is ready before you start.
---
Is it ever gonna snow in Appalachia?
---
Cool idea but players would sqiftly obtain god tier everything and then likely burn out on the game faster than otherwise. 
---
For that reason i doubt Bethesda would ever accommodate something like this.
---
might need therapy. it certainly worked for me.
---
Finally a use for that Nocturnal legendary coding and they don't use it!
---
I don't even know. I can't say I've ever had anything like that happen before. I've lost a few caps here and there because of being maxed out. 
---
They went black Friday shopping today in my CAMP I guess.
---
This post will self destroy in 10 seconds.. 9..8..7..
---
Bloodied builds were nerfed recently.
---
haha - you've been as wrong as I've been the entire time. so you can insult my intelligence all you want, but you and I are on the same level, chief.
---
Hey [u/Ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ladydevann/) I'm sure you love bee's as much as I do and would also love to see them in your C.A.M.P. :)
---
Robots?
---
This is so wholesome.
---
where is the "railing" from on the skywalk?
---
I used conduits for it üòÅü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I crafted some and sold them in my vendor fast for 250, and a little slower for 450 (only made &lt;10, was getting tight on adhesive) . It's a fun weapon, legendary or no, someone will pay you more than 11 caps.
---
I really want to get cats at my camp (and have them be unkillable)
---
Doesn't the tattered mole head give DR 1? Or am I thinking something else.
---
I just laugh, because I know death is coming, hahaha. Although with the gun my daughter gave I fear no more! üòÇ
---
/boo xD
---
I'll take one, will drop you a couple of each flux.
---
I bought the plans for 750 caps last week from another player.  I had no idea that I was getting such a good deal.
---
The large neon letters are onsale in the Atomic Shop this week.  I think they're marked down from 700 to 490 atoms.
---
Join me pisdoffpizaboy
---
We should be able to scrap legendaries,  learn the effects and then craft whatever we want using 2 or 3 legendary modules.
---
I'm sure it is in the game files, I can only image me it was taken out because of a bug or exploit and never fixed.
---
This is amazing! I ran the first part and came across several good tamables! Thank you for this and all your help with the other stuff!
---
I like it, adds a challange and encourages teamwork.
---
I done the same thing. For my Junkie PA I have a Junkies FFR Gauss Minigun as my primary and a Vampires FFR Gauss Minigun for when I need to heal during battle. No matter what is happening, using the Vamp mini heals faster that damage taken and feels so bad ass.
---
where are they from, then? I've never seen that item before.
---
They are all rubbish and don't do as much damage as regular guns
---
uhm, you can "use" them? Its playing anims (like playing an instrument), when you trigger "play" on it.
---
I hadn't even done Burrows before Ops came out, and it was the 1st Op I did. I was pretty lost there for a bit.
---
Is it 10 single items or 10 stacks of item? Like would 10 cranberry relish fill the whole fridge or just 1 slot?
---
I've had it glitch twice today so the op doesn't progress. It sits at the boost alpha stage. Kinda irritating.
---
Shelter probably won't cost anything budget wise.
---
yeah they would need to fix them, though with a system like this trying to find such a thing would be less common cuz you can just 100% chance the gear by stockpiling stuff.
---
I WANT ALL THE PUMPKINS I fuckin love fall and the decorations I love the color of the trees I love the seasonal candles and I love pumpkins
---
hehe thanks for the reply m8 :) i got a feeling they are gonna buff unarmed a little in the future, not 10k dmg but would be nice with just a little bit more lol
---
You can toss/donate ammo that doesn't sell well or at all. I used to keep syringer ammo and railway spikes on my vendors, but they were never purchased by players. I also immediately dump flares, cannonballs, missiles, mini nukes and other high weight ammo -- everything on a vendor contributes to your stash allotment, and they rarely sell as well while taking up considerably more space.
---
&gt;wait so anything i pick up from an overseer's cache was donated by other players?
---
Not everything! If you see items that other than the normal fare (low caliber ammo, water, food, and basic plans), then it's likely contributed by a player.
---
&gt;i'd really like to switch from ps4 to PC but im' not willing to shell out for the cost of another copy. ugh.
---
I got lucky. I'm on the Game Pass for Xbox, so my swap is essentially "free." I still play on both platforms, but I'm hoping that Win 10/Xbox crossplay is now and finally going to become feasible, since Playstation's unwillingness to participate is supposedly why crossplay doesn't exist.
---
I'd be in trouble if they ever remove the game from the Game Pass, but -- with Microsoft's recent acquisition of Bethesda -- that seems unlikely.
---
It's in its nature to destroy itself
---
yeah, the second half of the first paragraph notes that as an idea. at the very least players should be able to craft them as random legendaries.
---
No clue. Usually details help with this kind of thing but I seem to be selectively blind right now.
---
I wonder if welded rebar works. Just gun them to 1 hp, get close and let them melee you
---
We can only hope, at least for now its not super nerfed like most weapons got with the one Wasteland patch, and most of the legendary perks (hack and slash, exploding palm) are hella good xD
---
I'm not sure but I mean the name from the plan is "advanved power connectors". You can buy it from all ingame vendors ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Be there in a minute, my TV had to update.
---
players should not be allowed to craft the exact weapon they're about to dupe 100 of...
---
It hasn't - it's going to be there soon. And it will be added into the main game along with Steel Dawn in Patch 24 (November-December according to the [roadmap](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4kRrC6daJSw0g4s5KpHdAS/48e7143814678898dcbd77dfdfbd389e/Fallout76_Season2_CommunityCalendar-EN-05.jpg)).
---
So you want another currency? Hard pass.
---
Being able to choose the rolls at that level is overkill. 
---
Just allow the option to craft ‚Äòstandard weapons‚Äô as legendary rolls, just like the new ones. 
---
They could even have new plans added in that we‚Äôd have to go track down.
---
*‚ÄòPlan: Legendary Super Sledge‚Äô*
---
Give it its own category and just have the same cost as the normal version but cost 2 Legendary Modules. You‚Äôll get a random number of stars, but you‚Äôll get them on your weapon of choice. 
---
Beats getting another AA/FFR/90RW Western Revolver and wishing it was a .50 cal...
---
You are a good wastelander, I would definitely appreciate that üôè
---
It's not bad, bashing seems best way to got.
---
What is bad though are bugs,
---
if you have Melee weapon with elemental effect, if elemental effect is applied first, enemy will not die, I couldn't kill a single enemy with Flamer Chainsaw and it took 2-3 hits with Shishkebab, while simply bashing with .50 cal killed them on first hit
---
I was excited for mine as well, then I scrapper him together with the other junk like the Idiot i am.
---
I figure you can not put him in a display case? Just like Mr. Jangles, the moon monkey? üòï
---
Hello? Todd?!
---
WE NEED CRANBERRIES PLEASE
---
Nice camp, mine is located here too, but yours is nicer
---
I too feel that pain
---
Under power connectors it's the pipe use to connect a power grid.
---
Seen these used before but they can be a pain to get just right at first.
---
there goes the neighborhood, first its your camp then the rest of us.
---
Yeah, can't wait to try them out :p
---
Are you actually bashing or just running until enemies when it spins? I never thought to do the latter. That‚Äôs interesting.
---
Considering that speed demon is the only mutation that I have, this sucks 100%
---
youre welcome and good luck woth your build üëçüèº
---
interesting - I will have to check this out.
---
Whats up gt
---
But the thirst zapper is a pre-war weapon. Probably found in nuka world for the most part, but itd make sense for the nuka cola plant to have some as promotional items or something
---
thank you, do you have maybe a picture from it üòÅ
---
Same.after the 6th magic heavy ,I stopped going for them. They just don't work on bosses for me,destory everything else.
---
Preach it brother!
---
I'm running the powerfist like 80% of the time too.  Maybe it's the Gauss Rifle, but it's not enjoyable shooting it.
---
oOh... Thank you very much. I thought my character had developed a natural lead belly.
---
It ment to hurt, it's just sometimes it misses you
---
My exploding bullets always hurt me if I'm close enough to the area of attack. Which is better than my Gauss Shotgun, which ends up with me 1-shotting myself.
---
Their 100% a recommendation from me. I‚Äôm pretty sure hack and slashes vats area of effect proc also works with exploding palm so you could have a AOE explosion. At least it seems like that but I could be wrong, either way its super nice combo to have. If your looking for other stuff to increase melee damage, you can look into Brawling Chemist legendary perk. Generates a melee damage chem, I don‚Äôt use it atm but you could in you build if you wanna increase damage.
---
Spinning the barrel, you can shoot and deal ""bash"" and ranged dmg it's really fun to play also it's break the minigun really fast but in dailyOps ? That don't work to kill any resilient mobs...
---
If you have a pet deathclaw every time it encounters an enemy and does it‚Äôs rawr it slightly damages everything in range of it. Only thing i can think of that I know damages my camp (other than hostile mobs)
---
Edit: grammer
---
Never would have expected it.glad to be proven wrong.
---
Yeah, gotta bash or melee to kill them.
---
They have means to ensure they don't double dip and work as expected
---
Bro whatever you need i got if you want anything for the whole outfit i got you
---
You can drop it anywhere, not made place for it yet. Thanks.
---
&gt; Just like Mr. Jangles, the moon monkey? üòï
---
Yup, and Giddyup Buttercup.
---
They won‚Äôt change it because one person wants it changed. When most people want it changed, they most likely would.
---
Berkeley Springs station
---
Sure for low level items, they can be level 5, but typically if they are over level 10 and end with a 5, then they will max out at 45.
---
It's supposed to hurt you.  I use the fireproof perk and dense torso mod to negate all the explosive damage I take.
---
My turrets are still hostile to any wandering Merchant and even ATHENA when she wanders into my camp which I'm sure you can imagine is quite the shit show when she starts attacking my structures because of it.
---
The critters at the meat event do though. Got all 25 in like a minute when they spawn in one clump
---
Berkley Springs Train Station
---
Well, tomorrow l will take some pictures of it, but my quality isn't that impressive, feels kinda empty too so.. but yeah tomorrow I will remember and take some pics üòâ
---
Only because of the poor hit detection system. When you "miss" and you are hitting them, that's ragequit material me
---
You playing rifleman? The gauss has a high top end dmg, but the charging really irks me. If you're sniping ideally you'd want a lever action.
---
If you're ps4 I have a couple of bloodied guns you can play with - most are commando tho, I do think I have a bloodied explosive assault rifle you could have. Don't think I mave much in the way of single shooters.
---
Gah I get so annoyed by this haha
---
It's to the point I feel like I'm just gonna sell/scrip all my armor since I prefer to do combat in my power armor 
---
Just worried I'll get annihilated instantly while I'm running around outside of it doing little errands and messing around with friends and camps and stuff
---
Also the ahole factor. The people that run forward to kill every thing before anyone else van get a shot in. I just get off those servers as it tends to be contagious.
---
Carry around enough of them till I'm at 490 weight, then slowly feed them into the machine till I'm capped, then buying more in a vicious cycle.
---
Other then that I just sell them to vendor for a pittance. Maybe someone will stumble across a nice weapon for themself. Found a Two Shot Ultracite laser gatling that way that's pretty nice.
---
What category is it under? Have a hard time finding it
---
Ahhh I wonder if robots are the only mobs that can have resilient
---
Nice. Vamps seem pretty popular since the new patch. I use a level 40 explosive gatling 90% of the time. If stuff gets really nasty I switch to either a 50 cal or a gatling plasma. Got an ultracite gatling laser for the queen.
---
So the fact that the gun in particular being explosive doesn't make much of a difference comparatively?  I just want to be able to remotely hit what I currently do with my Bloody powerfist(about 400 per) yet get my HP back.  Both big boss battles scare the piss out of me.  1 good hit or 5 seconds in the rads &amp; I'm dead.
---
Misc
---
Well you believe what you want to believe but thats what happened on my daily run two days ago
---
The site was glitched there is no red viper handmade skin.
---
Great ‚úåÔ∏è let me know when your finished. You can post it here, then I'll see it 100% üòÅ
---
Wot
---
Cool thanks!
---
Probably an atom shop skin
---
That would be a good Idea too.
---
Have you tried putting a Forceful Stock on it?
---
that happens, anyway, with or without the ability to get specific shit you want. you either burn out after finally getting all the shit you want, or you burn out on failing to get the shit you want (cuz, honestly, the possibility of getting good shit, let alone specific good shit, is effectively zero)
---
with this you wouldn't have to spend anywhere near as much time gearing a single character up, allowing players to do multiple characters and thus playstyles at once while also mitigating one of those two burnouts. granted, it should not be fast to get specific gear, but it should be a possibility.
---
plus, they could, and totally should, add new legendary effects with such a system in place. ie, an explosive variant specifically for energy weapons (and flight time weapons in general) would be nice. (ie, aoe at hit location rather than altering the projectile as it currently is). it would also allow them to experiment more with such things rather than having an unchanging list of possible mods. (ie, 4 and 5 star slots would make this system significantly more expensive even with the mock numbers i have up)
---
all that said, i just went with 50 modules as the amount for a 3 star weapon craft, they could totally double or triple that and it would be fine for time. assuming you can get 500 scrip a day to buy modules, that would be 5 days for the original amount, and 10 and 15 days for double and triple. for people who can't, the numbers go up from there. 200 scrip/day is pretty easy so with the normal amount that would be at least 12.5 days to get a 3 star. i think that would be a fair period of time to get one specifically rolled item. it ensures people will play more (to get more scrip to eventually make something very shiny) and gives players a goal to work toward if they want to.
---
Weird comment
---
The instanced camps make this more possible
---
It shouldn‚Äôt bug theirs out, I game share &amp; my friend could purchase 1st at the same time as me
---
I just bought a Troubleshooter s Explosive Shotgun, but it still doesn't sound like fun.
---

Like a 'real' companion? Unlike the current companion system?
---
May a hundred mole rats devour you while all your weapons crumble through your fingers, thee who sits idle upon this DailyOps team.
---
I wish pain train did, if it did, i would totally use it for resilient enemies.
---
Ive got 4 burrows signs from 6 ops
---
Forceful is no help on laser nor plasma rifles
---
Ha truth
---
i don't make suggestions based on bugs unless i'm suggesting ways to fix said bug. if duping is still a thing, that needs to be fixed. its existence shouldn't deny progress in the game for people who aren't using said exploit, though.... plus the existence of meta weapons ensures that such exploiters are going to do that anyway. if anything, this kind of system would negate the desire for such an exploit. since you could just make the thing some otherdipshit duped, rendering said duped items worthless.
---
Don‚Äôt sell stuff at the same time that exceeds your max caps. 
---
Sell smaller amounts and maybe cheaper
---
Got me wondering now. Lol
---
Yeah but I run Queens and Earl solo constantly and never had to repair this much. Is what it is I guess.
---
shoot robots with vamp gun. 
---
don't melee. 
---
????
---
profit
---
The ONE skimpy outfit we have is stupid expensive and horrible to look at with that bug. All it was supposed to do was look good...
---
I have a huge farm going with all plants but it sucks that I still have to go get cranberries, snaptails, bloodleafs, rhododendron and anything else plus the flowers. I hope they change this but they may not ever.
---
Eh. I‚Äôm just gonna solo it and get the completion in 30 minutes. No need for elder every day.
---
Hope the Wasteland treats you right, and that Fallout become one of your favourite games. Happy trails!
---
Water purifiers need power.  
---
That one gives 100 and less wasted materials and time to get it rather than finding the others in Overseer chests.  
---
One can easily come up with a good amount of caps by not hoarding and selling chems.
---
Welcome!  lol
---
It's kinda screwed for me this week as well and it wasn't until Monday or Tuesday, but lately even my non-legacy AA Gatling Plasma with Gunsmith 5 is breaking ridiculously faster than it used to be. I've been chewing repair kits almost as frequently as I reload the damn thing
---
I‚Äôll be adding.
---
I‚Äôll have to try some time. No idea if it‚Äôs working as intended or not for daily ops (mini gun uses wayyyy too much ammo for me to use regularly) but that sounds fun.
---
Thank you all
---
I am a gamer mama too! I taught them though. I was so much more excited to read your post than I have been to read any in a long time. I only learned reddit...for fallout76. Welcome to the club! Twitter is a great place for fallout 76!
---
This is the way.
---
The objective is to boost the signal and kill the 6 or so marked spawns + boss. Not take out the trash.
---
Deadzone is fallouts issue. Its god awful. You can move the stick like 3/16"  of an inch before it does anything.
---
Its not as bad if you play fallout everyday. But you hop games, especially fps, its very noticeable
---
I love this idea. It makes it so much easier on days when you don't have a lot of time.
---
Awesome.
---
that would be a cool alternative to increasing costs in this kind of a system. it would make it so you'd have to spend modules to craft random versions of the item, then scrap it to learn it, and then be able to make it again (for yourself or others) thus still requiring a bunch of modules to be able to specific legendaries but also allowing someone to specialize in a specific weapon/armor if they want to.
---
they could also add an entirely different system for crafting specific legendaries with the specific rolls on one of the stars being a reward from quests or a possible bit of junk that can come out of scrapping legendary items.
---
I get it's longer. But I'm definately not one of these 200 hour people. That's not a game anymore, just a waste of time treadmill
---
yeah i'm gonna see what i can fit in there hehe ty for the tips ü§ôüèª
---
Thank you üëç
---
If they melt things immediately, don't like them.
---
If they let people do their damage, then melt them after it mutates, I don't mind. Saves me ammo.
---
Except it's not, because if you cancel the reload those shots can be fired still. It may be the case that its emptying and then refilling, but it's not *just* visual.
---
I wouldn't say that too quickly
---
Yesterday I was in a server with 4 different Daily Op groups, I went between each one looking for anyone doing a daily op or at least willing to join me. None did, I just don't understand.
---
Hear me out though; spawn a friendly honey beast. The hive requires defenses.

Whitespring train station.  Top of the stairs.  I leave all sorts of items there for the community.
---
Lol, yeah, time to stock up!
---
Oh that‚Äôs actually really nice to hear about the instanced interiors. I didn‚Äôt realize they were an additional thing you could add on to your existing CAMP, I figured you‚Äôd have to choose one or the other. That means I don‚Äôt have to rebuild my camp again so I‚Äôm happy
---
Throw on born survivor and one autostim piece. Helps a lot
---
It's not. If you cancel the reload, you can actually fire those shots. I think it is refilling, for some weird reason (maybe it's related to the health rubber banding bug?), but it's not *only* visual.
---
why not just make them made of paper while we're at it?try not standing in front of 7 of them. 
---
get a vamps weapon. shoot them. keep shooting them. shoot them some more. shoot a few more times. oh look. you're taking damage and healing it straight away.
---
get yourself some troubleshooters armour if you're struggling THAT much
---
Resilient cryo bots at the burrows? I hope they add those, fingers crossed!!
---
My Vampire Minigauss keeps me alive when things try to eat my face.
---
Not the greatest DPS, but I like being alive.
---
People will get so bored with it
---
I have a gamer family too ands its an awesome, interactive learning and cooperation experience that more people should try, but don't because of the stigma that's its only for teen boys.  I'm a 39yo married woman who has been gaming consistently since I was a kid.  I'm surprised how many female adults *still* turn up their noses at it without ever really trying.
---
My teenage step-kids think we are pretty cool and 'not like most adults' because we game with them regularly.  That leads to more respect and better relationships, especially with the isolation that comes with many forms of technology for kids.  On your phone, iPad and TV your attention is drawn away from those around you.
---
10k for random trash camp cosmetics? I've been selling spare liquid courage recipes for 2500 since the game keeps giving them to me. Like I get caps are worthless at this point in time, but come on
---
meat week takes like a minute with minimal effort.
---
Agreed.
---
Make it yourself, it‚Äôs under utilities on your cooking fire
---
Build optimisation? What are you talking about?
---
The beauty of magic guns is that they will work thx to ROF and server lag. Absolutely nothing to do with perks. 
---
In fact I have zero heavy gunner related perks (bloody commando) and on bosses I pop out my magic minigun. 
---
Do some perks help? Certainly. But absolutely not needed if you have a proper magic weapon
---
I have tested, filmed and sold over 50 mini guns and the best one so far was a TS/33/- minigun (with accelerated barrel ofc) no perks required
---
Meh they weren't that bad today, much harder the first time with all the tight spaces
---
Scrip maybe, I noticed some legendaries at prime sites drop two one star legendaries. 
---
Probably be a bit too OP to get a guaranteed three start every hour on the hour.
---
Hate robots on the best of days but *resilient* ones that won't die until you melee them and there's 10 of them pounding you? Yep not a fan either.
---
Monstrosities, all of them... bees, bears, and of course Edna.
---
yeah i hate that. Specially the people who can near one shot the final boss.  had one of the. glitch me because i tried to use his tent to cook
---
This is immensely helpful, thank you!
---
&gt; Being able to choose the rolls at that level is overkill.
---
i mean, i'm still trying to get my hands on a half decent junkies gauss minigun... so far in this cycle i've gotten one 3 star which rolled absolute ass. i also have three 1 stars but i had them before this group i've been making. it wouldn't be that much of overkill.
---
&gt;Just allow the option to craft ‚Äòstandard weapons‚Äô as legendary rolls, just like the new ones.
---
i'd appreciate this, too. especially with the new weapon plans from ops not being craftable as legendaries but the war glaive plan isn't tradeable... no idea about its legendary variant, haven't gotten one from a mob yet.... probably not gonna, either, the dude i got it for has way too many plans known to be able to get any one specific legendary item.
---
&gt;They could even have new plans added in that we‚Äôd have to go track down.
---
i'd appreciate and approve of this. make it something legendary mobs have a chance to drop or from bosses or whatever.
---
&gt;Beats getting another AA/FFR/90RW Western Revolver and wishing it was a .50 cal...
---
they could also add a system where you can choose specific items you would prefer legendaries for and thus focus farm them somehow, though that'd be a totally different suggestion from the OP hahah
---
You bastard! That‚Äôs where all my rare rewards are going...
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll get to getting the resources ASAP.
---
Sharing it on a full health team doing radiation rumble saves 40 radaway amongst the team
---
I'd have to disagree, would remove the specialness it has. Wouldn't make sense if we had Christmas at the end of every month.
---
I haven't had an issue with it. What's your prefixes?
---
Wrong. The higher the fire rate, the better the magic effect and easier to start it. Accelerated barrel is a must have unless you have a 25% FFR one
---
It‚Äôs extremely useful for maintaining xp buffs from food. With my fridge I can maintain a bunch of cranberry relish and brain bombs that would normally spoil. You can also pull food out from any stash.
---
üòÇ x 2
---
Yeah, I understand being bloody and not wanting your rads messed with, but my teammates just stay outta my circle, or lose a few rads. No one ever complains really.
---
Welcome to the game :) when you decide what kind of character you wanna be, let me know and I'll have a rummage though my stash box :)
---
you should try marsupial, it's really damn good for exploration. but yeah, i rely on speed demon to help reload on my heavy guns (cuz holy fuck i cannot afford the room in strength for the reload card) so this bug fucks me pretty hard.
---
Thanks man! Could you point me to a guide that would help me along? :)
---
I drop them in the purveyor cash machine in case anyone needs to top off their scrip.
---
Hm I meant post patch. It used to be certainly possible to kill PA guy, albeit at high ammo cost...
---
yeah, it's an old one, too. idk if it's hard to fix or bethesda/zenimax just doesn't know about it.
---
Ah, ik at work at the moment so I don‚Äôt know it by heart. 
---
I was hoping to maybe one day be lucky enough to buy a magic gun off somebody‚Äôs vendor. I‚Äôd love a 50 cal, since the recoil is better.
---
It‚Äôs good for me. Without meat week my food supply is bleh so the fridge is nice. I like to go on multiple runs before camping and it helps to have food stored for my runs.
---
Oh man you're so right.  I have 1st too lol.  I couldn't cope now.  I guess that's how they hook you lol.
---
And the funny thing is, it‚Äôs literally just a catapult. In terms of actual mechanical parts, it should be simpler than a pipe gun. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason it shouldn‚Äôt be the most durable weapon in the game.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with it though as well as lots of other players...I use melee weapons when resilient pops up. It‚Äôs not hard. 
---
All I can say is spec your character better.
---
Yeah I need to learn to clean out I guess lol
---
 I would agree with that.
---
A mule is a character whose only purpose is to store items on. You transfer stuff your not using but want to keep to your mule.

I dont think so. My buddy and I gameshare and we both have subscriptions to Fallout 1st

I just tested on that same group of molemen, and brawling is definitely better, even without incisor on.

Oh how I cannot wait to build the most ridiculous overly ego-inflated camp that is dumb AF and then use my instanced interiors to actually live in. This is going to be amazing. I cannot wait to troll TF out of all of you with my camp.

I‚Äôm almost out of aluminum. Been a long time since that happened. I‚Äôve been doing the same thing though, just buying bulks from vendor bots. I have nothing else to spend caps on so I don‚Äôt mind paying their exorbitant prices for my own convenience.

You're right, they were supposed to be seperate loot tables for the old and new pails. At least one person mentioned they were getting new loot from an old pails on the PTS forums, but they didn't notice or didn't have time to fix it before the patch went live.

It seems to need some damage level to trigger - even with zero heavy gunner, you're a bloodied build so you have to factor in adrenal/nerd rage.  And what are your test targets - anything other than a wendigo colossus or SBQ it doesn't matter much, but for those 2, you really need to hit some threshold before any magic will happen.

an apexigod museum :D

Bash damage miniguns shine with this op!

I agree with this. I don‚Äôt see how people are having problems when there‚Äôs lots of buffs via food, legendaries, and perks to choose from.

I hope Beth doesn‚Äôt listen to these kinds of people.

There are a few locations but none of them are reliable because other people are doing the same thing. I gave up on using my carnivore characters for xp and just grind on my high intelligence heavy gunner with herbivore. I don‚Äôt have to kill scorchbeasts and pray they drop a brain or server hop whitespring for squirrels.

I have never actually used a guide, aside from specific junk farming guides (I've only been playing this myself for about 5 months but I'm lvl 260 lol).

The main points I'd say for low level are stay well rested (few seconds sleeping in a bed), find Aaron holt Farm (northwest of the forest) and pick the cranberries, you can cook them into cobbler for 5% xp boost, and run every event you can in the forest :)

I don't have much in the way of low level legendaries, but I can provide you some goodies and ammo to keep you alive :)

If I'm at a station I'll find a 0/0 container and drop them in there for other people, so always check the suitcases and lunch pales.  I put some on my other characters to scrip them out and sometimes I'll drop heave one stars where I got them so I can still FT and stuff.

Very good point actually!
