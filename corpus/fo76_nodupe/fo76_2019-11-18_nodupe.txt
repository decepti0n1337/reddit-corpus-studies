I wan't to play with your wife.  Not you.

---
But doesn't Fireproof 3 make you already immune to explosives? I can waltzed over mines and be hit by normal scorchbeast attacks and take no damage. If the Queen's attack can hurt then it is minimal at best. Unless if my Fireproof is bugged.
---
No, you'e not,
---
Flavoured cigars, perhaps, my good chap?
---
 Yeah, I got one quite a while ago and snuck around Harper's Ferry murdering Muties. I was so impressed by how much fun it was, that I built my main guy to use them.
---
Doesn't using a serum remove the negative effects of the mutation for an hour or so?
---
‚ÄòRarely‚Äô i see anything i would call hacks on NW on PS4, you should join our dying NW community!
---
F2P is a good idea objectively. With a $0.00 Price tag, we get an expanding player base, which provides more feedback, and gives veterans a reason to come back (helping new players, selling bulk items, etc.). But something that it is constantly overlooked is the atom shop. The game has already drifted into the incredibly questionable gray area of no longer selling just cosmetics. If the game went F2P, who knows what  we would see shoehorned into the game. And with a lack of an entry price, revenue for the game is no longer consistent or guaranteed, which could make content updates come even slower if a proper cashflow isnt recieved.
---
&gt; Fuck my ass Todd 
---

---
You wrote this just for that.. Admit it =\]
---
Not positive but most people have said you will still have access to the scrap box but you won't be able to put anything into it.
---
Submit ticket. Seems to be a bug.
---
No, they usually go for around 50 caps.
---
:)
---
Grats!
---
Wow. I'm surprised you had a high enough building limit for all this! Great attention to detail! Love your accent too. üòÅ
---
How long was 50-100?
---
It is the easiest way to fill up all the characters to 150 000c total.
---
It came into my head very quickly into the writing process... üòè
---
[deleted]
---
I like the green of the plasma grenade. It could have been a sentry exploding or someone with a fatman
---
Same, I keep one bulked of each item to repair things, everything else I sell all the time to make the easy 1400 caps.
---
[removed]
---
That does sound cool. I was trying to figure how to make a nonbloodied ninja character, I may look into that with my new character I leveled up this weekend. Do you do weightless chameleon armor or what?
---
You're doing God's work. I always wanted mutations but I'm a casual and could never for the life of me get speed demon or marsupial from radiation. Serums always sold for outrageous prices till I found a guy selling em for 350 ea. My jaw dropped and I've been rocking then ever since and it's improved my gameplay a ton. I say keep the price if it's not bothering you that much. Someone like me will greatly appreciate you selling them at affordable prices
---
It hasn‚Äôt I‚Äôm playing right now.
---
The only other one I can think of is the Stars and Stripes Hazmat skin... That thing never worked, and you just get crickets when inquiring about a fix.
---
what platform are you on? me and my friends haven‚Äôt got in on PS4. in nuclear winter yes?
---
Where do you start the quest line that ends with encrypted? 
---
I paid around 10k for a fixer plan. Whatev, needed to dump some caps anyway.
---
That list says there is a glowing behemoth. Plus, though super mutants and scorched may be resistant to radiation, maybe the resistance isn't 100%.
---
Shhh you‚Äôre upsetting the hive mind, go back to the regularly scheduled echo.
---
So, ...... you're not coming back?
---
It's not my strongest cuz I haven't built into heavy weapons yet but I got double shot explosive Gatling gun. Boom boom boom boom boom like artillery fire. Works great when I'm scavenging low level areas with crowds of muties or scorched, plus it's got 250 round mag so I like literally never run out of bullets while clearing them. 
---
Strongest tho is my modified handmade, or maybe my modified lever action but nothing beats the steady booms from my Gatling gun clearing a crowd
---
tbh what is worth doing? Took a break for awhile and I'm being, unfortunately drug back, but it seems like not much has changed. Bugs that have existed from day 1 are still here, and there doesn't seem to be much if any new content.
---
So what‚Äôs wrong with taking the backstreets?
---
Does camo paint work again yet?
---
I could just put one on for you. Need to do my good deed for the day anyway. I ain't at home right now but I'll be there in maybe half a hour.
---
No idea each level increaes in xp requierements
---
Thank you I was going to see about getting it but I‚Äôm still skeptical about the whole thing.
---
Tinkering with game files, eh? This will end well...
---
There's lots of side quests to do. Have you done the one where you help the robot pirates get their ship to fly yet? It's not all help x settlement, infact I avoid that shit like the plague. Plenty of other more fun side quests.
---
It does now yah
---
Orbital strike?
---
I know that this can be very bugged for some, the one I used was the bones in the wall of Hopewell Cave. Ensure that it says 'fossil' on your screen to make sure that your camera is picking up on it.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I‚Äôd love to be able to have a real waiting room type of thing.   Somewhere that can you can look at stats and rewards, explore vault, and change perks without being so rushed.
---
You keep the box and can take stuff out but can‚Äôt add anything new.
---
It is just a glitch. It doesnt do anything  and is not worth anything.
---
So, what did the move on to?
---
Hi, had the same problem
---
Quest is fucked
---
Open your pip-boy, go to **Dailies**
---
Track the mission
---
I found it had picked it up, but doesn‚Äôt auto track like *everything* else
---
Brawndo?
---
sometimes u have to wait 24 hours... cuz the toxic goo mission is an daily....   
---
thats the way it worked for me
---
Like who? What examples do you have? What game did they move to?
---
Its still going on xbox
---
Don‚Äôt have it on PS4. want to wait a bit to see if more people speak up. see if it‚Äôs a ps4 problem.
---
Some of the challenges are still bugged. I know discovering Abandoned Bog Town still doesn‚Äôt trigger for whatever reason too.
---
I support this
---
Xbox. And yeah in NW.
---
 It depends, I like my Heavy Combat and have all but one, a Trapper Unyielding, as my set. I have most of what I want and can do 3 Chameleon but I only usually use 2 as that's good enough. I don't have any weightless, I'm good with weight and always trade em in. ;)
---
think it might be a ps4 thing then i don‚Äôt know
---
Yeah I literally just finished an event and died because I got swarmed by ten enemies and as I was coming back to get my stuff a lvl 20 just grabbed my 100 weight of junk and left

---
Yes, you are right. 
---
Running with Bloodied Explosive weapons without Fireproof was suicidal
---
Truth be told, I only updated recently.  I haven't played in months and right now I'm hip deep in Borderlands 3.  Unlikely I'll play anytime soon.  ;)
---
Collect all the bobbleheads and magazines.
---
Good idea. It'll be the f1st incentive for next month
---
I disagree. I think that if you die, thats on you. I personally feel like that just takes yet another entire challenege element away from an already otherwise severely nerfed game. 
---
Not in a mean or disrespectful way. This is just genuine back and forth.
---
Edit: i.mean you drop only stuff thats literally called "junk". If it means that much to you, you shouldnt be taking it into events. And its not like youre getting any kind of decent amounts of any kind of decent junk from any one event.
---
Nuclear winter and snow..? You're illogical.
---
People with Intel processors and not on this forum have no idea there is issue with this pa at all, as it‚Äôs affecting only amd cpu
---
Campfire Tales has a chance to give badges.
---
As you should be.  I lost a ton before they fixed it. (I think )
---
Can confirm this as a sometimes solution for quest bugs *(specifically the dailies)*. 
---
I find Untracking the quest and quitting, reloading and then tracking it again - *generally* fixes things if they aren‚Äôt working similar to what you said. 
---
Cannot say it‚Äôs a silver bullet but /u/randomlettersms definitely has a valid trouble shooting. 
---
FWIW I think you can ‚Äúabandon‚Äù dailies also and then pick them up again. Not sure if the cool down is a factor there tho.
---
Wonder how much they gonna charge for this
---
Not true, INTEL user here and can confirm I do lock up... I don't crash but I get hard freezes for 30 seconds or so/ Just get your hits in and look away / open your map the remainder of fight.
---
I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm lucky then, had no issue so far.
---
It is your money, spend it as you wish.  I'm not doing it, but what folks do with their money is their business.
---
Which is why I'm pissed off at people going after those that chose to get Fallout 1st.
---
No, it's the Wasteland. Death should be a risk and a penalty, rather than an inconvenience where you're magically protected from being looted unless a rule is a met.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet plan is a rare drop in the Ash Heap.  I believe it‚Äôs also supposed to be in the deathclaw loot table, or that could be the extra claw plan, but it‚Äôs been bugged since launch and doesn‚Äôt drop.
---
I got a gauntlet plan at Camden Park, in the green steamer trunk inside the roller coaster clearing where the power armor station is.  Check it every time you do the daily quests there and you‚Äôll get one eventually.
---
If you get a legendary gauntlet and want to add the third claw, you can buy it as a mod from a robot vendor.  They‚Äôre pretty common. You need to have the appropriate level of Makeshift Warrior to actually apply it.  The Savage Divide raider vendors seem to almost always have one in stock.
---
Contact customer support. They can be pretty good about these things, especially if it's your first time asking for a refund.
---
Despite all the hype, i'm finding it worth it, if you're trying to grind out the dailies for atoms, it' nice not to have to compete with others for them so you can knock them out fairly quickly. I bought the first month and i'm seriously thinking of subbing it again.  It's not really a private server - more like a private session,  as one person leaves a server they shove over to you if you login within 5 minutes looking for privacy. This is strictly my impression of how it works, if i get disconnected for whatever reason, as long as i don't take too long (ie: 2-3 mins), means I log back into that session with workshops I've taken and they are still grinding away.
---
If you get someone elses session that they left, you'll find some things missing, mobs/loot, if you do, just bail and get a fresh one.
---
They've proven more playable for me because 3-4 people to a server is waaayyy more stable to the ancient code they're using. I use it some times to reset my Vendors without worrying about people showing up before i'm done.  For the all the cons of the game, the pros are winning me over. I'm use to this having played Elder scrolls online, so this is just the same thing in another dress. 
---
You gotta figure if the value is there for yourself. Play the way you want, how you want, I've been making some good friends in game and have friends from other games thinking of taking the dive into the game. I'm doing full disclosure, yet they're still interested. We'll see.
---
Launching a nuke solo. Right as I got to the location terminal, I crashed. Haven't played since.
---
Loading into 76 has always been a terrifying experience. 
---
I'm naked! Ok no, I'm just invisible.
---
My camp is building itself, one item at a time? As is the world!
---
You say there's a ghoul attacking me, huh? Well I can't see him, but I'll take your word for it. My health is indeed falling. 
---
I CAN HEAR YOU, OH MAGNIFICENT MAYOR OF GRAFTON!!!!!
---
I really do love 76 though, honestly. ‚ò∫üëç
---
I worded that a little strange. I like sneaking with Weightless armor and chameleon mutation. Apparently armour weight affects sneaking a lot, so I don't even need sneak perk with that combo. But I'll check out the multiple chameleon pieces option

I mean with a name like fxpijs and spelling mistakes that make one's brain hurt I'm starting to think Bethesda is running out of money to pay people to defend their game online.
---
News flash for ya, companies (just like anyone else) are capable of lying. Just look at the canvas bag (woopies on doxxing anyone who requested it), the nuka-cola dark (and the 5 star reviews), or the numerous "fixes" Bethesda made in the patch notes that weren't true. 
---
The people at Bethesda are bold face liars you can't change that fact no matter how much Bethesda is paying you to go on the internet and defend them. I'm sorry your job sucks so much man maybe request the boss to find another company to defend or something cause this one ain't worth the trouble.
---
He killed them all for you, he gets the junk
---
Honestly, that's why I put one up in the first place. Then I determined it did squat and deleted it.
---
I think I may have bought them twice for something  I really wanted.  Other than that, I didn't see anything I wanted to spend money on.
---
PC and I'm still getting 2X in NW as of right now!
---
He didn‚Äôt kill them, he sat on top of an object till they ran away
---
Do that next time lol
---
I have spent money.  Twice.
---
Perhaps when they take the time and effort to fix bugs and ban hackers consistently, then I might consider spending more money.
---
It's less of a boycott and more of me refusing to spend money on a broken product.
---
How about they take all your caps and rob your corpse.  It'd be more realistic.
---
Could you please link a page? I tried finding it and when I clicked atomic shop refund it said to give an order code but I don‚Äôt even have one
---
Is your psn the same as your Reddit name?  I must come visit.
---
How does it show up on the vendor?
---
Is it ammo or misc? And what would the average cap rate be?
---
You free tomorrow?
---
And this is why caps are useless
---
yet, all the loot you had with you was taken from dead people of appalachia 
---
those are the rules of the games, there's no way around it
---
I do have concentrated fire, but my perks are maxed and I rarely use rifles unfortunately.
---
It‚Äôs so fucking squirrely though and I never can get a clear shot.
---
That as well as those fucking SBs...
---
It always spawns in the mire/Watoga
---
Thanks, I'll start looking for it at Camden. I should be able to do the mod because I have max makeshift.
---
980hrs+ and totally the same thought as you. High five.
---
As a McDonald's worker I applaud this camp ü§ò
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
I've got a refund before. Just fill out a ticket.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Not sure, I had three characters during the 50% off sale and got 2 decent weapons. Usually I get better stuff when I'm just out fucking around
---
Same way you can get the achievement for 10,000 caps. Just can‚Äôt sometimes
---
That's how I feel, my best drops are out in the field, and only 2 weapons out of 3,000 scrip 50% off?!
---
I agree there needs to be risk in playing. If there‚Äôs no risk of losing junk then the game would lose one of its last real survival RPG mechanics.
---
I personally don‚Äôt usually mind losing what little junk I am carrying, but then again I am currently a FO1st member so I have the scrapbox. Unfortunately, I think Bethesda has made this question harder now that you can pay to store unlimited junk.
---
In light of these changes I could support something like an optional strongbox that drops instead of just the loot bag. This could be an option in settings that could be enabled, but would also drop something like aid or ammo along with all of your junk, like in survival mode. It could have a lvl 0 lock like supply crates that would at least deter other players from taking your dropped loot.
---
Ski sword and combat knife.  Whatever prefix you like and swing speed.
---
I think its fine the way it is. And im not paying for that first bullshit. Lol. Its YOUR responsibility to know what YOURE carrying. 
---
Edit: just meaning that i think the current system is more than fine and i dont pay to have unlimited storage. So thats dealing with the weight from junk still. 
---
And that fallout first is bullshit. Lol.
---
I got a VE lmg so that was nice
---
Yes - I finally got it to work - even when it said ‚Äúfossils‚Äù on the screen it still did not work the first 2 times.  On the third try I held the shutter (fire) button down completely until the shutter snapped completely and the. Held it down for another beat.  I‚Äôm not sure if that made a difference, but third time it worked for some reason ...
---
I think it depends on what you want to do.  I have two super high DPS characters, a gauntlet build and sniper, but both can only do one of the vault raids, because it  doesn‚Äôt have sections of huge radiation.  Both suffer horribly if I have to use power armor for any reason.  Stealth perks are disabled in PA, so the rifleman DPS is cut by more than half, and you can‚Äôt use unarmed weapons.
---
My third character was built as a farming tank for when Whitespring nukes were very common.  He was specced into slugger with Tesla coiled T-51.  Aggro all the ghouls with little zaps, auto heal with a vampires buzz blade and collect loot.  I can swap to heavy guns for the vault raids, put on an emergency protocol torso, and he has very little trouble with those.  His DPS is probably 1/4 of the sniper, but rads and endless enemy swarms aren‚Äôt much of a concern.
---
If I can stay hidden, which is everywhere that doesn‚Äôt require power armor, the sniper and gauntlet characters are excellent.  They fall apart when I need to deal with heavy radiation.  The slugger/heavy gun guy can take a ton of abuse, but I‚Äôll blow through 30-40 stimpaks and 2000-3000 rounds with a F/FFR 50cal doing a solo vault raid.
---
I saw 'more content' and got excited for a moment :(
---
This page is more explicit about 1st
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
Why? Do you project a forcefield around your dropped stuff ?
---
It's on the ground and if you don't get back quick enough or you die while someone can see you expect to lose your stuff therefor don't carry around anything you mind losing.
---
Ps4 and just got double XP.
---
All revives in NW are done without Stimpacks. It takes about 2-3 seconds to complete the revive.
---
Yeah, I guess I got a few more good weapons that I didn't care about and would never use.  Was a derpy3000 for sure lolol üòÇ
---
Yeah, I usually only kept lead, everything else went to vendors. Just think that now that FO1st lets people who choose to pay a premium store as much junk as they can scavenge, it may be time to look back at the mechanic. That‚Äôs why I included dropping aid or ammo, something to add a larger risk for players who want to enable the locked box.
---
Yea that one is fun I did all the side quests before finishing the story. So like I said, all that really is left are radiant quests. At least 76 has events.
---
Do not play the game anymore, you will be saving your time.
---
Love the XB handle!
---
from NW? is it showing up in your pip boy. sorry want to gather info before putting in a ticket
---
I've had the skin since it came out and still dont have the balls to try it out.
---
Maybe they should have given everyone a month of First free to get us all hooked
---
Stable Flux shouldn‚Äôt be Junk
---
 I get amazing drops off legendary spawns at least once every 2 or 3 weeks, yet I haven't ever had a similarly desirable item from the purveyor.
---
In fact now that I think about it, every single BE/VE weapon or unyielding/powered/sentinel or similar armour piece I've dropped has come from ghouls at the Whitespring. I'm sure it's coincidental but it's certainly weird!
---
Honestly, it should be misc
---
I agree
---
Ha! I feel your painüòÜ. Not a bad bloodied ffr shotgun though.
---
The fact remains though, with or without the storage, its your responsibility to know what you are carrying. Nobody elses. So if you die and drop a ton of loot because you werent paying attention, thats entirely your fault. You should not be rewarded or hidden from punishment for your ineptitude.
---
Edit: to me, this conversation will never not be about anything other than making the game easier for yourself. Its nonsense. 
---
 And bringing up the fallout first box, is, to me, even worse. You already get a box and private servers, how much easier are you really trying to make the game? Its nonsense.
---
I don't get the point. It's boring, and none of the highest level players are bush campers.
---
All other Bethesda games would be in a similar state if they didn't allow modding. Aka Bethesda doesn't know how or care to fix any of their half assed broken shit, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for 76 to ever be polished. It just isn't going to happen.
---
&gt;As are any specific meta elements of the game... 
---
What do you mean, nuking the nukeproof Whitesprings resort isn't cannon? /s
---
&gt; What about the emails sent to YongYea? 
---
Last comment because you're either dumb, dyslexic or just a shill. Or maybe all three, idk.
---
can you honestly tell me that you like the microtransactions like repair kits and lootboxes that are pretty much gambling since you can sell items in fallout 76? do you really like the bug reporters getting banned? do you really like that there are numerous issues with this game that are still unresolved, that the power armor helmet from the collectors edition has dangerous levels of mold? that hackers run rampant through every server? that you have to pay 13 a month or 100 a year for the ability to just play on a dedicated server free of hackers? that your beloved company has released a game with the worst reviews of this decade? that you waited for a fallout title and it had no story line, no npcs, a closed off perk system, a pay to win microtransaction shop, nukes that crash the game and servers, lightwood laminate, no push to talk at launch to the point where you have to hear people all of the time, a battle royale mode two years after battle royale peaked in popularity, a horrible amalgamation of fallout lore and enemies combined into what could only be considered to be a non-refundable game/ subscription service, not to mention the canvas bag that was falsely advertised when it was in fact just cheap nylon with the moldy power armor helmet, or maybe its the fact your base has to be placed down in another location if someone builds too close to it while you're offline, or maybe its the fact that you can't accept that you wasted your money and rode a hype train that has been going since even before it started.   
---
Fallout 4 was different, it wasn't bad or good, it was different. This game is not different, its the same cookie cutter bullshit we have seen released time and time again the last five years and is nothing but a cash grab. Every youtuber making money off of its demise has not made enough tbh and i certainly enjoy watching the fans go crazy over how much bethesda loves to lie to them at every turn.
---
Truely entertaining!
---
Nutters in here :)
---
You do realize your not just asking for spare ammo. These plans go for 17.5k caps.
---
Desperate for what? You are a shill. You made a comment asking for a discussion but don't even engage with anyone who has a different opinion. You are literally a shill, my man.
---
Nice idea! Maybe that mirelurk cook tank from far harbor for a camp cook station too.
---
Idk I‚Äôm sort of new to the game, and it doesn‚Äôt really hurt to ask lol
---
It's funny until I realise that 15fps is what I'm already getting on Xbox One. :(
---
Out-witted by a baby.
---
Oooooooh....I.....Waaaaant....thaaaaaat!
---
Amp up your agility... I sneak right to him &amp; shower him with my AA handmade maxed with low AP mods and sneak damage perks (lvl 392).  I'm far from OP, but have never had any problems with him.  My trouble in the silo is the Assaultron at the end who goes invisible. Died a few times to her!  Good luck!
---
To clarify, I'm not to the point where it's just a daily. It's part of the original 4 part quest (the helpfulness part?). Its tracking the quest, it's just pointing to the scout master and not the stuff to pick up. It's been well over 24 hours. I'll try what someone suggested, unmark, log out and try to track it again.
---
When there is two high level enemies nearby I usually shoot them both to lure them into fighting each other while I sit back, eat some popcorn and bet caps with my teammates as to who wins
---
Nuclear Winter
---
Nope and I don't recall seeing it before
---
Thanks! I don't usually instigate PVP, unless it affects my base or someone is being trolly.
---
with max charisma and some grape mentats i empty the vendors pockets real quick with just doing once uranium fever event.... i have been thinking to not use the perk if i'm playing longer xd dunno this works for me i play like 2-3 solo or more if friends are conected
---
Huh, very odd...
---
Regardless, I'm glad you finally got it!! :)
---
Did you freaking read? Keep your toxicity for yourself. I am a melee bloodied. And I'm the one tanking the pylons for many minutes when I start the event. For nothing because on a full server, few fresh players show up and they can't do shit because the dps was the only idiot who came prepared with a ton of stim, food and nuka to tank the constant damage.
---
On my many attempts what were doing the oh so untouchable lvl250 with TSE weapons ? Oh! They went to One Violent Night because you know, a pumpkin plan is really useful and the event just happen once a day. Or they almost all went for flux farming in the middle of nowhere. Because you know, a nuked area least only 5min...
---
Seriously... Even for a lvl250, if you see Encrypted that means free xp and chance to get a (extra for many) high valued plan. The Imposter don't stand long if everyone do their part.
---
The main issue is, ignoring this event just because you don't want to be the conduit and you can't imagine someone will do it if you don't is not an excuse.
---
It reminds me of Meat Weak, where many 250+ player came but were only hunting the animals because you know, it's funnier to use their TSE than actually reading the objectives. The same people who started trolling the people doing drums because for them, these people were afk.
---
Lololololololololol
---
Yeah!! I got him over by watoga right after a scorched mothman sighting
---
Nice, you mean I get snow **AND** an FPS upgrade to 15, Merry Christmas to me!
---
At the moment there's no reason to think it's not canon.
---
That‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt even purchased the game in the first place.
---
I agree but I rarely use shotguns but at least it can fish me some caps
---
I've been seeing a resurgence in mothman sightings over the last few days.
---
Your build is pretty devastating, just can't run low health makes me nervous. 
---
I don't like pvp at all avoid it at all costs. Reminds me of the fun I had yesterday though. I decided to stop being a victim too, lol.
---
When did he start playing?
---
not on gatling laser. base damage for ultracite is like 10 or 15% more maybe 30% %. I do know I ran a onestar vamp gat laster for many months, recently upgraded to vamp ultracite. side by side comparison shows a higher base damage on the ultracite and it naturally hits like I just took a psyco. not an amazing instant melt deal but a noticibly snappier death for.. well everything.
---
Congats mack!
---
I completely agree with you that it is individual players responsibility to manage inventory. I never lost more that a few pounds of junk personally because I knew not to take risks when I was carrying something I didn‚Äôt want to lose. I completely agreed that the mechanic didn‚Äôt need to be changed, until FO1st came out.

Now that junk has been completely devalued to subscribers. What is 20 screws and 50 lead to someone who has 1000 screws and 3500 lead in their scrapbox? But what is the same value to someone who can only afford to store 100 screws and 500 lead? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that there is such a wide divide in perceived value.
---
I‚Äôm not saying my solution is the best, I just think it may need to be looked at again. Maybe they could make it so that picking the locked box made you hostile to the owner only. Or they could add this as a back back mod for the upcoming squirrel scout rank. It would definitely need to be balanced, for example it could drop something even more valuable when used, like your currently equipped weapon, an armor piece, and/or a percentage of your caps.
---
How do you not get fall damage?
---
you are a donut
---
I still need the plan on xbox. I don't have much time to play usually and definitely don't have a team to try events with.
---
yeah so normally and it was up until 3pm GMT showing as double XP in the effects on pip boy. i have had some good and bad matches so can‚Äôt make a guaranteed decision of if it‚Äôs finished
---
Correct.
---
This. Everything you take from the game belonged to someone once before.
---
Lmao. I know who this was. I saw it. Automatic Two Shot Faster Fire MIRV? Yeah, blinding as fuck. Hackers man
---
thank you
---
I have Bird Bones, plus two pieces of armor with 50% reduced fall damage. So I'm completely immune to fall damage, which comes in handy all the time.
---
It's expensive, but if you start selling basic plans, junk, and ammo at your camp, you'll see how fast caps are coming.
---
For exemple, I don't use acid or lead with my melee character, so I sell it for 1c/unit. Many high level are at there caps limit and you can save them some time.
---
I used to love it, would have given it a 7(had a fallout bias though), but lately I‚Äôm just tired of everything wrong and the monetization before fixing the game, so it would have a 3 from me until something changes
---
Thanks for the forwarning on the assaultron.
---
Which silo is the ‚Äúeasiest‚Äù you can say that would be best? Or! At what level should one accomplish this task (solo or team)
---
The first time I got the infinite loading screen and the second time I did Encrypted he exploded and glitched thru the floor.
---
Ah, thank you so much! I‚Äôve been buying serums at 250c and selling them at vendors every day. Basically I‚Äôve made 4K in a span of like 4 days which is a very slow process...
---
6.5/7
---
I play infrequently but often and I enjoy it.
---
It‚Äôs a world of my own creation and I truly am not a hardcore gamer by any accord.
---
I still like it even with the glitches. They just mean to me I should push harder to be a better gamer! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéÉ
---
9
---
If it was released without the majority of the bugs and issues that has plagued the game, I'd give it maybe 6.5-7.
---
As it stands, it's closer to 2.5.
---
of course its possible. but I have done the ag center a lot I haven't seen it. I would beleive any of his points individually but all at once plus a bot being stuck in a tree at the ag center which I have done hundreds of times and never seen. nope sounds like a fabrication to me.
---
I think, maybe only in my case, youre putting an absurd value on junk. The kind of people who are worrying about 10 screws arent going to be taking them into battle. They are going in the box asap. The kind of people worrying aboit 50 lead arent getting it from events. 
---
Thats what im saying. If you are knowingly taking a load of junk into battle and die, you arent really gonna be crying over losing it.
---
If you are really needing that junk you have on you, you absolutely should be punished for forgetting to deposit it and dying while in battle. 
---
Thats on you. 
---
And personally, i dont like or agree with the direction youre going with the whole "what are 10 screws to.people who have 1000" thing.Be very careful choosing your wording on that. Or a ton of people are going to get VERY upset.
---
Edit: i dont think i can be more clear than this.... It's literally called junk.
---
There's a difference between Sneak and Chameleon.
---
Sneak is for PvE enemies. You need higher Agility or Sneak perks/armor for this. If you have low Agility and lots of Chameleon armor, PvE enemies like Scorchbeasts and Deathclaws will see you.
---
Chameleon is for PvP. It makes you invisible to other players.
---
There was a huge debate on this on Facebook, with everyone referring to captainoobs video, which no one could seem to find a link to. So, I tested it myself. With 5 chameleon armors on and low Sneak, my resident Deathclaw could see me easily, and I was constantly in Danger status as soon as I moved. I was lucky if I got to Caution at all.
---
Likewise, with a high Agility character and 0 Chameleon pieces, I could sneak around the same Deathclaw without being seen. I could even shoot at the Deathclaw without it seeing me.
---
The visual effect of Chameleon does stack. It makes you more and more blurry, which isn't necessarily a good thing. A massive distortion is incredibly obvious in some situations.
---
Same with artillery grenades at the camp, it sometimes goes in your stash box, must be a new bug
---
now i want food :/
---
Congrats Mack
---
7/10
---
The game isn't as bad as the hate train claims it to be but the game is lacking in a lot of ways. Though if you get into 76 the game can be fun :)
---
3/10
---
It had potential, but Bethesda has made it clear that they are not interested in making the game better, and instead they decided to milk the players that remain.
---
Wastelanders will surely be a failure, and it will finally bring the entire game down with it.
---
Congratulations.  Overseer.
---
Yes, I've seen it once in Watoga since the last patch.
---
Yes - thanks for the help üëçüèª
---
Notes that fallout already has those.
---
I would be up for trying to help in a bit. I am trying to get into the raids. I have a mic, but I have not beaten any raids yet.
---
You must be new to MMO‚Äôs which is what FO76 is. I started playing games similar back in 2002. I have played many of the top MMO titles for nearly 20 years. Final Fantasy XI, given my reddit name is my absolute favorite. But the moment I first played Fallout 3, I wanted an online version of the franchise. I played the previous 2 and I have played every Fallout game since. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played FO76 for probably 4 months. The game doesn‚Äôt have the qualities that deserve a subscription. No text chat, no quick load out changes as long as they require lock pick and hacking to use card points. FO76 doesn‚Äôt have a universal que system for individuals who play solo to complete content. 
---
I‚Äôd still play everyday if the developer actually fixed bugs and added simple quality of life content to begin with. The overall content of the game way too short for a subscription service. People who are blindly loving Bethesda in the wake of all FO76.... you and your inexperience in the industry is degrading the gaming industry as a whole. You have to give criticism when it‚Äôs earned...
---
How about a Bloodied gat plasma? The right Peek‚Äôs to run with it also
---
I believe I first saw him in the NW Preview. We've both been playing since the early days of the game.
---
I give it a 7 out of 10, I don't encounter 95% of the things people complain about, bugs, glitches and lag. I do have a couple server disconnects a week maybe but that's about it really. 
---
Why do I play, I love Fallout. Now this isn't the Fallout I'm used to as it's not single player game and well single player content is lacking hence the 7/10. Looking forward to the Wastelanders DLC very much.
---
&gt;Hilarious. Your stupid link *does not work*, whereas the one I gave does.
---
My link works just as good as Fallout 76. I know you would gladly pay more money for those in the future but here, I offer you this one for absolutely free. Not need to thank me, mate. Just remember next one will cost your 99,99$ per each.
---
[Also its a shame that a Fallout 76 player cannot even get the simplest joke but oh well....](https://media0.giphy.com/media/HVZYTlVgE908o/source.gif)
---
&gt;Please continue to beclown yourself in public.
---
I didn't even start to act like one but to be honest I don't even need to.
---
You are doing already a perfect job at being a clown by playing Fallout 76, mate.
---
I could never do a better job than you at being a clown because of that.
---
Just remember that changing the color of your nose does cost 1000 atoms so better go back to your Flying Circus of Todd Coward. At the end those atoms won't collect them self.
---
That's fine with me. I can already run novice and standard solo. My gt is Deitrus. Shoot me a message and I'll invite you to a party.
---
Me too, bro. Me too.
---
8 but I spent thousands of hours playing fallout 4 long after I finished the story line just working on settlements and roaming the wasteland. so I am biased. The glitchs and bugs are real though. most of the time they just add a bit of quirky character to the game but sometimes they can make the game annoying.
---
It's annoying to have the game freeze every time I open the map alright.
---
because I am a moron and bought about 4 when I intially started.
---
Boooo you stink!
---
thats higher than most peoples adventure mode levels. i dont get it do u get more xp in nw or what?
---
How would I farm junk if people didn't drop it when they died from falling at my camp.
---
Tons and tons of crap and 1 BFFR Fixer w 250 DR while reloading.
---
Is Encryptid the ONLY place you can get The Fixer plan?   Do any robot vendors sell them or do any other events drop them?
---
The Fixer is one of the few weapons I don't know the plans to and I'd really like to get it.  And I'd prefer not to pay a ginormous amount of caps to another player for it if possible.   :-(
---
I dont have that issue. but today my wife fast traveled out of my camp. on my screen and map she was still standing inside my base.
---
Of course! You're welcome üòÅ
---
sure I am just going to have a friend help me move some stuff first so I can  get more battle cards on
---
It's hard to argue that the base game isn't canon, but I also feel the writing been executed very poorly in the attempts to re-write the lore as we knew it. West Tek Research Centre is huge in terms of its implications for how things play out in other games, including its direct relation to the existence of the Brotherhood of Steel. Yet the story you read in there via the terminals and holotapes contradict the story from all of the previous Fallout games.
---
Research was supposed to have been moved, in 2077, to the Mariposa Military Base. This essentially allows for the Brotherhood of Steel to exist when they learn of what the research is and rebel against the chain of command. Yet in FO76, it's almost as though the writers ignored all of this and implied instead that some of the more contentious research continued at West Tek. Their attention to West Virginian folklore was great when they wrote these stories; their attention to the franchise's actual lore... less so.
---
TL;DR: This is just one of MANY plot holes, but the fact that Bethesda *did* try to re-write the lore implies that it was intended to be canon.
---

---
üòØ
---
Yeah I have seen that too.
---
You can get about 1200-1300xp in NW per round (at best). You also get awarded Adventure XP and caps on addition to NW XP.
---
There should be a couple of settlements. Probably minor though.
---
I just tested 2 simple scenarios where **you** hit someone (with melee only) who has the **unstoppable isotope mutation** and **passive mode switched off**:
---
(Scenario 1) You are **not** wanted, **you** hit them until the mutation triggers the explosion effect.
---
(Scenario 2) You are wanted (eg. for picking a lock on someones camp), **you** hit them until the mutation triggers the explosion effect.
---
The results are:
---
For Scenario 1, **you cannot** take any damage from the mutation's explosion effect, and therefore cannot engage in pvp with the player you just hit.
---
For Scenario 2, **you do** take some damage from the mutation's explosion effect, and therefore can engage in pvp with the player you just hit.
---
I did these tests several times (on PC using 2 of my accounts so I could control the characters easily by swapping between them), and the results were always the same.
---
NOTE: If the player you hit has the **unstoppable isotope mutation** and **passive mode switched on you cannot take any damage from the explosion effect.** It makes no difference if you are wanted or not.
---
I‚Äôd go as high as 8/10
---
Got 800 hours in it and still enjoying it.
---
Sure there‚Äôs problems, and a lot of fallout lore and mystique of the old games has been lost. The 76 story isn‚Äôt compelling at all, but teaming with friends and family to launch nukes and battle queens and other stuff has been fun.
---
I‚Äôd give it an 8 out of 10. It‚Äôs has annoying bugs, but otherwise I really enjoy it.  I just got done leveling my 4th character all the way to a ‚Äúperfect max level build‚Äù today.   Next double experience weekend, I have another character already planned!
---
i just dont get how people get higher than peoples adventure mode levels in a matter of months when they have been playing since beta?!
---
Interesting...will report back to see if this works

When there is the scorch-beast queen at 5%health your game freezes and crashes you load back in join you friend and it‚Äôs over you get no legendary and no plans.

I‚Äôd assume it would be with Wastelanders. 
---
Bethesda is probably hoping to dump it on steam when the NPCs are added to curb SOME of the negative reviews that they‚Äôre inevitably going to receive by the steam community
---
So does Dense mods completely negate the need to have Fireproof?
---
That was pretty good. How did you manage to tank all the damage with such low HP? Apart from using Stims of course.
---
7.6/10
---
It has a solid foundation and a lot of potential, but the occasional glitch or bug causes concern for me. And Bethesda hasn‚Äôt handled the execution too well.
---
I‚Äôm bloodied like this too, you just fire and mash stim button. I go through a lot of stims but usually have 600 on me.
---
I really don‚Äôt see any ‚Äúvast improvements‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs still roughly about as unstable, glitchy and busted as usual. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that Bethesda comes up with new and innovative ways to alienate and repulse people with how greedy they‚Äôve been
---
Bethesda selling every new game feature at a premium won't help improve the game either.
---
My game freezes with pretty much anything lately. Opening the Pip-Boy or the map, checking my stash box or talking to vendors, sometimes when I fire... It's pretty bad atm
---
Damn that's a lot haha

Run around in a dress shirt and sunglasses with an open mic and Bob Seiger's Old Time Rock and Roll.

Sneak up on people with chameleon and play a joke or gift them something

I actually asked someone about this recently when they spent 20k caps on herbivore and carnivore serum. He moves them to his mules and then logs in to them once a day to sell them to a train station vendor. That 20k then basically becomes nearly 100k across his mules over the next couple of weeks.
---
It does nothing. Just a rare bugged collector item. Use to have Radtoad Eyes that I traded for some plans ages ago. Literally no purpose besides a laugh.
---
With my Low HP/Bloodied Build, I use both Serendipity and Dodgy. So I am already fairly hard to hit. I think I only used one stim in the video, in the very beginning.
---
I also have two really good build videos you should check out if you want to learn more about low health or Bloodied builds.
---
Yesterday when fighting the Scorch Beast Queen.... Almost had them dead then CTD.

2 bananas/ 1 plum this is of course adjusting for inflation

Thanks, I will!

Well it's definitely still going.
---
We won and I wound up with 1500 or so
---
Shills and mindless fanboys defending Bethesda at all costs.
---
Ultracite weapons do more damage to scotched enemies. Other than that there the same.
---
Big is all relative. The crashed space station settlement looks a decent size but at the same time the farm property in the trailers seems on the smaller side.
---
Maybe Megaton but really doubt something Diamond City sized.
---
That‚Äôs slow progress because you aren‚Äôt actually making a profit, you‚Äôre sort of making a loss. It‚Äôs seems unintuitive, but let‚Äôs look at this way.
---
You start the day with 1400 caps. You buy 3 serums as 300 each and sell them for 400 each (let‚Äôs say), and then sell random other stuff you find for 200 caps. At the end of the day you have 1400 from the vendors and 500 left over. 1900, assuming no other income. 
---
Contrast this with only selling stuff you find. You start the day with 1400. You sell 1400 of stuff you find and didn‚Äôt pay for. You now have 2800 caps. 
---
Selling serums is a tidy profit if you make them. If you buy them and sell them to vendors you‚Äôll make money more slowly. Clear out Blackwater Mine, pick up every last damn thing, sell it at the train station and you‚Äôll make up your daily caps limit easy.
---
Are the things we do as players canon?  Once had a dude offer to suck my dick for salt, fucking raiders.

Do you know if that includes scorch beasts and the sbq?
---
Cool! I knew it would just be a matter of time before big corporations would come back. Who would have guessed the first one would be MIckyDz.  One question though are your burgers made with 100% scorched beast? Or that lame Brahmin meat? Hahaha
---
Yeah I see that. I calculated what I would make because they sell at 460 so I can only sell 3 per day.
---
For example, I started with 4 thousand and after calculating what I would make after buying as much as possible I would make 7 thousand, so it‚Äôs a 3 thousand cap profit
---
It still isn‚Äôt very good but I‚Äôm saving up to buy a serum recipe, which is why I made this post to see if anyone would be kind enough to give one or sell one for cheaper than what it goes for at the bunker
---
Also, thank you for the advice :)

True, probably was simply a cash grab for the next big game.

My adventure characters are about 250, 230, and 107. My NW characters are 127 and 113. I've been playing since Beta on Adventure and Preview on NW. It's easier to level up in Adventure.
---
Wait...do you mean an apostrophe?
---
It‚Äôs old not fixed so far, the same happening to me occasionally üòê

Yes it includes both of them

Yeah. Happens on occasion for me as well. It‚Äôs a recent bug at least for me.

Wow! I went from 48 to 54 grinding out that skeleton costume and I‚Äôm done for awhile. Nerves are shot.

cheaters do continue to run rampant. map boy was one of them, he got busted, "white hat hacking" is still considered a crime if you get caught. pen testers are hired employees which map boy wasn't.

Making caps is easy once you‚Äôre at level 50 or higher, eventually the problem becomes spending them!

Same! My Xbox One really can't handle this game lately, which is really weird because it handles games that visually look like they should be way more taxing perfectly fine.

That might be worth the hassle!

Thank you for this! Very good to know. I‚Äôll be trying it out tomorrow.
---
No, I have fooled around a bit with Weightless bits but not enough to properly test them. Too many Chameleons maybe, and though I knew they were supposed to enhance sneak I never thought about it. I'll look at that closer as I play the Murmrgh game. ;)
---
While it sure looks good and all that.
---
Isn't it just...pointless?
---
I'd love to able to play fallout 4 but with friends
---
In terms of weapons I'm gonna classify with what I know starting with melee. 
---
Unarmed with only three perks that add a measily 20% damage are some of the most powerful melee weapons in the game. Deathclaw Gauntlet, Power First, and Meat Hook are ridiculous. Sadly you cannot use them in power armor and power armor unarmed is the worst.
---
Two Handed melee weapons are the go to for most Strength characters and have plenty of weapons to have a lot of variety. Plus you can use them in power armor.
---
One Handed? Honestly I hate one handed weapons in 76. You sacrifice damage for speed and in a weapon class that can one shot Level 80 Scorchbeasts you want damage.
---
In terms of firearms heavy weapons are the best hands down. Great synergy with various builds and the 
---
Gatling Gun is the hardest hitting weapon with the most common heavy ammo type.
---
Assault and Semi Auto (Sniping) go hand in hand. Essentially late game you can switch your load out to automatics due to easier access to ammo but its personal preference.
---
Shotguns and pistols. Oh boy. Essentially unless if you have an ideal gear setup I'd avoid these two. While both can be insanely powerful they are the most gear intensive builds in the game.
---
I have never even fired ann energy weapon in 76 so I can't give you my input.
---
90% reduced weight for chems so you don‚Äôt notice. 
---
When I craft them I use the chemist card for double, and the super duper card for 30% more of them to double again. I can turn 20 stimpacks into 120-150 diluted and since I‚Äôm bloodied, a diluted pack heals fully.
---
Forget it, smooth-skin.

I don't know if they formally count but interestingly enough this happens when you use photomode on them

Oh hell nah. So I guess it‚Äôs a 2 birds w 1 stone type of thing
---
For all its quirks, I haven't played any other game for near 2000 hours. So probably an 8.5/10 cause something keeps me coming back to it
---
Ever since the Mischief Nights ended that particular lootbag is broken and unusable. Shame because it's my favorite one for dropping loot.
---
It's def still working. Just got 2.1k
---
No worries. I use one on the SBQ. You can put a prime receiver on them too which will make them more powerful against scotched but the ammo is expensive to craft.
---
As an avid NW player myself, I agree completely. They tried to put the "best of" each type of weapon in the orange crates, but high-quality crap is still crap.
---
While I would love this idea. This would make the game even more unplayable.
---
The most I enjoyed it was when they first added the Nuclear Winter mode. Then I might have given it like a 7. After that it was a slow decline. Now I‚Äôd give it like a 4 at most.
---
This is a weird bug and sadly PS4 level requirement trophies still give me PTSD. You might need to makea character and my only advice is making a melee character. The rate you kill enemies gives you insane XP. during a double XP event I got a brand new character to level 44 before even entering the Ash Heap and not once touching savage divide.
---
Pok√©mon SwSh and Death Stranding.

Excellent. Beautiful knife work at the end there. ;)

I saw a bearded Mason running around in NW this morning, using a demo build. He wiped half the server himself... As poetic justice, I killed him by throwing a plasma grenade at his feet and detonating it with my M79.

Demo builds are too strong. I shouldn't have been the only person in that server capable of dealing with one guy.

My game freezes for a few seconds when I open the map on PS4. Maybe a hardware thing ? ü§î

When people say terrifying, they don't mean like "jump scare." Arachnophobia is a thing.

I have fun with it. There's people who feel burned though. They have legitimate criticisms and concerns about the game, which is fine. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And then there's the "THIS GAME IS HORRIBLY BROKEN! I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE ***BEFORE*** BETA, I'VE UNINSTALLED THIS GAME 30 TIMES THIS WEEK!" crowd, that just needs to be ignored.
---
I plan too do that. Most of my weapons have prime receivers on them now. A little bit extra effort for a little bit extra damage. But the effort is worth it to me. Thanks again.
---
Under the Misc heading in player vending machines
---
If you can even pull off the rare Stealth Attack the combat knife with the stealth blade is just obscene. Also, surprisingly, the switchblade is a very powerful weapon. Sadly the serrated mod for it is about as rare as the tomahawk plan so definitely combat knife.
---
Can you find it in the atom shop and go into the inspection thing and send me a picture of the description. I want to know if it will go on excavator armor. I got to inferno 1, it has a cool version for X-01, but won't go on excavator, I was a little disappointed.
---
Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet is what I‚Äôve been using, granted it‚Äôs the unstoppable monster but still with marshal artist it‚Äôs insane
---
That is very well-done... you have a great eye for detail.  One of the most creative and fun builds I've ever seen.

I just need to make sure not to come during the busy meal times....

Hell yeah i could do with that honestly, as long as the town has some personality and vibes lol

The thing Iis Founder Maxson was at Mariposa and went to Appalchia sometime after and formed the foundation if the BoS there. Now how that conflicts with other stated material I do not know  West Tek though is really never even mentioned apart from raiders. The BoS fought plenty of Super Mutants but most logs just contain combat with the Scorch.

Not to mention he has a post of 2 months ago saying something to the affect of "Selling Repair Toolboxes was the last straw for me, I quit on the spot, but I am only one man"

Dont quit your day job

I've tanked all 3 pylons before using Cola Nut and Nuka Grape/Quantum w/ Dodgy.

It would be a lot more effective if they just put a scope on it
---
If they were still putting out bug fixes every couple weeks like they were i would say 9. But because I have very little to do, and have to open the map 5 times to fast travel once, I would say 4? Maybe 5.
---
Do you have any sp saved?
---
It's still hard if that's what you're asking. Definetly do it with a team.

Lag wise it's gotten better since it launched

I nuke whitesprings two times and got 0 HRF. I tried Morgantown and it worked nicely I got around 30. I saw a post where if you nuke Harpers Ferry also you get a lot and even more if the enclave event its on. Also scorched earth if you nuke the entire place not just the border you get a lot as well.
---
i mean, its not solo and probably never will be solo based content.  definitly group up for them.  if your an xbox user ive been seeing more pop up on the lfgs from people i know that are regulars looming for a filler

yes there are a ton of ghouls and the 3 queens.  avoid killing unless necessary as well, it just slows you down.

also check out one of the guides . its much easier now that we have info.

Only shows up once perk points have been spent past the required level

Everyone has a right to express their opinions!  
---
It was logged and  submitted as a QoL Suggestion, vs bug, hence something people would possibly like, but isn't a bug!
---
We know there will be at least two bigger settlements, one at Anchor Farm and another at the crashed space station. That's from the Wastelanders trailer from E3. 
---
No idea how widespread the settlers will be across Appalachia aside from those.
---
I had the usual amount of fluids from several runs today, but I found much less mass than normal.  I chalk it up to RNG.
---
Read my text, Bethesda. Fix... Your... Game!!!
---
As a bloodied player that typically lives at the 25% and under range health isn't that important. Resistances and DPS are far more important. Power Armor gives you the best defense because a power armor armor rating and regular armor rating are two separate quantities due to hidden perks of power armor. If you have an issue with damage received T-51 has the highest ballistic defense. Otherwise try to wear heavy versions of your chosen armor if available. (BOS Heavy Combat is essentially cheating). Otherwise you need to delve into perks. Serendipity is good for any build with only shotguns being the regular counter. Dodgy works almost too good and tanks your AP. Though if you really want quick Endurance fixes craft some food. Plenty of easy recipes that just require certain meats and food that give Endurance buffs for half an hour.
---
Because players are buying microtransactions and buying 1st subscriptions, even though the game launched broken/unfinished and is still broken/unfinished a year later. Why would Bethesda fix anything? You're giving them your money regardless.
---
Wait, just to clarify. Was he giving you salt or charging you salt.
---
A lot of people are having problems with the jack o lantern loot bag. I would bet Bethesda knows there's a problem with them. ü§î
---
What's the optimal price for chems honestly no one buys mine even though I have litterally all of them
---
The two things that bugged me the most were inventory management and the lack of NPCs. The former made the game mind-numbingly tedious. The latter made the game more colorless than the landscape. 
---
No NPCs might be realistic considering how early it was after the bombs fell, but the fact that all these terminals were laying around to give you quests made it less, not more, immersive. I would have preferred quests being triggered by your actions than those terminals. I might give it another try when Wastelanders arrives, but I doubt I will before then.
---
Respawns new Nuked NPC's, they should be alive.  
---
Additionally people have reported with a Private world you can trigger re-spawns solo.  
---
If you log to main menu, remain for 15 seconds or so, and then select Private server you'll rejoin on your server again, or so I'm told
---
Just fyi, there's nothing 'Raid' about it. Just a long dungeon type of mission with way too many enemies, way too high level, way too short timers, very underwhelming rewards and almost no mechanics other than 'kill enemies' and 'push buttons.'
---
Pick flowers, make healing salve to give to low level players. Deliver honey to Sweetwater, and pumpkins to Jack.
---
I've been trying to finish all the challenges. ü§î
---
I am so f-ing sick of this bug.  It happens to me all the time.  It's been going on for more months than I can count.
---
So tired of having to relog because the client fridge because I dared to consume too quickly.  The hunger and thirst are annoying as hell.  The perk that is supposed to reduce the negative effects of mutations doesn't work right on speed demon.  Hunger and thirst are ridiculous.
---
My character goes through more food in an in game day than a normal marathon runner goes through in a week.
---
The whole damn system has been crap for as long as I can remember.
---
It has a lot of bugs (I hate sting wings the most), but it‚Äôs a really good multiplier game and wasteland is addictive.
---
It's still garbanzo. There's nothing 'Raid' about it. Just a long dungeon type of mission with way too many enemies, way too high level (enemies don't scale to around the party level, they're just obscenely high level for no reason), way too short timers, very underwhelming rewards and almost no mechanics other than 'kill enemies' and 'push buttons.'
---
Understanding what you mean by "Shitty Clickbait Fraud" is kinda important. As there have been a lot of things lately..
---
Range. I got plenty today, hadn't been like that some days ago.
---
I got almost all the way on novice with a team. On the first one. And almost halfway through the 3rd one by myself. I will probably never get through one. üòâ
---
I enjoy it,
---
and
---
 most of the negatives expressed here have not affected my ability to successfully complete all the main questlines, launch a nuke, and defeat the queen.
---
I did so without repair kits, or a large backpack, or a fridge, or a  matter using bobbles, foods, or chems to increase my toons performance.
---
Depending on how long that‚Äôs been around the ‚Äúsomeone logged into my account‚Äù posts have much more merit now.
---
I go on to talk to friends, I been trying to finish all the challenges.
---
I nuked toxic valley,
---
got around a dozen.
---
No clue how much was collected by others before I got there.
---
omg i hope i run into this
---
Score for game quality: 2/10
---
Score for personal fun factor: 8/10
---
Score for game quality IF the game ever gets the fixes it needs to make it an actual, finished game: 7/10
---
I play it (infrequently) because I got it used off of eBay for $12 about a month after launch. For that price, I was willing to give it a shot. And it turned out, all the bad things I had heard were true. That being said, I enjoy the core gameplay loop. I also have a couple friends that own the game so we play together and good around and whatnot. I don't take the game seriously at all. And I don't spend a penny in the Atomic Shop or for a 1st subscription.
---
Pacifist?
---
The game is buggy and messy at times. Despite all of that it's Fallout with friends. It's a huge world with lots to see and it has tons of potential to be great if Bethesda can get out of their own way and start using their heads.
---
Yeah had this a few times too. Had one of my vendors full of free foodstuffs/alcohol and over 200+ puri water. Thing is, had two lower lvl come along, and each took only what they needed. One took a few foodstuffs, some rad x and radaway and about 10 water. The other, a lvl 15 i think, just took 20 water. Then a lvl 100+ came along and just took it all. Greedy barsteward.
---
7 out of 10. It has issues, but I think it‚Äôs a fundamentally fun game.
---
I will say you need to seriously take the negative feedback you hear with a giant grain of salt. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs honestly about 40% truth, and 60% hyperbole and bullshit saltiness.
---
I disagree, Bethesda need profit or they disappear.
---
The Anchor Farm one didn't look very big. ü§î
---
Yes, this happens to me if I've messed around with power armor around the same time.
---
To purists it would be Play2Win ü§£
---
I have no friends and solo the game, I enjoy it. I have no FO1st.
---
I find it fun. Can't things be as simple as that?
---
More loot woot!
---
Even though the quest that gives it to you was patched in for free?
---
&gt;Play2Win
---
My bad, misread that
---
üòäüëç
---
I feel like I'm copying everyone but honestly I'd give it 7 sometimes 8 depends on how recently I crashed and lost all my inventory, or enemies vanished into the map etc.
---
Just went down there for the first time... stuck on loading screen for 10 minutes üî™
---
Anyone have any clues about what one can expect to see down there? / notable loot?
---
Old news. Saw this last week. Maybe use the search function before posting.
---
They lag everyone (user too) with a high speed fire rate gun. The acid cloud appears with damage and the cloud can be a bit much with a lot of other things going on and will crash the event.
---
OK, think I experienced that today then, didn't know about it but I was admiring someone in this new PA, that explains the lag. Didn't crash though and got my queen loot.
---
By any chance do you have adrenaline Mutation?
---
On PC - had micro lags for a while. Just built new PC. Zero problems related to loading or performance now.
---
It‚Äôs a solo game tho
---
What kind of weapon?
---
Buffs to str will raise that number. Each point is 5%
---
i have Speed Demon, Marsupial, Grounded, and Twisted muscles!
---
All my decent weapons I've bought from player's vending machines or had drops from some enemy. 
---
Purveyor is always garbage that goes back into the machine, a complete waste of time I now keep forgetting about the whole thing and just sell legionaries to the robots if I've a great pile of them. 
---
I'm at 1000 scrip and can't bring myself to suffer that old cow again to be honest.
---
I am kiwi you mong, I know how an Aussie sounds
---
No
---
There's actually a snow effect I saw climbing the cliffs up by the northwest border of the map. Immediately west of a raider camp I can't remember the name of.
---
We're probably not going to see any full-yet-seasonally-temporary implementation as they probably would have done this last year.
---
It was freaking fun. He definitely helped out to get it started it was a huge puzzle with like 5 rooms lol. I may need to copy that idea and get creative once I get the pin pad power doors....it was fun as hell. Most fun I've had in the game so far. Pay attention Bethesda! This is a great idea of an escape/puzzle room
---
At one point he had a flamethrower trap blow a wall open to lead to the next room. I thought I was dead lol
---
I thought it  was the other way around. I mean just because you have better internet than us.
---
That awful dark depressing room with the dreary music makes be depressed.
---
Troubleshooters Grognaks Axe. and my strength is at 15 and has been forever
---
I would actually believe this store if they said their ice cream machine wasn't working.
---
Only thing I can think of is losing points in strength or you ate or drank something that got your damage higher I would recommend getting adrenaline mutation it comes in handy
---
okay thank you so much!!

---
SidAlpha seems to have a different take, for what it's worth.
---
I‚Äôve gotten unyielding armour and a few three star weapons (no bloodies though) that were good
---
I enjoy the fruit variety for breakfast, very tasty.
---
The last hotfix was going to fix this but they need to hotfix the hotfix before they put your hotfix in your hotfix.
---
Sorry couldn‚Äôt help much
---
There's a respawning bug?
---
I thought they crawl out all the time...
---
What's the bug?
---
You wouldn't get it
---
No idea why you‚Äôre getting downvoted; you‚Äôre right. But then again anything remotely positive here often gets downvoted to oblivion. 
---
Yeah the cases aren‚Äôt as nice as placing it wherever you want but I‚Äôm cool with it.
---
üò¢
---
That would be pure gold really, that seems right where Fallout's style of humor would hit best. With two PA suits just spouting off propaganda in retaliation towards each other. Extra points for a line where both just drop their ideologies in favor of killing all humans together.
---
Masochism.
---
Hmm do you have radicool? No unyielding?
---
i honestly have no clue what radicool is
---
Take an addictol and see if it fixes you up
---
Withdrawal effects don‚Äôt(didn‚Äôt) show on the effects page
---
They‚Äôve been rolling them out at 1500
---
Lol ok. Its an end perk that gives str based on rads.
---
Do you use rad-x? That'll suppress mutations.  Diluted doesn't.
---
no i don‚Äôt use Rad X and i don‚Äôt have that perk:(
---
My bloodied 2 handed build as a reference.

---
nope still the same
---
Finished my set not to long ago ... Painted it bright pink too.
---
Then took it for a spin and I crashed myself.  
---
Was one of those, I knew it was coming but worth it kinda moments.
---
Weird. That's about all i can think of besides food buffs but those are pretty obvious.
---
You do know that bobble heads etc pull from you camp limit right? It used to be extreme though they lessen it a little
---
i really have no clue. oh well guess i‚Äôll figure it out. thanks for the help:)!
---
You could just be a group of part time brain damaged raiders calling yourselves the Brahmin bandits
---
At the root of it all, it‚Äôs a fallout game, and seeing as how I play alone anyways the multiplayer aspect might as well be non existent.
---
Your nickname should be something to do with your skills probably. Like what it your fave weapon? Or fight style?
---
You mean the feature already included in Fallout First? Pay up bud
---
The ‚ÄúJunkers‚Äù is mine  so you can‚Äôt have that one..
---
Also don‚Äôt fuck with The Junkers. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Love seeing all the creative builds people come up with, nice job!
---
Well you see, we're going to Tahiti! If you don't got no faith, you can call yourself Arthur.
---
Assuming you meant to put ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find them‚Äù in there.
---
Only thing I can think of is double check all the weapon categories on the workbench. Sorry man.
---
Thing is I can craft Ultracite fusion cores so it‚Äôs weird
---
last year was 3 separate bundles? for a combined 3,000 atoms or so
---
My guess is you got the Prime Plan which drops from the SBQ, not the actual Weapon Plan. Any chance?
---
that's a really cool idea actually. perhaps a computer lab type room with terminals where you see all that
---
So I need to buy the Gatling laser plan
---
No,the Ultracite weapon isn‚Äôt the same as the Laser version, they are considered two different guns.
---
Worth a shot &lt;.&lt;
---
thank you!
---
Near the Fissure site between Watoga Station and the Prime Fissure this morning had a Scorch Beast , an Alpha Deathclaw  two Mirelurk Kings,  a Glowing One , a couple of Feral Ghouls and some  Scorched.  Got killed once by one of the Mirelurk Kings but finally got them all.
---
How about T-bone?  Something real tough.
---
Or is the Ultracite Gatling and Gatling laser two separate guns
---
The difference is that Dota 2 doesn‚Äôt suck.
---
You might have accidentally acquired the mutation Herd Mentality, which can glitch out and not show on your list, but still give you the negatives when you're off a team (-2 to all Specials). Also, do you happen to have Adrenaline in Agliity that gives you boost to you damage for each kill?
---
Why would he taint his image, and run the community's believability by/through retaliation.., the smarter move would of been like the kid who was reselling krispy creme in an area that didnt have a store for miles and miles.., who acted neutral, and ended up getting krispy to backtrack and actuall ended up positive by supporting each other.., this happened along time ago by now.., since i dont really care for points or etc..,(or reading the clear nonsense some would message..,) in the end its wanton rage and bloodlust in the form of wanting change no matter the way.., when all itll do is put one side down, without actually reaching a consensus..,
---
if he gives it back for free, it shows its just a message.., and not a hold to blackmail/extort.., i havent paid attention how this has progressed cause i got other things to care about.., the reality is.., why would he even keep it anyway.., it does him no good except put on spotlight on him and with that.., comes everything else that goes along with it..,
---
Yes they‚Äôre different, and getting the plans for the Ultracite Gatling is super hard to find.  I believe you only get it as an event reward for Events in the Cranberry bog.  I‚Äôd love to get both the Ultracite Gatling and Ultracite Laser plans so I could modify some of those guns better!
---
i‚Äôve had starched genes since i was rank 30 and have only bought the mutations i want. and no i don‚Äôt have the perk:(
---
Not only that but the lore is complementary on the sites. Both worked with FEV, but in different capacities. mariposa made super soldiers(super mutants), Huntersville pushed FEV to its limits, making other creatures like the snallygaster and Grafton monster. 
---
When west-tek Huntersville started construction the FEV was non-existent, the program was still the Pan Immunity Virion Project which included plant testing. After west-tek California ended plant testing the Huntersville facility opened and immediately had to find new jobs for the workers on its plant based projects because their avenue of research had been closed.
---
All I can imagine is that scene from PieMations "Meet the Mem!" video where the heavy see the medic cutout, shoots at it, and when it does run or die he begins to freak out and runs around screaming.
---
Well then perhaps they stealth nerfed the axes damage output. They been stealth nerfing weapon damages since launch so I wouldnt be surprised lol
---
oh really? i didn‚Äôt know that. i bet that‚Äôs what happened. thank you!! that upsets me a lot üòÇ
---
Hear hear. Glowing steak is 10 caps a piece, then there is the weapons. Uranium fever and maybe one harvest of mothman eggs is all you need to do.
---
Did you kill them before they finished glowing? If so, it'll cause em to bug out and not drop legendary loot
---
You really hate to see that. 
---
Its bad enough to support Bethesda in this disgusting pursuit as it is. But to pull a stunt like that, yikes.
---
I really hope the majority of players arent like this though. In other words, i hope those that said they would stay away, are going to stay away. The only way Bethesda is going to learn is through a lasting decline in sales revenue, especially as it relates to fo76
---
Resale
---
I remember when bloodied handmades pushed 700 in damage and a lever pushed 1400. I feel your pain if I'm right.
---
So basically I just have the ability to make the gun fire Ultracite cores once I acquire the plans or a legendary gun of it?
---
jesus that really sucks. i‚Äôm sorry for your loss lol
---
They call it a "name bug." Its been around before. The word from bgs is theyre not leng, its just the name is bugged.
---
That‚Äôs when I stopped and never looked back. Fuck that game the creators can sit on it
---
Have you worn them? Then no
---
I also never get anything but shit from the purveyor vendor yet get great drops especially from the super mutants at west tek, get 3 or 4 legendary items every time i go through there and usually get a pretty great weapon. But spend scrip and i get a fucking walking cane or some bullshit pipe wrench etc..
---
Auto AA FFR Railway rifle. It's a beast in VATS
---
Yeah, but to make more mods to modify the gun, you will likely need to come up with a bunch of Ultracite weapons to scrap to learn the mods.  If you could get the Gun plan from one of those events, then it would be come much easier.   
---
This is why Ultracite are really hard to use right now.
---
Save your money. It‚Äôs worth about 6.50$
---
All I really cared about was the prime receiver thanks for the help
---
Our reality has zilch to do with Fallout. The USA of the fallout universe is super nationalized beyond anything we have experienced.
---
Thank you! That is what I needed confirmed. Having three more specials is gamechsnging so I understand the pricing for it.
---
Bigrig is also a scammer, so don't trust him in a trade
---
The only gun that causes me lag are my exploding plasmas with a splitter. Just got a ffr 50 cal and it did not lag me out at all
---
I have seen endless lies and exaggeration about the games issues. I cited one (the class warfare debacle) as an example. Another recent one right off the top of my head would be the reporting on private worlds not being private.  
---
This has been going on since day one.
---
Go to youtube.com and search "fallout 76 private servers are not private"
---
There are videos with hundreds of thousands of views with that phrase in their title.
---
The Santa outfit Bundle was 2000, hopefully they don't bring it back, i never seen anybody else with it in my hundreds of hours in the game.
---
Haha, fair enough, that was my favorite thing was being able to solo a nuke launch onto the golf course solo. I played a power-suit melee, so I could run through without using any ammo, and barely any buffs/aids. The new paid stuff really bums me though.
---
mangoes
---
This is something I appreciate but I'm not good at. No one I know personally plays, and I have never used mics. At least 70% of my xbox friends come from fo76.
---
"*The fixer is "bis" for rifle*" What does that even mean?
---
PS4. I stopped playing around august I think. I had it crash at least once every day but usually more but ive had it freeze on me twice while putting in the nuclear keycard. The 2nd time I had the whole story done and ive only played solo so I was getting pretty bored went to launch the nuke had that happen and havent played since. Was planning on coming back for wastelanders but with the subscription shit that has happened I doubt I will as I will not put any more money into this game and I feel like there will be some catch when they finally release that update.
---
Wow thats amazing, what location is that?
---
Same thing here. I only got 3 fluid all weekend. No flux for me. :(
---
I was staying for a long time playing the game hoping they'd fix it, really. I was one of the guys trashing the game on release, and IMO rightfully so. I have been playing and playing and playing until yet another update that fixed nothing, broken a few things and had been announced to be the last update coming until next month. At this point, I've just scrapped the game from my PC.
---
I do constantly want to be back to fallout, want to hear some good news about radical changes in game performance, yet, when I browse forums and see threads like "I love this game, it has been crashing for me very often, and that was fine, but now it crashes 3 times an hour for a week and I am starting to get frustrated", suddenly I don't wanna be like that person, I have to be better than this.
---
I am even thinking of going back to Fallout 4 at this point even after clearing all of it on survival mode.
---
It is addictive though right? I couldn't complete the main quest due to bugs, but I was still hooked. I have only two achievements left to complete the game on xbox, and I struggled to stop playing before I hit them.
---
Yeah im in the same boat, but im past the stage of feeling regret, i just know down the line they are going to become more fun/useful.
---
It is a lot of fun to be sure.
---
That's a damned good question. I've got about 60 of them and can't remember how they fuck I got them
---
Lmao.
---
 "Obviously the game has been received very badly, and even initial supporters have dropped off." 
---
spoken like someone who only knows about the game from forums and click-bait you tubers. As a person who has been playing since beta I will tell you that 76 is not nearly as dead as people say. and no it was received badly on a lot of social media but social media is not the player community. servers are active, people are friendly 99% of the time and the game is not nearly as buggy and glitchy as one would believe reading forums and watching you tube. yes there are bugs and glitches but it is not the bug ridden hellhole people try to say it is. at least not for me anyway. I have seen a tenth of the crap people complain about all the time. 
---
 My question is why have you stuck with the game despite all of it's downfalls? 
---
for the same undefinable reason I put thousands of hours into fallout 4 long after I finished the story and built up all the settlements. I cannot say why I am drawn to the wasteland but at the end of the day when I look at the choices before me. that's where I want to go. Sea of thieves has some awesome pvp and the sailing mechanics are amazing. I played a few hundred hours in that game. its probably one of the more polished and bug free games I have played in a long time and the ocean. its beautiful. by every measurable metric sea of theives SHOULD be the game I am playing right now. but no. I go to post apocalyptic west virginia. 
---
 "Even though I don't play anymore, I keep subscribed to fo76 subs hoping to see some great news about the game, something that would quell my moral qualms, " 
---
 bethesda is a game company. they offer a product. they have no "moral" obligation. they. are. a business. you. are. a consumer. either you want to play the game and are willing to pay or you are not. you shouldn't get "moral qualms" from buying a video game, if you are you have been way to wrapped up in what other people say and think instead of what you say and think. I like the game. I subbed. I am happy with my purchase. I do not give a crap if little jimmy cant afford that. I have 0 obligation to take care of little jimmy. bethesda has 0 obligation to make sure little jimmy can afford it it. beth will make decisions based on what is best for beth. they will continue to offer a product I will continue to pay or not pay based on what I think. little jimmy can go fix his own damn problems I don't give a fuck about little jimmy. 
---
 "**What are the redeeming qualities to the current players**? "
---
1. this game has soul and character not found anywhere else. even the bugs and glitches are pretty damn entertaining. one thing I worry about is bethesda making the game too polished. some of my best laughs have been a result of some random bug or glitch. my favorite example is a cow I killed in flat wood. My weapon of choice pre level 5 is the mighty board. a board and some throwing knifes and you own the forest . no perks needed just that dumb looking board and a few throwing knifes. I am in flatwoods and attack the cow. take a big healthy bite out of his life bar and he takes off running. I biff the knife throw. the cow runs around the corner and glitch's into the side of one of the trailors. I paddled that cows ass. that was just a ludicrous situation. it was funny as hell. That kind of random is a precious gift. at no time when logging in did I think " hmm I think I will paddle a cows ass today" that shit just happened. for all the polish of other games none of them quite scratch that itch for the random freaky and funny like 76. 
---
2. I like running with my wife. she has been watching me play since beta, and not to mention 1000s of hours in fallout 4, she has expressed 0 interest in the fallout universe for the entirety of our marriage. she saw me looting a bumble bear at tyler fair. she melted. now she runs adopt a bear has a complete collection of all teddy bears in display cases including the rare ones. I love that we can hang out in the game together. I love the fact that she finally "gets it" .76 is the only way that could have happened. 
---
3. the story is there. you have to be able to see it though. and the stories that they tell are powerful, some are funny, most are tragic. for example at the temple of the winding path you will find three bears stacked on top of each other like they're having a threesome its pretty funny on the surface when you first notice it. Then you find the note from the kid who owned the bears. you realize the  mom was in the other building  with a bunch of raiders and drugs. then the realization hits as to why the kid was posing the bears that way. as a parent that went from slightly naughty and funny  to heartwrenching and painfull in less than a minute of looking at the big picture. I looked out at the pretty lake and buildings around and felt horrible at how sad and lonely that poor kid had to be. that is a good small tragic tale told expertly with a small letter and a few items placed about. nobody else does that as well as beth. dont get me started on the colonels holotape, 
---
4. I loved building the settlements in fallout 4. 76 lets me build workshops and CAMP when I am in the mood to build things. some of the player builds I have witnessed have been amazing. and even my brick for my camp is pretty cool. its a basic rectangular base built to be efficent first. I made some nice patterns on the floor with concrete and shag carpet and placemats though. the over all theme is its like a small clinic. outside coming in is the bathhaus with toilet, its got a display stand with plunger and 3 rolls of toilet paper. next to the toilet display is the anti rad shower a bench and locker. there is no logical reasoning why building a fictitious bathroom in a post apocalytic wasteland would make me happy. for some unknown reason even to myself that stupid bathhaus makes me smile every time I go in there to clear rads. inside the base theres an armory with weapons  and armor workbench and 2 vendors where I sell my legendsries, next to that is the infirmiry , 2 beds with displays of medical supplys as headboards and endtale and lamps for on the other end. next to those beds is a vendor and a stainless fridge. some meds you have to keep chilled in real life. then I have the chem bench and stove. the ammos bench and vendor are next scattered ammo crates and I sell all ammo at 1 per because murica. 
---
5. the community. despite the traffic on this subreddit, despite the bullshit on youtube most of the people I run into are awesome as hell. very rarely do I have to deal with a jerk. so many storys of random acts of kindness I could fill a novel. 
---
This is long enough its already a wall of text I doubt many will read it.
---
[](/abcowboy)I'd take some inspiration from Raul Tejada, and recommend "The Vaqueros" for your posse's name, and perhaps for a nickname you could take Raul's Surname, or perhaps you could just throw some gunslinger lingo through google translate looking for something snappy. :P
---
Very cool. Do you remember where that place was or who was the owner?
---
My bro, that's me. I earn fuck all, I saved for the launch, bought the tricentennial and got hooked quickly. I thought "This is going to be great, even though things are fucked right now, this is a great game company. Things will be sorted and this game will be great."  
---
I played huge amounts believing in that. I bought stuff from the store thinking it was going to look badass way down the line, against other players who hadn't played during the launch.   
---
Now you hear horror stories of loyalists who haven't had issues resolved. Now they have a subscription service that is 25% above the ultimate pass service on xbox, which seems like a way to manipulate hardcore players to keep the game alive.  
---
I love the series, but I don't think I would ever buy another in the fallout series, purely based on moral conviction. I feel like I was fucked with this game.
---
Stop the meta gaming bro
---
McDonalds asks Bethesda to ban your account.
---
Things should be as simple as that. Question is, do you find it fun without paying extra on top of what you paid for the game?
---
Got a great Five Nights at Freddies vibe at the end there which got me wanting to see a Chuck E Cheese camp next! ;p
---
r/iamverysmart material right he folks. But not super bad.
---
Happened to me drinking water in my inventory menu just today. Freezes, then CTD. Thanks Todd.
---
No, we bought Fallout 76 because we are Bethesda and Fallout haters. We bought it just to justify our trashing of the game when it comes out. But the game was awesome, even flawless from start and we loved it, couldn't complain, until finally one day we saw a random video on youtube, from YongYeah or JuiceHead saying the game was crap, so, like mindless drones we are, we've changed our minds again and started hating it again.   
---
At least that is how it works according to some people out there, but since I'm a mindless drone I think I just have nothing else to do but to go with that.
---
I feel there would be better places to put your advertising than a niche subreddit which has peak viewers ~2/3k users a day. That's my rationale.  
---
  
---
But hey, if you want to believe that all positive posts to be paid for...
---
thanks, good to know.
---
That is awesome, but I bet the shake machine is broke.
---
Yes, it is. But Fallout 4 also reached its end cycle some time ago, where as much polish and content as there will be is out. I still remember how hard folks teabagged FO4, and FO3, and even the Golden Child, new Vegas, got bagged on (hilariously, it got bagged on for not changing enough of the gameplay from FO3).
---
I'm just going to chill and see what happens with Wastelanders. In theory, that should add a bunch of content. In theory.
---
As someone who actively plays NW, I can confidently say that Mack made it to 300 with the help of his crew carrying him. Never seen the guy play alone; ever.
---
Ah yes the classic example of a food build losing their junk and crying on reddit for Beth to make the game even easier
---
I run the Santa outfit with beard on  male and and female character.  Also run the "Northern Lights" power armor.
---
Right now, I do not. Whenever new content comes in, I hop on and play. I'm just chilling till Wastelanders hits, then my wife and I are going to play.
---
I don‚Äôt care what other people think. I play it cause I like it. If other don‚Äôt, well that‚Äôs fine there‚Äôs lots of things I don‚Äôt like that other people do.
---
Scorched Mothman is the first Mothman I ever encountered! Haven't seen one since
---
this is the most weird thing that Ive seen
---
Ok some companies ban people that abuse from exploit, but instead of banning ppl that use exploit, why don't just reset their accounts? because finding a exploit is very useful for making the game better
---
There‚Äôs a map in each power plant control room showing everything they power. They tend to power stuff north and south.
---
Soft Puppy And The Sunshine Babies.
---
You can be silver fork from the Sticky tar band. Just saying
---
My replies are being deleted faster than I can post them. I love the original game and content but I don't think the service and effort put into the game are worth it now. I think that adding a subscription service is like having a gofundme page for a billionaires kid needing cancer treatment. This will be deleted soon but it's true.
---
I rarely see anyone play alone, ever. That doesn't negate the accomplishment, nor does it explain how anyone "carried" him beyond level 300. If he put no effort into it, he would be trailing behind. I say this as someone who has only teamed up with him twice ever. Don't be salty about a legitimate accomplishment.
---
Before lunch they flew influencers in and had them make YouTube videos promoting the game.
---
They even gave influencers a nice nylon bag to show on their videos.
---
If you use influencers to create hype and essentially use them as part of a scheme to trick the general public, don't be surprised if they turn on you.
---
this^
---
There are 4 things:
---
* Gatling Laser plan - you can buy from a few vendors in Watoga. It's also a world drop. Allows you to build gatling lasers. 
---
* Prime Gatling Laser plan - drops from SBs and the SBQ. Allows you to put a prime receiver on a gatling laser and craft ultracite fusion cores
---
* Ultracite Gatling Laser plan - very rare drop from bog events. Allows you to build ultracite gatling lasers, which are just slightly better gatling lasers. They still use regular fusion cores
---
* Prime Ultracite Gatling Laser plan - drops from SBs and the SBQ. Allows you to put a prime receiver on an ultracite gatling laser and craft ultracite fusion cores
---
Ultracite ammo is used only in primed weapons. An ultracite weapon has nothing to do with ultracite ammo.
---
Ahhh congrats to Mack! How exciting! Teamed up with him the other night. Super chill dude.
---
Trying to reach 200 myself. We shall see.
---
Yeah I got the ultracite prime Gatling laser it seems that‚Äôs the one the fires green lasers right
---
Tens of thousands so far, got less than ten keepers, QE harpoon, BE railway, BE MG42, VE fixer, BE pipe revolver, etc. Also a few fire rate weapons but I didn‚Äôt think too highly of FFR so can‚Äôt remember. 
---
Since latest patch I get way more bashing drops than before, very annoying and scripped them all.
---
You still could have corrupted files. Their "scan and repair" function is sort of lame. I had replaced a few files when modding and then deleted them to uninstall the mod and you would THINK the scan and repair would find the missing files and put them back... nope. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game to fix it.
---
So if all else fails try that.
---
I was the only one on the server; and it was definitely not 20 minutes.  I'm leaning toward going to adventure mode resetting the private server.
---
It means fill it with Nukashine and give visitors a free vacation to a random location on the map.
---
Yes, it's a "gatling laser which shoots green beams". It does 10% more damage against everything, compared to the regular "red beam" version.

Thanks for the heads up
---
If you use the extra time posting to reddit about the game it's not really time saved though.
---
Agreed, and honestly the game is still pretty new. Bethesda was in a similar situation with ESO what with the money grabbing and whatnot. ESO was originally a game you spent sixty bucks on then had to pay 15 dollars a month to stay subscribed in order to play. When it launched there wasn't even a bounty system. You could just take things from tables and sell it to the owner of the table. There was no real meat and bones it was just meh. It was like this for like 16 months. They eventually changed and started doing the right thing. Who knows, maybe if we give it a few years it will be amazing. Even if it isn't I kind of like the fact that I have a sandbox world where I can build pretty much whatever and wherever I want, and I can chill with friends and go merc some random person who is  being an idiot or monster. It's not like I can return it, so there is no point to uninstalling and crying over spilled milk.
---
Why does everyone think Bethesda have no input into the dumb shit they do?
---
That makes a lot of sense of your way of talking in other posts.
---
jolly old bethesda with fun bugs amiright fellers no bethesda game is without some bugs ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I remember they lied to consumers about special sale price with visuals saying half off and shit but whoops as it turns out it was priced like that all along, which is illegal but meh no one cares anyways
---
One of many testaments to Bethesda's incompetence. Critical bug that's been there since launch, reported thousands of times, still not fixed
---
Uhhhh, what? Workarounds??
---
Try being a bloodied, non sneak, pistol build.
---
Nothing beats vats headshotting 6 lvl 50+ mobs in a row in succession with my six shooter then reloading it while jumping around like a lunatic screaming like a little girl.
---
I think it requires a team with the right charisma perks and mutations to take no rad damage in nuke zones.
---
&gt; You must be new to MMO‚Äôs which is what FO76 is
---
fo76 is not an MMO, a server doesn't even have as many players as a call of duty lobby.  It is Fallout 4 on a larger, more empty map with much less content, no NPCs and the ability to play with a small group of people at the same time.
---
In all honesty, if you‚Äôre a sneak build you should be fine in a hazmat suit as nothing will ever detect you and if by some chance something does just break line of sight and sneak again.
---
That said, my bloodied sneak commando build can sneak around the scorch beast Queen in power armour and never get seen while blasting away with a black powder rifle.
---
Thanks
---
Nice!
---
I'd like to order a happy meal and a big n nasty please
---
in evening, yes 
---
im in EU timezone
---
Out of a ungodly number of scrip sacrificed to her I think I have gotten two really useful items. However, those were good enough to keep me coming back for more punishment time after time.
---
Couple of minor questions, my dude:  
---
1- Do you use your PipBoy in the default view or the more translucent amber view?  
---
2- Have you noticed whether it freezes the game if you consume an aid item before moving or doing any movement whatsoever upon loading in?   
---
Typically, I noticed the crashes happen less often if you move somewhat before going back into your PipBoy menu to consume an aid item. Still, there's a crash about 75-90% less than what is normally experienced by goin' all willy-nilly.
---
The only difference between the GL and the UGL stats wise, that the UGL have 12% more base damage. 
---
The UGL does not deal additional damage against scorched enemies, unless you prime it.
---
I just quit playing a month or two ago (realized that destiny 2 was free so I needed the space for that plus apex legends has been my go-to game for a couple months now) but I always went back because of the community. I loved ‚Äúmaking friends‚Äù with people by showing off my camps and explaining the lore + story I made up behind them. (I put making friends in quotations because I‚Äôve got terrible social anxiety so I wouldn‚Äôt talk to people that would add me on their friends lists.) Sometimes I‚Äôd hold events and give away some good weapons/aid items. 
---
I also loved the grind aspect of it, not because it‚Äôs fun to grind, but because it felt like it FIT with what I always thought fallout online to be like. You‚Äôre stuck in this shitty situation, and you‚Äôve got to constantly fight to get better weapons/more food &amp; water/ammunition. This was the first fallout I ever played where I really felt alone. There wasn‚Äôt some character/gun I could go to that would hold my hand through the journey ahead of me, I really appreciated that aspect of the game the most. 
---
Otherwise though the bugs had me fucking raging those first few months, my god was this game hard to love...
---
They‚Äôre killable just like everybody else. Just more of a nuisance lol
---
And it happened a few more times this weekend. :)
---
My camp, being to close to Whitesprings got double nuked the other day. Last night I got invited to a team. Later on when I got back to the camp, the player had repaired alot of it, planted ingredients for adhesives and built me some crafting stations si was lacking. 
---
The community is awesome.
---
Go to whitesprings, have no junk because you will die, a lot.
---
Stir up the clubhouse ghouls, they will usually be high level thanks to a high level player wandering by first, then run around near the pool and jump up on the wall.  Shoot them over and over and over until they are all dead, or you are out of ammo.  Regardless of your build I‚Äôd suggest using a hunting rifle if you‚Äôre alone.
---
The other alternative is to shoot the goals through the window at the side of the clubhouse BUT they can glitch through and can also get up to your level on the garden easily so you it‚Äôs not ideal at your current level.
---
Craft more ammo (annoying in early to mid game due to lack of ammosmith and super duper perks but still do-able).  If you need lead get it from places which have gyms, three easiest are the jail, the hotel near flatwoods, and the fire breathers base.  If you need steel I‚Äôd still recommend the jail, kill all the super mutants, scrap their weapons (get scrapper perks as soon as you can).  The real issue is having enough gunpowder, and to make that you need cloth and waste acid...waste acid is fairy scarce in the game compared to other resources.
---
Repeat.
---
You will level up fast, even faster if there are other players around to keep enemies spawning and add fire power.
---
Also a decent way to get some legendaries if you‚Äôre lucky and the server is nice.
---
Dont discount having eaten food that gives you a  bonus.  For example, if I remember right, glowin meat gives you a 10% bonus to melee.  
---
When I was doing melee I would make sure to make certain foods like steak and drink BlackBerry juice.  If I remember right steak gives a bonus to strength and BlackBerry juice gives bonus to AP regeneration. 
---
So, it might not be a perk.  It might just be something that you stopped eating.
---
Next time do the tour during the day, and have it cut to different night angles to show off the lights.
---
Example walk through during the daytime, and if you want to show off a particular lighted area have a short 5-10 second clip of that spot at night cut in.
---
Would make it way easier to see the camp
---
I ran around in Nuked Morgantown yesterday and got some. Could be RNG, could be location.
---
I didn't tried it with Minigun, but with my BE 50 cal it seems fine - I have no stutters, and I asked my friend who played along with me (not in team, just another player near me during the fight) and he said no problems too. There is a problem though when I use BE Gatling Plasma with beam splitter - even my game stops almost immediately.
---
Yeah, the only advice I got from GFNow subforum: Stop playing FO76... :)
---
Thank you for the feedback! I'll definitely keep that in mind! üòä
---
Ok, now when they are finishing EU servers maintenance  it works as it should. Just remember to set the English language in Bethesda Launcher settings.
---
Be good if it did but it doesn't.  I think this bug popped up quite a few months ago - don't remember it at launch. A lot of bugs have been introduced during the year.  Like that fast travel bug,
---
I use it but I am a vampire build- I feel like they go hand in hand. With my laser Gatling I have 999 shots before a reload so my bullet shield is active the whole time I am shooting-  with the vampire laser gat I use as long as I am firing I never use a stim. I can take the full blast from the sheep robot without issue as long as I am firing on her 
---
I never use stims in queen fights either
---
....because it was true?? Hello? How is a title thats talking about backed up factual information a lie??
---
More projectiles, more healing
---
I know the Ultracite Gatling plans are rare but I bought the Ultracite laser gun plans from Watoga railway station last week for about 2K caps. Took me about a week to learn all the mods (35).
---
are you working for bethesda? you are make publicity to Fallout 1st. this schould be free
---
As a kiwi this makes me want to load the game up for  the first time in weeks.
---
same . and when fallout crashes for me and doesn't crash to desktop but locks up freezes, it means a full manual restart of my entire pc...
---
Those fusion cores are only for a gun with the prime receiver FYI
---
Idek.. all I know is recently it‚Äôs so much worse than it‚Äôs ever been.. for me atleast
---
That bloodied shotgun should get a few caps at least. My last run was mostly garbage but I managed to sell a junkie‚Äôs faster fire radium for 12k.
---
Of course, but I've done it countless times and nothing has changed.
---
Wow I have 600 hours and have not seen anyone else trying to start hunter hunted
---
Its is, I've played over 1700 hours
---
Splitter for sure
---
I had my tight jeans rip at the back pocket :(

---
Could you be a bit more specific? Which type Power Armor are we talking about? There are many.   
---
If you don't have a Power Armor yet and you just want one you don't have to necessarily craft it, there are certain spots where you can find a Power Armor Chassis with some armor pieces already on it.  
---
If you really want the plans then it depends on the type of PA you're looking for.  
---
The one you unlock with the Enclave quest line is the X-01 PA.  
---
You can unlock the Ultracite PA with the BoS quest line or on the SBQ's corpse.  
---
You can unlock the Excavator PA by completing a quest called "Miner Miracles", you can start it by interacting with  Garrahan Mining Co. posters.  
---
You can unlock the Strangler PA by completing Vault 94 raid missions on Normal difficulty or higher.  
---
For other types of PA plans it's a lot more complicated as they're a rare reward from the Distant Thunder event or digging up Treasure Maps spots.  
---
If you have more specific questions I'll be happy to answer them.
---
How about "Taser Face"?
---
You can start building Excavator armor from level 25. Ultracite armor is gained through the BOS questline. And the Enclave questline gets you the X01 armor. As for the others, they can be found in the world with mods being available at certain vendors. You can find plans for these armors but they are pretty rare drops/rewards.
---
Unfortunately until they fix the +250DR bug it's only usable while crouched since the Bloodied prefix has no effect if you reload (unless crouched).
---
Hahaha you are very wise üòâüòÇ
---
A big Nasty, I love it!!
---
Yes üòä
---
Why are you trying to smugly correct people about unarmed weapons not being melee? They ARE melee weapons and you are making yourself look like a fool by commenting the same thing 3 times.
---
 Unarmed is a category of melee weapons, just like the other categories, 1 handed and 2 handed.
---
To build Armour, is tough outside Ex PA, Ultracite and X-01 those plans are straight forward, but Raider and T-series are had to come by. (I'm lvl 175 and can do 1 limb of Each T-series)
---
Modding them? straight forward enough, you need Caps. Lots of Caps. for the Plans. 6k each for Calibrated Shocks and Targetting Hud. Locations for the Mods plans are Vendors, Whitesprings, Raider Bot for Raider mods (Why?), Brotherhood for T-series mods, Responder bot for ExPA. X-01 is in the Encalve (Production wing?) Ultracite Mods however are SBQ drops.
---
Oof
---
In the UK, 1st is ¬£11.99 per month. I can buy the game from cd-keys for ¬£13. As good as üòè
---
Yes, one member according to these statistics I just found
---
No it was above 207600 but it‚Äôs been slowly dropping constantly. I wonder why people are leaving though
---
I'd be happy for them to just add these under floor decor, and add them in the Atom store. Bundle of 10 things for 800 atoms, that's the only way it will happen.
---
Considering all the news is it super surprising?
---
I guess not
---
Rule 1
---
Cause that‚Äôs how this works the game came out like a year ago it‚Äôs expected that people leave
---
Fair enough
---
It‚Äôs related
---
Enlighten me on how this relates directly to FO76
---
It‚Äôs about the fallout 76 sub reddit
---
The sub got more members after the announcement of fallout first. Shockingly they came not because they were happy about the game. Now that all the drama is over they're moving on to the next chapter of their sad lives.
---
Yea
---
Yes and it's hard enough to deal with the radiscorpions and cave crickets
---
Why not build a wall?
---
Winning NW without hacks? Lohl.
---
Do explain
---
That's nothing, during the 3 purveyor sales using multiple chars I threw about 12,000 scrip at her and the best I got was a two shot explosive reduced weight 10mm and a zealots crit damage reduced weight fixer.
---
Splitter, each beam procs a heal
---
Urban Scout Mask? I think I bought one for like 500 caps, they‚Äôre rare?
---
Fallout 1st but now gold, diamond, &amp; platinum levels. $80 one time fee or $30 per tier.
---
I unsubbed a bit ago because how vitriolic this place can be. I come back now and then when I want to see what if it's less hateful, and then normally leave again pretty quick. There are other FO76 subs that are for people that enjoy playing the game.
---
Pfft, it's all about my troubleshooter, limb damage, reduced weight Tesla.
---
It does terrible damage but gives me and everyone else lots of EXP at events.
---
Yeah, I've used about a hundred thousand scrip for all five of my characters that used to scrip for 145-150 scrip each day. I've never gotten an item I use. I've gotten an item I've traded for something I use. The five charachters are of different builds and still...
---
I've had good drops from mosters though, but never from Murmurgh.
---
As we know, building a wall doesn't necessarily work. It's expensive, ugly, difficult to place on certain terrain and doesn't stop determined foes for long. It's better surely to scare them shitless so they don't want to come near you. Plus the Scorched won't pay for it.
---
That's funny
---
Depends on how you use it. I have a Vamp's plasma flamer I use as my 'balls to the wall' gun when I'm swamped... generally by a mob of glowing ghouls in the Whitespring clubhouse either because I was dumb enough to blow my cover or 76 wigged out and broke my sneak skill or some dude in power armor just bounds in to wreck up the place while I'm in there picking them off one by one. 
---
My advice is if you want to use it as a main or alt weapon, use the splitter but if you want to break it out in case of emergency I find the flamer with its absolutely huuuge 300-round clip and wide area of attack to be ideal when getting swamped by dozens of high level high dps melee attackers (i.e. ghouls, but it's good for gulpers too and anything else that does decent melee damage and roams in packs).
---
Jeff Gardiner, the project lead, says it's the conundrum of you need to feed the beast (make new content), but the more you feed it the more likely it gets sick. The raids are more stable. There are bug fixes, it's just the few prominent ones that are left tend to overshadow what's been fixed. If BGS can backpedel on MTX whilst remain solvent, I think the community can only grow.  If the, for lack of a better word, relaunch is buggy and egregiously monetised, the excitement over Wastelanders will be another turning point on what is seemingly a sinusoidal function.
---
Yep, that's the ticket - looked it up on YT, same effect, whole screen goes pure white except for a silhouette of a few things.  Wild!
---
This comment makes little sense. The game still renders quite quickly at 60mph+. Even in real life you don‚Äôt notice much detail at 60mph. 
---
If you traveled at 60mph in fallout76 the disk would come flying out of the console. You‚Äôd clip through the map and be blinded by never ending god rays.
---
The hero we deserve
---
And here someone has some good things to say and proceeds to rate it -47 / 10...
---
But if you put a turret at the top of the wall, then you got something.  And the scorched are a bunch of freeloaders, gotta pay for that wall yourself.  Or scrap bunch of pipe guns.
---
The flamer would be better for sustained HP recovery and tanking while the splitter's better used for bursts of healing as a stimpack replacer
---
wow okay  
---
sold a ton for dirt ass cheap months ago
---
If I were to give it an actual score, it'd be 2/10 because the world is great.
---
Scrambles, the Death Dealer
---
Don't forget the Scorched have been essentially running things since the priveleged few retreated to their Vaults and let the world go to hell. Now the residents have suddenly re-emerged and started randomly persecuting them, no wonder they're pissed.
---
I think you got downvoted for unstable isotope n shit, otherwise it looks cool. I'd do blocker and fireproof 2 but looks fun
---
Not all heroes wear capes.

Better than 0 I guess lol. It's got problems, but at least you're giving Wastelanders a chance
---
It's in the category with all the other emotes, Once you find it, clicking on it should enable the emotes.
---
I've enjoyed all the TES and Fallout games, until 76. I'd love for Bethesda to make this game as awesome as their other titles. I hope they realize there's alot riding on Wastelanders.
---
Ok, so, to sum up you think my username is stupid (it means something in my language), 
---
You are assuming me making english mistakes has to be becuase Im brain hurt, and don't even consider the possibility that Im not native english speaker. Say one sentence in my language correctly and I'll give you a million dollars.
---
And most importantly, you cannot provide evidence so you just scream how they are paying to me to think and are liars.
---
Well. You may have lost the argument for now (unless you would come back with an evidence, that way you can still come around), but at least you called me some names. Probably feel like a true winner right now, aren't ya?
---
You mean killing everyone not infected with their brain rotting parasite that eventually turns them into a statue of radioactive ash?
---
You can display all the magazines. I had the full set on display in my camp. Depending on camp budget of course.
---
I don't think BGS can backpedal on MTX, not because they are greedy, but rather because that is the only way for them to make money. I think the game does underperform severely compared to its planned earnings so they all but have to double down on MTX for the game to stay relevant to BGS and worth all the work.
---
lol
---
You can display all magazines (I have full collection in my camp). You only can't display games magazines.
---
honestly? with all of the (to me at least) questionable decisions that Bethesda have made recently, it would not surprise me at all if this were locked behind FO1st.
---
ok! I am glad you came to your decision about your purchase. now why are you here on this subreddit trying to upsell outer worlds and telling me I am a chump because I am happy with my purchase so far again?
---
Don't waste your time looking for plans - those for PA pieces are usually rare or very rare (except for X-01 and Ultracite) and most useful mods are also quite expensive to buy plans. Decide which PA you'll like to use, collect caps and use someone's crafting service - for 5k you can get full set with most useful mods.
---
It isn‚Äôt likely it‚Äôs going to be locked under fallout 1st? I am curious how to came to that conclusion as it‚Äôs been officially said over and over it‚Äôs going to be free and available to everyone.
---
There is many many legit complaints we can have about this game and the company who brought it to us- we do not have to act like children and make more up.
---
Honestly you all sound the same to a American. No offense was intended I‚Äôm sure.
---
lunch boxes.
---
How much budget you have after you placed them all?
---
Because you accidentally put fallout 76 on
---
The kinds of people you have as friends matter a lot for a game like this. The person I play with the most also likes just going exploring and seeing what we find somewhere. 
---
Most of my friends stopped caring about social media stuff around games a long time ago when we realized most of it is utter BS and mostly just made up. Those things run on conflict and negativity since that is what drives the algorithms. You can get way more hits about how bad something is than how fun it is.
---
A lot unfortunately - I got them on my main character and I have to remove all unnecessary items from my camp to be able to present all magazines. I hoped they could lower it a little, but no luck so far. As far as I remember it's around 1/4 of budged.
---
I doubt the main expansion and content will be locked behind 1st. I'm sure that there will be more 1st benefits added with the update but I dont think any of the main update will be
---
Amazing!

Rather they just scrapped it. Worked on a new engine and made a sequel. I actually enjoyed Fallout experience with other people running around, but this current engine cannot hack much. Also they could have supported this game with the Atomic Shop. People would have constantly bought good looking content for real money in there. But they barely update it and when they do it‚Äôs crap.
---
RNG, had the same problem with hardened mass a couple days ago. Three nukes and I got the other two materials 4:1
---
every mod I tried to run ended up corrupting my game and causing me to lose my save.   I eventually uninstalled it and went back to vanilla. then I lived with whatever bugs came with vanilla for thousands of hours. so bethesda was right in my case.
---
Yay! Finally I can eat some McNuggets in my favorite game. :)
---
LOL
---
Damn that looks amazingly amazing! Please tell me it's on xbox. I'd love to run into it!
---
Solid post, birthday boy
---
because I comprehend the game from the eyes of someone who plays it. I understand how echo chambers work, I know what an astro turf campaign is. despite all of those factors what I see within the game is continual growth and improvement. doesn't matter how much the haters want it to fail I keep seeing more and more young accounts and more and more blue boxes. the silent majority is a whale. whiney cunts in this sub reddit are small fish swimming around in its back trail of poop, semen, and awesome.
---
Deja Vu on this post. Are you copy pasting yourself in multiple threads?
---
Death Stranding is getting a hate train post launch? :(
---
LOL I got your upvote sir well said and agreed.
---
&gt; Is Encryptid the ONLY place you can get The Fixer plan? 
---
Yes.
---
2nd the clean toilet for sure. 
---
also I want place settings for tables like at the gold course.
---
Tell that to my -3 karma haha
---
OK, bommer
---
If you have Strangler Heart armor, what you can do is simply remove any arm piece or your helmet to lose the acid damage bonus. This way you can still run most of your DR/ER without crashing anyone's games/computers and simply put that piece back on after the event is over.
---
I'm an Intel i7-9700k / Nvidia GTX 970 configuration and Strangler Heart effect as well as Gamma/Beta wave tuners on a beam splitter + explosive laser gun lock up and crash my game all the time. I've tried every single thing possible to mitigate the issue but to no avail.
---
Bethesda needs to fix this ASAP; I and many others worked hard for this armor and want to use it, especially to equalize the playing field vs legendary body armors, but the crashes are too awful.
---
You're at -6 now lol. Why are you getting downvoted for this
---
&gt; the second time I did Encrypted ~~he~~ *[ she ]* exploded and glitched thru the floor.
---
 chump;
---
a foolish or easily deceived person.
---
"how can this chump be a detective?"
---
1. you can think I am a fool for making a purchase but your opinion doesn't matter. its my purchase my money my business. think and say what you wish I do not care. 
---
2. being an experienced fallout player I did not expect fallout 76 to run smoothly for the first 2 or  3 years(if ever). I was not deceived if anything I was pleasantly surprised at how much they have been improving the game. 
---
3. with the original post you asked a question. I answered. I know you're trolling still dont care because its a topic I don't mind discussing. 
---
4. I think you should consider bacon in your diet and try to avoid being negative as much.
---
You know me Gemini! (Morpheus_GI here). I messed up my reddit name lol
---
Anyway. Gotta say it's nice to see you back... or I'm late. This is a great build and was discussing this with Scorpio beforehand.
---
Is it bad that I'm kind of enjoying it? I was honestly looking for an excuse to come back and now my feet are stuck in cement.
---
I'd try some witch hazel eye drops and maybe you wouldn't be so blind. Maybe some other bullshit quip regarding some old wives tale for relieving ignorance and stupidity. &lt;3
---
I'd also love the option to sell things in bundles.
---
Isn't there a falling damage reduction legendary effect for this purpose ?
---
They better bring it back! I‚Äôve been saving up. Last year I was able to grind to 1900 before it was removed from the shop! Barely missed t.
---
Vertical half walls and the 1/2 and 1/4 floors to be covered in lino instead of just wood.
---
Thank you sir, you succinctly described why I loved the game. I play D2 now as my main game, if you ever need a clan hit me up. We do nothing, you won't get much other than clan bonuses, but the offer is there if you want it.
---
I like the sneak aspect for that, walking around and looking at things slowly... It's quite pretty.
---
The Final Pam.
---
Or alternatively: Pam, Who Death Forgot.
---
There is for vertical falling, but not sure if it stacks, or how good it is for jumping long distance
---
6/10. There is potential in this game, especially with Bethesda moving the game in a direction that more resembles the Bethesda Fallout games people are used to. Wastelanders has to be a home run and Bethesda needs to keep the pedal to the metal in 2020. With npcs coming in you have a lot more potential for fun stories and quests.
---
I actually went back to the one with accuracy and range when I ran a vamp plasma gat. (focussed? ) its been awhile. 
---
both options burned condition super fast and had shit range and horrible accuracy. I preferred a standard or more accurate focuser. 
---
I also always felt the healing was more than sufficient with just stock vamp plasma gat. I had no problems tanking the entire box with a fresh out of the box vamp plasma gat. 
---
in the long run though I stopped even carrying it and sold it because I got a vamp ultracite laser gat.  In my opinion the laser gat has easier ammo, superior range, superior accuracy, and superior sustained dps. Math wise I cannot say for sure I am correct. the burst dps of the plasma gat exceeds laser gat by a pretty big margin. but you have to reload 4 times to the laser gats one. so it felt like I was losing out on all the extra damage because of the reloads. I carry only the one laser gat now all other side weapons have been sold, displayed, or scripped.
---
What are you talking about not receiving updates? They have added a ton of content over the last year and dropping a big another update in a few months. I bought game at launch and have not spent any extra money. There is no need.
---
Lmao
---
It has had content in the form of collectibles, not in any form of progression.
---
This is a bug thats been in the game almost since launch if not since launch. I did get it when farming. Adding aid item tl fav wheel and using it ‚Äùto quick‚Äù, lol.
---
I lost a lot of time and resources to get this armor for PvP, only to discover that it's useless because it freezes your game if you use it with a good weapon.
---
Sorry for your loss.  Thats a heartbreak
---
\- not at once, but I did claimed all for a challenge
---
\- no, I usually fast travel since I have a lot of caps to burn
---
I don't even bother trying to sell low level stuff. I actively hunt down a low levels with the default icon and drop them good stuff as a gift.  I'm sure there are alts and mules mixed in there from time to time but if I want a low level to have it, I give it to them personally.
---
Currently carrying an level 10 instigating hunting rifle around with me waiting to come across a level 10-15 to gift it to.
---
No worries :P
---
"I doubt they ever wanted to make it low effort. Sure, they've seen the opportunity to make a lot of money on a Live Service version of fallout, but I think they have assigned a proper team to have it done."
---
They took a game engine that they had spent years tinkering with to make an already buggy single player experience and tried to use it to make a multilayer game. As you acknowledge, the game was an absolutely buggy mess at release, to a degree that it would have been impossible for them not to be aware of. They have vocalised that since then, they have spent effort addressing some of the bugs in the game, though it still suffers quite a bit from stability issues.
---
I think what your post does not acknowledge is that in the face of all the design issues they were all but likely completely aware of, they still pushed forward in striving to produce a game system that likely magnified the problem. They did this because it met their corporate financial goals. I think that pushing forward with an obviously unstable product is what has lost them any respect in my eyes.
---
At any point in that design process they could have been honest with themselves with how well it was going and either reduced the scope of their multilayer goal, delayed the release date and increased its budget, or just scrapped it. But they didn't. And what we the consumers were sold after a lengthy marketing campaign with many promises, was an undeniably broken product.
---
Your post seems to make the case that because of corporate structure and budget limitations the Fallout 76 team has been limited in what it could achieve and that they've been steadily advancing on improving the game. I think it's plain to see that they have been working on their product. As a consumer, I beg the question of why we should accept the state of things knowing that the very problem being addressed is wholly of their own making. 
---
Beyond the faults of the game itself, the battleground being fought over is for Bethesda's reputation. This game has fundamentally tarnished the company's reputation and I would argue that this is mostly a reasonable response to the events of the past year. I empathise for the actual workers at Bethesda that are toiling on this game, because it has to be pretty thankless at this point. But I have no patience for the publisher that knowingly released this game and has taken this long to work at resolving its issues, all the while increasing the reach the scope of the game's monetization past what was promised. They own all of their failures.
---
Im a 76 fan but his post is solid and lucid, let's not get our panties in a bunch every time someone isn't all-in
---
- yeah seems like F1st would be a good way to do this
---
- yeah me too, but was wondering how long it would take. Maybe with a new character, start at the lumber mill in the top left hand corner..
---
Thanks sm I‚Äôm actually going to start doing them. It‚Äôll give me something to grind for
---
Exactly.
---
Yeh I remember the amount of time given being minimal
---
Ive followed the map boundary around in one session, to make sure I had discovered every marked location. Took about 3 hours i think
---
Knowing how stable the servers are, you'll crash before you'll be able to claim all. I heard you can come back to last server within 5 minutes, but I don't have 1st to confirm it. Other thing is it'll be unmanageable to defend all those workshops - the defend missions appear to fast after claiming.
---
I thought there was a perk called goat legs or something that helps as well
---
&gt;The release of Fallout 1st just shows that this game is only money to them. You aren't a player anymore. You're a wallet.
---
I'm pretty sure every game developer wants to profit off thier games. 
---
The only shady thing about FO1st is the scrap box because we were told inventory effects server stability. We know know that's a fishy statement. They could've released FO1st without it and players would've bought it. The atoms alone are worth it.
---
OMG this is cleaver yet -16 downvotes atm. 
---
OPs name is Boomer, /u/alienfister saw Boomer and said OK BOOMER to cash in on the current meme craze. Poor alien fister.
---
Lol
---
There sure is, sadly it's only 80% fall mitigation. I need it to jump off the very high railways regularly :(
---
I'm not saying it isn't worth it. But they just boundled some features that should have been in the base game and sell it as an subscription service
---
If your PC i will give ya 10k for it
---
Just gift those items. I actively search out gear for my alts. Good gear makes leveling easy. I pay well for it.
---
Ah ok. When played as a dirty mutant I had bird bones and all the luck perks associated with mutations and I jumped from some pretty High places and never died
---
Despite the downvotes, Id love to know how this pans out in the end. I want to know how the password breach is happening. Since you changed the password, is it possible a brother or sister who lives where you do is responsible?
---
Did you write the password down anywhere near that computer?
---
It's possible your keystrokes are being logged by a secret running silent application in your Windows. If you know anyone slick with computers, I recommend you have them come take a peek, they could probably look at your running services and spot anything that shouldn't be running.
---
If you don't know anyone who can help in person, I recommend Malware Bytes cleaner, is safe and widely used and can catch many of these tiny trojans.
---
We demand an update once you have one!
---
https://prnt.sc/pyhw5y
---
works on all power armors just like the liberty prime paint
---
applied it to my strangler heart PA
---
&gt;After the horrible launch of battlefront 2 they developers pushed almost all content aside to fix the games horrible progression system.
---
is this really what newer front2 people think? the only reason EA changed it was due to the riots on reddit, it got so large that MSM picked it up and launched the lootbox investigations.  thats why they changes it.
---
as far as 1st goes it was gonna be launched with wastelanders, and as of now is priced similar to other RSP's.  of they fix it to be a real PS then that would be fine as your renting a full server then.
---
as far as bugs go, yes they have been introducing some, but have also been trying to squash them as we go.
---
It cost extra to run private servers that deserves an extra cost. The scrap box should be released to everyone. It obviously doesn't effect server stability I agree with you there. They dropped the ball on that there's no way they didn't know there'd be backlash.
---
I'll have to give that a try, I think the rails are the highest place. Wish me luck with my stacks of lead lol I hope being overcumbered doesn't change it :D
---
Can be extra careful and do goat legs as well. I‚Äôve moved to a power armour build so fall damage isn‚Äôt a thing for me now haha 
---
Hero entries all the time for me
---
Best in slot
---
Some say hand made is but its a toss up on how you play.
---
I did not say that EA fixed it because of good reasons. They obviously did it to save their skins
---
I've never done either of those, but I saw all workshops on the map claimed by the same player just this weekend.
---
You have closer to 5mins before your server despawns and you start from scratch
---
I go with knockoff rust devil's, the scrap demons. Mostly wear robot armor for the character
---
Awhile back the mods mentioned they had banned more accounts than they ever had. They really cranked down on the trolling with how bad this sub was after fo1st.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they're still doing so.
---
I used to love jumping with power armour when I first started, but now i'm a sprinter AP build with a mass carryweight, so power armour slows me down too much. I still love spamming 2 cans of coffee then using my jetpacks across the map though with power armour lol
---
Actually Game Theory made a video on that
---
reduces fall damage by 50% for each piece. so 2 pieces negate fall damage altogether.
---
Where did I say every positive post?
---
The perk goat legs maxes out at 80 percent but 2 pieces of acrobat armor does give 100 percent mitigation. I use it and never take damage despite constantly jumping off mountains.
---
I believe I've seen your name ingame before. Am I correct? 
---
I stopped playing that cancerfest of a gamemode ages ago. He is a cheater who claims to have children and is apparently an adult man, but everything implies otherwise. Even his discord, which has groups named after the Greek alphabet. It's cringe. 
---
And on top of that, he has cronies that have Stockholm syndrome and rush to defend him whenever his name is mentioned. 
---
He's an obvious narcissist, his ego alone is larger than the sun, and everyone *knows* he's cheating.   
---
One time, from what I've heard, he even "joked" about having wallhacks to one of his "rivals" which I know.
---
He's trying to roleplay Tuco Salamanca.
---
Essay over. Prepare for the cronies.
---
Well,
---
Well here's a leak that was found online....
---
According to the leak, the game's new Fallout First subscription is -- somehow -- exceeding expectations in terms of subscribers, which will bode well for support of the title going forward. Meanwhile, the upcoming Wastelanders update is far more ambitious than once planned, which is why it got delayed. However, in the coming months leading up to the update, Bethesda is reportedly going to transition the game to more of a pay-to-win style, suggesting at this point its done trying to attract the mainstream audience and is going to focus on its whales.
---
Interestingly, the leak notes that wile Wastelanders is slated to come in February 2020, it may be pushed back a second time as Bethesda Game Studios looks for ways to add more meaningful content to Fallout First, with some internal discussion currently going on within the team about releasing future content to subscribers before the wider player base.
---
Makes sense since Bethesda originally said that we couldn't have any sort of unlimited stash because it would strain the servers too much. Then 1st got the unlimited scrap box. So either Bethesda lied about the server strain, or they were telling the truth and don't care about the server strain so long as we pay them for it.
---
More floors, gold/black tiles for sure, more fence colors like black brown etc...the  terra cotta  floors I see in the atomic shop photos, stairs that are on either side of not in the middle! Interior railings..clean medium water purifier skin, lavender colors of anything lol. Clean red fire place.
---
If i see them for 250 and below i will buy all of the popular ones and sell in my vendor for 500, i don't sell to vendor bots. Its far to easy to make max caps each day just grinding. The only reason i buy the serums is for passive cash, i didn't do anything for it, plus I'm not just filling up my 5 characters but my wife's 5 characters and she loves to spending caps on stupid stuff...lol
---
Only *it* can save us from Bethesda.
---
Thanks dude, I never knew if they stacked. This will put an end to being camp dropped deliberately when you don't buy anything lol
---
Jesus christ...
---
A very nice tactic. I never craft my own Stims so I didn't know. I have to try now.
---
i go hard
---
He was just chilling out, my friend grabbed her power armor and Jet Packed up next to him, got some nice shots of a villain in chase!
---
I sold one for 10 caps once because I didn‚Äôt know those things were valuable. Who ever bought it must have shit themselves
---
If Bethesda didn't have the resources to make and maintain a Live Service game, they shouldn't have made one. They did anyway because money. Fallout, before 76, was one of those franchises that is played by a ton of people, but without a constant revenue stream that so many other franchises enjoy. Bethesda basically had that thought in mind, decided to make 76, and to hell with the consequences. And you know what? It worked. Financially it worked. They must be making a profit. People are buying microtransactions. They're buying 1st. Despite the game receiving virtually no major fixes in it's first year. Why would Bethesda waste time fixing things, if their microtransactions are already selling?
---
I actually agree with the principle of fixing bugs first. I would prefer that they do only bug fixes until the base game is solid. the thing is I know how little I actually know about the variables they have to deal with on their side of the fence. 
---
how much of their player base would they lose if they delayed wastelanders for the new content crowd? I dont know, neither does the op. 
---
financially speaking how much of their MTX was brought on by lower than projected sales due to the rougher than expected launch?  how hard has zenimax been leaning on them for their return on investment? how much actual money have they made from microtransactions? how much do they need to earn to keep the corporate overlords happy? 
---
" The release of Fallout 1st just shows that this game is only money to them. You aren't a player anymore. You're a wallet. " &lt;-- and this is a no shit statement. they are a business we are consumers. they may like or not like their product they may like or not like their customers but as a business they have to make their money. his post is entirely based on a single assumption made completely in the dark about 90% of the variables that are in play.
---
9/10 for me
---
There are very few games that kept me engaged for over 100 hours.
---
I have over 1000 in FO76
---
The scarecrows actually attract aggro from npcs and creatures, someone put a load in my crops as a joke, and I couldn't work out why my camp was constantly getting attacked. I removed it and now I rarely get touched.
---
It happen to me in the favorites wheel as well. So it's not just the pipboy menu.
---
That's him btw
---
level 50 with a min maxed perk build and a solid weapon like a two shot explosive handmade
---
Funny is also, that everything related to Fallout 76 gets downvoted on imgur right away.
---
&gt;  X-01 is in the Encalve (Production wing?) 
---
yep its in the production wing
---
With a solid sneak rifle man build you can take them on starting level 35 to 40
---
Claimed all the workshops, no.
---
Walked across/around the entire map, yes. I rarely fast travel (unless it's to a free location such as my camp or a public event). Costs too many caps to keep fast traveling all over the place, but, the time it takes to traverse on foot is too long. So pick your poison, walk endlessly until you reach your destination, or fast travel all over and waste your caps. I choose to walk.
---
&gt;but Raider and T-series are had to come by.
---
if youre on PC i  have all raider and t series plans and craft whatever u want
---
servers are extremely stable and fast on the private server. I haven't had so much as a lag spike in private so I think you could claim them all without crashing easily. personally in private I have farmed all 3 power plants and the ammo factory without so much as a hiccup in server performance, I farmed 150 cores..so at 20ish  cores per hour I farmed that for around 8 hours straight. on a side note I also did all the dishes and caught up on all the laundry in between pick up runs and defending. 
---
and yeah you're right about defending. no way in hell. 4 is about the most I can keep up with and actually defend and even then I often have to "retake" 1 or 2 of the shops.
---
You know, on a side not, the grind feels so much more bearable during Double XP. I'm not saying Double XP should be the norm, but the norm should be higher than it currently is. Maybe 1 1/2 times XP should be the norm. I don't know, just thinking aloud.
---
Yes I did.
---
I love taking over workshops, especially Thunder Mountain Power Plant and Mount Blair.
---
No. Probably a bug. Or the quest will continue with future DLC. But probably a bug.
---
No we do not need this that is just stupid
---
Why?
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed an increase. Chances are you have low disease resistance. Every time you get hit you have chance to contract a disease. If your disease resistance is low, you‚Äôll contract diseases often. Radaway decreases your resistance.
---
I personally don‚Äôt bother curing diseases unless it‚Äôs something bad like blood worms. Taking 50% more rad damage doesn‚Äôt really matter so it‚Äôs not worth the cure.
---
servers might be ok, but the game isn't very stable - almost everyday game freezes and quit to windows. I visited my friends world once and game quited like 5 minutes after joining.
---
I love it! :D
---
I get smacked by an enemy once and get diseased. Even while wearing armor with increased disease resistance. It's so bad that I rarely cure myself anymore, I usually just wait for it to go away on its own.
---
Get two points in fireproof, and go for it. Some poison resist armor helps as well.
---
The jet pack is def needed 100% going from a jumping mutant to power armour hurt haha
---
you edited out "they listened to feedback" as i posted...
---
Bethesda probably sees no reason to focus on bug fixes because people are already buying microtransactions and 1st subscriptions. Why would they fix anything if you're already giving them your money? They've priority list is clearly:
---
1: Microtransactions/Any new features we can charge for.
---
3: More content.
---
100: Fixing the game.
---
Ah, I'm glad to hear that, my first time posting there and I thought I had offended everyone!
---
I think it should be primary.effect
---
The game is in pretty good shape at this point from my experience. Your post is about 10 months too late.
---
i don‚Äôt have that many issues, stay well fed and we‚Äôll hydrated to give yourself a bonus to disease resistance, be careful when you take rad away since that lowers your resistance.
---
Once you've got a few disease cure recipes under your belt you'll find they're pretty easy to make. The only remotely uncommon ingredient for the Forest Disease Cure recipe is Firecap.
---
The Blight, parasites and dysentery are the only really bad ones worth using a disease cure/antibiotics on
---
Cheers, will need to check my perks, but my new level 40 Combat shotgun was easily sneak one-shotting Lvl 62 ferals in WS - which got me wondering about the SB....
---
Bring it down with enforcer the agility card, from then it should be easy for you to sneak kill it.
---
I'm not saying they're wrong, but Bethesda also said over and over that we can't have any kind of unlimited storage because it would strain the servers too much. Then we got 1st and the unlimited scrap box. It's not like they haven't lied to us already.
---
Disease cures make you more susceptible to disease, while antibiotics make you resistant.  
---
Make the latter from the former.
---
You would most likely need a full team to take all the workshops just to manage defend events. 
---
Once I got fo1st, I tried taking as many workshops as I could. Solo, I got up to 6 before the defend events overwhelmed me.
---
Just about every session on private server, I take 4 workshops. That's manageable solo, but still every 10 mins or so I have to run off and do a defend.
---
Beautiful
---
When they said that was it a ‚Äúat this time‚Äù or a ‚Äúforever‚Äù statement? I was not around when that was said I joined on the free weekend :)
---
I‚Äôve had crashes from all sorts today, they really need to focus on getting these bugs sorted
---
Absolutely love the idea of Whisperer RP, I once got attacked just out side a nuke zone, by players, and we entered into a PVP battle, I still had my perks on to placate ghouls, so I used it to charm some of the nearby ghouls and they went totally non aggro to me and attacked the guys trying to kill me in pvp it was beautiful, it ran at me as if to attack I did the pacify on it along with a couple of others and they ran right past me and attacked the dudes, I joined in and killed the guys trying to pvp me lol whilst my ghoul brethren attacked them and kept them busy. It was glorious and I totally felt like alpha and beta lol.
---
I hope Bethesda fixes their damn game and stops focusing so much on microtransactions. I don't care about the Christmas bundle. I care about the 'fix the game's bundle.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Well capes are dangerous.
---
I'd never say this is a good game, not in its current state. But there is SOME enjoyment to be found.
---
They had said multiple times that any unlimited stash would strain the servers too much. That's all. And they did not retract that statement when the unlimited Scrapbox was introduced with 1st. They never mentioned 'at this time.'
---
LOL I dont know if your joking or serious but yes losing my first save really really hit me in the gut. far far past the institute ending I had all of the settlements built up supply lines etc I was struggling with getting everyone uniformed and armed and I decided to try the settlement management tools. in my research I found out about other mods and also decided to go with touch of green and a couple others I cant recall now. yeah I did not install them in the correct order and lost all of it. did more research learned more about checking the mods for compatibility and installation order etc and tried again on a fresh start with mods enabled from the beginning. I got past the ending and got most of the settlements built up and I was enjoying the mods and son of a bitch my save got destroyed AGAIN. SOOOO I decided to give it 1 more shot. 3 strikes and you are out nexus. I restarted with a fresh save and only had the settlement management one added because it was the main one i wanted anyway. it lasted far longer than the other saves and I was pretty happy with it but eventually it too just corrupted.
---
You might be right here but I just think they thought they did have enough resources to make and maintain the game, and thought so before it was too late already. These mistakes can happen easily when planning. Though that is just my view on that atm.
---
They spent month and several big patches fixing things at first. It was many, many months after launch before they started doing content. And they always kept rebalancing and fixing bugs while doing so.
---
I do totally agree with everything you've said. Yes. Yes, indeed.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a slew of old bugs return since the two maintenance sessions they had... these are dark times.
---
I have 1500 hours in the game and im not board :D
---
Off the top of my head there are 95 mags in total you can display. I wish we could display the mags that come with the holo games as the work art on those are pretty cool.
---
Side note: my camp is in the Toxic Valley and all my mags are displayed upstairs above the pool.
---
NO CAPES
---
Did they unlock Hellfire Mk II?
---
Beth has already stated people reporting exploits would not be banned. You are safe to report it.
---
But the question is...would you like fries with that?
---
BFFR, use Unyleding armor to get more agility and perception, with a good build and prime handmade you can solo the Queen
---
I just go to the magic fountain
---
Well, Bethesda has confirmed they are not banning for reporting the exploits and are usually banning for multiple offenses. Thus, if I were you, first I'd make sure I won't ever do that exploit again and surely would not report it to Bethesda because the day I'm gonna trust those lying shameless bastards again would not be today lol.
---
Not exactly how they should work, they should repel creatures, not attract them!
---
Sounds like someone that cant clear expert
---
No. And I have no idea jf we can in the future. Considering NW is still beta and the time to explore between the matches is not enough, I would say that they will open in the future.
---
I still can't help but feel sorry for them. Not like raiders who choose to be bad.
---
Vault 51 is the Nuclear Winter vault; Vault 94 is by default a raid,  I suppose you could wander but there's lots of enemies and at harder difficulties a timer, so it won't be a stroll in the park.
---
Whether or not I can clear it is irrelevant to the point I'm making. Try again please.
---
I litterally was looking at a Deathclaw through a gate and got a disease...
---
But he did do the exploit even though he didn't want to do the ban hammer can come down
---
What Bethesda states and what they do are never the same. I'm afraid I've lost all faith at this point.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm ps4 üò¨

In my experience Gatling Plasma mag capacity are between 300-500 shot/core. Also damage wise the Gatling Plasma, got around 23% more damage compared to the Ultracite Gatling Laser. 
---
Altough i did this test on SBQ, with UGL i got 38(damage)\*22(firerate/sec)= 836 dps, with the Gatling Plasma (Focuser) 95(damage)\*11(firerate/sec)=1034 dps. Both weapons same effect, same buffs.
---
Of course the 2.6-4 second reload times make the UGL more even on long term, but i wouldnt say they really different in sustained dps.
---
Oh hey üëã thank you very much üòä
---
radaway reduces immunity by 50% disease cure doesnt boost immunity to compensate like Antibiotics does. you can avoid a lot of diseases by using one point in endurance for a perk called sunkissed. it removes rads in the day time for any character in the game I consider fire proof and sunkissed two must haves for every alt I make. 
---
the sunkissed heals up most minor rad problems without ever requiring radaway which means you spend less time with the - 50 immune debuff - which means less reason to carry as many antibiotics and disease cures. 1 point of sunkissed perk is a very powerful point for increasing your quality of life. it drastically cuts the amount of meds you need to carry. combine that with regeneration mutation and you can assign your strength points from traveling pharmacy into something else like blocker.
---
Yeah I think it is either a troll by Bethesda, or accidentally left in by them. But when they first arrived you would literally get attacked every 15 mins regular and stuff would spawn there had never before. But I took mine down as I got sick of fixing everything lol
---
Exactly. Even though I gained nothing and even stayed behind to die, I followed my team right into a glitches area.
---
Believe it or not
---
I'm walkin' on air

I never thought I could feel so free

Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer

Who could it be?

Believe it or not, it's just me.

I don't trust them not to ban you with them so id stay silent of i were you

Well my character isn‚Äôt a little puppy and can hold on curing until after the queen fight that lasts a total of 5 mins
---
Good to know. I‚Äôm grinding away to get mine.
---
Those bikes are pretty deadly I agree
---
Well, a queen fight with diseases just isn't as effective as it would be when you're not ill.
---
The effect is very minimal if at all noticeable.

My girlfriend is the same. xD [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/dxg12a/encryptid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/dxg12a/encryptid/)

Shell shock and rad worms are pretty bad.
---
that's not been my experience.
---
Until Wastelanders, yeah...
---
He's with the hate brigade. He's just shittalking every player that enjoys 76. He feels taken advantage of by BGS, and wants to make other people hate this game too. You know what they say, misery loves company.
---
So... you are not going to report it (bad), and not going to upload the video (good). Then what is the point of this post? You are obviously not going to help get it fixed, so what do you want?
---

---
Suggestions for Bethesda  
---
1. Allow Vault 51 to be open for standard players so we can obtain the lore from terminals &amp; holotapes.
---
2. Allow Vault 94 to be explored outside of a raid - again for those who want to get the lore..
---
Tell the truth. You had unprotected sex with the death claw. 
---
Don‚Äôt turn this sub into a sub of lies!
---
&gt;by going with fist
---
Eh? Iron fist is worse bonus damage-per-point that gladiator perks are.
---
The only benefit of fist weapons is the Talons mutation.
---
What's "endgame" about it exactly?
---
They lied. There is not more load on the server with more junk storage, it's simply a number in a database which changes.
---
Here's the thing. Remember when 900 hour guy got banned for too much ammo? When this happened I laughed, not at his ban...at his hours and the fact that so many people found it impossible to have that many that soon. I was at 1200 by then.
---
When patch 8 hit I was at a staggering 2700 hours, level 327...I love the game. Patch 8 completely broke it, and to this day it is unplayable.
---
After weeks of back and forth garbage from Brian at the escalation department he had me delete over 500 friends...nothing, had me uninstall the game and reinstall...nothing.
---
He even went as far as to tell me to drop all my items and leave the server, concerned that an item may be corrupting my game....nothing.
---
I asked for my items back and got an email stating that Bethesda is not responsible for lost or accidental scrapping of items. Not responsible...from the guy that told me to do it.
---
Here's the kicker. I simply wanted the money I spent on atoms back so I could buy back my items on the new account I had to make in order to continue playing.
---
Not only was I denied, but he had the nerve to scold me for starting a new account, months after he couldn't fix mine.
---
No trust left bub.
---
The day after I tried Fallout 1st I captured every workshop on the map. It took about 3 hours and most of the time I didn‚Äôt bother with the defense but did spend another 2 hours doing the ‚Äúretake‚Äù quests. A little bit dull. And I had a plethora of common plans in my inventory when it was all over. By the way if you need a ‚ÄúSingle Display Shelf‚Äù or ‚ÄúPotted Plants‚Äù, I‚Äôm your guy :)
---
xXx\_Raider\_xXx
---
Ok so I am curious what the point of this post is? You are not reporting it...
---
Ya have to let go and stop collecting the crappy plans and recipes.  
---
I only have about 20 at a given time in my vendor, but they‚Äôre rarer types.  
---
Plus, if you hop servers, they may spawn as a different plan that you may need.
---
I know this *really* doesn't help, but I haven't crashed in months and I play daily.
---
It indicates to me that there is *something* within the range of our control as PC owners that can mediate the risk of crashing.
---
Appreciate that's not a very helpful comment so apologies but just wanted to add my bit - that it's not that bad for all players.
---
Before I switched to bloodied, I'd run two pylons and hide on the roof of the shack. Usually the bloodieds would protect me. Now I sit on the roof to protect the pylons, but maybe one will jump up there. The other ones just run around and get chewed through.
---
I sell all mine for 0-10 caps each... they still don't sell well. And so 9 hord
---
You got it. How can I prove this unless the video is uploaded? It will be viewed by others and it could spread.
---
Been teamed with and killed by him before haha, major props
---
Dump some in a bag outside 76 when you see a new dot in there
---
Dump some in the  Box at the overseers Camp
---
I saw that happening as well on ps4. A guy killed me and when i watched him after death he clearly went under a condo in morgantown, hanged there for a minute,then reemerged in an alley to kill another guy.   At first i thought i was just glitched because of the spectator point of view,but the guy was alway looking up.
---
But how else is he gonna get that sweet sweet karma for trash talking 76?
---
My end game is collecting every plan. It really is what you make of it I suppose
---
My point is how can I report it? If I upload the video it will have views instantly. I'm not going to have any part of distribution of an exploit. I can report it, but how can I prove it???
---
Looks like I‚Äôll work through to get X01! Do you know best place to get fusion cores?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll get the excavator and x01, do you know where‚Äôs best to get fusion cores?
---
Just stuff to do when you‚Äôve done everything else.
---
Kind of. If you do the quest, it can be found in the trunk of the car somewhere south on the map. I honestly don't remember what the quest is called, but you can only do it once.
---
That's the spot.
---
Same here. Loading times seem like they take 5 minutes nowadays, performance is abysmal and sometimes it just crashes on loading screens. I'm sure there's something fucked about this game that wasn't there before. I mean, it always had problems, but at least it worked to the extent that it was playable. Now I cringe at the thought of even starting it up and having to face the invisible enemies, object pop-in, stuttering and crashes.
---
I don't farm them since I don't use PA all the time - I just collect them when I found full ones and usually sell them in my vendor (got 5-10 for my usage - I utilize PA only during SBQ fights and for V94 raids).
---
the fixer might be the only weapon where this bug doesnt matter because its a sneak weapon. and sneak breaks this bug.
---
Scrubber paint was available some time ago as part of raider bundle if I remember correctly. I'm not sure if it available now and/or as separate item.
---
This...
---
Never did the Vault raids and now never see anyone doing them so I'm SoL
---
No, no, aaaand yes it totally should be free
---
There was a raider scabber paint, and an upcoming Chinese rifle skin too.
---
It isn't their fault, they got sick and unwillingly became drones under a malevolent influence.  Putting them down, at this point, is a mercy.
---
I agree with you, but I wasn't saying that you need to buy it, I just said that for the people who buy it.
---
Ibet you there's gonna be a atomicshop item to "fix" that
---
Christ... Like it'd be so goddamn difficult for them to just keep weapon skins in the shop
---
Especially for one of the more popular guns.
---
But no... Please have multiple skins for daggers............
---
Looks like I‚Äôll be on a plan hunt and fusion core hunt! Do you know best place to get fusion cores?
---
To be fair its not a bug, its just how they shoehorned survival mechanics into the game.
---
Iron man? Is that you?
---
I also bought this bundle because I wanted any skin to not scrap or sell or scrip my handmades accidentally - skin itself is shitty, but it works ;)
---
Happy Cake Day
---
I think you don't have to convince people who bought it ;)
---
Alright thank you very much
---
if you are incapable of original thought and creating your own fun in a post apocalyptic sandbox. yes. 
---
I have been playing since beta and keeping myself entertained just fine. so much to do I have to prioritize. Currently I am trying to maximize my all characters max caps sales as fast as possible by maximizing legit in game serum manufacturing by farming the sbq. just finished getting hard bargain 3 on 4 fresh characters all stationed at morgantown for the serum traffic. 
---
since I can make more serums than I can sell in a day and I already have to get out of power armor to do that bit of crafting I have redecorated into an infirmary themed CAMP complete with hospital beds with displays set up so it appears to have healing tools on hand. and a well stocked vendor of chems and meds. of course it is the wasteland, 
---
so to keep the flavor I have started refarming ticks and tick blood to keep my healing supplies high . since I am already rich af i only sell the stim packs for 5c per.  thats mostly to help level 30 and 40 players who show up and actually need them. at the same time if someone buys them to resell that's ok by me to. I just stock the shelf's I don't actually care about my patients to much like any good doctor have to maintain emotional distance from the patients or it will cloud your judgement and all that. 
---
And I have my first fully functioning bathroom. a working anti rad arch serves as the shower there is a bench and lockers for changin a toilet and a display stand with a plunger and 3 rolls of toilet paper. that my friend is some high level end game entertainment.
---
Oh sorry I didn't explain myself well, I wanted to say people who bought it and think that it wasn't worth it.
---
Sorry again.
---
I partly agree with your post statement regarding mtx in the concluding paragraph. I for one find all these live services abhorrent in any game (unless done right of course), especially one that goes against established promises for a game that is as polished as a turd in a washing machine currently.
---
However I'd be okay with all of these changes if they were simply transparent and communicated with the community and gave us answers. If Bethesda told us they were in a tight spot and things like FO1st would greatly improve the quality of content, I wouldn't hesitate to support it. 
---
But I refuse to throw my money at a company that seems to care more about profit than the actual community. They've pretty much ignored most crucial feedback at every turn and drummed up one PR disaster after another since launch, constantly laying low until whatever current blunder blows over (as it always does for this community).
---
I honestly did not finish your main body post but will finish it rn and leave additional thoughts in an edit.
---
You don't need to be sorry - you got you opinion, I got mine - that's cool :)
---
I also respect your opinion :)
---
I remember seeing level 100 person first time only two weeks after nw...i was astonished..
---
Depends what mood I'm in. If I feel like killing something tough then I'll hit up one of those events, otherwise I just do the dailys, grind the normal events for hopes of rare plan or outfit drops or rebuild my camp. I'm running out of things to spend caps on so I've starting buying all the plans that I can't get from grinding events.
---
Even by glitching you can't explore them. They moved the mapped part into cells :(
---
Cutthoart crag? Cutthoart raiders?!
---
im on pc got the strangler heart PA
---
woudl love to help other people get it as long as they can read and listen
---
I link you a post from Beth that explains how to etc
---
Okay, thanks. But won't I loose my chaeacter if I do that?
---
Source?
---
I'm just getting them from workshop defense missions etc and yes I could get rid of them but I have a hoarder mentality that prevents me from just dumping them if I think they have value.
---
They're enough options to upload videos private, that only people can watch if they have a link to the video.
---
Easy to change and then some other poor sod gets assigned the old IP.
---
That's awesome, thank you üòä
---
Never knew about this. Know any other quirky little lesser-known things around the map like this?
---
Put them in the body outside V76 - some fresh vault dwellers would benefit. They're wasting space in the vendor machine, usually no one will buy it, even for 10 caps.
---
The trailer implies they settle the crashed space station. I've seen changes made to Morgantown Airport too that make me wonder if some are gonna pop up there.
---
On YouTube??
---
You didn‚Äôt like your welcome party?
---
Was this in the northern mire area near the pumpkin house, fissure site, and red rocket mega stop?
---
To be fair, neither are Bethesda.
---
I feel ya.  I was the same way.  
---
Junk plans from workshops and quests go into my free bag I put on my shop counter.  I drop one each time I start on a world.
---
About the transparency (and the rest), it is awful. I mean, if we'd only talk about the outcome, it is terrible. A very bad game, no objections there. I just wanted to figure out why is it so and perhaps I did. Why is communication so bad? I think that is because they do not really have that much news to tell. When they do, they do, but in the meanwhile, when there are no good news to tell, they are keeping silence and that is about it. As to feedback, I think (as mentioned in main body) they got it, but they do not have enough resources to cover much of it while working on a new content.  
---
Does it somehow make it any better? No. Is it a good excuse? No. Whose fault is that? Bethesda's.
---
Spot on depiction of the current situation. And yes, micro transactions will soon be P2W, no doubt.
---
Yeah, shell shock is my bane; I keep my CAMP located just north of Watoga at that little power substation where the deathclaw and the giant ants always spawn. It's a good spot aside from the fact that I'm always having to fight a high-level deathclaw that almost always inflicts shell shock if it can land a hit. I take frequent trips to Whitesprings to cure it at the magic fountain.
---
i have ALL power armor plans ( for x-01 i only have calibrated shocks,jetpack and targetting hud + bracers)
---
You can easily tell that atom shop owner doesn‚Äôt care about money. Next to none skins for most popular weapons, yet they had to make skins for assaultron head and baton for the two players that actually use those. They also nerfed shotguns to oblivion before they brought out the responder skins, just to make sure nobody will buy them.
---
Just Google Fallout 76. The top stories that pop up are from ComicBook &amp; DGR. Both are about the leak &amp; where they got it from.
---
I have a character on BDO who‚Äôs a ‚Äúrough guy doesn‚Äôt take shit and gets his way when he wants it‚Äù Ergaus Ashthrone if you‚Äôre happy to use that?
---
Luck effects a lot more in the game than Vats crit meter though, they just don't spell it all out as it's lumped in with "general good fortune" :)
---
yes , on youtube, you can set video to "only people with links can view it"
---
emphasize on accidental find and act like stupid when you report it, since the one who got banned is doing it more than once to make sure of how the exploit works.
---
ye, i have the same problem man :D
---
Ooh excellent
---
You dont need to pop a cure every single time you get sick, most of the time the debuff isnt worth popping a cure ...
---
Very close to the pumpkin house, just right of the mire cave.
---
You must not play the game very much....
---
Oh that sucks. I haven't had any issues (I'm sure I will now üò¨). what platform are you on?
---
Just like the Tesla randomly causing all your ranged damage to go to 0 until you reset the whole game.
---
The Sheepsquatch head isn't a skin, it's a weapon, but it takes different materials to craft.
---
It wouldn't hurt, that's for sure! Hopefully you'll be playing with people who aren't assholes and would be understanding of someone learning.
---
I've noticed the number display in you inventory can be inconsistent, I've gone in and out of inventory and it would show a totally different number for the same weapon. If you go into settings you can turn on damage output when you hit enemies which seems to be more accurate though it will vary by enemy. Axes should be fine, I use a few different ones that I toggle between, but I'd recommend trying to track down an instigating or anti-armor one instead of troubleshooters for general use unless you go for a build like junkies or bloodied.
---
I would personally like to know if Bethesda is understaffed or if whether customer support is a different branch located elswhere. 
---
I remember submitting a ticket once and a guy named John (Last name obviously not given) resolved my issue poorly with poor spelling and grammar and his occupation sign off being with "The Elder Scrolls Online Support Team" or something along those lines. 
---
I suppose they are trying to remain professional and not admit that everything is on fire which would make sense. But I prefer to hear the truth no matter how painful it is and support it knowing my money is actually supporting development and not just going into some suits pocket.
---
Often 3 or 4 in fort defiance as long as you have access to the top floor
---
Vault 51 is nuclear winter. No raid required but you only have 2-3 minutes to explore before match starts. You need to level up in NW to gain access to all areas and lore. 
---
Vault 63 isn‚Äôt open yet. 
---
Vault 94 is only accessible via raids. 
---
Vault 96 isn‚Äôt open yet
---
Vault 79 unclear what this is going to be, presumably in wastelanders. Unclear if we will be able to explore.
---
Someone's salty bc they cant clear expert lol
---
My Vendor?
---
More serious note, they are plentful in the wild, you get them as rewards for some missions (BoS) and the power station workshops can produce them (In Safety if you're a 1st)
---
Supposedly no limit
---
Well then just say exactly where and others will report it. Ive guessed at this before on this thread. Thought it may have been aimbot untill i thought of an underground glitch
---
1. I use the quicker view as opposed to the physical pipboy view
---
2. The freeze happens in the pipboy itself, immediately after pressing A to consume the item, I don't use the favourites wheel for aid so there is no movement happening at the time
---
Xbox, had the chance to get a full set of T-60 plans from a player vendor, but it would of emptied me out of Caps, so I passed. Not seen the Vendor since...
---
They are one time use items and if they are easily found plans you are really just hoping someone early in their game makes a mistake to give you free caps.
---
If I hover over a plan that I already know I do not pick it up, leave it for the next person who comes by. You are not entitled to value for everything you pick up in game.
---
I've noticed that if the atom shop has the loading wheel on it, if you go into the game you won't have access to some of your atom shop items like emotes. Usually quitting the game and reopening will fix this.
---
That's...actually terrifying...now I'm worried to what an Ancient one is üëÄ
---
I should have taken a screenshot to add with the video üòï
---
Well, you're right, but I only used 1 minute to answer and explore this subreddit and then I went to play Pokemon Omega Ruby, so I don't think it was a waste of time üòÅ
---
Infinity + 1
---
I‚Äôm actually pretty compared to the other folks around here haha. The power plants have a fusion core pump thing you can power when you take the work shops!
---
I build elaborate traps and trap ppl, it‚Äôs a good time haha :) and as long as you build something interesting people never get mad, the most I‚Äôve got was a message saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got your number bud‚Äù haha
---
I'm actually selling disease cures in my vendor at 5 Caps a pop, they get brought frequently enough.
---
My BoS Engineer is fast becoming a Responder Pharmacist.
---
Holy fuck
---
Leave them in your stash
---
Eating, Stimpak-ing, opening my Pipboy, opening my map, fast swapping between my latest two weapons.... It's gotten SO bad.
---
How do you gather them one at a time?
---
Mine always combine
---
Can you still drop sets of the PA ?
---
I agree, I have a two handed build but even without the one handed perks, I use a junkies faster swing speed combat knife and it cuts through swarms of enemies like butter. With a proper build it could probably do some serious damage on tougher enemies too.
---
Lol that was great
---
I was sitting at a loading screen for several mins yesterday before I just restarted the game.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 never ran a raid but always wanted to, id be happy to team up with you to try them! I play as a medic so would hopefully be quite helpful
---
I heard you was able to drop a frame with the PA on it and give/sell it basically
---
Just found a post of someone somewhere who suggested that you take one out of your stash and server hop. After you hop, you put it in a world container and then pick it back up. 
---
Whether this works or not, I don't know yet
---
Now if I could just bottle that goodness.
---
Why do you need to prove it? You already said you won't report it, so proving it serves no purpose?
---
I'm not entirely sure how it works. Have read somewhere that if you collect over 10, then a new stack starts in your inventory. But I've no idea whether that's true
---
Recently, I've been trying to solo Vault 94. Interspersed with completing challenges while searching for the elusive 3* combat knife.
---
Yeah I only pop a cure for parasites. Pesky parasites
---
I actually hope so, the lore is its best feature.
---
tried putting all but 1 in stash. No good , quest has to be active. debatable wether 1 or all makes any difference as to reward.
---
No. Probably a *feature*. Or the quest will continue with future DLC. But probably a *feature*.
---
There. Fixed that for ya üòè
---
Vanilla bug going all the way back to Fallout 3 AFAIK.
---
i‚Äôve been looking for anti armor but not having any luck. thank you! i‚Äôll definitely put damage output on
---
Yea the most charisma the more caps you make
---
"It", did not do this. You did. You have to check that you choose a perk matching the same ability you just spent since it is possible to choose one ability point and a perk from another.
---
Also, no need to delete characters. After lvl 50 you can move points.
---
If they buy you out to resell does it really matter? You get a bundle of caps and they try to resell stuff at prices many low level players cannot afford. Also if it is supplies like meds it is possible the level 200 actually needs them more than a level 5. 
---
A low level character can easily get by on food and non diluted items are almost a waste. Unless they are running off to more difficult areas early, depending on how often they scavenge they are often swimming in supplies.
---
As a low level what I would like to see in shops more are simple low level modded gear at decent prices. By late game you probably have unlocked all the mods for a really neat hunting rifle or automatic 10mm guns. And easily have collected all the plans for efficient leather armor.
---
the amount you need to win the game.
---
False, there is also no point to hoarding them, you will only deposit one per quest
---
i‚Äôm pretty sure your right! i use to eat glowing meat. and haven‚Äôt since i was level 90. i will definitely look when i get home!!! thank you!
---
Sheesh you‚Äôre incompetent
---
Just a reminder (I'm positive you know this already and this isn't what happened.) you select the Special you want to raise and then you scroll through the other categories with the, I believe its L2 and R2 on PS4 to select the perk you want to purchase.
---
I've sadly not heard of anything that could cause your issue.
---
Lone wanderer is from the charisma line and he‚Äôs saying the point went to strength.
---
That place is craaaazy!
---
When you choose your Stat, you can tab over to see other perks to choose from other stats. I am assuming you accidently did this.
---
I chose Lone Wanderer which in the past it gave me a Charisma point but did not this time.
---
Mole miners should be locked to level 40, I believe, though if they swarm and start firing missile launchers at you, they can do some damage. Ghouls should level much higher and can take down high level characters if they aren't careful, especially if they give you rad worms which they always do.
---
Check your t-51 armor to make sure it's level 50 on all the pieces and repaired. Also check to make sure you don't have any status ailments. Excavator armor may look cool and can carry more but it's not as good as others for damage protection.
---
That might be possible but the resources just to get the plans and craft it are insane. Be worth a literal fortune.
---
So looking at your replies, your IQ seems to be in the single digits.
---
Doh, that sucks man. Will have to give this a try myself later
---
It is a wasteland out there...
---
My main is level 180 I do not see how I could of done this so many times. I always tab through to see what new perks I have gotten.
---
Wrong. Check them out in detail.
---
Blood worms: Take 25% more damage  
---
Bone worms: Take 50% more limb damage  
---
Rad worms: Take 50% more radiation damage.  
---
Flap limb: STR -2
---
Just to name a few. All of these are pretty bad for a melee in a queen fight.
---
True, I wonder if it does work and what market value would be, like 30k or maybe up to like 150k caps!
---
No. The two are independent.
---
It is in the name, Fallout 1st, they may hide Wastelanders for some amount of time as an exclusive. Also probably will load the atomic shop with a lot more exclusive items with the update.
---
I am hoping at least the base update is free.
---
I love it. Just point and shoot with nothing else to worry about.
---
I assume this was by generals steakhouse? Happens all the time over there.
---
To be fair, I think 76 makes clear that West Virginia wasn't bombed directly.  The destruction you see in places like Toxic Valley and the Ash Heap actually came from greedy mining companies aggressively exploiting the region in Pre-War times.  Welch, for example, wasn't bombed from above.  It collapsed due to Ultracite mining.
---
Trust me, it's 100%. I've been using two pieces of fall damage armor and bird bones for hundreds and hundreds of hours and I have yet to find a cliff that will damage me at all.  Serendipity doesn't even trigger because no damage happens.

The HDD could be faulty or any other hardware too.
---
Wow!  That's amazing progress
---
Do the items appear in the Atomic Shop? Might be you have to redeem them. Ben playing since BETA and I have no clue how that works anymore.
---
Nope. The special you raise and the perk you choose need not be same.
---
I am on the verge of paying so I can get a private world. But I think I will give it a while still, I want to see if I can g set and hold workshops without the game crashing or some griefer PVP me in adventure. 
---
Also the private world makes it easier to tune people out when I want a quiet walk reading terminals. I try not to ignore people in Adventure although sometimes I do sort of have a plan for my playthrough of throughly exploring some tiny corner.
---
Cool, I‚Äôll try that.  My understanding was that you could on,y get the plan from events, but I‚Äôll try to see if I can find it that way.
---
50 Times with varying teammates.
---
I wouldn't report this. Bethasda says you're not going to be banned but they can say whatever they want at this point, I don't believe a word they say. So no, do not report this, you will only get problems.
---
Dope!
---
They should make a helium filled backpack that increases carry weight the same as the normal pack but gives 100% fall damage mitigation BUT also has a DR and ER penalty similar to the high cap pack to balance it out. It would be an interesting alternative to fall damage armor.
---
The perk card doesn't determine the perk point. When you level up and you're asked to select a special stat, it applies the point to the one you picked then card is picked independently of that.
---
It's quite possible select a point in strength but then pick an intelligence card instead for example.
---
I'd say it was probably 16-17 levels.  I was somewhere around Lv. 98 and made it to Lv. 115.

Meta gaming? I'm telling people to stay away from people who are gonna steal your caps then destroy your base. There's no metagaming about putting up warnings.
---
Making a completely new engine and game from scratch would in all likelihood take a lot more time than improving Fallout 76. People are impatient because Wastelanders (the first actual significant update) has been delayed by a few months, yet a full new Fallout game would be unlikely before around 2029, and even that estimate might be on the optimistic side. The whole point of the "live service" model is to be able to build on the same game for a long time, rather than having to start over every few years.
---
End game is what you want to make it.
---
Addictol is just an excuse to get addicted to chems all over again! What's the harm in that? Well, except for tracking down Formula P. Ugh. (Pops some fury and and chugs a bottle of whiskey)
---
Sounds like your character is just to weak to be doing queen fights if being diseased makes a major difference for you.
---
Maybe live in a bubble?
---
No I do play on Xbox. But in your case someone is posting in a forum that they are starting it and then others join.  If someone starts Encryptid in a random lobby with no heads up then no one joins it, or those that do don't know the mechanics. 
---
I mean everyone in the lobby joins in on SBQ because all it takes is one bloodied melee user and it's a guarantee kill. Encruptid, not so much with randos.
---
Yeah i already have all the BoS paints....i just have 30 or so tech datas sitting in my stash and i noticed theyre useless. I dont really bother running the quest anymore since i already have the rewards, but i would at least deposit them for the free ammo, if it worked like that
---
I've seen mine attack enemies, but yeah, pretty ineffective. Honestly if you get rid of turrets and don't farm, your base will barely get attacked unless you are right by a spawn point. Turrets and crops make your camp get attacked more frequently in my experience.
---
We need more variety in stair placement. 
---
Right now we have center stairs only. We should be able to place them left-aligned and right-aligned as well. 
---
We need to be able to stack foundations. We could in Fallout 4, why not now?
---
They need to fix their lazy invisible ramps on foundations.
---
I would really enjoy basements (like the Cellar in the Hearthfire DLC for Skyrim).
---
A separate interior cell would allow us to get more creative without lagging the server/other users. 
---
I could go on all day about improvements for camp building.
---
Nice catch!
---
Update: So the problem was happening to me everytime I'd swap servers but it would stay until I switched my weapon over, if I tried to use the one I loaded in with, it would go up by 1 shell then the infinite reload animation would begin, it would be stuck at one shell.
---
IMO, what they should have done is just have a general disease resistance and eliminate this whole distinction between "diseases from creatures" versus "diseases from the environment" that each have 3 ranks of Perk Cards.  No one is going to spend 6 SPECIAL points on disease prevention.
---
You might say, "Oh, stop whining, it makes the game harder."  To which I say, Bethesda already undermined their own mechanics by having the magic sulfur drinking fountain at Whitesprings that cures all diseases.  I could waste time FT'ing to Whitesprings and call it a day.
---
How about you provide the source for this instead of telling people to google it. You are the one making the claim of this ‚Äúleak‚Äù it is only a reasonable suggestion to provide a source to said ‚Äúleak‚Äù.
---
Thanks google
---
If I had it and crafted it I wouldn't sell it for less than 150k and two godroll legendaries. Five legendaries if they were all right. It takes like s month of daily runs on all modes to just get the mats for it.
---
that of course circles back to my OQ: What are the breakpoint numbers? 
---
If someone was, for instance, using PA but trying to calculate mathatically the optimal mix of parts to reach the optimal B/E/R resists in that situation then knowing the breakpoints would be good
---
In Nuclear Winter I got 13 levels :D
---
I saw that too. Definitely stepped up. Also running solo you get an idea what perks might be needed or helpful in a group setting.
---
The only ones I stop and cure immediately are blood worms, fever claw and rattle hands. The rest can wait or run their course.
---
Getting the antibiotics plan and making a bunch of those is very beneficial, because of the 50% resistance.  It stacks with inert flux and blood leaf tea.
---
With chemist, green thumb and super duper, you can start at the junk yard and follow the river south to Flatwoods and make 30-40 disease cures in one sitting at the chem bench in the church.  The firecaps require a bit of searching and grow all over the northern end of the route, but you‚Äôll have tons of snaptail and bloodleaf left over.  That many cures will last me a while.
---
Or you could just hand them to your buddies if they dont have any to turn in!
---
Ex-sqeeze me?? üò≥ Are you on Xbox by chance?
---
I buy them from player vendors whenever I see them for a reasonable price. Formula P is a must for melee junkies build but it's made from the plant in Arktos I believe, so you don't see it around much. Daddy-O shows up in med chests I believe so people often sell it.
---
Ok, so you're saying you can display all the magazines, But then you said there's some you can't display...
---
Pick a friend, give him your stack of technical data, he jump to new location with world containers. You re-join to him, when you leave, buddy put data into crate. One world container work once for session (dont have any ideas about private server, not 1st member). This method works 100% some patches ago
---
Just become a Plague Walker.
---
No there is literally a legendary affect for this, not to mention a mutation and perk cards that can help mitigate.
---
This actually speaks to my only real issue with stealth in general...it always gets shattered in groups. By myself I can waltz through any location and wipe out mobs in quick order. But during things like a queen event I always get spotted, with or without armor. So, naturally, running a nuke zone becomes an issue.
---
You can display all magazines, but games (i.e. Nuka Tapper) is not consider as a magazine, despite it looks like magazine when you pick it up (magazine gives you certain bonus when you "consume" it, while game gives you certain bonus when pick up and disappears, leaving only hologame you can play using your PipBoy.)
---
Yeah I put on Pharma Farmer and hit the places with chem boxes when I need to, Daddy-O just seems to be the rarest chem to find in them.
---
you're welcome, I know googling can be hard
---
They need to be found in the wild to trigger the quest, they are worth 1 cap to a Vendor bot.
---
Thanks!! üëç
---
Thanks! Don't suppose you know which mission it is this week too? Currently in work and planning my night haha.
---
Protect AND Serve
---
I don‚Äôt use bird bones but have two fall damage pieces, I never take any fall damage :) and a lot of people don‚Äôt care about that effect so they are usually cheap. I have Van/AP/Fall. Goat legs is a waste points imo
---
It started with just me and my dad and we were picked up by a group that played together one of them in the group is actually from the same state as me and my dad
---
I don't think the hats are worth anything without the matching outfit, I've got one of each and some doubles I collected easily while looking for outfits, still only got the white (non-dirty) outfit so far.
---
Yes. You can find my Camp just east of the observatory.
---
Ok, I see, I've grabbed the game ones before and didn't realize the magazine had disappeared or anything
---
&gt; What I mean by breakpoints is the point at which Ballistic/Energy/Radiation resistance is typically past the point of  diminishing returns. 
---
Sorry what do you mean by past the point of diminishing returns?
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll just stick em in my stash for now till I find the outfits
---
Yup got it figured out. I was just at the 1st screen with lack of options. Thanks!
---
They would be walking away from hundreds of millions in funding.
---
Ok, lots of people providing solutions and reasons, that doesn't negate the utterly ridiculous ease of contraction mechanic there is!
---
That said, there's also a 5% disease resist on all raw and inert flux... for what that's worth
---
Duly noted. I'll just avoid the area.
---
I buy .38 ammo but no higher than 2-1. I‚Äôll never pay 1-1 for .38
---
If you're a melee build it's not that bad doing it solo on normal, specially if you got the right armor and weapon. Everything else is too difficult and to resource expensive to be worth it.
---
188-201 in NW

Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.
---
I've always heard of this, never ever happened to me until after the latest patch. Happened to me 3 times now.
---
Same GT as your handle here I take it? I'm happy to buy you out every time you get a reasonably sized bulk. Are there any items you frequently come up short on or are looking for? I feel like 5c for the extent of fuss involved is imbalanced and id love to help motivate higher yield from ya
---
that sucks a big one, I have about 43 in my stash ü§£
---
When you pick up magazine or bobbleheads they are in your AID tab when you can consume them gaining certain bonus (which lasts 1 hour for bobbles and 30 minutes for Magazines). When you found one of holotapes games they looks like magazine but you get bonus right away and you get game in HOLOTAPES tab in your pipboy (it won't be consume upon playing). If you won't use bobbles or magazines you can show them in the camp in special racks.
---
If you hit ctrl alt del, you can sign out and save the time shutting your PC off an on.
---
I would recommend a Anti Armor Handmade and all vats character
---
I just use plague walker and let the diseases fester.
---
"You're suffering from radworms"
---
BITCH, I enjoy every minute of it!
---
It's "Dead in the Water".
---
that doesn't work either. i wish it did. but when it hard locks up like that and freezes nothing works for me.
---
I personally always just ran full excavator. Once you craft the max level version, the DR isn't that far removed, plus it still has all the passive benefits mentioned before. PLUS you get double ore from nodes. Win win win.
---
why are you karma farming, when there is a settlement that needs your help
---
(check his post history lol)
---
No I understand all this. I had thought that the games just came randomly with a magazine. So I was trying to understand what you meant. But there are specific game magazines that disappear, got it.
---
Hey you never know, someone has to try it, maybe buy 1000,000,000 atoms as a test?
---
yes, here is list that might help you:
---
https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/Holotapes-Fallout-76.asp
---
yup, this has killed me more than a few times
---
They were probably duped or you're just looking to take advantage of a generous player
---
Insulting me won‚Äôt make this game better but a refund would be nice
---
The first gun to find is an Instigating Lever Action.  This gun alone will 1-shot nearly every mob in the game.  Then I‚Äôd look for a good Handmade for when you‚Äôre fighting in close quarters, or when your doing events like the SBQ.  Furious, AntiArmor, Vampires, or many others can work for this.
---
That said, it‚Äôs the Instigating Lever that will transform your build.  A 1* will do, but if you can get one with Exploding, VATS50, or FFR, that‚Äôs even better. 
---
All the above is for a high health build.  If you are willing to go Bloodied, then obviously you‚Äôll do great damage with bloodied levers and Handmades.
---
I gained maybe four levels. Been busy playing Fallen Order.
---
Yeah, those hats are worth about 15 caps each.
---
What in the world made you buy this game? Can you describe the process which took you to this? Were you high or something?
---
You can try emailing them, but they have a strict "no run-on sentences" policy.
---
Tabbing through the categories is what did it. You put a point in strength but then went to the charisma category and chose a card.
---
A fixer is probably a good idea. Really, for rate of fire you may want to just switch to commando. Fixers are great for either type, and if you go with a Bloodied or Junkie's, you'll be able to 1 shot sneak hit most things even without tweaking your build too hard. Handmades are cool too! 
---
If you want to stick with Rifleman, I'd suggest going to maybe a quad pipe rifle or revolver, you'll get more shots and they're pretty fast, even without automatic, and they have a more viable number of shots to keep you alive‚Äîespecially the pipe rifle!
---
Ay. I say your post on FB a while back. Thumbs up for being in my group. Lol
---
That‚Äôs one of a kind mongrel you got there, since Explosive and 10Aiming shouldn‚Äôt stack. Keep it and auction it on ebay üí∞
---
I have a route that allows me to conviently produce about 16 per trip. To make more I would need to find alternate locations.
---
yes
---
I wanted to give it a try I thought it might have been better then people said but it wasn‚Äôt it was very bad
---
i have strangler heart pa and b/ex/reload fixer so i should be fine
---
Eh, duped weapons don't just disappear. They will disappear if you try a couple of the old methods though, such as dropping them in a bag. That was one way Bethesda started to mitigate the duping crisis.
---
On Xbox, I sit through load screens when fast travelling, then when I'm in game it freezes for 3-10 seconds, most times twice before I can actually move. What the hell was the load screen for?
---
I agree though, I'm pretty sure if guy freshly renamed them, he was probably trying to use an old exploit, and it back fired. Why would you just randomly rename your items?
---
Whatever the excuse is, it's inexcusable.
---
if you think anything in those 2 sentences was an insult, you should seriously go seek professional help.
---
armour piercing is the key. non lgndry lever and gatling have no armour penetration and are pants , even with 2 shot, to others like combat, h/made, hunting etc which, regardless of the stated damage. will out perform. you have all 9 rifle cards and 3 tank ?. you could try the fixer (SLIGHTLY) better combat rifle.
---
Yeah, I could... I just don't wanna lol I'll buy 30-50/visit. I'll add you and come visit asap.
---
In my experience lever action has the best vats hit chance out of all weapons.  I can see a clear difference between all the rifles when it says ‚Äú95% chance‚Äù or ‚Äú60% chance‚Äù. On lever action I hit every shot every time no matter percent. In my experience.  Gauss rifle barely hits.  Hunting rifle and handmade somewhere in the middle. 
---
Damage wise lever action and gauss is competitor. I prefer lever action for accuracy and stealth. Get the speedy receiver. Or whichever one speeds up the shots. Also if u can get a faster fire rate legendary then it‚Äôs a beast gun. The best gun for me  is instigating lever action. I shoot for about 3000 damage most of the time so unless there is more than five enemies, you shouldn‚Äôt have issues with fire rate or reloading. 
---
Lever action all the way.   Handmade rifle is weak if not running full auto.
---
So you shoot tasers out of your face?
---
Really hope you're right lol. Turned in probably 100 since launch and never got a paint, now recently bought a plan so I'll try again thanks!
---
Well yeah, it wasn't! I hope you'll get your refund.
---
You can only pick one up a time, then you have to drop it off that play through or itll be useless.  Giving it to someone else will not work.  So it is annoying a one and drop off.
---
This engine is actually incredibly modular. Look at all the diverse mods that have been made for 4 and compare it to previous titles.
---
What this engine was not built for was multiplayer. There's already a cap on how many NPCs can exist in a cell before things start breaking. No way it was going to handle online.
---
Hats aren't worth anything
---
The game freezes up enough as it is.

Unfortunately, there has never been a time in the history of the world where the money wasn't (mostly) going into some suits pocket. Also, yes, they are chronically understaffed, especially at the lowest levels imaginable, such as forward-facing customer support. All of which are treated as disposable junior-grade janitors at every single large business on the face of the earth. They have three days of training, make about $12 / hr and are literally hired en masse through agencies about 75-percent of the time. 
---
No corporation will ever tell you that they are "having a tough time" (looks bad for the leaders who might want to jump to a more lucrative position elsewhere, or shareholders (in the case, potential "buyers"). 
---
The single biggest favor we as players can do to help preserve the hobby is to stop treating corporations like trusted friends and lifelong companions just because they made (or used to make) something we love. They are neither of those things. They never were those things. They never will be those things. Treat them accordingly.
---
Did not know it was possible but after reading the comments apparently not only you are the bad guy but also you deserve that for trying to rename your weapons which is apparently an offense worthy of deleting all of your renamed weapons.
---
This isnt where you go for refunds.
---
3000 damage? i think im about 210 ?
---
Can you tell me which perk cards you have to get such an obscene damage?!
---
I need this build lol.
---
Thanks!
---
Bethesda actually has a program on their computers that block out the words ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù, so they won‚Äôt be putting this in game.
---
When i did play i used the plasma minigun with all the heavy weapon perks maxed an i could pretty much melt anything in seconds
---
&gt; non lgndry lever and gatling have no armour penetration and are pants , even with 2 shot, to others like combat, h/made, hunting etc which, regardless of the stated damage. will out perform. you have all 9 rifle cards and 3 tank ?. you could try the fixer (SLIGHTL

So armour piercing outperforms 2 shot?
---
Its a bug that you can carry more than one. You can't turn in more than one though.
---
"It's just like rain, but it's just not like rain."
---
no it wasn't. it was their way of staying in communication with the players after so many felt ignored after the near dead-silence after launch. it was always meant to keep people updated regardless of if they had something to say or not. you are right however that there isn't much to talk about these days.
---
yea, seriously.  
---
I'm a melee build.  Incisor, gladiator, glow sight, and martial artist, and am usually in Excavator.
---
I don't use food/chems/bobbles/mags for buffs, and I never figured out how to put/use stimpacks on the favorites wheel (or I'm too slow to get it to work right).  and power swings take too much AP.  
---
  When the entire population of the golf club swarms me at the door, the all rise, grognak... (or pretty much anything with high damage but slow speed) does not take them out fast enough, and I take too many hits to survive the battle, especially if WS had been nuked.
---
  Vampire switch blade hits 3x in the time it takes slow speed weapons to hit once (so ultimately, it does more damage in the same time frame), and gives me a bit of health regen while its at it... end result is I can kill the entire mob while standing at the door.
---
I‚Äôm a walking plague in this game, unless I have something that lowers my carry weight or drains stamina I usually ignore disease

im sure it was the assaultron eye blast, it do be like that sometimes, as the kid say nowadays

Ive always thought instigating was inferior to 2 shot in that you only get double damage on the first shot. I have a 2 shot executioner gives me extra damage near the end of said monsters life, plus the extra shot - is that better?
---
Yes it was... I‚Äôll try and find the post where they talk about how they decided to keep doing inside the vault posts.
---
In most games, due to the math in the system that calculates attack values vs defense values, there is a point at which (for either attack or defense) stacking it further doesn't actually add to the stat further in a meaningful way. I am not a math guy but I have seen it consistently in everything from WoW to Pokemon GO so I was wondering if anyone had done the calculations in FO76.
---
My character is the same way.  I wanted Ramona to be a tinkerer, but most of what she sells is chems and Ballistic Bock.  Now, whenever I come back home, I switch over to my Paramedic Jumpsuit.

i rename my stuff so my favs appear at top of list by adding a 1 onto the start
---
The issue with two shot is the accuracy.  You are likely only hitting with one projectile with most long shots.  With the Instigating Lever you want to target VATS head shots.  If you do this, you should be hitting for just about 1,800 on a regular headshot with only a 1* Rifle. 
---
Two shot is actually a pretty bad prefix.  I pretty much won‚Äôt use them at all.  The key here is going for 1 shot,  1 kill.  The Instigating Lever gets to the point you will be 1 shotting 3* Level 68 mobs easily.
---
I should be clear. The commitment to doing them weekly was a wild Appalachia thing
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. so far this is what I KNOW i don‚Äôt know
---
- lead pipe

- sturdy metal torso, arms and legs
---
- heavy metal torso, arms and legs
---
- bear arms
---
- light, sturdy and heavy raider torso, arms and legs

- raider pwer armor torso, legs and arms
---
- t45 helmet, torso arms and legs
---
- t51 legs
---
- t60 right arm
---
- shielded casual
---
- shielded marine
---
and there are still 4 mods for the x01 I need to buy. I have bought all other plans for amor, weapons and mods. even crappy raider power armor mod plans. 
---
hopeless for the raider armor parts though...
---
its a feature, when they fall back in the hole thats how you get to them
---
Go stand infront of a Snallygaster and wait for it to spit, then spam the pickup button and bam it's in your inventory.
---
I might idk though i have the attention span of a rodent when it comes to games. Im probably super behind now.
---
I solo the queen with a stealth commando build. Using a BFFR Radium with prime receiver. 
---
A few chems and a couple perk card swaps and she‚Äôs not so bad solo.
---
I never liked legendary gear in the game to begin with. Cheapens the "survival" aspect for me tbh. One day I'm hoping mods become allowed because that's the first thing in doing.
---
Same,  rebuilt my CAMP, too, which is something I had been meaning to do.
---
Blooided unyielding sent melee Or rifle is most popular and most overpowering....I happen to like vanguard vamp rifleman for PVE.
---
This actually reminds me of a new bug I've been running into. Whenever I loaded into a server, my weapon would reload to a weird ammo capacity and when I attempted to fire, a message would pop-up saying that I don't have the ammo for the weapon. Just like you, switching to another weapon and back fixed it.
---
We have one TV in the house (I play on xbox) so the 25 hours played were basically a gift from my wife, lol.
---
Ya, but once you do that, why rename them again?
---
There was a duping exploit a few months back that involved renaming items and selling them, or renaming them and trading them.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much it. You can get some stupid-high damage numbers on bloodied primed heavy weapons with faster fire rate, some Psychobuff, bobbleheads, magazines, and so on, and of course the relevant perk cards. Or you could build up around Junkie's and get similar boosts. If you really want to specialize, a Nocturnal weapon at night can be just as good.
---
When you say fast, what do you mean? To me, 5 minutes is an average fight, and last night some chucklehead wiped her out within 30 seconds. The latter is fast to me, and ten minutes would be an unusually long time.
---
I have the blue outfit you can have for free.
---
I'm probably wrong but I seemed to get diseases much more often when I used the plague walker mutation. Any chance you've started using that mutation recently?

Commando

---
Not sure getting behind in this game matters. I'm tickling level 200 and have done so little really, still enjoy just exploring and solo adventure, no nuke, no raid, no backpack, no defend paradise, no fake sheep, BOS glass cavern PA etc and only partly completed main quest, only finished the Watoga one for the All rise level 50.
---
I'm thinking I may go play FO4 for a bit but FO76 is fine for me at the moment. I'm not a completionist obviously.
---
the handmade and the fixer.
---
both are great even without any legendary effects.
---
you can do great with them using singleshot so you can use yr
---
equipped perks.
---
bloodied and junkie are the best, but it reuires some mangement.
---
as you are now, I would suggest anti armor/furious/two shot they would be a good pair to yr lever action. and get a instigating lever action.
---
5 caps? Damn, I do some pretty solid disease cure production and I can't keep them stocked at 20 caps per. Even at 25 they go pretty quick
---
Bloodied unarmed is quite popular.
---
&gt; I spent a further $200 on top of that on customization's that ultimately mean nothing.
---
Sound's like the problem's on your side of the screen.
---
Lol well she is a keeper cause it is not the most interesting game to watch others play

90% of my time is spent walking around defending other peoples workshops and playing with my camp.

Not a forum, on the Xbox One console itself. Go to the Official Club for Fallout 76, and look in in the Multiplayer section, You'll see 100+ posts with people asking for help, wanting to buy/sell/trade things, advertise for their trader that they opened up, what event they are running (Encryptid, Project Paradise, SBQ, etc) and other posts like "SoAndSo is a scammer" and response post from SoAndSo that says "RandomJerk is a scammer, not me".
---
But, I do get what you are saying, random world with randos in it. But, it doesn't have to be that way either. What I've done, personally, is clear the area of the few ghouls and then post that I'm going to start Encryptid in 5 minutes. Then, that gives people time to show up. After a few minutes 5 to 10 people have answered the call and the whole event is over 2 minutes later.
---
Nothing wrong with the standard backpack, I just have not yet gotten around to completed the tasks to obtain it.  That I finished the endgame before completing the tasks to get the larger backpack is circumstantial.  
---
I do have the small backpack.  But I am generally very overencumbered, so spend most of my time in PA (ergo didn't use it often).  
---
Point is, for as much heartache, hate, and discontent the introduction of the listed items caused, I was able to    to "win" (complete the accepted definition of end game of launch a nuke and kill the queen) without all the so called "pay2win" items.  
---
Thus demonstrating you can complete endgame without having those items.  
---
And still have great amounts of fun doing it.
---
ThAts what I meant not melee....the meat hook always confuses me but that‚Äôs the weapon u want. Bloodied swing speed meat hook with plus 1 str.
---
no doubt!
---
Shell shock is awful, I dont even understand how anyone thought it was an interesting idea. I cure that shit the moment I see it, all other diseases don't bother me in comparison.
---
*spoilers*
---
Her journey isn't over.  Supposed to be a cliffhanger thing for wastelanders as the last tape from Vanilla  makes it sound like she may not make it but she is clearly still alive in the trailer for wastelanders.
---
Should have bought Fallout 1st, man. Then they would care a little more.
---
I sell the hats for 300 caps, which are not worth it. Surprisingly, people actually buy them.
---
That sounds terrible, is there anyway this could be escalated as surely there is some legal responsibility for selling you a product and then not supplying after sales service. Small claims court or something, that might kick them up the butt. You paid full price for the game.
---
Yeah a BFSS +1str is good as well.
---
&gt; The new paid stuff really bums me though.
---
Might have to up them a little.
---
I make a point of only putting 10 for sale at anyone point, still only get brought in 5's
---
Sounds fine really, we all need to take a break from things in life every now and then, take care.
---
&gt; What I mean by breakpoints is the point at which  Ballistic/Energy/Radiation resistance is typically past the point of  diminishing returns. 
---
The calculations in FO76 basically work off the ratio of incoming damage and damage resistance. If you look at [the graph](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d3/Fallout4_damage_reduction_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20151117145955) taken from [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance#Damage\_Reduction\_formula](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance#Damage_Reduction_formula) you see that when the resistance hits about double the incoming damage, the mitigation curve starts to flatten out considerably (the mathematical inflection point is even earlier than that). So it would help if we had some hard data about how much hurt top-level mobs are able to throw at the player. Generally speaking, though, somewhere in the 400-500 range seems to be where things flatten out, as others here have already said. (The existence of mobs like high-level ballistic Mr. Gutsies with their apparently high Ignore Armor stats relativizes things a little, but still, that seems to be the general picture.)
---
With the inherent reductions of power armor, that also means that the question of which PA type is best is essentially moot - they all work adequately at their top level except in extreme cases, where you should then spec especially for the incoming damage types (X-01 for RR, T-51 or Ultracite for DR, T-51 or X-01 for ER).
---
Exactly.  And that's why I never understood the P2W claims - because you can W without those  items.
---
You could just play without legendaries. You dont need to wait for the game to tell you what to do!
---
The difference is radscorpions aren‚Äôt too bad to deal with.
---
With a proper build you dont need any legendary effects to be strong. The problem is when people "abuse" legendary effects to use weapons they arent even specd for.
---
Yep just watched that video, even made me think of trying a raid, I'm a solo player and not far from his build and setup.
---
Guaranteed they don‚Äôt. Ask me how I know...
---
I'm PA/melee as well.
---
Why get bummed out?  We both know you don't need it to successfully get to the end.
---
And enjoy yourself while doing it.
---
Not so fast we still gotta bring back the cazadores from New Vegas first.
---
So far gained 32 levels. Only thing making the grind worth it.
---
Oh, that's easy, you have to buy some ~~atoms~~ Reddit Coins from ~~Bethesda~~ Reddit.
---
You could even buy ~~Fallout First~~ Reddit Premium and get some ~~atoms~~ coins every month.
---
https://www.reddit.com/premium?rdt_cid=2760866850412778662
---
Unlimited Scrap build, for the low price of 99.99! 
---
oh and junkies is cool too
---
To be the Aussie accent is much thicker that a Kiwi that seems more delicate sounding. In my limited experience of course.
---
H... how do you k-know?
---
I hope so, I wouldn't mind some of the deserted cities to be repopulated, Morgantown seem ideal. It would be cool for Flatwoods to get NPC settlers and make a good impression on new players.
---
hats are worth 0 caps friendo
---
Ah, Fallout 1st eh? I‚Äôd rather not pay that amount.
---
What kind of Junkie‚Äôs am i looking at? What armor will i be using?
---
You get for playing Fallout 76 on PC, not for playing on PC
---
Maybe they were using berry mentats?
---
Wow, this is amazing... very creative, love the cars outside.
---
Berry Mentats.
---
Because I‚Äôm a Fallout 1st subscriber and they basically told me to kick rocks when I submitted a support ticket.
---
Hello me.
---
Concidering people can broadcast sound to surroundings in game, I think that could change pretty soon...
---
Biv needs more love. Biv should be taken out of that side room and put in the speakeasy serving refreshments especially to NPCS when they arrive
---
Sweet! I have a full set of UnySentAP marine armor. What rifles would i be using? I traded my VanSent set for a bunch of legacies.
---
It compliments vampire.  Vampire regens health during battle.  
---
During the fight, you still may need to stimpack, and depending on the scenario, may not bring you back to 100%.
---
Healing factor mutation regens health back to 100% \_after\_ the fight is over, and much quicker than a stimpack.. Great in WS, for example, it heals you 100% between the houses.
---
I run melee with a 1\* vampire switchblade as my goto.  Has served me well from L65 to now, which is L153.
---
&gt;  I doubt they ever wanted to make it low effort 
---
What they WANTED and what they ACTUALLY DID are two different things. This "game" is in fact a low effort cash grab. They offered a AAA game with "No charge for future updates and no pay to win items, ever" on the Atom shop, yet here we are.
---
Thats pretty much where it ends.
---
It affects all chems, even stimpacks but not sure about Radaway
---
Any proof besides two random numbers? Anyone can make up a story.
---
Odd, your description sounds exactly like what I've done, but I did everything (except end game nukes) by lvl 50.  Just became bored after that and quit.
---
Also, having 1000+ hours in Fo4, I can really appreciate how much better all the mechanics of that game is compared to '76.
---
How do I make antibiotics?
---
*sigh* Nevermind. Think whatever you want.
---
Magic fountain?
---
This right here.
---
Berry Mentats are a hard counter to players that attempt to Hide and not engage in a PvP zone.  If you want to claim a Workshop and prevent other players from using it, then you might have to fight for it.  PvP on PC is actually quite rare, if you want a workshop and do not wish to fight, then you should switch servers when someone contests the space.
---
Hiding in a corner is not viable.
---
To add to roof request: CLEAN RAFTERS. I like the look of the rafters, but next to my wallpaper they look dingy as fuck. :(
---
I'd also like: 
---
* Tables/desks/etc. pre-covered in junk...if you're not going to let us mess it up, at least sell us a table with place settings already on it, a desk with a typewriter, etc.
---
* Better display cases: I was SO EXCITED for display cases and since they came out....I have literally never bothered with one. At least give us an option that's a flat surface with no glass so the weirdly aligned items for my kitchen look like they're out in the open rather than in a museum....ugh -\_- I'd also take wall-shelves that functioned as display cases (imagine all the teddy bears!), but they haven't fixed the one wall-mounted cabinet so I am not gonna get my hopes up.
---
* Sleek wall turrets! They're in the game already....give them to me! Normal turrets are ugly.
---
* CONCRETE WALLS FROM FALLOUT 4. I want the curved bit!!!
---
To second others:  
---
More Rugs, vertical half-walls, stairs snapping to sides of tiles (not just dead center!)...pretty please\~!
---
lol this is one of the users who swallowed the YouTube propaganda about the map76 guy lol
---
How do you not take into account how popular a game will be given its previous successes? They brought ESO and that game has done a lot of beautiful things World of Warcraft, who has been around A LOT longer, failed to do such as scaled leveling. You have to be a complete fucking idiot or just dont give a shit. They're a MAJOR game publishing company so im going for the latter.
---
&gt; This will be deleted soon but it's true.
---
Deleted?  Having problems with paranoia?
---
Or a jetpack. It would take the weight capacity of the backpack down to 0 but allow you to fly.
---
Smart man! 
---
man after 200+ hours I still know jackshit about armor, but the cool part is while bloodied offers "luck" related perks (" is are there since they literally proc all the time but there's always gonna be one unlucky moment you'll get one shotted) to mitigate damage, junkies can actually take some hits! so all that vanguard sentinel etc, ya know, big boy armor armor should be good.
---
I sacrificed CHA and INT a lot as I didn't want to minmax that hard to a point where my STR was -2 or even -3 and my melee dmg was hindered. Really man, I could just pick up any new Junkies weapon I want from shovels to goddamn gatling plasmas and use them with great effect. it was a nice build to run casually but yeah Big Dick Bloodied‚Ñ¢ build is the more pro build I guess
---
Those two numbers mean a lot to the support guys(i still have some hope)
---
I even provided them with the email of the hacker as i got from the email message that my account email was changed. 
---
I did my best. 
---
Now i 'm not asking you to believe me just up vote so hopefully the support guys see my post please.
---
"Health Regen" is a specific buff from food and drink. I'm just wondering if that is the buff that is applied by the Vampire's weapon effect, or if it is a unique effect.
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
With how many bugs are in this game, I'm not giving Bethesda the benefit of the doubt that it's intended. It's probably a bug.
---
They may extend the quest later as more content is added, but I highly doubt they intended to do that. It seems.more like a convenient way to hide a bug. 'Oh yea we left the quest open like that so that we can add onto it later. Definitely. We definitely meant to do that. It's definitely not a bug. We couldn't just extend the quest as more content is released, no, we made it look like a bug but it's definitely not a bug.' That sounds more plausible for Bethesda.
---
BFFR handmade with lvc would be ideal but Be handmade would work too. That or a BFFR or BE Fixer if your lucky enough to find one of those
---
You lost 400 caps? Stop pressing seek revenge, just server hop and be done with it.
---
Just give up man.
---
And all the sweet mods, I kinda miss spending time in the Nexus searching for new mods to try out. I have a few cosmetic mods for FO76 but nothing major.
---
I was a big settlement builder in FO4, loved to surround all the settlements with junk walls and neat defences, and my main camp would be a confection of extravagant tall modern glass and concrete constructions with lifts and spiral staircases and loads of stuff to fill them up and then of course Automatron, I loved Automatron üòÉ
---
yeah and they have an amazing track record of keeping promises
---
How does that song go? Bag, Bag, Bag, Bag, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
---
Don't report it man, you might get in trouble
---
¬£16 game code, bought nothing else and still enjoying the game.
---
I don't mean mean to be rude buddy but he may of just seen you. When u are in pvp there will be a diamond on your head, he may of also had berry mentats which reveals players and frankly are not 100% invisible. you most likely were not the victim of cheating, you were just beaten.
---
Also if you don't wanna loose caps don't hit seek revenge or continue fight the dude if he's too good.
---
On my YouTube I have some meta builds and some of meta but useful, meta will be stealth commando: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
And heavy gunner: https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
People forget about the sulpher spring fountain at ws that cures diseases
---
Absolutely, on YouTube there's jetpack bag videos. It's totally possible, although it would take some coding
---
Not gunna lie my inner 12 year old snickered at the "Adult" bed options but yeah, I'd like to see more beds that aren't kid themed.  I'd also like to see beds in the shop that aren't kid sized.
---
And on the subject of beds how about a pillow pack?  A bunch of different sized pillows you can place like the plushies since some sadist didn't model the fo4 beds with pillows.  I also think a bean bag chair would pair perfect with the pillow pack.
---
I run an anti armor vanguard stealth melee build.  Weapon aa/ swing speed/ str or weight redux.  Armor vanguard/ap regen/better sneak. Build in link, does plenty of damage, and doesn't require me to have health that would kill me from a stubbed toe.

Look at his/her's other comments, I really don't think there is any hate just asking questions.
---
"Look at what's happened to me, I cant believe it myself. Suddenly I'm on top of the world, it should've been somebody else"!!!!!
---
i didn't press seek revenge even once, he simply kept hunting me. He could kill me even without me engaging in PVP because he first killed me using some fully automatic gamma gun, meaning i had barely 15% of my full HP after respawning.
---
&gt;walked all the way round the map, using roads and tracks only?
---
I constantly did this in the mire, from north side to south, never left the road, always skipped Dyer Chemicals as those Gutsies hurt man and always visited that fucking spooky church. It was a cool experience, and it rewards you good - multiple legos are almost always a guarantee. 
---
shame that bethesda is such a shitty company now. Mire is a 10/10 region.
---
&gt; What is it that has kept you playing fo76 despite the general hate?
---
Why should the "general hate" affect what game I play?
---
&gt; Obviously the game has been received very badly,  and even initial supporters have dropped off. 
---
Like I said, so what?  Why should I worry about what others think?
---
&gt; My question is why have you stuck with the game despite all of it's downfalls?
---
ITYM "downsides", and the obvious answer is because, for me, the upsides outweigh the downsides.
---
&gt;  What are the redeeming qualities to the current players?
---
Great map, many fun things to do.  The multiplayer bit adds a new fun element, fighting SBQ or taking part in some event with other players is an interesting new thing in the Fallout world.
---
Yes, I have finished the story, but then I finished the story in FO3 and FO4 too and kept playing them for many hours too.
---
Excellent comment.
---
The weapon depends on the job.
---
I have a rifleman build, and I have an Instigating Hunting Rifle that one-shot just about anything (esp. with sneak damage). It's only a one-star but it does the trick. The rate of fire doesn't matter if you don't need to shoot anymore.
---
But for things that can't be one-shot (the SB Queen), I have a Junkie's Explosive Combat Rifle. and I make sure to go full Demo Expert and Tank Killer. 
---
If you're having problems with damage, and don't want to go for a Bloodied build, I suggest trying out a Junkie's build. Extra damage with only 5 addictions. And depending on the addictions, it's not *that much* of a donwside.
---
And meathook double-dipping if they haven't patched that yet.
---
Even when i was behind walls, or when he was on a roof, he would jump straight down to me even though he didn't have line of sight. i watched his icon saying he was above me when i was under a ceiling outside, then next thing i know he had jumped down and shot me.
---
Not trying to be a dick I just see people making up stories on here constantly. How did someone hack your email is my question? I know it‚Äôs possible but seems far fetched for someone to even try.
---
yes.... and ive, done my homework and the maths. tried and tested.
---
turn on the damage no's and you will find out. even a gauss at 224, without the perforating caps... garbage. with the caps,   much better.
---
Hand made(90 dmg/stinging mag) - lev 22 scorched - av damage = 15/20.
---
perforating mag - dont need damage no's - scorched wasted.
---
found damage from no armour weapons, to have lost as much as 85%.
---
best thing is maybe, go play with them , and see what works for 'you'.
---
Great thanks!
---
Two stimpacks two disease cures , some antiseptic, and I don't recall the other ingredient. Imo they aren't worth crafting. I don't care about diseases in this game. They never effect my performance. Parasites is the only one I will use a cure for , bc food.
---
Fixer is very good with automatic receivers even non legendary version, check this build without single legendary item: https://youtu.be/m1OTKSxeeCw
---
And here if you want to see how stealth commando works with legendary weapons/armour: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
How many atoms did you buy before that?
---
Yeah. I've seen melee players charge in as she is spawning and climbing out of the fissure and just wreck her down to almost dead before the rads take them. The rest of the players clean her up in a matter of seconds.
---
üëã
---
Junkies or bloodied stealth sniper is pretty dope and sorta popular.  I'd argue Junkies is a little more consistent when it comes to health % but bloodied is def a bit better damage-wise.  Unyielding gear with a piece or two chameleon and you're set.  If you do it right you can kill an SB in just a few hits with a lever action rifle and 10 or fewer shots from a handmade.
---
The hacker did you a favor. No point playing this game anyway. It is just a broken cash grab.
---
I have never bought atoms.
---
its okay my bro i understand.
---
i don't know how they got my account password. even tho i don't play this game that often i will NEVER let that hacker enjoy a free fallout 76 account with  legendaries and stuff.
---
I usually have one piece of chameleon and one unyielding,  harder to detect unyielding. With sneak peeks,  food,  chems and alcohol the damage output is amazing. Can easily get numbers near 10k.
---
I‚Äôve definitely been having more freezes this past weekend.
---
I sel the hats for about 50c each.  They usually sell out pretty quickly.
---
The question is why are you still playing when you crash so much? I get that some people fear any kind of change and just stick to what they know, but FO76 is just a scam.
---
&gt; The only shady thing about FO1st is the scrap box because we were told inventory effects server stability.
---
Inventory, or a least non-stacked inventory, *does* affect server stability.  The scrap box is only for stacked inventory.  Yes, there's nothing stopping them giving the scrap box away free, but they need a MSP for FO1st so I can't really blame them.
---
(No, I don't have, or even want, FO1st, I *like* playing with limits, it makes it more fun).
---
It isn't true, at all. Wtf 
---
The whole recycled server thing was a myth
---
I understand, even tho i won't let that hacker get away with a free account.
---
A message pops up before you claim a workshop that warns you that you can get attacked by other players after if you decide to claim.
---
It's a rare chem called Meta. 100% addiction rate and can increase your DPS into the 10s of thousands.
---
I always think about that and imagine it‚Äôs someone you know. Like someone that could answer the security question.
---
That is true, I missed that
---
Good "Live Service" game requires having a good game at its core, as properly developed, Q&amp;A'd and so on, like it was usual normal complete game.  
---
Problem of "live service games" is they often feel like they were pushed out at "Minimum Viable Product" level with attitude "you devs will make rest of stuff along the way". However guess how market used to actually getting rather complete core experiences to getting that type of games. They're not exactly happy.  
---
And devs don't get easy task that way either, they have to bugfix everything they didn't got to fix before release, and they have to also work on expanding game systems, debugging them to proper state, and do everything of this within expected windows of time. In business application, something like that can work if main core functionality works as intended, you can get rest of stuff outfitted along with time, but in video games? That doesn't work, think of just Mass Effect Andromeda facial animations. Facial animations aren't some essential aspect of gameplay functionality, but just look how much reactions that caused. Game at release should be aimed to be a complete product, and live service serve as expansion to that. And needing to fix a TON of stuff is major hindrance from get-go for development of new content for live service purpose.
---
Some of them are easy to ignore, but others like rad worms can be really hard to ignore because you'll take rads like no ones business. The easiest way to get them is to equip Pharma Farma and search every med box you find. You'll get plenty of disease cures and some antibiotics that way as well as getting a bunch of extra stims.
---
Legend says the mothman appears before a disaster. Maybe it showing up is a bad sign for wastelanders.
---
I think I get what you say, you are asking whether the +300% health regen applies to items.
---
The mutation's positive effect which is called "+300% health regen" grants you automatic healing, the negative effect does exactly as stated, and the mutation only activates OUT OF COMBAT.
---
So I am quite sure it does not affect Vampire or the buff is really irrelevant as you enter combat when you shoot, and when you are not fighting the mutation heals you.
---
The same applies for food, you don't need any extra healing when you are out of combat, and during combat the mutation deactivates.
---
Primed or hardened, chicks has lower base dmg what in result defeats the purpose of higher dmg with critical as you can‚Äôt crit every shot. I think there are some exceptions were vicious and hardened offers the same base dmg and in that case vicious is worth it.
---
Of course. You should prepare for a long wait though, since Bethesda are not really quick to respond if you don‚Äôt have a problem with your payment.
---
adding all of these were bethesda's responsibility
---
Ghoul perk. Radworms heal you.
---
You can use high capacity backpack mod to reduce your DR and then use it for stealth build like mistress of mystery: https://youtu.be/m1OTKSxeeCw
---
Sure, but their path started diverging from ours before we were born. I am not even saying that they don't allow immigration, they obviously do, but they are so uber nationalized that those immigrants are going to have to conform to the culture or it isn't going to be good for them at all.
---
We are taking about a society that is so cautious with security concerns that if you don't wear your badge at work a sentry bot might mow you down, because commies. How do you think they would treat a neighbor who flies a foreign flag?
---
I think OP is already playing without Legendaries, he wish he could turn off others‚Äô üëå
---
Maybe that was the case then
---
 Because it‚Äôs got nothing to do with fear of change.. the move to Fo76 from a top500 overwatch player was one of the biggest changes in gaming I‚Äôve made..
---
The fact is I FUCKING LOVE FALLOUT 76.. it‚Äôs has captured me and got me more addicted than both runescape and MW2 did when I was a lil kid.. 
---
I want nothing more than this game to succeed.. I want to play this game daily and show Bethesda ithey have a reason to fix the game.. just unfortunately by no fault of the playerbase.. (which a lot of us feel the exact same way) the game isn‚Äôt being fixed.. and I guess and this point all we can do is talk about it.. if your not interested in what we have to say about the game.. how about you stop nosying the Fo76 subreddit.. instead of telling me to stop playing a game I enjoy more than any other..

"Every once in a while, it would be nice for Formula 1 racers to get their sports cars replaced with 1987 Mercury Sables. I'd love to see those racers slowly struggle to get around the track." -said no one ever
---
I saw a camp that had a scrap-tron placed at the end of a set of stairs, and they would hover in the air like that right off the edge of it's dock,and then drop through the floor and back through the sky to wear they were laying just before every few seconds. When that guy left, his scrap-bot was stuck mid air like this.
---
Went from lvl 10 to lvl 65 on alt
---
* the players, definitely
---
* Also it allows you to do what you want and play the way you want. You can do SBQs back to back but you can also aimlessly wander around exploring and shooting. 
---
* The post apocalyptic setting and the mood. I'm so happy the graphics of Fo76 aren't like Outer Worlds. I like em gray and dark, not bright and popping like a kids cartoon.
---
* My third character still needs lots of stuff so still grinding for that one
---
Sign of a great company.
---
so what you're saying is we have to build a wall to the southern border?
---
I lvl up every 10-15 minutes, if someone want to see my strategy there it is: https://youtu.be/dsnWFaf6A4I, another really good strategy is farming fissure sites introduced by Innov survivalist
---
Fo76 was designed as a mobile game with a $60 price tag. It was, is and will forever be a scam. It is not a matter for debate. It is a simple fact.
---
Heard mentality too
---
As others have said - sounds like he was using berry mentats tbh. They light you up like no other and there‚Äôs no counter to my knowledge
---
Isn‚Äôt it just... pointless to comment this? Lulz
---
Your at a workshop. That alone is engaging in pvp.
---
So, the fixer is better, IF i can get one? I‚Äôd probably go for the BFFR and LVC Fixer. I have some very amazing trades.
---
Wow, sweet! Thank you.
---
This actually really cool
---
Maybe
---
With class freak 3 the chem debuff is pretty minimal.
---
Nice, thank you for all the advice buddy!
---
Well your information was leaked through the launcher again like two days ago so...have at it.
---
How many times has that happened now? Buy Fallout 1st, it's only $100.
---
Sure you have the tickets, but you could just as easily be the hacker trying to fully secure some poor player's account. Not saying you are, but Bethesda support might think that. Either way we hope it gets resolved.
---
He was circling over new players, preying on their atoms.
---
I run a Bloodied faster fire rate 50cal, bloodied faster fire rate handmade and the unstoppable monster across my 3 main characters. Chems, bobble heads and food buff can make a big difference. Sneak attacks for rifles and melee will also make a big difference if you perk and gear right.
---
You can build higher level weapons
---
We all wanted Fo76 to succeed. We even convinced ourselves it is a good game and we had hope for the future. All that vanished the second they released a pay to win monthly subscription.
---
You also made a good point about how addictive the game is. It was designed to be addictive. Not good, just addictive. It makes you log in every day for that quick fix. If you don‚Äôt log in, you are missing all those ‚Äúfree‚Äù atoms...Just like in any other mobile game.
---
Actually no, just spreading the news so players can check it out before it's patched.
---
No, I'm highlighting a flaw in the game.
---
I‚Äôve heard chameleon isn‚Äôt necessary anymore with a full set of Uny. Your Agility will be so high you won‚Äôt get detected in sneak mode. What kind of Lever Action and Handmade would i use? What Major and Minor Legendary?
---
I get you . this why i provided the email messages in my tickets.
---
Every email message regarding my account is there (as a screenshot)
---
Even the message that says i pre ordered fallout 76 and this the order number. EVERYTHING.
---
even my visa number is in tickets.
---
At Whitesprings, there's a gazebo with marble pillars right near to the golf club. There's a fountain there which will cure any disease when you drink from it. It's great during nukes at Whitesprings as you get rad-worms every ten seconds from glowing ones.
---
Sweet! Thank you.
---
1 level.
---
And make the Scorched pay for it!
---
I have that meathook! Awesome.
---
The Race Car bed is the most adult thing I own, no clue what you're speaking about.
---
*Crab rave*
---
They are still a thing because Bethesda are lazy and greedy. The only thing that worked in this game was the cash shop. Everything else is either broken or unfinished.
---
This week is the first mission, it‚Äôs definitely worth learning on novice, you can even do it solo on standard here‚Äôs the guide: https://youtu.be/OxW92-9Z6tA
---
Easiest way to find a group is discord (in my opinion)
---
Its not hate but rather complaints about the gameplay
---
Tomorrow (Tuesday the 19th) it changes to Meltdown so be aware.
---
Is there a thing called horizontal falling?
---
Currently you cannot upgrade the level of any item.
---
You can only farm a higher level item or make a new one with higher level.
---
Not...us....
---
I use vampire weapons and have the healing factor mutation.
---
Oh, that - now I think I understand your question.  
---
That I can tell, Healing factor does not affect that drop in health due to radiation, starvation, or dehydration, and does prevent it, and does not regen it.  Neither does a vampire weapon.   
---
Both will only regen health up to the whereever the red line is.  
---
Vampire weapons do so slowly during combat.  
---
That said, if you have healing factor and are not in active combat, as soon as you eat/drink, or pop a radaway, healing factor will increase your health immediately, at the same rate the food consumption decreases the red line..
---
That is what I figured out. Thanks +karma
---
Sentry bot got some mowing 2 do lol you make a fair point no flags 4 us then üòü
---
The southwest corner of the map was broken for me. I followed the southern bank of the river going in and out of the "water" until I was under the map. It was odd.
---
That seems pretty roundabout. I just trade them one by one to my brother and it works everytime for him.
---
They spawn out the air already dead and ragdoll on you.
---
Chances are part of Wastelander is supposed to be accessed through the southern border and they accidentally opened it up despite the expansion was delayed.
---
So it made me so visible i could be caught even when there was a small roof blocking line of sight? i guess i should be stocking up on berry mentats
---
I trade them to my brother all the time. I just wait at the turn in spot and give them to him via trades one at a time. It's always worked for us.
---
No loot, cause I already killed them and their bodies were just ragdolling whilst following me.
---
"empty" the corpse and it should no longer follow
---
Yes, technically... If you got kicked up the backside off a cliff, for 2 or 3 seconds you would be falling at a horizontal angle
---
The bug in which Scorchbeast you've already killed will just ragdoll out of nowhere near you.
---
Yes, that bug.
---
I found it funny at first but I'm starting to get annoyed it isn't patched already.
---
The fact that they're already dead and will spawn out the air and flop near you.
---
Also gliders and seagulls fall horizontally
---
This isn't that feature.
---
They spawn out the air and will ragdoll near you already dead.
---
The diseases are not an issue, why bother?
---
I'll do that next time, but I shouldn't have to do that.
---
Thanks.
---
It must be from somewhere else, as I have the bundle but not the handmade paint.
---
just go through the raid, you‚Äôll get a shit ton
---
I can see displaying everything but the covert ops and tumblers today.  They just look so booooooring.
---
I will admit however I was heartbroken you can't display chainsaws (which shockingly no one else is upset about) so I feel your pain.  Have an updoot my dude.
---
So it's considered a "horizontal falling" when something is not falling in a straight vertical fashion?
---
100% of them are empty for me. Everytime.
---
Personally, I like the company.
---
Personally, it pulls me out of immersion.
---
You really should care considering its unneeded as items can be stacked with no detriment to server stability. They are making money off of a free feature of almost every other game in existence.
---
There we're 2 Raider bundles, this was in the first.
---
I'll bet that's where all the Psycho and Daddy-o is coming from.
---
I always loot the scorchbeast when I can. Empties follow me around. Sometimes I can't loot one (it's lost, dies off the map, etc.), but when it magically drops a few minutes later it has stuff in it. So that's a positive.
---
I actually like the bug as sometime the Scorchbeasts' corpse are flang so far way, and sometime they even fly away and die elsewhere.
---
But yea all bug should be fixed altogether.
---
I‚Äôm very particular about my camp. I think I have it just the way I want now. But I do wish I could build a second just to experiment.
---
I have an unfinished stealth commando character that I stopped using around level 40, but only because it was getting insane trying to keep up with the ammo demands. But I do remember it did some crazy damage while stealthing.
---
Absolutely, depending on nearest degree angles. A Stooker dives vertically, and glider's glide horizontally. A horizontal fall relies on a momentum, uplift, and gravitational balance
---
So, would these people always be using a build like Bloodied (the "meta") or can you create a build that just focuses on the perk cards?
---
Hence why there are people calling it Pay2win. Because what you gain seriously enhances all the aspects of the game that you would consider "winning". You get all your resources faster, much much less traveling for objectives between dumping your inventory, faster access to objectives for your friends, etc etc. 
---
People are so stuck on the idea that P2W means literally just combat gear, but that is only in games where the only aspect of winning is combat. And Fallout is most certainly more than just combat.
---
This would be neat!
---
Really but Ive tested it with a previous mate and it didnt work.  Im on ps4 so not sure if youre pc and its tough love for us consoke users or if its just my shit luck at it again.  Cue fist to air cure you!!!
---
Been doing it 4xs a game play every day 2 months and i sti dont have all the plans or the last outift the bos jumpsuit.  I have 4 pa paint plans need the other 4.  So very frustrating.
---
People need to stop calling them private servers, they aren't your own personal private server if they get recycled after 5 minutes.
---
We play on x box. I dunno why it doesn't work for some. It's hard to tell with the game honestly. 
---
I just know me and my brother have done this for a long time, and even recently. I don't have the quest, he does, I normally give him the ones I find and they always work for him. Maybe that influences it?
---
Showing an exploit is not the same as showing yourself using a 3rd party program to cheat.
---
Please, report the exploit.
---
Added since when? If you're a returning player spend some time reading through the [patch notes](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches).
---
Lol stims are a total pain in the ass for me I'm picky to have 5 nevermind enough to make them even then diseases help with my mutation so
---
Ooh I'll check it out
---
Flying away on a wing and a prayer, who could it be....
---
It also requires the (fully ranked?) Pharmacist Perk.
---
You need to have the plan and  be the appropriate level.  
---
Some weapons (or mods) will also require you have a particular level perk in order to craft them.  (Perks are not required to attach a mod you found, looted, or bought.)
---
At the weapons crafting station, select the type of weapon you want to make, then hit X (on PS4, anyway).
---
Once you do that, you can then select the level for the weapon you are crafting.  
---
You can only craft up to your level, and not all weapons or armor go to Level 50 - (some max out at 45).
---
The same process applies for armor.
---
It's useless. Should be 200% more damage for all the negatives you have to deal with, you basicly can't use any armor at all. So kiss all legendary armor or power armour buffs goodbye.
---
Currently I use a Junkies LA and Junkies Handmade, both explosive.   As far as the armor set goes, having one or two chameleon pieces def seems to have some effect.  With the rest being uny, you already have so much of the per/agi/luck you need to make the build work that I just err on the side of caution and role extra stealthy bits.  It might come down to how you play the character so it could just be preference at that point.  
---
You could swap bloodied for junkies in both weapons, I go back and forth on it.
---
Here's my perk/mut loadout:

---
Probably a bloodied build. But they are right for an obtainable one start weapon Instigating levers are my weapon of choice. I am not sure if I have any ATM but I can check are you on Xbox?
---
Make this the new most downvoted post on reddit!!
---
Added you
---
I think rifle gaming did this on YouTube, but he‚Äôs clickbaity so I may be wrong
---
Interesting... I wasn't aware that they were **that** noticeable to other players. But either way, cool :D
---
We need guilds like they have in WOW.
---
^This 
---
Now that clickbait scumbags spread around the story that Bethesda supposedly bans you if you try reporting any kind of bug (instead of, y'know, explaining the story in-depth), everybody's turned into a bunch of paranoid fucks who refuse to report stuff like this in fear of getting banned.
---
That could be part of this thing I‚Äôm trying to get, say something like merchant guilds,or the such
---
Could I have 2 mole rat McNuggets and a large mutfruit smoothie
---
This is why the ONLY bed I use is "Simple Modern Bed"...otherwise they don't really look like beds. :(
---
I would take a pillow pack, but more for floor-seating pillows and throw pillows for the very bare couches!
---
Far worst than clickbait,he said that West Virginia was on the west coast
---
Yeah more art options already in-game would be wonderful &lt;3
---
31 in Nw (trying for 32 in next 13 minutes)
---
100% of my west tek runs started with a suicider running at me
---
All of the borders are gone (for some players, sometimes). A couple of friends and I tried to figure out what the cause was to report it as a bug to Bethesda, but it was inconsistent. A solid boundary existed for some players in some worlds, but vanished in other worlds for the same players. I thought it was due to my private world at first, but another friend repeated it in Adventure later. He does not have Fallout 1st. Without being able to contribute something solid for a bug report, I've stopped exploring.
---
That's why I wanted them to be able to be placed like the plushies so you could use them in the floor or on beds or on couches or chairs etc.  An Asian or Middle eastern themed camp with floor pillows peaks my interest =)
---
Maybe try calling their support number until you get in contact with an actual customer support member. Sad to say but even if you do get your account back, anything good you had will probably be gone or sold off.
---
Omg how üòÇ
---
The question is why are Bethesda not doing anything about it? I am not sure they are even acknowledging the issue.
---
I‚Äôve never played wow shh
---
I started cooking a lot of Razorgrain Soup and hotkeying it so i always am Well Fed and Well Hydrated. That will give 50% disease resist. Razorgrain Soup gives 5% DS. Only use Antibiotics when i do catch something as they give 50% DS. Between all of these i have lowered my disease chance drastically. Another thing to keep in mind Diluted Radaway will increase Disease Chance for an hour but a Regular Radaway will only do it for 15 minutes.

"When the Queen sends her Scorched, she's not sending her best. She's not sending survivors. She's sending afflicted that have lots of problems, and they‚Äôre bringing those problems with them. They‚Äôre bringing pipe weapons. They‚Äôre bringing rad damage. They‚Äôre plagued. And some, I assume, are good people.‚Äù
---
Unfounded... It's a known glitch that can be replicated easily
---
That's why I said this bit:
---
&gt;(though I guess there's a spawn point for Yao Ghouls like the Suicider?)
---
Cuz outside of West-Tek, good luck ever finding a Suicider. I've only ever saw it away from West-Tek *ONCE* and that was in a battle between them and the Whitespring bots (in which it immediately blew up)
---
You are welcome. If you need some, I can give you like 20. just bring me 40mm grenades to balance my build.
---
What‚Äôs the flaw? Everything in every game is pointless, cause it‚Äôs a game :)
---
Real useful input.
---
Is it just fire rate that tops the Gauss rifle for this choice? I'm running an instigating gauss and seem to be doing alright with it.
---
The forest is easy farm for mats. I usually had about 80 made each time. If I farmed stimpacks I also usually get antibiotics aswell with Pharma pharma or wte its called
---
My bad then üòê I was sure it‚Äôs affecting all resistance üòê
---
Prob not, two seperate transactions. Sorry bud.
---
I was out getting pissed up for my birthday all weekend. Do it again so I can join in üòÅ
---
I hear you on rotating things and leaning objects.  I like to make rounded walls and integrate my buildings into the already existing world.  This would be ten times easier if I could lean objects or rotate them slightly to help cover gaps better etc.
---
lol, bugs seem to get bigger instead of smaller
---
I'll defer to the other commentators her on your primary, but as a fellow rifleman i feel your pain on selecting a secondary. There's not a lot of good combo's with all your points generally stacked in Perception. I assume here you're carrying the heavy gun 50 cal, rather than the rifle?
---
If so try and find a decent Handmade \[AA for example\] and keep it in single shot, you'll have a good back up gun with a decent magazine size and rate of fire and still have all the advantages of your perception perks like rifleman etc
---
Would love to see a buff to Deathclaws in general, they are not intimidating in the slightest.
---
Nearly everything on imgur gets downvoted right away tbh, they are just unnecessarily angry over there
---
Thanks everyone for the feedback!
---
Better than yours. Stop victim blaming.
---
One handed is really under powered especially if you dont max the cards and run bloodied. You might be more successful running unarmed weapons (gaunlets/meathooks). You get more damage and they take 6 less perks to max out.
---
Fist weapons also benefit from the "brawling" armor mod.
---
I figured, oh well. Just not sure it‚Äôs worth refunding since I paid for the sub, but then again that‚Äôs $50-$60 or whatever I paid for it that I‚Äôd get back...
---
Large glass window walls and hanging plants too
---
THIS, this is why i love this games, random events are awesome and how the map and creatures interact with what you are doing.
---
There should be perk cards and more mutations that make berserker weapons more viable. Even a berserker perk on armor keeping it‚Äôs dr from affecting weapon damage would be good as far as benefiting from other armor perks without making it op. As it stands now it‚Äôs only viable, imo, solo exploring outside of events and group activities.
---
Treasure maps aren't a bad way to get PA plans but it takes a lot of maps.
---
All of the damage metas have some bloodied synergy. Every single build *could* get more damage from running adrenal reaction, so for it to be truly Meta min-maxing you *have* to take it. No combination of perks or gear gives you more damage without adrenal reaction than with. You could use a Junkies weapon to get your damage bonus on the weapon instead, but if you're already squeezing that last bit of damage out of AR, you may as well run a bloody weapon and not suffer from withdrawals.
---
Went from lvl 66 to lvl 78 Saturday after a couple hours, didn't really get on Sunday.
---
New Vegas monster mod had them and I deleted it because of that
---
The Gauss isn‚Äôt nearly as good as the Lever.  The only way to get good damage with the Gauss is by charging it on each attack, and that‚Äôs just a slow mechanic.  I‚Äôve tried to warm up to the Gauss, even trading some good stuff to get a legacy BE90 Gauss, and it honestly just sucks. I‚Äôd rather use many other guns over the Gauss. 
---
With the BE Gauss I‚Äôm looking at around 400 damage on a normal head shot. With a BE Lever, I am looking at 2,000+ damage.  The Gauss can hit that 2K number with charging, but it just isn‚Äôt practical to do that in a firefight.
---
Yeah, that would be fun! I'd love to go parasailing off the monorail elevator.  No good reason for it- as others have said, there are perks and legendaries to cover fall damage.  But it would be cool anyway, especially if it gave some degree of forward gliding thrust.
---
Leveled up my strength character (got a really nice meat hook and I want to use it) went from 0-25 in like an hour or two
---
You win.
---
To be fair Bethesda isn't doing themselves any favors with all their security flaws like holy crap before you could literally copy the URL when your logged in and paste it on another computer and would auto login you in, JuiceHead did a video on it and hes actually a trustworthy source.
---
He supplied his original purchase info with card number etc, so this is not the case, this time.
---
I deleted FO76 off my. PS4 last night. This makes me feel better about my decision
---
I‚Äôve got both, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd agree.  Commando can do more damage on a long fight, but the Rifleman has more damage on the first shot (1-shotting 99% of mobs), and is brutally efficient.  If I want to play a character that does insane damage (by wasting ammo), I get on my heavy build with hit Gatling Plasma.  The Commando is kind of in the middle between the Rifleman and Heavy.  
---
Commando is definitely good, and depending on your goals might be your favorite build.  To me, I‚Äôd rather play my brutally efficient and stealthy Rifleman, or get on my ammo wasting Heavy that goo-ifies everything in a blaze of glory.
---
Money‚Äôs super tight at the moment so it would be nice get some back. Also, I may have played the game but that doesn‚Äôt matter - Bethesda didn‚Äôt deliver what was promised and they lied to Australians about what their rights are. That‚Äôs why the ACCC forced them to start allowing refunds under certain conditions.
---
Fallout 76 in a nutshell.  Laugh at the bugs when you can.  
---
Bethesda: "Dead robots in the sky?  Sure, we can do that.  Even our developers died in the apocalypse."
---
There was a game a long time ago called Shadowbane. In that game guilds could make fortresses with towns inside them on any part of the open game map(a certain ways away from NPC cities I think was the rule). And in that area they had the ability to open to the public or deny entry and kill invaders(game was open pvp outside of NPC towns). It was pretty awesome and guilds could raid each other as well, it would be cool to have that type of setup in this game.
---
Bethesda should sell **VIP customer support** for a subscription.
---
You used the Bethesda account recovery link to do this? I mean, I wouldn't have waited two months to check in on this, I'd probably be checking daily for any change, and I'd be knowledgeable about what Bethesdas SLA is (if there actually is one) and when to expect a response. Two months would be..well excessive for any company to respond. And if they had been sending emails to the address you specified and werent getting responses, theres a high probability they closed the ticket for lack of response.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
After submitting your ticket and receiving your ticket #, did you at any point in time receive an email confirmation to the address you specified for them to contact you on? Perhaps a few minutes after submission as an acknowledgement of the submission from Bethesda? Are you certain you provided the correct address for them to contact you on, because there are two email fields, one for the account and one you want them to contact you on.
---
I really like Furious for the SBQ, and having Vampires or AA is great too.  A fixer, combat rifle, or Handmade would be the weapon type to target. Assault Rifles need a big buff.
---
1) the ruling says you needed to have requested a refund prior to July (I forget the exact date but the point is you needed to request before the ruling)
---
2) you don‚Äôt have a right to request a refund just because you want more money
---
Ended up leveling a new character to lvl 25, and leveled up in NW twice so I could get mk.1 version of the power armor skin 
---
Kinda productive
---
&gt;anything good you had will probably be gone or sold off
---
and support will be unable to check logs and replace because... reasons.
---
Are you new to the internet? There are huge email password dumps posted online from security breaches. Most people use the same email and password for every service, one leak, and your email and password for all services are released online. Anyone who has used the internet more than 5 years has had this happen to them, whether they know it or not.
---
There is a list of 150 or so recently picked up junk items. They will not respawn until you pick up enough things to boot what you want off of the list. Everyone gets their own instance of overworld junk items.
---
The rules for ore veins, costumes, and plans may work different though. I know personally that ore veins will spawn in already mined if you login next to one. My camp is next to a lot of steel and lead veins. I have to log at vault 76 or else I cannit mine them.
---
Thought I'd share my build.  I run Junkies so I \*only\* do about 2500 avg from my LA, but it's more useful than instigating in that you can use it on SBs if you're feeling froggy.  With adrenaline reaction and the adrenaline perk you can down one in just a few hits.  Running uny armor and a piece or two chameleon.  
---
I just shared this build elsewhere.  Hope it helps.
---
I use both but most but the .exe is there a risk to this then? 
---
I started doing this because the launcher threw a fit so I have my details saved in the Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
Kinda of hard to program into the game like this, but I would absolutely love this but based on the fact you can get leg armor to reduce fall damage they won't be working on adding this any time soon.
---
Saw one of these last night funnily enough, was doing Rose's quests on my rifleman alt, the one that has the karma syringer. Had to use it on a Yao Guai near Silo Alpha and it turned out to be a ghoul one I when I got there.
---
Only the second time I've seen one since the beta days.
---
Have any evidence of that? It might not be the first person to cry wolf, but it would be the 1,000th person to complain that community support is ignoring them.
---
I check everyday and no there was no response, not even a msg saying THEY ARE WORKING ON IT . 
---
This what frustrates me the most. The fact that i don‚Äôt even know if they are working on it or not or if they need more evidence or not i don‚Äôt know because i never received anything from them.And despite all of that they deleted my ticket.
---
did they send you some email?
---
because sometimes supports act like ok i send you an email so "this case is close bye"
---
I found 2 scorchbeasts just east of the whitespring train station the other day. Gave them both a few shots and then ran over to whitespring. Barely had to do anything, the robots finished them off. 
---
Tbf they were like lvl 50 &amp; 80 so it wasnt that impressive but I felt proud of myself
---
Would they need physical access to the persons machine?
---
Remember the Bethesda promise, if its not fixed in the first year the bugs been around it becomes a feature.
---
Fast travel a lot from indoor cells to outdoor cells seems to trigger it pretty consistently for me. I've been playing around with jetpacks past the point where you start to fall through the world.
---
Never. Last thing i heard from them is that my account email and secret questions got changed.
---
The Gangbangers. 
---
The Bukkakers.
---
Earth, Wind and Raiders.

Approved by current president of the enclave right after the current president gets done raising the threat level to activate nuclear silos.
---
Licensing works differently on software in America.

No. It's apparently a security issue with the server showing it as data for all players in that server.
---
I only used the launcher.
---
My housemate had 49/50 (or however many there are) achievements on Xbox, his last one was to get to level 100, he didn't get the achievement despite being level 100+.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought and this particular reason is why I‚Äôll never get one. I don‚Äôt need food in my stash unless it‚Äôs to sell to people
---
No.  That is not possible.  Who made that asinine claim?
---
Remember in the description of fallout 1st they released??? It said the same thing. ‚ÄúYou deserve it‚Äù Lol
---
Cool:)  From what I recall, Morgantown has fair number of enemies to give her a good taste of the zone without being overwhelming like WS can be.
---
  My decision tree was I had already done SBQ a couple times, I'm overencumbered and can't fast travel, and I wanted lots of violet flux.  Where's a short walk from a silo that also has lots of violet?  Dropped on Toxic Valley.  
---
 Sure enough, only took a couple of minutes to get there from the silo exit.
---
Didn't really care about enemies, but surprisingly, along with the things you normally find, there were a couple of annoyed assaultrons, agitated mireluck kings...plus 2 yogis, and a radscorpion.  
---
Nice change of pace from a constant stream bloated glowing ones.
---
And I picked up 120 or so violet and enough mats to make it stable. 
---
Mission accomplished :)

---
Yes people clicking links to exploits and hacks are then robbed of their credentials. this is pretty common.  Not just for bethesda btw.
---
I try to be nice when posting this, but Two-shot sucks,  I know that upsets some folks with their TSE weapons, but it‚Äôs the truth.  The on,y thing good about TS is that people overpay for it when I sell it.  
---
Armor piercing is also not super important with a Rifleman build if you are running Tank Killer 3.  The Lever action dominates this game despite not offering additional armor piercing because of this.
---
I definitely want to have a melee character to avoid ammo problems.  
---
Between these options, which one can I do the most damage:
---
**1hand +30%**  |  Gladiator 1 (+10%) / Expert Gladiator 1 (+10%) / Master Gladiator 1 (+10%)
---
**2hand +30%**  |  Slugger 1 (+10%) / Expert Slugger 1 (+10%) / Master Slugger 1 (+10%)
---
**Unarmed +20%**  |  Iron Fist 3 (+20%)

Gained a few levels but wasted another 1000 scrips on nocturnal bashers ü§Æ

Happy birthday fellow SeventySixer!
---
I end each session with 1000 scrip and carry around 100 Berry Mentats. As soon as the next purveyor sale or 2XP weekend rolls around, I'll be ready!
---
Ah! OK that kind of makes this a non issue then, if you can't trust your friends and family you have bigger problems to deal with.
---
Yep. Saw a Sheepsquasch and Deathclaw fighting and Super Mutants were shooting at them. The Deathclaw died first, then the super mutants, and then the Sheepsquach. And your damn right that I sniped everything until it was just me and the Sheepsquach.
---
I‚Äôve been around there a few times and there is always some kind of brawl there. There is usually a bus nearby that has some power armor in it though.
---
You requested before June 1, 2019? Why did you buy a subscription if you already requested a refund for the game in June? Seems to be in bad faith honestly.
---
If they really want people to play they need to tackle cheaters and do something so you don't end up playing against the same level 200 peeps over and over.
---
Fingers crossed for hard freeze on eating or drinking being finally fixed.
---
I honestly don't mind this bug and find it quite funny. :)
---
I leveled a new character to 70 and finally tried a pistol build. Told myself I wasn't gonna go do a low health build on this one but found a bloodied lvl 20 western revolver early on and couldn't not use it.
---
I'm irrationally happy about having the old intro back.
---
But yes, they've been pretty mum on what this is about.  Historically, they haven't released numbered patches without a long list of things, or teasing them weeks in advance.  I don't know if that implies this is a tiny update, or if there's simply a lack of time for writing the weekly newsletters.  The last few Inside the Vaults have been very short, to say the least, and they seem to struggle even getting the Tuesday Atomic Shop posts out now.
---
It was smart üòÇ
---
They got cocky. Got too comfortable, Fallout 4 was good too. I'm not sure I'll be buying TES6.
---
My apologies!  It's UltraciteMan!
---
Took a new toon out of the vault and on to level 50.
---
those will come in 2020
---
Went from 17 to 31. Not great, not terrible. But I did get Starched Genes and can use Healing Factor and Marsupial now! I‚Äôm a kangaroo!
---
Yes, either inserting the disc or going into the library will reinstall the game. The game save data will be there too, unless they went and deleted that too.
---
I think it‚Äôs 150 containers and almost 300 loose items, anyway if you have scrap box just loot totally everything and stuff will be keep respawning. This system is in place to give us the reason to move around and not just keep looting one location.
---
It‚Äôs not. But is this story really that hard to believe? After all the bullshit Bethesda has put its customers through for over a year now with this game? The list of customer service being entirely ignored or not helped whatsoever goes on and on with this company. They don‚Äôt care about us at all. They just care about what‚Äôs in our wallets
---
It‚Äôs honestly quite useless... it only keeps 12 items and it‚Äôs only single stacks so it‚Äôs quite underwhelming for the cost. That‚Äôs why I spent it on the robot, yes I know it‚Äôs kind of useless, but I just have my unlocked and people can take the stuff from it if they want, I don‚Äôt care. I know it‚Äôs a worse junk extractor, but it gives me freedom on low level alts to not sit on an extractor.
---
Wrong game
---
One would hope all that effort missing here and there is put to Wastelanders.
---
Undoubtedly unarmed as the base damage is higher.
---
Damage resist while aiming. It wouldn't hurt feelings to have the plasma grenade plan and robot armor plans a bit more obtainable.
---
What about the damage? feeling good?  
---
Thinking in remove just the rifle perks and adapt to mine.
---
Oh shit.
---
Idk I‚Äôve had a few problems and had them resolved rather quickly by support. I guess it isn‚Äôt hard to believe either way.
---
Did they say 2020 or just assuming since things get delayed with them? One would hope they would give us a little something since Wastelanders is delayed
---
they did say 2020, it sucks, but I rather get it right instead of launching it completely buggy like most of the content
---
Thanks! it helped me a lot.
---
I hope that‚Äôs the case I really do. But I think we can all agree that fallout 76 has basically shredded Bethesda‚Äôs reputation entirely. Some people I know think they‚Äôre just as bad as EA now.
---
" They *don't* work like that, right? "  
---
I suppose that depends - when he fired it, did *you* help him? :D :D  
---
If you did help him - how well did that flare firing work out for him do you think :P
---
There's always one in the barn/shack by Charleston station - i'll have to give one a go
---
Mine just seem to show up in my stash.  Seems to take a couple days though.
---
How do you get the fridge?
---
Atom shop only buyable convenience for the win
---
But you kept coming back into the workshop, 8 times, right? Well at least you learned something.  
---
PS: You are also not really invisible even in chameleon; you will be always tagged on compass and on high-res display quite visible through all that shimmering.
---
It is not hard to believe, there is just no reason to think they are. Bethesda's community support is notoriously horrible, anyone who has submitted a ticket can attest to that, including myself. These people reporting things like this have nothing to gain by sharing their stories. The fact your mind even goes to a place to think they might be lying shows you have some kind of twisted fanboy attitude toward Bethesda. There is no evidence, what so ever, to think this person might be lying or to even suspect them of lying. So why do you even mention it?
---
I remember using them when I was in a fricky situation and other players were rushing to help me. And I would do the same If I saw a flare in the sky. But since it was mutual understanding, you didn't lie, because you have no idea If it's still happening or not.
---
Gosh you build a lot. You should build near the bolton greens.
---
Well, they hotfixed it but people who were using .exe was exposing their password to hackers. Don‚Äôt really know the technical aspect.
---
Did you install mods?
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve called women you don‚Äôt like..fat pigs, slobs..‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúOnly Tabitha from New Vegas.‚Äù
---
*mic drop*
---
I don't think they specifically said 2020 but they haven't said anything since Quakecon. At least as far as I know
---
Never. I didnt even know you can install mods to a multiplayer game ? Thats some poor anti-cheat protection .
---
I have 2 completely different character builds that are capable of Soloing the SBQ in under 5 minutes, it's all about Stacking perks, mutations, Foods, &amp; Chems to maximize your Damage with a particular weapon.
---
* Full Health, Level 350+ Stealth Build using a Primed AA FFR 50 Cal, hits the SBQ at up to 579 per round when Adrenaline is maxed, and getting Stealth bonus 75% of the time.
---
* Bloodied Stealth Build, level 175+ Using a BFFR FR LMG, hits at 292 per round, with brief periods of 600+ with Stealth, fires 75 rounds in \~2 seconds which equates to around 10K per second.
---
Both of my characters use level 2 Heavy Gunner perks, and level 3 "Stabilized" during SBQ battles along with other perks which are used always, similar results can easily be achieved with other weapons when perks and other Buffs are properly aligned.
---
My first suspicion would be that you entered your cc# and other information on a phishing site. Have you checked your account activity for suspicious purchases?
---
Thank you!!!!
---
^(I'm just hoping for mosaic floors.)
---
Robot Armor plans are rare?
---
I did. There were none.
---
When i plan to buy something I transfer money to my visa and then buy with it. So its mostly empty.
---
Because I didn‚Äôt think the refund would happen so I wanted to get what I could out of the game, and I can be impulsive. Mostly I bought the sub because I was sick of the laggy ass servers and I was desperate for a smooth experience.
---
The funny thing is the private servers aren‚Äôt much better anymore. Rubber banding and such.
---
65ish to 94 on main character.
---
Rolled a mule 1-47 on a second account.
---
I guess I was busy xD
---
I must say its a nice thing to have, I was able to build a new PA/Heavy weapons character in just a day, which plays totally different than my main sniper build. Fun times!
---
It also doubles as a buffer/perk sharer for any future alts I may roll, good stuff all around.
---
I'm hoping that with wastelanders, maybe they will have a use, like summon an NPC or two to help like it used to with the Minutemen.
---
There is no evidence the other way either the dude just posted two random numbers. It‚Äôs cool that instead of using facts you just attack me lol like no matter what someone says they are a fanboy.
---
Ya, you can only find them in the wild. None of the vendors sell them to my knowledge
---
Yea well, it is. Are you on discord or recieved any pics or files from someone you play with? Are your mail hacked? I‚Äôm asking because keyloggers or trojans are a easy hack tool. Last one ofc is if you used any cheats? But I bet the answer there will be a no anyway ^^
---
Dispute any charges from Bethesda immediately. Just tell your bank that the company sold you a product that is not as promised. Money makes management actually care about business practice.
---
I would like to see if someone on my team has a disease so my support character would know when to use disease cures to help out. Among other support related additions and changes to make him more useful.
---
I run 1H melee - not bloodied.   I'm almost always overencumbered, so I run in PA most of the time.
---
Been using a 1\* vampire switchblade as a primary weapon since L65 (I'm 153 now), and I usually change to an AA LMG or troubleshooters gatling for things that fly.  
---
I know from experience you /can/ take out an SB with a switchblade.
---
That said:
---
Melee needs high strength (so do heavy weapons, BTW): Strength perks should max out Gladiator, Incisor, and Martial Artist.
---
You'll benefit from Glowsight and Fireproof.
---
Actiongirl/boy for faster AP regen (benefits for power attacks)
---
For the heavy weapons: Stabilized3.
---
I used bloody mess3 early, but only running 3 luck. When I mutated (Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speed Demon, Adrenal Reaction), I swapped bloody mess for starched genes2 and class freak1.
---
Out of PA, I liked the deathclaw gauntlet and have deep pocketed weight reducing armor.  I'm actually lighter out of PA than in it, but still have an average load about 1000# .
---
I went from 114 to 123 and I wasnt really trying
---
No, I am not talking about clicking links for exploits or hacks. I am talking about, if you click a specific thing on the Bethesda launcher (I wont say what for obvious reasons), while on a network I am on, I will be able to log into your account. That is not pretty common at all, it is a huge security flaw. The plain text passwords in memory pale in comparison because that one was only a problem is you installed something nefarious on your computer. The new one is a problem despite what you do because anyone with access to your network or url requests can now log in to your account if you ever click that link from the launcher.
---
As I understand it, there's an exploit in the wild right now concerning the LMG and a specific Legendary effect that doesn't work correctly.  I don't know the specifics, but it plays out like an unbounded Furious effect, where the Queen will take more and more damage until she's dead in about 5-10 seconds.  There is a distinct ramp up to this damage.  This started happening around Patch 14.  As a Bloodied Unarmed, I never thought I'd be the one racing to deal enough damage before she kicks the bucket. üòÇ
---
People say theres a fountain in whitesprings that cures diseases, i've yet to find it
---
Skyrim on the PS3, to my knowledge, still has a massive memory leak that will hardcrash the console if you play for too long.
---
Also the mods on console cannot fix these kinds of problems as doing so would require too much access to the console's system. Which is why all the console mods are skins and textures and a few new items, usually from Bethesda themselves.
---
Nope, i mostly play with my close friends so i didn‚Äôt receive anything from strangers.
---
And no i never used cheats.
---
Thank you. Will try that definitely!
---
Did fine, got some levels on my main (not really needed, but maybe useful depending on how the legendary perk system will work in Q1). Also got to finish the build on my second alt. Good times!
---
Yeah, I do... I love building!!!
---
I've built there before, I really like the area. It's definitely on the list to revisit in the future! üòä
---
Hmmm, I don't even go indoors. I was up showing my friends Vault 79 from a YouTube video. We explored for anything else new in the area and noticed some chickens near a truck with a safe on the back. We went there, saw nothing of interest. I started exploring again to the north, when my friends started asking, "hey, how'd you get past the barrier?" I had no idea what they were talking about, so I walked straight back to them. I showed them the straight line I had walked to the north. They tried to follow me, but sure enough, while I could walk straight through without so much as a pause or a notice that I "cannot go that way," my friends were pressed against an invisible wall. I was able to walk all the way to the center of the compass on the map. I then walked to the north-most boundary of the map and beyond. At that point, I fell through the map and started sinking underground. I stopped soon after. We couldn't figure out why this was happening and didn't want to cause any problems.
---
Not at all.
---
Wear a hat that‚Äôs foil lined!
---
This shit shows still going strong? Why
---
Me: That‚Äôs a cute bear, I‚Äôll store it for my friends collection, oh crap my armors low. Better repair it. 
---
Bethesda: Hey you‚Äôve got some unnecessary weight in your Stash, don‚Äôt worry bro, I got you fam.
---
The fridge only holds limited quantities of items and does not allow for stacking of like items.  So if you wanted to store wheat for instance , you would have to store the pieces individually.   It would allow you to hold 12 pieces...
---
So, you can store only a few things at best.  I use my fridge for complex scorch beast recipes etc to prevent the meat from rotting while I get all the parts.  
---
Is it worth it?  Probably not.  Does it look shiny and nice?  Yep, sure does.
---
gottem
---
I carry two rifles:
---
1. Instigating Lever Action. Basically one-shots anything that isn't a Cryptid or Scorchbeast. 
---
2. Furious Explosive (plus something I forget) Assault Rifle. For everything else.
---
No, he wasn't using a cheating program.
---
Why do you have a rug in your kitchen?
---
Don't tell him how to avoid a ban! Ban incoming.
---
Has anyone else been having this problem? You're the only one I've seen mention it. You might want to report it to Bethesda if it's a problem affecting only you. Might not be a game-wide bug.
---
You can find loads of Firecap along the river near Slocum's Joe, just throw on Green Thumb and you're set!
---
I'm having fun watching this raging dumpster fire(didn't buy this game)
---
Fair point. It‚Äôs annoying coming across a bunch of infinite loading gore piles. But, cleaning that up won‚Äôt prevent server crashes and lag. That‚Äôll happen regardless.
---
I've had it too, but it's very sporadic.
---
That url works for 60 seconds. Sidalpha did a video and tested it. They do need better security but it is not that easy to exploit. It also requires you to provide some information before you can make changes.
---
The issue here is that almost none of the PvPers will be like those guys. Most of them grab max level god rolls and build themselves up so that you do nothing and they kill you instantly. It‚Äôs not about a fair fight, it‚Äôs more about making you mad and getting off on that
---
Happened last night. Tried to drink purified water then froze. Lost my workshop. Quit for the night in disgust.
---
For those that dont want to read post.
---
Tldr-dont be a ass, loot mobs and play nice.
---
PvP can be fun but for the most part its simply an attrition war of who can spam stims and stealth boys. Personally, I'll go to NW if I ever felt like PvP but for me, end game content revolves mostly around collecting thibgs that I like, helping others craft or repair gear, and general just being a simple mechanic. That's good enough for me
---
‚ÄúGame is a service‚Äù= excuse to release a half baked lazy buggy experience that wasn‚Äôt worth the price they were charging us
---
And what about the colander bra?
---
Come onnnnnn increased drop rate for plasma grenade plans
---
If you spent the Atoms that i you received from the sub then I will guess no.
---
What? I always did that, because the launcher was broken on my PC. Support said I should just use the exe.
---
I have a passwort that I only use for the Bethesda stuff on that account, but they should have informed me or something.
---
Ammo problem is something you'd encounters if you use automatic weapons, early in the game you should use shotgun / rifle (with stealth) / 2h / unarmed.
---
You can find their locations online. They are rare. Your best bet is to find one of those level 300+ event grinders and check out their shops or message them.
---
So nice to have nothing to do.
---
And you should see all the winning I do with it.  I mean some days I barely win at all but other days I just can't stop winning.  It's to the point I dont know what to do with all the winning, it just piles up everywhere and I have to throw the excess away. /s
---
It's literally the worst method of food storage in the game bud and it costs quite a few atoms, eats up camp budget and camp storage to boot.  Only really good thing I can say about it is the arktos pharma one looks neat.
---
Bought mine on accident cause I'm a clutz and double clicked.  Used it once, realized how dumb it was and never used it again.
---
Maybe my account is stolen, I haven't played since the Fallout First stuff. I should check if everything is alright I guess.
---
You know, as someone who loots almost everything, this is valuable information. I only learned this a couple days ago, and it actually seems legit accurate.
---
Over the double xp weekend I was grinding big bend tunnel, which happens to have a ton of loose junk around if you include the outside exit and entrance. Now if I stayed 100% at big bend, it wouldn't respawn. BUT If I took a detour and cleared out another small area, things would start to reappear. This allowed me to collect a lot of the same junk over and over.
---
I totally recommend people who are trying to farm specific junk, to look for a place or several places with a lot of what they want, and clear those out then find somewhere with a lot of junk in general and clear those out just to reset the stuff they want. I'm planning to do this with fort defiance eventually, since that place is huge and has some valuable items.
---
NP :)
---
Oh, I just remembered, there are 3 specific weapons you can upgrade.  
---
IIRC, all of the Mysteries quest line rewards - Blade of Bastet, Eye of Ra, and...Voice of Set,  I think - are level upgradable.  
---
  You cannot craft the higher level version if you don't have the original lower level one.   So if you have them, don't scrap them!  For example, if you got BoB at say, L30, you wont be able to make the L45 if you scrapped your original L30.
---
Thats what I thought.....thats also kinda why Im hoping they drop one of not both before the end of the year that way we have something new to play with while we wait for the DLC
---
If you don't dupe it.

Ive played online games for 20 years. I‚Äôve seen close friends get backstabbed more then once.

Wait, you paid for a subscription for a game you‚Äôre so unhappy with that you‚Äôre getting a refund for it and you think you‚Äôre entitled to the money back for a subscription too?
---
How the hell does that work?

Next DXP im gonna work on my NW leveling on my level 228 character.

As someone who works in Tech support, it's doubtful they actively deleted your request. They probably just let it sit so long that the system auto-closed it.
---
Still, that is completely unacceptable to let happen once, let alone twice.
---
MVP right here
---
No evidence either way? This post is the evidence of it one way. Sure, Beth could respond with a reply saying this is not true, but they are not doing that, and haven't for any other similar claims. The lack of them responding to any similar claims is additional evidence to support this claim.

Sometimes yeah, but as a pvp/pve player I've found more good than bad.

Ye, I‚Äôve done it aswell since the launcher is crap lol. They didnt know though, when people reported it they actually did a hotfix. So they can if they want to lol

I managed to level up 7 times to help move points for my new build all in all it was a good one ..

Embrace the diseases, it‚Äôs just part of living in Appalachia!

The interactions in adventure can be amazingly fun. Just area chat people. Most are cool.

Thanks! :)
---
A great surprise fix would be making it so you don't have to select a fast travel point multiple times over before it registers.
---
Do you want a only stealth build or a "run around and stealth build"?
---
Mannnnnnn that was my issue. basically this is what I did
---
I would farm lets say grafton, sulton, or the airtport. I would get like level 5 pistols, pipe rifles, etc.... so I would scrap them all but 1. I would then maybe get a high level or a weapon that I liked.... like the laser pistol from the robot area... and then I would just use that and scrap the other weapons that I didn't like. So basically I just need to get a weapon and just keep it then instead of scraping it..... I can craft a higher version of it, because I have the lower level of it
---
It‚Äôs not happening often and mostly when i decide to consume directly from pip boy, but still very annoying if occurs during a raid.
---
Yea, I do kinda miss the "resource here" dot on the compass ...
---
We actually just refered to them as ‚Äùfeatures‚Äù, at least the ones that been for several months.
---
I‚Äôve only come across players who try to force me into PvP, whether I‚Äôm passing near a workshop or even just running up to me and knifing me trying to trigger mutations in Queen fights. People like that I want nothing to do with ever
---
The last thing i saw in the status of my ticket is ‚ÄúWaiting for an Agent‚Äù and then next then i know its gone.
---
Read below before posting. I paid for the sub because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get anywhere in regards to getting a refund, and this was before the ACCC ruling. I was desperate to play without lag and rubber banding, stuff fucking up etc, so I tried the private servers out.
---
I never said that I think I‚Äôm entitled to a refund for the sub as well. That‚Äôs literally why this thread exists, to find out if I am.
---
Also, I said no troll comments.
---
Same, it's so useful and fun when it works.
---
Believe me . I know those friends in real life , almost like family. There is no way they did that.
---
PC, 20 hours of NW, 3 games with cheaters.  Frustrating but not catastrophically so.  Once again clickbait fraudsters are blowing this completely out of proportion.
---
Nice. Having a good reserve of Violet flux is good.
---
We did Collision Course, Feed the People and killed a fair enough of glowing ones. Even shared level 2 Glow sight so even more XP for all my teammates. She had tons of fun.
---
Collision Course is fun to do in a nuke zone.
---
Wonder if the Mr. Farmhands would mutate if we could nuke Flatwoods?
---
Bag of spoiled meat and toilet paper works too ;)
---
Didn't play... I'm the kind of player that hates anything that speeds up the journey. Wish I could turn off all xp sometimes and just wander.
---
There are many of them. There is also those of us who kill those type players. I ask for pvp, if you say no I thumbs up and leave. Way of the world.

All good points, and no, my fancy underwear does not in fact, grow on trees.

Went from level 76 to 89 in NW. So close to that power armor paint
---
I‚Äôve read some devotees talk about how it changes your whole game. Makes it a slower, more thoughtful game. Not for everyone but it does have adherents
---
Yeah and WoW was totally bug free 1 year in.  Ff13 non one complained about that game ever.  Beloved Bew Vegas, absolutely perfect at launch.  /sarcasm.
---
In all of my play time since beta I don't find that to be the case especially in PvP. I used to run around geared ready to go but eh. Its lost its luster on me but hey if others enjoy it, power to them.
---
Leveled up new alts I created.  One is now lvl 19 and the other is 12. Could have done more, but found out one alt is in good with the purveyor.  I started feeding him legendaries to scrap to draw lvl 1 *** legendary weapons or fun and to make leveling up future alts even easier. Now trying for decent ***  lvl 10 legendaries Keeps getting explosive weapons with executioners, AA, or instigating being fairly common.
---
Just saying, you got hacked so someone got your password.
---
There were a lot more people playing for the exclusive Halloween rewards than there were for the Double XP event. The hoarder/collector mentality is strong in Fallout 76. Despite absolutely hating NW, a lot of people showed up to get in on the exclusive rewards.
---
That's the main reason why I level up when DXP comes around. Right now I have 4 "super perks" i can choose.
---
I never want to grind nuclear winter again. The climb to 100 was horrifying and boring. Love the rewards though. Nuclear Waiting: Only for the rewards üëçüèº

Deathclaw gauntlet is not OP
---
Most diseases aren't even worth wasting a cure on. If you have Adamantium Skeleton and get bone worms,just wait the 30 minutes or whatever. 
---
Now diseases like shell shock, weeping sores, and the blight generally get immediately cured for me. Which, being I roam the cranberry bog the most, can be obnoxious if I run into a scorchbeast and cure the blight, only for a deathclaw to run up and give me shell shock.
---
Thank you for your support. I will definitely take this as a possibility.
---
Lol ‚Äúi thought this would be patched already‚Äù
---
Maybe server lag
---
Marsupal is pretty much a must have on all my characters. Dont foreget to get Class Freak to minimize the negative mutation effects.
---
I‚Äôve been preaching this! Please please fix jetpacks. Patch 15 is tomorrow ... all of a sudden... they just posted that on Twitter. Really hope to see the fix in that update.
---
I must be very lucky.. none of this happens to me
---
I suspect this update could be a crumb trail, adding things ahead of time for Wastelanders. A foundation update for what‚Äôs to come basically; a couple structures here and there might change or be added completely new, probably some items into the developer room like the new gauss weapons and raider armours to make sure it‚Äôs all there and ready for next year. Likely some new AI pathing for future NPCs and some bug fixes hopefully and I expect some to return as well.
---
Why? What's so special about using one character. I like making builds and trying out new things.
---
I almost never eat the food I get from creatures. I almost never craft food out of necessity. I pick up an absurd amount of canned dog food and always hit Mama Dolces when it‚Äôs up. I never need to eat anything else, though I‚Äôll snack down some potato crisps or fancy lads snack cakes now and then.
---
Adding more PVP zones, are for me personally, my favorite idea. Let me opt in to PVP by going into the zone if I want to, and If I'm not, I won't worry about it. Keep the same system in place map wide for duals if both agree, but create a couple of areas that are pure chaos. Survival, but on a small scale inside Adventure. Put it in a raider area, make it "lore friendly". If you agree to go inside that area, there are no rules.
---
Bloodied Gauss stealth rifleman build here; it's true that charging is a drag, but even with a quick shot I basically one-shot everything except scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, and sheepsquatches. With fully charged shots, I can pretty much delete any enemy in the game, but now I'm thinking maybe I should give the lever action a try and see how it performs compared to my current gun.
---
Yeah I hardly even dont loot 1 stars anymore.
---
I‚Äôll pay for the jet pack fix. Please. I‚Äôll do anything.
---
I don't think that was it. I wasn't having any issues on that server.
---
This bug started 3 months ago
---
Mutation heal from shower and rad away is very laggy, most likely when you removed starched genes healing from shower was triggered again.
---
one things for fucking certain im waiting for the reviews this time
---
I always thought for BOS PA paints/BOS clothes for example, why don't you make it turn in this many tech docs to receive a paint etc., instead of total randomness.  Again like you say traceable progress. Turn in 5 for base paint, turn in 30 you get Elder...
---
All of which proves nothing. Sorry, but that‚Äôs the way it is. If they have access to your Bethesda account, Bethesda may claim the hacker might have access to your other info including your email and your credit card data as well.
---
Or maybe just let people enjoy the game? Hard work was put into it. People still enjoy it, even if it‚Äôs buggy as hell. Bethesda does need to step up when it comes to helping people who are getting hacked, though.
---
Noted. I'll server hop after using the shower.
---
Powerfist is good
---
I let him blow up everytime. Usually changes the garbage mini nuke he's carrying to valuable nuclear waste.
---
The only nice thing about this bug, and I hate to admit that there‚Äôs anything nice about it, is that I‚Äôve come to love emergency protocols. Great mod! But PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF ATOM, fix my JETPACKS!!!
---
As well i will recommend farming caps and buying serums from players, it‚Äôs actually faster and you will get only what you want.
---
I died with 6 minutes left. Unless someone one shotted it.
---
Private worlds are fresh and not recycled. I don‚Äôt know how many times people have to be told this before they stop trying to claim or imply that they are ‚Äòused‚Äô
---
Stop it. They are fresh instances.
---
The serums are REALLY expensive though. And players usually sell for more than vendors
---
Im gonna work on my NW character next DXP.
---
I nearly leveled up 12 times, which is a lot for a level 400+
---
Usual price is 400 caps vs vendors over 3k
---
&gt;What do you hope is included, changed, or fixed in this patch?
---
250DR bug

---
This is one with a little bit more being fast and stealth.
---
I hope I could help you
---
I don‚Äôt see any mention of jet packs
---
This happens when playing Nuclear Winter, but there is a way to keep it from happening: simply load up adventure mode before playing Nuclear Winter. You only have to do this once every time you launch the game.
---
They have a support number you can call? I've looked and looked for one.
---
Dont care until wastelanders
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying. You know what you're getting in to.
---
Makes one think that it is the company who sold your account to new user and now doesn't want to admit it.
---
I'm also lucky as they don't affect me either.  But that hasn't stopped a lot of people on my friendslist from quitting the game due to inability to engage with endgame content/
---
Well they haven‚Äôt released the patch notes yet. Unless I missed them.
---
Oh, cool. I'll have to find some ps4 players that sell them.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to understand filing for a refund for a game you‚Äôre still playing, buying a subscription for the game that you filed for a refund for, and demanding a refund for the subscription you willingly paid for, for a game you‚Äôre so unhappy with that you‚Äôre getting a refund for. Am I correct? Is this how this is playing out?
---
 I make a run every once in a while from Slocum Joe's to Flatwoods and scam up Firecap, Snaptail and Bloodleaf. Make some cure at the bench in the Vault Tec Agricultural place, where you can find more Firecap..
---
I play every day, and have it happen to me 2 or 3 times a week. Hard lock-up, often have to reboot the computer.
---
Powerfist and the Sheepsquatch Club.
---
so you can loot them if you haven‚Äôt already, when they fall back in the hole use it to get them:)
---
Contact Bethesda
---
He might be able to see my email but not my visa number . Maybe the last four digits of my visa but thats it.
---
Did you try checking it through the game?
---
When your server hop player vendors it‚Äôs worth to know that on the map when you are checking player vendors serum is under miscellaneous and when you are buying it‚Äôs under aid, don‚Äôt ask me why üòÖ
---
We really need more "reaction" emotes and signaling emotes for Nuclear Winter.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6AZhnwmqwE8SkOeoeuiamw/fallout-76-patch-notes-november-19-2018
---
Noted XD
---
They said Q1 of 2020, per September 26th inside the vault. [link ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again)
---
What I used to do when I was low level and needed Fusion Cores was server-hop  Belching Betty. There is a PA spawn point right next to Bernie, in the small building. The chassis will always contain one Fusion Core, unless another player has already looted it. I like that spot because the fast travel point is very close to the PA spawn point.  
---
You can capture a Power Plant workshop, which has a Fusion core processor that'll give you a fully charged fusion core every 7.5 minutes.  
---
Of course, I highly reccomend you get yourself the Power User perk which'll make your fusion cores last longer.
---
Summit a ticket, they'll give you the atoms for those challenge. I'm going though it right now actually xD
---
Oh snap. Okay I‚Äôll read that in a minute
---
Cheaters on PC: absolutely.
---
Level 200 players: not sure that will ever happen, nor does it seem necessary.
---
If the argument is level 200 players should be isolated in their own servers, that's impractical. If you start level-sorting players, you will end up with reduced server populations. Additionally, a level 200+ player need only make a new character to participate in lower-level servers. The way it works right now, only 1 or 2 Tier 1 teams will generally end up on a single server, and most of the time, we're going after one another. We know who is a threat and who isn't, and we take down the biggest threat first. 
---
If the argument is high-level players are inherently too good to face low-level players, that's only sometimes true. I routinely see level 200+ players getting mowed down in the most ridiculous ways. Likewise, it's only moderately more difficult to take down other players when using a low-level character. Level doesn't dictate ability, nor does it dictate your access to perk cards. A level 0 account could have the same NW perk cards as a level 200 account.
---
They rarely show up , but I find them most often in display cases in harpers ferry.
---
Seems like alt-tabbing was the cause, thanks for that... game looks much cleaner without the resolution bug.
---
Tough i still have a funny box on the world map and pipboy that stops my mouse from reaching the far right and bottom of the screen... any clues? 
---
Blizzard did a similar thing for me a few months back.
---
"If the issue is not resolved please reply to the original ticket"
---
They deleted it so I couldn't.
---
Bloodied combat knife with the sneak bonus and fury it's pretty powerful about 800 ish same build except the strength cards changed to , for sheepsquatch type enemies I go to DCG 2-handed for about 2000+ Adrenaline really helps for up close repeated swings at one enemie.
---

---
Wow... yeah no mention... unbelievable
---
I wish more people had this attitude.  PvP can be fun so long as you go in with a good attitude and don't take it personally win or lose.  Don't carry junk you don't want to lose, simple as that.  
---
All that said certain aspects of the game are horribly balanced and when used in PvP it really limits what otherwise would be a fun passtime.  I feel like a good pvp game is possible in fo76 but they really need to take a closer look at the meta builds and tactics and make some adjustments before it can ever achieve its potential.
---
At least they replied... hope u get your account back my friend!
---
The shovel, especially with +swing speed
---
Yes I did but it doesn't appear there.
---
[Q1 of 2020](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again)
---
What I was saying is that there is no way for Bethesda to know where they got your account info from. The thief might have access to your computer instead of Bethesda‚Äôs servers or even to your physical documents. So even if you keep sending your screenshots or credit card number, it isn‚Äôt definitive proof it‚Äôs you and not the thief. Unless there has been a major breach, to them it might be more likely you‚Äôre just the thief trying to further the fraud and dig more info about you.
---
For lack of a better term it's de-facto Predator Vision. 
---
You were a ghosty pink smoke blob for him - through the walls - and everytime you ran and sat down - he/she would see your smoke blob move and then crouch / stop.
---
Sorry you got ganked but they had you dead to rights without cheating each time despite your hiding efforts.
---
Plus side is you only lost 400 caps which I won't deny that it hurts but honestly you can make that back pretty quickly.
---
Just learned this 2 days ago.
---
Huge.
---
 One of my Combat Knives goes out at 200. The rest around 150 and they escalate rapidly as Adrenaline kicks in. I can melt Ghoul Hordes. 
---
 Yup really underpowered ... not! ;)
---
No, I just thought you said in your previous post you had seen it mentioned in the patch notes. I think I misunderstood.
---
My builds were based on Melee and bloodied handmade sniper commando equally, moving more to the rifle so may start moving more points into perception. I just love my silenced bloodied handmade, only one star but it's so fun.
---
They need to swap the damage bonuses of bloodied and beserkers and it'll be a bit better. At the moment it's too easy to be bloodied. Beserkers is the real glass cannon.
---
We definitely need a way to tag the junk that we want to keep from being scraped, this is probably easier than making a bunch of different types of junk unable to be auto-scraped by default.
---
I've seen it mentioned a few times, but I don't think it's a widespread issue.  Unfortunately, I don't think there was enough information to really allow a guess as to what's going on (few people ever remember to even post what system they're playing on, much less any other relevant information, when complaining about these things).
---
I haven't ever had this pop up in my time (PC), but that doesn't mean it's not an issue for XBox users (for instance), or some other particular slice of the population.  I pretty much eat carrot soup and the occasional canned dog food (and purified water) though, so it could be related to some other food.
---
So, with Stabilized, do you still remain in stealth even in your PA? 
---
I'm curious about how you get such a steady stealth bonus when using a weapon that can't be silenced (the 50 cal)
---
The micro freezes , very sporadic, sometimes will freeze every couple feet while walking , also may be hours until it happens again. Makes me feel like Adam Sandler's character in click.
---
I've tried those directions and it's not listed under "My subscriptions". It's not listed anywhere actually.
---
Seems pretty sneaky to set up an auto pay sub then have no way to cancel it.
---
Damn. I hope to reach level 400 eventually.
---
The least they can do is replying and requesting further info or something. In which they failed to do so.
---
Same here.  I have been looking for robot legs for ages.
---
That sounds good, maybe with wastelanders you can have a bit more time playing.
---
The True Hero of Fallout
---
Bethesda essentially says it's between me and Playstation, not between me and them. "We do not have access to your Playstation transactions..."
---
Or provide some non-armoured overclothes that don‚Äôt provide dr but maybe have some other bonuses or legendary effects. Like how some berserkers wear broken armor now.
---
Once you get a build set, you stack up perk points so if you want to respec in the future you can.
---
I have some 87 perk point to spend if I wish.
---
This game needs reputation vendors for suuuure. I hope they introduce them in wastelanders so I can grind for special outfits, and actually know what I'm going for rather than rolling the dice constantly.
---
Isn't there a cool down on diseases though? Similar to mutations. Pretty sure there is, don't remember how long it is though.
---
When I was leveling up they were pretty scary.
---
That's weird. I opened a ticket to cancel (on PC) and they included those instructions in the reply.
---
Robot armor has worldspawns. Rare are sturdy and heavy metal and all the raider armor plans
---
Got my fifth character from 8 to 34.
---
I sell for 275 on Xbox. You should be able to find pretty easily for ~300 at player vendors.
---
And apparently an [investment group is interested in Zenimax](https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw), which explains why in the past year they have become so greedy. Zenimax is trying to make the companies they own (Bethesda and such) appear more profitable.
---
Ooh! How do i submit a ticket?
---
\^ This is the most reliable tip tbh
---
I get very poor performance at SBQ. My fos doesn't drop much according to the gpu but the game still stutters with distorted audio. I can visually tell the server is lagging, as sometimes my hp/ap doesn't drop or my hits register late. Any other time I get near 60 fps (except some areas). This usually happens when lot of people with explosive auto stuff show up.
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
I remember teams using flares in survival and if they were coordinated they made good use of them and would mop the floor with me.
---
Caused by the gaming being developed by Bethesda, fixed by uninstalling and playing something else.
---
hey! These notes are from 2018! Yeah you misunderstood me.
---
This community is seriously mentally ill.
---
I am on PS4 and have never experienced any of these problems.
---
 I even have an AAE gatlin laser gun. For the most part it collects dust in my stash because i dont use heavy or energy weapons. When I do bring it out for shits and giggles I never experience any lag using it.
---
I do this with the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
Exchange your soul and dignity with Todd.
---
Lol. I‚Äôm such a fucktard! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
They announced just an hour ago or so that there will be an update tomorrow. No patch notes yet. I‚Äôm just saying that I hope jet pack fix is part of it.
---
Fuck yes! Missed the old intro!
---
No worries
---
Nope, assultrons are reddish.  It's definitely the MIRV thing, the effect looked the same as the first YouTube video I found of it, someone in F4 shooting 10 things at a time.
---
Why would you want a feature removed from the game? This is the classic animation from FO3 and FO4.
---
wow, he truly has no life, I hit level 25 and wanted to blow my brains out
---
The 3 I named are upgradable and require the lower version to upgrade.  
---
Anything else non-legendary ls craftable without a lower version, but you may need to find plans and/or have the appropriate perk.  the craft screen will tell you if a perk is required  (ex: You can't craft a level 50 tesla rifle without a certain level Science perk)
---
Don't stress - this game is a marathon, not a sprint.  
---
The higher level stuff will come - you just wont get higher level stuff at the airport.  OTOH, if you loot the airport then sell everything to the train station vendor, you'll get a fair number of caps.
---
Check player (and bot) vendor machines.  Some will have mid-higher level stuff at reasonable prices.
---
I bought my first legendary (rifle) from a bot vendor for all of 200 caps.   The gutter (an assaultron blade with vampire qualities) from another vendor (I later earned another when I ran the Burrows)
---
==
---
IDK how far you've progressed on the main storyline - there's a nice weapon you get as a reward for a quest that starts at wavy willards.
---
The Mysteries questline is another good one.  Start at Riverside Manor. ( Bastet was one of my first really good melee weapons.)
---
Roses quest will take you all over the map, but the first reward is a good one.  But you will need better weapons very soon after starting this quest)
---
Brotherhood of Steel is multiple step and has multiple rewards, weapons and armor.  Start at Camp Mcclintock.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve had a few problems and had them resolved rather quickly by support 
---
Got any evidence for that? I am just saying, a lot of people lie on here about getting good support. 
---
See how ridiculous it sounds?
---
I appreciate that‚Äôs your point of view to the matter. They might consider it more trouble than it is worth. If there‚Äôs no two-step verification process like a second email or a phone verification then it just might be impossible to definitively prove you‚Äôre you.
---
Good catch. I probably read that and missed it.
---
If that‚Äôs the stupidest thing I do all day I might just make it till bedtime.
---
Lol. I don‚Äôt recall having this problem in those fallouts.
---
Disease resistance also depends on endurance, according to a comment I found in the data mining AMA thread, it is 2x disease chance at 1 endurance, and 0.5x disease chance at 15 endurance. Additionally, there are endurance perks that further reduce the chance. However, most people spend very little on this attribute, or even leave it at 1 point. Perhaps if it had a greater impact on the maximum HP (currently, it scales from 250 to 320 points, while 15 agility for example triples the amount of AP), there would be more reason to invest in endurance.
---
Meathook is uniquely OP because it benefits from both unarmed and one-handed perks, allowing you to double-dip and boost its damage to a greater degree than any other weapon. That's not to say it does the most total damage, but it can be made into something pretty devastating because of that.
---
I rarely melee anymore, but I keep a perk loadout handy for when I feel the need, and I have a bloodied faster swing speed powerfist (thanks, purveyor!) that I consider god roll for my build. It probably is OP if I add the right consumables buffs, but that could be said of a lot of the melee weapons with the right legendary effects.
---
I used to see dense plans in Watoga about 2-3 times a week in \~20 hours of weekly playtime, and randomly checking.
---
Have not seen *any* under the same circumstances for several weeks now.
---
I am quite curious what causes this. I myself, nor any of my immediate friend have ever had this bug, but I have run into several people affected by the bug. I wonder if it is certain server clusters, or certain clients (PC, PS4, XBOX) or if it has something to do with the hardware of the machine (PC).
---
I do appreciate him
---
I'd love a fix for the one bug that's ruining my fun the most right now - Enemy health regen.
---
I have a character who doesn't do well in nasty close-quarters fights - I rely heavily on a strong 'first strike', sneak attacking with an instigating black powder rifle. But lately, 50% of the time that first hit will take the enemy health down to half or even zero... and then the enemy (NOT a legendary creature) will have its health leap back to full. If it's a Yao Guai or a Deathclaw, they'll then close the distance and murder me before I can finish reloading. Or worse, hit me and interrupt the reload, then kill me while I try to switch weapons.
---
Last week, I sneak-attack one-shotted a supermutant master who had a minigun... blew out all his health, watched it leap back up, and he instantly killed me. When I respawned, he was dead. So my hit DID register... but the server let him gun me down anyway. Infuriating.  
---
My second choice bug fix would be invisible enemies. Last night I tried to join Uranium Fever - Hit the free join/fast travel button, appeared outside the mine, and immediately started taking damage. Explosions and gunfire everywhere. No sign of enemies. I ran around hiding and hammering stimpacks, but kept taking damage. After 30 seconds, and almost dying numerous time, the mole miners finally became visible, in a mob surrounding me. Then the game announced that the event had failed. Nice.
---
Under no circumstance should enemies be able to attack you if they haven't rezzed yet. FFS.
---
It wasn't my account being lost, it was regarding billing and how I lost gametime due to their shitey servers.
---
Someone REALLY needs to sue Bethesda because the Fallout series is in the hands of imbeciles.
---
Level 80 people have stronger builds than me, so it‚Äôs really just a way to see time played. No need to go over 200 really. I just play way too much haha...
---
If you're looking for the best 1-handed melee that is not an unarmed melee, I believe it is the Sheepsquatch club.
---
You need to find the plans to craft it and its mods by doing Free Range events.
---
You can only find legendary variants through the Purveyor if you know the plans to craft it.
---
I have a TS +limb damage primed LMG - I play a support build that focuses on mob control and debuffs but with the Adrenaline perk, enough primed ammo, a vampire's shotgun, and a few ranks of heavy gunner I could probably solo the SBQ and her mobs without too many issues
---
Yeah i do admit that for me personally hackers and cheaters on PC is one of the reasons why i tend to prefer consoles for gaming.
---
Don't do that, they'll charge you a chargeback (usually \~$25 USD) and you can get blacklisted by their company and any affiliated companies. People always suggest disputing charges, but that's not something you want to do in the overwhelming majority of cases.
---
Level may not dictate ability but it is a metric for time spent, and thus familiarity with the game mode at the very least.
---
A level 200 player is going to either have all of the perk cards or at the very least enough to have an solid build. If they are one of the names we see constantly in every match chances are high they are far more sorted out than a rank 10 player.
---
You are totally correct they can just evade any level ranked system by bringing in a new character, that is something that would have to be addressed in any kind of ranking system. I mean at the most extreme it could be totally circumvented by buying a new account, but the point is that people trying to learn the game mode are consistently mowed down by the same tier one teams match after match and it is a problem. There has to be a way to at least mitigate the issue.
---
If nothing else it is a problem for the game mode itself, any funnel that just feeds kills to the same experienced players over and over is going to suffer stagnation eventually.
---
And yes, even the level 200 players still die in stupid ways, but they are also usually in a better position to bounce back from a setback due to more cordinated and better set up teams even if someone gets lucky and offs one of their team members.
---
I think a big part of the problem is the perk and special system implementation as it is, connecting the mode to existing character special builds seems wack to me in hindsight. Not everyone is going to spec for better builds in the mode, thus helping feed the meat grinder.
---
Sorry for the ramble, but I appreciate the convo, you make good points
---
I have a 2-shot lever action and it is my least used one of the bunch;  the accuracy on it is horrible compared to my other levers.  I will use my Furious, Vampire's, or even my Zealot's before the 2-shot.  The extra damage looks good on paper, but if you're continually missing it's not that great.
---
I tend to snipe enemies from a distance if I can;  if swarmed by a mob, I VATs target legs, especially on ghouls, to slow them down.  If the mob gets really thick, I'll hop on a roof or something where they can't get me and then VATs as many of their legs as I can while they run away; when I hop down they're just limping back toward me so it's easier to be strategic about your shots.
---
It does not pop up in my atomic shop.
---
In FO4 walking off a porch in PA would cause the ground slam animation.
---
There were several FO4 mods that did this. (it was a very good idea to have a full set of acrobat armor as well)
---
It‚Äôs one of the main reason so stopped playing
---
Actually, to be more accurate, then not doing anything to address it in any reasonable time frame is the reason. Bugs happen. But these should have been addressed at some point.
---
You have made my day
---
It is always catastrophic when one person finds a way to rob 35+ people of their time invested through ill gotten means.
---
Also, vampire effect works best with high cyclic weapons like gats, machine guns. Each round restores health regent for a short period of time.  You can unload on a mutant and watch your health continue to creep up even after you stop shooting. They really nerfed vampires. My mg42 was OP before the nerf. You'd never get below 100% at west tek, now I can see the health drop a bit (but come back up) where it was maxed out all the time previously. I usually mix my mutant slayer's explosive Gatling w one of my Vampire heavy guns. Switch between the gat plasma, gat laser, .50 cal, mg42, minigun. Prefer the .50 cal. The light machine gun is a monster, but ammo is expensive .50 is a good balance of ammo consumption fire rate.
---
I don‚Äôt think Bethesda set it up right for PSN users. It‚Äôs flagged as a single purchase like if you bought Atoms. There isn‚Äôt a cancel option available and will not auto charge. This is due to a disconnect between Bethesda and Sony.
---
We are doomed, insult bot is evolving
---
5 times but I did not really grind. Im level 360. So 5 times was good enough for me
---
It *is* a different item every day, but on that page, they list all the ones that will be up for sale *that week*.
---
The good news is they can‚Äôt access ur legendarys or items as it is linked to ur PS4
---
I had a nifty mole miner gauntlet with bloodied and more power attack damage that just crushed.
---
i think it depends on the legendary effects, really
---
Yeah, it seems like that should be the way. It should simply be listed under "My subscriptions" in Playstation but it's not. Those instructions explain how to navigate to the "My subscriptions" in your PS4.
---
I'm kind of at a loss what to do.
---
It would be under services actually. Scroll until you find Fallout 76 it would be listed there.
---
And piss off the settlers? Lol. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I made my people want to kill me because I hit the ground a little too hard.
---
If you sent them credit card numbers in your support tickets that could explain why they were deleted. You really should never, ever send credit card numbers to anyone for any reason over the Internet, except when making a purchase through a reputable site, over HTTPS. Legally speaking they could get in serious trouble if they were storing your credit card numbers in a relatively insecure free text place like a support ticket and those got stolen. You have to file the ticket, wait for a response, then they will walk you through how to verify that you are the original account owner.
---
With the correct rolls anything can be OP. Like a +40% power attack damage, -40% damage taken while power attacking plus whatever you want the 3rd to be. I have one of those and it cleans up shop and it‚Äôs hard to die as well.
---
This is actually simple to do and I have done it before. A simple Google search should get you some answers, but if you want an in-depth guide from me you'll have to wait until later today.
---
I used to get at least 3 a week and I‚Äôd check constantly. A few people have said they have had them but for me I‚Äôve seen none.
---
This is great news! No sense in saving Appalachia if all that is left is a bunch of mutants at the end. 
---
Stay human bro's! Never forget what the Enclave did to make those disgusting serums!
---
I don't think it should be a perk, it should be a given feature. Red Dead shows a handy little marker on the map. It shouldn't be that difficult to implement.
---
JET PACKS FIX PLLEEEAASSEE!!!
---
I am rocking a maxed Supp perk and a Supp Gat Gun: do they stack, one works but other doesn't, or not work at all? Some ja ambushed me at a workshop and lit me up with a explosive auto shotgun, came back at him at range and even scoring a few hits died almost instantly even with X-01 and full Fireproof perk. Supp seems pretty useless atm in PvP.
---
So Playstation telling me it's a recurring charge and will continue to be charged until canceled is a mistake? Are you sure? Because if they keep charging me I can't argue about it because I was told in multiple places this was a recurring charge.
---
Oh, but these mutations are GOOD. They help us defeat the horrors of the wasteland by giving us buffs (along with class freak perk. Reduces negative effects)
---
Haha, yup. I end up leaving my PA just in side my walls. That way no one will get upset.
---
I mentioned this in another reply, but they probably deleted your support ticket because you sent them your credit card information. They are legally at risk if they are storing your credit card information in a place that's not heavily secured. A support ticket is not secured the way that, say, Steam's shopping cart checkout is. You need to resubmit, without including any information other than what happened. Then they will contact you and verify that you are the original account owner.
---
I've been using Instigating from the very beginning, and fortunately for me, many others thought as you do, which allowed me to acquire quite the collection of Instigating weapons.
---
My Stealth Rifleman character uses an IE Handmade (1280+), IE Lever (1580+), &amp; IE Pipe Bolt Action (2750+) as his main weapons (Ballistic + Explosive), and the best of all....IE The Dragon (12,888+), will drop a level 80 SB from the sky at range in one shot.
---
I got to go up 19 levels
---
Got over 40 levels.
---
No they dont, i have tried and got nowhere
---
Nope. I have moral standards.
---
Yes! That's too hard to find, thank you very much! It's turned off now. I thought I looked everywhere but not there so thank you.
---
What would you want for one? I have an Instigating Gauss and an Instigating LA for easier enemies, with a TS Gauss for SQB/backup and I've thought about tweaking my build for bloodied sniping
---
I cannot tell you how much I learned two weeks ago about NW following a couple of level 100+ guys around for 3 rounds.  Literally blew my mind how many different strategies they used and how many times they completely changed their strategy on the fly.  I never would have imagined the mode was that complex nor would I have learned any of that only playing with other level 10 scrubs like myself (just don't care for NW normally, wanted the pumpkin weap skins.)

Tldr: I love having the higher levels in there from my experience.
---
\&gt; Wonder if the Mr. Farmhands would mutate if we could nuke Flatwoods 
---
Hmmm....What would they mutate to?
---
So an update to this, I played a couple more games and they were ok. Hid/slow sneaked through most of it but then as we got to the end I usually take out at least one before I die to earn ok Xp. 
---
The issue I had the other day I haven‚Äôt been able to recreate. 
---
Hidden in a bush looking at my perks on the semi transparent version of pip boy, guy comes around the corner and with absolutely no delay one shots me. No way he had enough time to see me, aim and shoot, it was milliseconds. 
---
I was wearing camo spec ops suit with brown hair and wood armour in a brown bush of the same colour. Span Round with the v key before going into pip boy I was invisible.
---
Sorry I dont agree with this. I've had a hacker take my steam and battle.net acct before. And both were quickly resolved within 24 hours. Battle.net asked for a pic of my passport or drivers license. And steam asked for a pic of a CD key for a game I owned or a receipt. Bethesda shouldn't just ignore him. They should ask for some sort of id to prove who he is. If someone stole that Id. Then I'm sure the game will be the last thing he would be trying to resolve
---
Yes they do, I've done it before, they'll ask for a picture of the challenges and your username.
---
Hooah!
---
My Main uses X-01 PA with the Stealthboy Torso, and remains hidden 75% of the time, My Bloodied build only gets brief periods of Stealth damage.
---
I understand . But at least they should let me know or something ! I cant read their minds you know. Like .. what kind of support team doesn‚Äôt inform the customer that they are working on it or if they need more information from him?
---
It's crazy how far people are willing to go to defend this company. Sorry but this is a ridiculous argument.
---
Thank you!
---
What the fuck, when i tried theu just said "yeah weve disabled buclear winter challenges for now"
---
Weird how OP was cool with me questioning but you‚Äôre just a troll looking to argue. G.O.M.D.
---
Maybe I should then I can go 3 for 3 on platforms üòÇ
---
Our PS is probably 90% used for VR and 10% last of us replays lol
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people selling them for around  150
---
It‚Äôs even crazier how people confuse understanding how/why something happens with approving that said something happens.
---
Right cause they are just on reddit all day looking for people crying lol
---
My deathclaw gaunlet does over 1500, it's all relative ;)
---
Shame really 
---
Also nobody plays the instruments with me on stage on pc, they all jump in on Xbox üòÇüòÇ
---
I'm over 60k on Steel right now.
---
I know it effects loot condition but I've seen people say it effects everything from bullet hit chance in vats to random event location chances to how often serendipity activates to a bunch of other things.
---
This is why I was demanding 2FA authentication a year ago.  SUX2BIgnored...
---
Lack of time writing weekly newsletters? This PR department? What work have they done to keep themselves so busy?
---
Provide an oversight/mistake.
---
With the way trouble tickets usually work, they can't communicate directly to you, which means if your TT is deleted (which they have to do the second they see CC info), they can't reply to you at all. I agree they should have at least told you via an automated system why your ticket had to be deleted, but that's Bethesda for you.
---
Derb.
---
You don‚Äôt have to agree with me. I‚Äôm saying what might and seems to be happening and, if that‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs policy, little can be done. Bethesda‚Äôs perhaps inexperienced policy might very well be different from Battle.net or Steam. And it might suck.
---
Then again, there‚Äôs no telling if any of what OP tells us is even remotely true or if this is just a grab for attention.
---
Lying and the Atomic Shop go hand in hand.
---
How about a ‚Äòloot all area‚Äô
---
Surprise, its wastelanders!
---
No, it shouldn't, because it breaks immersion.
---
Not necessarily true 
---
I got to PvP a few times this weekend and it was fun.  A couple of players (they were teammates) picked a fight with me at a vendor and we went back and forth several times until they got tired of me kicking their asses. 
---
On another occasion, I PvPd at the WS train station (shocker) and another person jumped in to defend me when the opposing player started his stealthboy Tesla bullshit.  That experience wasn‚Äôt nearly as fun but still helped to break up my boredom.  I can only XP farm so much.
---
And alot of ignorance
---
Do you guys want to actually do your jobs &amp; pass this on please?
---
Half-width vertical walls and roofs. Without them, the half and quarter floors are almost useless.
---
Stairs that snap to the side, not the center. Then at least the half-floors would have a use, and you could make a 3 story building without a huge foundation footprint.
---
Proper, nice looking railings.
---
Unbroken windows in the barn and warehouse sets.
---
Angled or curved walls, like in the F4 concrete set. In fact, that whole set was amazing. I understand why we can't stack foundations (they're indestructible), so give us other ways to achieve that 'look'.
---
Greenhouse set from F4. Without broken glass.
---
The F4 Raider tent canopies.
---
'Gack' objects (stacks of books, ammo, desk gack) that we can place on tops of desks / tables / shelves. I can put an Atom Shop plushie or a desk lamp on a shelf already, so this should be very simple to implement.
---
Less gaudy wallpaper, with smaller-scale patterns. A lot of the current patterns are too bright, and too huge. They look ridiculous.
---
Displays for clothing/armor (the mannequins from F4) and power armor.
---
Planters for crops (like F4).
---
More themed items - Heads on spikes for Raiders. Junk walls from F4. And the thing everyone's been clamoring for for months - BOS-styled CAMP items!
---
Oh wow. I did it last mouth so maybe a policy change happened or something? I don't know.
---
They honestly should just give you the atoms.
---
Lol nice
---
No worries, they take ages to get back just so you know
---
Thats what made e so angry about how it was handled, for the sake of 50-60 atoms they decided to just chin me off instead of just giving me the atoms
---
What mutations are you looking for? I sell serums for 250 caps on ps4 but I do not carry all of them.
---
But apart from this you're still enjoying the game though?
---
This guy is a nutter. I‚Äôve never hearD of companies completely ignoring you when getting hacked.
---
Yeah I guess!  I changed the HDD in mine to an SSD because they're cheap now days and it has halved my load times, fast travel, respawn etc.   The HDD in PS4s is bloody slow and mine's a Pro.  They won't use the full speed of a new SSD but it will be a lot faster than the clunky HDD they come with.
---
It's an easy process too, there's guides on the net and Sony makes the software easily downloadable so it's not a massive chore or something you need mad hacking skills to do.
---
"you get all that armor and gear for what"
---
for harder PvE, and even more rewards.
---
I have nothing against PvP but this was bad for your argument, sir.
---
No they didn't.
---
I saw this bug yesterday.
---
Me too.
---
I've never had the issue until they introduced the little combat timer for FT many patches ago.
---
I definitely wouldn't put it beyond server instance latency; I've had times where it functions without flaw for hours at a time. Switch worlds and it seems like 4-5 times to get it to trigger, happens on public worlds and private worlds.
---
Happens to me on two different PCs, the only thing in common with them is having an Intel Z390 chipset on the motherboards.
---
Marsupial and healing factor right now.
---
Hope it never happens to you my friend. This the first time i feel i am powerless or that i cant get my basic right which is recovering my own account!
---
I actually thought that was the purpose of using a flare gun was for it to make a WOOOOOO! when you fired it?
---
For me too.
---
Come on and help the guy!
---
They won‚Äôt do shit
---
Mind blown man, so obvious
---
Unlimited Stash would absolutely overburden the Servers, unlimited Scrap does not as the game only keeps up with a single item and a quantity integer, other "Unique" items require server space for each individual Item, which is why the patch that limited character weight had such a dramatic effect on the games stability.
---
I know I've definitely got Marsupial for sale.
---
I can make Healing Factor but I don't know off the top of my head if I have any made.
---
Doesn't work like that unless your datamining Bethesda's servers which would be called hacking.
---
You can expect datamining after someone who does said datamining downloads the patch on PC and examines any changed or new ESM files for changed or new data.
---
While they've helped out with somewhat related situations in the past, it's not a CM's job to chase around after failed support tickets.
---
Get your head out of your ass before you call people out.
---
That is all well and good if you end up playing on team of highly skilled people, most of those crews have their teams squared away or run solo. The vast majority of players will not get the experience you are describing here and are more likely to just be run over by the peeps we are talking about
---
People who used these programs and started documentation of it.
---
They probably did the follow, which some companies do. So example playstation if account was hacked/stolen are known to ban the account and close it down, essentially losing any amount of money you have spent. Its a super shady and shitty thing to do.
---
Secondly Bethesda probably does the same exact thing once reporyed so unfortunately you cant sur or anything because the account doesn't exsit and all your private data was erased as well.
---
Lastly a lot of businesses yse this practice to avoid more breaches and clear data so they cant be brought to court
---
Data mining can only show you what changes to the game data have been made compared to before the patch. Often developers will package future content in patches leading up to their release, but when that release is is unknown.
---
If this is real I hope it works out, they shouldn't be ignoring you. But I have to say, I really don't agree when you claim several times you did what any other person would do. If my account was hacked I would be on the telephone with a rep within 48 hours. You sat on a ticket system for two months...
---
Kinda makes me doubt we're getting the full details here.
---
You don't need those mutations to defeat anything in the waste, all you need is a strong axe and some power armor friend.
---
Perfect. 
---
Out of curiousity, Will you take 200 for each? I struggle with caps... (I can afford them, but I've never had more than 850 caps at one time)
---
I can probably offer a legendary item for scrip or to keep  in place of the caps
---
If you don't want to take that offer then I'll just pay full price and find a way to regain my caps.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious
---
Help dude out
---
Sad state when the best patch note you can get is for the old main menu screen tbh
---
What underwear?
---
good luck getting help, especially from their support team.  
---
a friend of mine is still trying to get it canceled  
---
"todd laughs while counting your money"
---
When you suck like me you do, lol. I never have many caps, I stuggle to find good items, my stash is always full of something I cant figure out, etc. These mutations help me a lot.
---
it just works - todd the liar
---
This bug still exists on the dragons in Skyrim. They didn't fix it then, they haven't fix it here, they're not going to fix it. Just enjoy the company and move on.
---
The Harpers Ferry Vendor &amp; Watoga Vendor both carry the T-60 mod Plans, but the Part Plans have never been available from any vendor, only from CB Bog Events &amp; Treasure Digs.
---
that's why the Savage divide it's my kind of place. If you don't live there- you probably wear a nurse outfit and are just a wanna be raider.
---
that sounds like bethesdas "support" team.  
---
I thought i might get the response fast like in steam or Origin or any other platform. Didn‚Äôt expect this to happen.
---
I generally list pink ones for 50 and they do not last long.
---
A friends Microsoft account was hacked and everything was deleted.  Turned out to be a friend.  So you may want to dig close to you too. Maybe a significant other is sick of the console. Maybe a butthurt friend is messing with you.  Mind you he was offline for month before he fixed it
---
Yeah I'll take 200. Send me a pm and I'll give you my psn. I won't be online until probably around 8pm EST
---
Kill the Sentry Bots at WS, you will get 2 off each one of them, almost always over 75%
---
that's awesome but it doesn't discount other players issues.
---
Or have it show up when you‚Äôre using berry mentats or targeting HUD power armor. (Not in the same color as living targets)
---
If you are on Ps4, find me. I have ALL the serums 
---
in my vend for 266. game tag is: georgepluck
---
Regular and legendary SB, I just use my TSE Handmade or Two Shot Action Lever (with accompany rifle perks). For the SBQ, I go with the Action Hero and wallop her with my Unstoppable Monster when she's on the ground if we are not in the nuked zone.
---
I remember when I used to play battlefield bad company 2. There was some kind of event or challenge or maybe just a certain rank but you could unlock some special pistol somehow. Well I completed the requirements and I never got it. I contacted support for the game and called support about it. I got ahold of some nice guy and after a minute of checking my account he did some typing and told me to restart my game and check my weapons because he said he added it manually for me. It fuckin worked. Best experience I‚Äôve ever had with customer support. Those days seem to be over now. Companies are so bad and greedy and just don‚Äôt care these days.
---
Ever Upwards does this mechanic right in my opinion. You work for the badges and get to choose your reward from the vending machine. This is how more quests should operate in my opinion.  It doesn't hurt that the backpack mods are actually worth the grind.
---
None of those things are fixed by mutations, if anything they are made worse by hurting your own special stats with mutations.
---
Murica
---
the centurion outfit they released around Halloween. I've only seen like two people wearing it.
---
The BE90 Gauss is a legacy, so I‚Äôd want a lot for it.  I have a TSE Gauss on my trade list too.  I‚Äôm mostly looking for another legacy a Laser Rifle (BE or VE), B25 Tesla and a 3* Bloodied VATS50 Lever.
---
So you don't learn when someone beats you?  I know I do.  Just sayin.
---
Unless you're saying they were overpowered compared to you.  Which I did not experience either.  I was usually either outgunned (had a crap weapon like a crossbow vs a machinegun) or they got the drop on me cause I wasnt expecting someone coming from that way.  Both of those problems are because I'm a newb not because they are so much more powerful.  Things that were remedied quickly just by playing a couple of matches and getting the lay of the land.
---
Milage I'm sure varies, maybe I just got lucky.  Only ground out 3500 xp that weekend.  Just saying I appreciated having some guys that knew what they were doing.  I learned a lot.
---
I‚Äôm really surprised these ITV‚Äôs haven‚Äôt done an ‚Äúfirst look at patch 15‚Äù yet. They basically launched fallout first, collected the largest influx of cash to date, and haven‚Äôt even tried to get anyone excited about anything coming down the pipe since
---
[https://falloutfirst.com/](https://falloutfirst.com/)
---
yep, thanks to dupers they disabled artillery grenades and vertibird grenades
---
Yup. Just like the pioneer scout machines. A nice mix of cosmetics,  camp items, and nice back pack mods. Imagine all the cool stuff they could create for factions.
---
Yea but like, after you didn't get a fast response... why would you wait around for TWO months and then suddenly post about it on reddit of all places?
---
Sorry but I'm leaning hard toward 'bullshit' now. But again, if it's all true and wasn't just some mistake then I hope it works out for you.
---
Dude Bethesda is the worst dad. Call judge Judy
---
wow, the bethesda fanboys are so brainwashed they accuse people with hacked accounts of being the hacker....just fucking wow
---
God roll refers to the legendary effects on an item.
---
A stalkers deathclaw gauntlet is not a god roll. A troubleshooters meathook is not a god roll.
---
A bloody swing speed +1 strength baseball bay is a god roll.
---
But really, who hasn't banged your mom üòÇüòÇ
---
I consulted my magic 8 ball and it said the heavy weapon spin bug would still be in the patch.
---
Well no, I didn't see the flare myself. And whenever I've fired one, I never see it light up or anything, so I just assumed it was a broken thing in the game. But it looks like they've worked for other people, judging by the other comments, so I'll have to try again.
---
She'll hear the case in 30s or less.
---
You should try out one of the common BE90 Levers.  You‚Äôll never want to use the Gauss again.  Not only will you do more DPS, but you won‚Äôt have to carry the super heavy Gauss ammo. If the Gauss was doing maybe 50% more damage it would be worth using situationally, but not the way it is right now.
---
Oh so kinda like rex‚Äôs companion perk new vegas? That would be extremely helpful trying to find loot in dark places
---
Sounds like good ole b.s. doing it again!!
---
I have a character with pretty low luck ..3 i think? and I definitely see a difference in my fortune. My serendipity seems to activate an awful lot on my low luck character though, but then the second swing always nails her lol
---
If you're on PC I can just make you the ones you want so you dont have to go through all that bullshit. Just gimme some flux or whatever
---
I use that mod. Works great. When I can't find a body I just occupy myself in the area till it turns to a pile, then I can see it a lot easier and I can hear it because of the flies.
---
A mapped bug turn into a feature if not fixed.
---
... that is true in software development.
---
Your guess is as good as mine, but you can't deny that the last several have been pretty much phoned in.
---
No, I'm on ps4. Thanks for offering though
---
Maybe this is their answer to all the complaints about hacking in Nuclear Winter. 
---
"Welp, we can't fix that, so let's just forget that game mode exists. Especially on the title screen." 
---
Kidding aside, i missed the old title screen too. It'll be nice to have that back.
---
Only a simpleton would think parodying the gullibility of a cynical online forum community is endorsement of something else.
---
I don't have to like Bethesda to mock how quickly people eat up anything they see that reinforces their biases.
---
Bethesda "We added the perk to highlight dead bodies"
---
Players all use it
---
Bethesda "Seems like players are always using and feel like its mandatory so we nerfing so you only see last kill"
---
hard work lmao. Biggest overstatement I've heard all year, there just incompetent even with the simplest of tasks.
---
Damn, me too. I took a picture of my protectron, levitating in the air. Need to post it as well o/
---
Yours got a good pose going.
---
Whatever, shill.
---
I buy keycards regularly all the time. I've started posting them on the Courier's xbox FB group but maybe the next one I do I'll post on here or on the market sub. Usually do 10ish or so runs before I call it good.
---
I thought it was just me. I haven‚Äôt seen the fast travel click-a-thon bug mentioned before.
---
I laughed haha
---
Thanks bud :)
---
I did what everyone in my situation would do. 
---
I made two tickets . What am I supposed to do other then that ? Hack my account back ?  It just means it needs some time as i said before those type of problems takes time to resolve and i didn‚Äôt expect them to delete my ticket like it never happened thats what pissed me off the most.
---
I just want to make Deathclaws run in fear from the dude with a toy gun...
---
I miss that from NV.
---
No, and I also forgot to kill Hitler. I dun goofed.
---
&gt; my visa number
---
If you submitted your full Visa number as text in a support ticket, their filters probably immediately deleted it.
---
Don't do that. The fact that you did so should probably clue you in to how this happened in the first place.
---
Submit another ticket without including any information that is literally identity theft waiting to happen.
---
Are you on PC? Sometimes I dump 50 Disease Cure because they are starting to take too much space... I can give you some
---
I was too busy playing another unstable game subject to crashes and disconnect, Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
Ah, I've heard the back and forth on the Gauss rifles having legacies for exploding. In fact I've had two or three deals pending for a TSE Gauss that the owner backed out of when someone told them it was a Gauss, and then sold/traded to another player when they were told otherwise. I definitely don't want a BE Gauss bad enough to trade at legacy level. I'm just holding out for a TSE Gauss less than 20k
---
It depends if you used your CC or wallet balance. I paid with my wallet balance so I dont have a auto renewal. Under the directions it listed to end 22 with
---
This is hillarious and I hope you get nothing back.  About the only thing I agree with in your post is when you said "I'm entitled" it devolved from there.  
---
You dont get to force a company to give you your money back after you've used the service because you planned your life wrong and can't afford it now.  Seriously what the heck dude.  Just wow.
---
I would have expected maybe something been put in the game last patch maybe textures or anything that's what I was asking
---
You're basically saying if a hacker even gets access to any of your sensitive information you're screwed?
---
The Morgantown airport is a great farm place with this perk. Easy mobs and plenty boxes to search.
---
With certain explosive legacy weapons, Demolition Expert doesn‚Äôt change the displayed damage.  This makes many assume that it is a different type of explosion.  It‚Äôs also believed that these explosions penetrate some resists like on the SBQ.  I can‚Äôt confirm or deny this, but I can confirm that my laser rifle does a ton of damage. It can even 1-shot a Whitesprings sentry bot when at max adrenaline and in stealth.
---
There better only be 1 more day allowed for the skeleton costume. 
---
  Sincerely, a guy who hated every minute of that 
---
    grind but got the rewards.
---
Prior to them limiting Character weight, I had a Vendor Character at around 20K lbs, and a friend with roughly the same, it was impossible to load them both on the same Server, it would crash, every time.
---
Playing other games lol
---
Made about 100,000 throwing knives.  Shared Scrapper and Super Duper with low level alts.  Trick is getting the low levels up to 20 then it's easy to gear them up and level fast.
---
If someone hacked my account-- meaning they potentially have other critical information about me-- I wouldn't just send a couple support tickets and wait around for two months hoping someone else fixes the issue. I would be all over that situation and so would everyone else I know. Phone calls, emails, public posts, repeated tickets... waiting two months and doing nothing direct is just plain weird.
---
It's entirely possible you're just an innocent victim in all this, but I'm not going to just accept that your response is normal, cause it ain't. :/
---
Yeah, I can confirm that Demolition Expert changes damage on a Gauss, but doesn‚Äôt on other legacies.  So the Exploding Gauss isn‚Äôt as overpowered as many of the other legacies.
---
Get a sense of humour, bucko. The world is much more fun when you're not wasting your life posting bitter replies to silly threads in a gaming forum.
---
I'm still going to 76 upon death respawn. So frustrating!!! Especially on a timed event or a nuke zone where you have to FT outside the perimeter.
---
And as a 'go between' that means they should be reporting every single claim anyone on reddit makes? Drop everything they're doing and rush over to see what the next complaint about Bethesda is? 
---
I don't know how you get through life day to day being this dense. xD
---
As others have already mentioned no. 1 on my list would be CTD upon using consumables. I mean, the list is... long but if there is one thing I would like fixed is that.
---
Right now that is the one bug that bugs me above all others.
---
I mean the fact that getting the Strangler PA was a total grindathon only to find out that I cannot really use it for anything I cannot 'one-shot' because I CTD is a bummer; the fact that if someone else turns up with the bugger means that I will probably CTD too is the icing on the cake but I cannot in good faith tell people not to use something that took so much grinding to obtain because it inconveniences me and I dread what the devs may do to fix it given their track record - for instance with shotguns in general and explosive shotguns in particular - so I guess it will be a matter of clenching the jaw and moving forward. In my X-01.
---
But I digress; what they will actually fix will be bringing back armour degradation, some obscure exploit of some kind, some nebulous 'server stability' matter and as you point out OP a slew of new Atom Shop items because it is a little bit stagnant on that front.
---
Don't forget all Mr Handy and Mrs Nanny Bots
---
The Outer Worlds gave you a highlight when you were standing right in front of a container/body and then a perk lets you increase the distance that the highlight is visible.
---
Use the environment to your advantage too. Such as the sentry bots and other robots at WS, the missile launchers in the BoS camps (although be prepared to dump resources into repairing them), SAC cargo bots, etc. Every little bit helps. üëç
---
do you have millions of dollars to be able to sue a huge corporation?
---
There is. It's called Rad Resistant.
---
I needed this, thanks! ü§£
---
I hope they fix the crafting priority so it pulls resources in the order of inventory &gt; scrapbox &gt; stash instead of inventory &gt; stash &gt; scrapbox. I've had to put all my collectible junk in a dedicated vendor because keeping up with a secondary pile of junk to protect it was just too much management.
---
Bethesda continues to show PornHub how to fuck people.
---
Toggle team status effects would be cool. Maybe have little icons under their health.
---
They really need to do some work towards taking important items off the scrap all list.  The Stings n Things parts are always things I never want to scrap, but always forget I‚Äôm carrying.
---
I hated having to do this after every Imposter Sheepsquatch event because an Eyebomb would send the invisible corpse flying.
---
Having Queen of the Hunt fixed would be nice.  My main, like other people have mentioned, has the issue where the quest won't finish when inserting the sample.
---
Maybe because there isn‚Äôt anything? :D
---
Power armor and perk cards do that better than any mutation.
---
You are hurting your endurance, strength, agility, hitpoints, and intelligence by piling on mutations. These things make you more vunerable to damage, not less so. Not to mention gimping xp gains.
---
Yeah my problem is I'm at the raider camp above the munitions factory so I get lvl 68 Super Mutants a lot. I can't get rid of my crops either, I need them to keep my punchbowl stocked with Nukashine for visitors.
---
I would always forget to swap it in.. I don't spend that much time inside nuke zones that I would want it equipped all the time..
---
Okay, time passes and you have grown up into the BGS prodigal son. You have inherited the keys to the kingdom and your name has become synonymous with the great Todd. The internet is clamoring for a sighting of this wonderchild and Zenimax has signed off on your first appearance at E3. What do you bring to the table to prove yourself to the unwashed masses of bathesdites and Toddians? Be careful what you chose, these factions are both fickle and skilled in the ways of the YouTube.
---
this
---
Do the levels feel any slower than they did in the 300 range? Curious if exp is capped at a certain point.
---
I'm a beta player, with a lot of friends from the beta days. Never heard of this before. I honestly suspected a corrupted installation or something like that. Seeing as eating and drinking would affect 100% of all Adventure players, the fact that it rarely gets mentioned compared to bugs that affect small groups of players, I'd still suspect it has something to do with the individual rather than a global issue.
---
What I'm trying to say is that this may be a small-scale individual tech support resolution rather than a global patch.
---
2 levels every day. hit lv355.
---
I feel like it caps out. I‚Äôd love it if a data miner or someone could release that info for us.
---
Hey dude. Don't bother arguing with this idiot. He will bring you down to his level &amp; beat you with experience.
---
301) 926-8300

It seems to be a pc problem. I have the full set and use an exploding gattling plasma with a splitter. I only encounter problems while fighting the Queen. I just got a ffr 50cal and was able to just lay into her with no lag what so ever
---
But my 60% was just an example. That would be to easy, yes. Should such a perk exist, it would probably be something more like 25%/30%. It should also not work with power armor.

Bethesda customer support

I can mod your Torso for 1000 caps, or 500 + the required Flux
---
If you don‚Äôt have two-step verification system of some kind, there is a significant risk that the answer is yes. It‚Äôs all dependent on the company and the process. Life is not always fair.
---
I think I leveled up 6 or 7 times. I made it to 351. Target was 350 so I did well. Lot of events and capital building, whitesprings travels. Fun times as always.

Lol my bank acct password used to be my last name and a 1 and I got hacked from Ukraine. I was asking for it üï∫üèª
---
How much would the lead lined backpack help?
---
Get armor with rad resist as a legendary effect. If you can't handle the game at normal difficulty, don't run a Bloodied build, it's that simple. You're just asking to be babied instead of rising to the challenge.
---
Yes true, I have around 25 of them though. And buffing them to power armor lvl would be even better than a perk.
---
I was trying to, but the elusive whitetail christmas roast eluded me this year.
---
&gt; That person was actually telling the truth
---
And you know this because....?... evidence...?
---
I didn't make this thread to ridicule the poster of that thread, I made this thread to ridicule the people who are brainlessly upvoting some random internet poster who actually claims they've acted normally when they haven't (since most people do not wait 2 months after being hacked and then just post to a subreddit about it... he hadn't even attempted to contact the company directly beyond the ticket or attempt to take fast action for a resolution, and neither of those things constitute a 'normal' response as he claims).
---
So no, I did not break any rules. I did not launch a personal attack. The first line of this thread is pointing out that since we're 'cultivating a scene that will believe anything critical of Bethesda', I'm going to have a bit of fun with it. 
---
I actually just finished some discussion with the dude who made the other thread, and as I stated directly to him, if he's legit then I fully support his quest to get help. Bethesda CS should not be ignoring or deleting tickets. I just don't think the way he's handled the situation is either effective or reasonable or normal, and so, having no *real* evidence, I choose not to rail against Bethesda like I'm sure Yongyea and the rest will. xD
---
Decontamination showers will still remove rads for a few seconds after leaving
---
That's unfortunate. I love some venison roast.
---
While I'm here they need more unarmed perks. I'm an unarmed build and I dont have much cards to use to increase my build
---
How about having a hazmat suit not remove all your armor?
---
Sure, but it won't put you in first place. These people play more than you, are in nearly every match and have been thinking in orgami with the remains of the box for months and you won't be joining their team.
---
There is a reason most games have ranked play, because the ones that do not just end up an endless meatgrinder feeding noobs to the established groups.
---
I appreciate your desire to pull up the bootstraps, but the truth here is that the game was rigged from the start.
---
Are you of the mind that those peoples total work will somehow be less than the total amount that you put in?  Cause 14k xp is 14k xp no matter how many days it takes you to get it.  They aren't getting anything for free bud, they still have to grind out all 14k.
---
He and everyone he plays with abuses Frog legs
---
Yep, would be nice to finish that quest.
---
Yeah, the struggle is real, i always forget to swap lone wanderer and hard bargain.
---
Equally good, would be all for that!
---
Haha it was my birthday on the 13th! Tried to have a birthday party in 76 but no one came lol
---
And still not recovered. Have to wait and see. Hope it get resolved soon.
---
Damn. Don‚Äôt have the outfit anymore.
---
Yes please, with damage resistance like the mole mask.
---
For the most damage in one single shot with a crit, you want calibrated reciever. However since you cant crit every shot, the best reciever is whichever does the most damage which in this case is primed. Primed also makes the most ammo per material at the added cost of flux. Also does more damage to Sierra bravos and scorched which is nice.
---
Also on the handmade the primed auto reciever is as strong as a normal hardened receiver which beats all other auto receivers
---
Bro, you had me going.  I was so confused reading them, thinking wasnt half this shit fixed already?
---
I'm bloodied vats sneak, so it's no challenge at all actually. But just fun to run around killing things before they ever see me.
---
I've found by just running about 100 game feet/meters fast travel usually works. I have to run out of my camp area to fast travel.
---
We also need a lampshade hat!
---
BFFR is the meta right now. So yes, it's a very good gun.
---
Lol. I never do pvp so it could‚Äôve said anything and I would‚Äôve been completely oblivious.
---
I've experienced it... once. In almost 900 hours. Once, in Watoga several months ago, I went to use a berry mentats from the quick wheel and it locked up. Immediate thought was "Great now this shit will start happening all the time I bet." but it never happened again.
---
The Bathesdites seize upon this moment and post a million hyperbolic videos on youtube about how this tantrum is proof that the Toddians have placed their faith in the wrong faction. 5 million falloutscrolls fans die in the initial violence of the ensuing faction war. Eventually the Toddians pool their money and buy an old missile silo out in the desert. A record breaking GoFundMe garners enough cash for them to build the worlds largest nukamine which detonates prematurely and starts a global thermonuclear war.  In the end no one is declared a winner and only dust remains, because war, war never changes....
---
Now middle aged and tired the prodigal son sits in front of functional ham radio that is housed deep in the Bethesda game studios HQ 'vault 76' theme bunker. What do you tell the world?
---
People want legendary shovels for the Prickett's Fort daily.
---
No more running to deathclaw island for a shovel just to bury some 400 year old dead guy.
---
I never had that. How much rad/res does it even give?
---
You have to cut the staff to the correct length and put the medallion on top of it to find the ark
---
Depends on the company thats why there is security questions and what not to ask before they take action. I only know because it happened on ps4 to my friends account and they didn't help him they just permanently banned his psn account and didnt refund or give him back the account since thats how sony operates with stolen accounts they ban them and end of story along witj removing all personal data. I dont know what bethesda actually does was just assuming they do that as well
---
That's fine, but my point was that even with that fix, the game is still unstable as hell anyway. It's good that they fixed it, but there's so much more to fix still. Not to mention, as I said, Bethesda wasn't clear about item limits and weight limits. So it makes it look as though they lied now that the scrap box exists.
---
"Abuses?" how so? They've already been nerfed, and honestly, one of the best times to kill someone is while they're using Frog Legs. Using Frog Legs places you on a predictable trajectory. I'm not a good sniper, but I've been able to place a 1-shot, 1-hit round on Mack at range with a sniper because he uses Frog Legs.
---
With a predictable trajectory, anyone using Frog Legs is giving you the perfect opportunity to shoot them out of the sky. It's up to you to take advantage of that opportunity.
---
Hey I'm hoping you can help me out. When I enter a store or other business, how exactly should I go about telling people to 'do their job' in a way that ensures I look 100% like a self-entitled douchebag with no social skills?
---
I'm hoping I can try this in a physical store, even though it's a lot easier to act like an ass online where there are no consequences!
---
‚ÄúSnakes, why‚Äôd it have to be snakes?‚Äù
---
I have too, and in any game that doesn't include ranking the story is always the same, the best players team up and curbstomp everyone on the bottom ad infinitum.
---
You should, but...?
---
New characters hopeful feels are nice tho :] and best responder rp response to seeing a flare ever
---
Did you have the weapon equipped when you went to check the damage number?
---
Just curios, is anyone else able to access the Burrows? My friend tried to enter but it says its [Inaccessible]
---
I think like 80
---
I wish.
---
An Incredible unfair advantage with no place as a perk in NW. should be a mutation.
---
Yeah, once it becomes bad press, it gets top priority.
---
Take your time dude, I‚Äôm 155 and still haven‚Äôt finished enclave missions yet.
---
did you equip it? iirc it needs to be equipped to see the change in damage numbers.
---
also if you have perks with +DR/ER (like ironclad) it counts against berzerker
---
It's almost like they want to get rid of their original fanbase and start fresh so that there won't be so many complaints about their shit games.
---
But I know that it's mainly because they have no fucking idea what they're doing.
---
Just more shit to pile onto the mountain that is the downfall of Bethesda.
---
Hope you can get your account back.
---
I did 3500 in 2 days and I tapped out.  So I get where you're coming from with your burning hatred.  And while I'm loving my bat/pumpkin weapon skins I cant even imagine doing 3500 again let alone 14k lol  Just remember they will still have to put in just as much work as we did if they want the level of reward we got.  May even be worse since the NW servers were full as hell those 2 weeks around Halloween.  No guarantee the Christmas rewards will even be worth it if they are released at the same time.
---
Oh and while they are all cussing at their screens in NW grinding out all those xp you will be sitting pretty without a care un the world in your glow in the dark skelly costume.  You got all your homework done before spring break as it was.
---
&gt; "Woke up one morning and found out my account was stolen and 2 new email messages from betheseda saying that the hacker changed the email of my account and the secret question, so i did what any other sane man would do. contact the support."
---
Are you sure it was an email from Bethesda?  Sounds to me like a phishing campaign and you might have just given the hackers every other info they need.
---
&gt;I got hacked from Ukraine
---
Thanks Trump!
---
You can use the Responders paramedic jumpsuit, the Responders police uniform, or the Firebreather uniform to satisfy the requirement. I've seen these in peoples vending machines if you don't have one anymore, but the prices vary wildly for no apparent reason.
---
Wow, really! That's a lot. But I don't think I have time to grind for it unfortunately.
---
Fast travel has been broken ever since they put in the useless timer, which is also broken. It gets more broken by the patch and they haven't even mentioned it.
---
I saw this and I was like what the fuck and sadly didn't take a picture before reducing it to a pile of ash
---
Really should just be a feature. Glowing dead bodies, or a small light rising up. Something.
---
Very good gun. 
---
Grats on the drop.
---
There are few Heavies that can compare to this right now, and they are also all Bloodied Fire Rate.
---
How annoying.
---
Message me on PSN, Stygian_Cultist. I run a church, "for newcomers".
---
This is your answer OP. Powered is AP refresh. It's only in the name if the armor is Assassins.
---
Kimball: It's just a good thing that someone with the temperament of Caesar is not in charge of the law in the Mojave.
---
Caesar: Because you'd be on a cross.

Yea I've only seen a ghoul one once before.
---
She's a tight bitch.
---
Because it's an obvious attempt to rack up views on their video way more than it is about providing some potentially interesting science to the community.
---
The guy could easily have their cake and eat it by giving the results and encouraging people to watch the video to find out the process of how they got to that result.
---
Now the whole post just looks like clickbait for his video, and not particularly good clickbait at that.
---
It is a stupidly powerful gun. Prime it, not just for the bonus SB damage, but also for the outstanding ultracite fusion core crafting yield. The only drawback is the slow spinup time, and I put up with it just for the sheer volume of damage it throws. Mine will headshot the queen for 40+ dmg *per round* and with FFR it fires 20-22 rounds per second. I literally have to sandbag in queen fights so everyone else can get their damage in and so enough waves of adds spawn to get a few legendaries.
---
Imo, Rad Resistant could really stand to either be a Rank 3 card, or offer significantly better protection for the hefty 5 points of Endurance.  It is completely outclassed by having a Lead Lined Backpack, or diluted Rad-X.
---
This . He just sent some Nigerian prince all his money and his credit
---
A better question is why? Like One Violent Night, there are a lot of spawns, each carrying the chance of legendary creatures. With the SBQ the vast majority are level 50 + and often 3 stars. I have gotten better loot from these creatures than the SBQ (not hard since you just get a 2 star combat armor every friggin time). The main attraction of the SBQ for me is the flux. These guys could pace themselves and do much better in the end, plus there would be fewer angry faces from players who arrive too late to do enough damage for a share of the loot.
---
I like how I got downvoted for asking why, this whole sub is fucking toxic on the dumbest shit
---
Thank you üòä
---
They'll throw you a bone. Gotta keep you guys hooked.
---
I broke down and bought Fallout 1st to see the private world. It is running much smoother, on Adventure I got several crashes, my butcher bounty skill glitched out constantly (same with pharma farma, scrounger, etc), and I experienced frequent frame rate drops.
---
So far by myself on a private world it is running dang smooth. I also do not see everything looted out anymore. So for now I am exploring on Private and joining Adventure mode to visit player camps and spend caps (those robots took our jobs, buy nothing from them).
---
Asps. Very dangerous. You go first.
---
It‚Äôs the same as my reddit name
---
None of those three things are mutually exclusive.
---
They have more ranger skins. We've already gotten 2.
---
They'll sell a better jetpack in the Atom Store.  
---
Bethesda showing Pornhub how to fuck people all day every day.
---
I mean a skin isnt exactly an outfit, the new outfit is being promoted as a part of the bundle, the skin was propably one of the exclusive atomic shop sales
---
Unreliable narrator?
---
That's where my scrap not went, thanks fo ringing him...
---
I wanted a shovel I couldn't accidentally scrap easily (for the daily quest)  Then I thought, it should have 90% reduced weight. Then the hunt was on for a god roll shovel, because why not. And since then, I have been searching for the best roll of every weapon type there is. I usually make sure it has 90%rw on the weapons I'll never use.
---
Radshields only last 15 minutes and are hard to craft. Power Armor is forever... Some of us don't like PA and still want to fight the scorchbeast queen.
---
So, I run Bloodied unarmed in a HazMat suit.  I don't get the benefits of Unyielding, but I can survive Queen battles in Nuke Zones using perk card-based resistance like Barbarian, Evasive, and Ironclad.  When you couple these with the typical damage mitigation perks you have for Bloodied (Serendipity, Dodgy, Lone Wanderer, Blocker), you can get by with the 120-160 DR you'll have.
---
-ringing +finding
---
Report it man, it is the only right thing to do.
---
Yeah, like the heavy gun spinning bug. Oh wait, that's still there.
---
Hey, at least they fixed the goo piles messing up spawns! Ah, no, they didn't...
---
Enemies floating while in the sleeping animation? Not fixed.
---
Legendaries disappearing? Nope.
---
Some foxed items like tanles not fulling loading is still around.
---
Honestly, the list is too big. I can't think of 5 bugs they have fixed since launch tbh
---
That fuckin blows, man.  Sorry that happened to you.
---
I'd also love if my gatling laser didn't dust legendary scorchbeasts into oblivion seeing as my big gunner dumps so much ammo in, I'd like to feel like i did it for a reason...
---
There is a Nuka World and Nuka World Geyser Jacket and Jeans Outfit in TNT Dome 3. I'm always rocking those.
---
Pastors Vestiments works too
---
A limited time reward, is just that, for a limited time. It was released in plenty of time to earn it. Only people complaining are the procrastinators.
---
It is far rarer to fight the SBQ in rads than outside of the blast zone. Most people drop the nuke so you can fight her outside the zone.
---
After the Scortch Queen  event it's a pain in the ass trying to find the meat piles that you shot during the fight
---
Come on dude. Up votes, down votes are all effectively meaningless. This is such an insignificant thing to babyrage over. Don't let it bother you.
---
I answered your question because it was a fair one to ask. Let's leave it at that :)
---
Going to if I can get my hands on the outer worlds.
---
So when I‚Äôm slaving away at the stove cooking up a Thanksgiving dinner‚Äôs worth of food every day my feet don‚Äôt get sore.
---
I got another infinate loading screen this morning. Unfortunately the other ppl there where unable to kill it.
---
The items on the "sale" portion change every Tuesday.  Every day a different one of those items has a sale.  It just shows you all of them so you can figure out if you want to grind out some atoms ahead of time.
---
My experience has been very positive.  Within the first few minutes of the B.E.T.A., I was constantly dying because of these invisible or unkillable enemies, but that hasn't happened in forever.  I've never had an issue with crashes either.  I've had a lot better performance with my XBone X vs regular XBone.  Same goes for my PC versions.  Once I upgraded to a beefy deck, I've not had a single crash yet, although I don't play nearly as often on that as I do on my XBone X.
---
I have 3 characters ranging from level 75-150. Quit because of bugs, improper management of bugs and exploits, bad game direction (imo they pushed pvp way too hard when the game hardly functioned as a pvp game), and a severe lack of challenging end game content.  All 3 of my characters have nothing to do besides farm randomly generated gear. Also the dupe glitch pretty much ruined the economy back in the day, don‚Äôt feel like it ever recovered to how it was before the dupe glitches.
---
How is a head a limb?
---
I finally got my first beta character to level 50! Now I can use him to get fully leveled unique items from the quest line.
---
Great idea. Wouldn‚Äôt be bad for adventure mode as well. I have 2 characters with a combined total perk points well over a hundred.
---
Make them a higher level robot.
---
PS4?
---
It effectives my main profile karma, which also effects how willing folks are to trade with me on reddit. It's not meaningless whatsoever.
---
Also, my comment wasn't directed at you.
---
You're plain wrong. Congratulations, I also didn't get it until past lvl 95. You just said yourself, it's possible to not get it for a very long time, making it unfair. People don't have Access to it. 
---
Yes, it's a horrible, horrible perk. Sorry it's your Crux and you don't see how it's bad. You jump to avoid fire making it incredibly hard to shoot. Yes you can shoot them, But when a whole squad of 4 jumps around with explosives, it's simply not fun.
---
It shouldn't be perk. Everyone theoretically having doesn't make it okay.
---
Battles have objectively been lost because of this perk
---
Nope... but it does deplete the Head stamina bar a lot faster.  When this bar runs out the enemy usually flinches and staggers and will be less accurate.  But limb damage does not cause more damage, it only cripples faster with all the benefits crippling brings.
---
Ty
---
You would think but we are talking about Bethesda here.
---
Let's see. Hope you get something worthwhile. I hate what the subscription has become (though don't mind subscriptions in principle) but hate people getting ripped off by Bethesda even more so.

OK, now I heard from many reputable YouTubers that [this](http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/pictures/k/kenbox/02.jpg) will be the next outfit added for Fallout 1st subscribers.  The outfit will be available on November 25th and will come with a free turkey recipe.  Or maybe not.  If all that turns out to be made up, don't blame me.

---
CHANGE ALL YOUR PASSWORDS NOW
---
So.... You sent your personal info including your Credit Card number in a support ticket, witouth being asked for it (support will never ask for a CC# and as many other have been stated, that's probably why your ticket was auto deleted)
---
Let me be honest here, your situation, of course should be resolved, and I'm happy that support have finally reached you, but the fact that you sent your CC# in a support ticket after you got hacked just raises red flags, I have never sent a support ticket to Bethesda, but usually support sent you an automated answer with a copy of the ticket to your email... In Wich you wrote your CC#, I don't know if you know where I'm heading here.
---
I think Bethesda never sent you 2 emails telling you that your Bethesda account was hacked, the hackers did, the hackers got access to your email because you probably use the same password for the game and your mail, and since they have access to your mail they probably deleted any answer you got from Bethesda if any was given.
---
Just to be clear NEVER WRITE YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER IN ANY NON SECURE SITE.
---
Change all your passwords now.
---
And effective
---
You're right about the build being tied to your adventure build. It doesn't make a lot of sense. I can't think of a better, practical way to address that, but I do admit that I hate having to figure out how to make a NW build work within the confines of my adventure build and vice versa.
---
As for the advantage players have through experience, you're right. That's why I'm launching a YouTube channel to teach players how to succeed in NW.
---
&gt;level 2
---
I've been noticing lots of nukes lately, players at the other events not so much.
---
Missed DXP?
---
In some fallouts the head is considered a limb for limb damage. Didn‚Äôt know if 76 considered it a limb
---
I want exclusive camp stuff. I was a big Sims player as a teen so the building aspect in fo4 and fo76 are always super fun to me. I can spend hours, (probably more like days) building a new camp.
---
No.
---
Limb Damage is a really misleading phrase.  What is basically means is that it deals more "damage" to a limb's condition, so you can cripple it faster.  It doesn't literally do more damage.
---
Consider the way that the Enforcer perk works on Shotguns.  Even if a Shotgun pellet commits 1 damage, it can instantly cripple a limb if Enforcer procs.  Limb Damage is like having this effect on the weapon in question.
---
It is a buggy mess, but it‚Äôs always been playable. You can play through and/or around the buggy mess and have a great time doing it.
---
Umm ok dude. You do you I guess.
---
Good luck with your imaginary clout. Hope it picks up for you, I really do.
---
PS4 here. It used to happen maybe once, twice per gaming session (several hours or so). Since the latest update, happens almost every other time I use the map. Annoying but not a game breaker.
---
It does, but not as added damage, just limb damage, and sadly, it's basically pointless to cripple the head, even in pvp.
---
No, Xbox one man :( maybe we will have crossplay soon since it's officially open.
---
The damage numbers lie
---
The same way the torso is.... feckin aimbot magical fuckery.
---
There is no more details as I just finish uploading video before going to work, I don‚Äôt have enough time to summarise everything I will try to throw some most important info:
---
Most mods have 0 effect on vats accuracy only long barrel helps over short barrel
---
Vats cost is hugely affected by automatic receivers reducing cost by about half, other mods reducing vats: aligned, forceful, quick and swift magazine, slightly reduced with hair trigger receivers vs regular semi auto. Mods like perforating magazine have opposite effect and increase vats cost. I hope it‚Äôs helpful and you really don‚Äôt need to check my videos if you don‚Äôt want to, guys I‚Äôm not making any money from YouTube.
---
Awesome I will def add you! I play in the evenings between 6-9 as well and I try to play all day on the weekends. Since I have a girlfriend I spend time with her on weekends or during the week etc..
---
My PSN is DarthSh3nn
---
Why is everyone talking in the past tense, the game is still here?
---
Almost the same set of mods available and I tested with my handmade and couple mods seems to be the same, I do agree that more in depth testing and comparison is required to confirm 100%
---
I just wish I didn't have to risk getting my camp destroyed by griefers just because I wanted to PvP.
---
But that's people outsmarting the game mechanics and its developers. I am sure they Intended scorched Earth to be  a radioactive hell of a fight, and it was, at first.
---
Not a new build but I played the mini game Bush Wookie and had a blast.
---
On a related note, when the game game start highlighting the resource nodes (when try to build the appropriate extractor) in workshops?  Just noticed it yesterday.
---
Yah dude.
---
Nice gun for the queen. Don't forget about the power user perk. 1000 shots per core.
---
I'm sorry but I dont see your point.  How does this invalidate your experience or your reward?  Also, will you be upset that other people get the same reward as you next Halloween?  Does this also invalidate your experience or reward?
---
That's because it's not a "buggy mess", it's a "mess with bugs".
---
You're about a year late to the party, at least in terms of all the Youtuber talk and buggy mess stuff.
---
This is not the best state the game has been in but also wasn't the worst either. 
---
It was a buggy mess in the beginning for maybe a couple of months. It was a buggy mess not long ago for about a couple of months again. The kind of buggy mess that broke the game for some outright. For others it made it consistently annoying enough that it wasn't worth playing anymore.
---
If you're doing fine now, good for you.
---
Incorrect. I'm guessing you haven't played NW for months, because the claims you are making are outdated. It USED to be hard to get Frog Legs for a very long time. Now there's a system in place to get the perk cards you need on your own time. You can't use Frog Legs to jump forever. Demo builds no longer rule the world.
---
Also incorrect - it is not my crux. I learned how to do without it. Now it just comes in handy from time to time. Using it too frequently will take it away when you actually need it.
---
The overlap between 76 and The Sims in terms of the itch they scratch is really understated.
---
It's not imaginary clout when you regularly trade on the subs. It shows others you can be trusted and you dont typically have to deal with bs like who goes first and I need a middle man crap. The passive aggressive bs from you is very condescending per the usual for this sub.
---
I have a bloodied faster fire low weight lever action rifle people have called God roll. Also, a bloodied explosive reduced weight 50 cal.
---
build more fridges I have 2 one for raw meat one for cooked meat
---
&gt; You have to literally click where you want to travel multiple times before it even registers 
---
That's been happening to me for months, I have to run somewhere else for FT to work or close the game and try again when this bug kicks in.
---
Now say it slowly enough to fill 10+ minutes so you can maximize that sweet YouTube monetization.
---
I spent more time in the Sims making and decorating houses than I would actually play the game.
---
Stop poking holes in my idea. üòâ
---
I played it for a month and enjoyed it the whole time
---
We know there's at least that one armored variant out there, so it wouldn't surprise me.
---
It my personal experience, it was really bad at launch. I forced myself through all the bugs and missions and that awful "kill evan" nonsense from launch until about january 2019. At that point and time, me experience became borderline unplayable. The game was done, no missions, no events, nothing to do but scrap. And all the bugs and constant drops that happened to me made me walk away. I sadly listened to the bashers and missed out on the Feb event. I know what its called but im not even gonna attempt to spell it. I came back about april 2019 to a completely different game. Still, mine was super buggy, but i played like twice a week until the fallout first bombshell dropped. New content felt broken when it was dropped every single time. By the time id hear the content was fixed, my mission would already be complete so i missed out. Nothing felt done and i almost deleted it. But two days ago i finally decided to start completely over. I figured enough time had passed since launch that id never remember all the missions. 
---
That said, ive been having a ball stomping around at level 5 these last two days. I actually look foreward to playing again. No fallout 1st subscription either, and its still fun. 
---
Dont let em get you. Form your own opinions. If you like it, then thats all that matters. Same goes for the 1st subscriptions. If you want it, dont be bullied out of it or into it.
---
I never saw it, and thought people were out of their minds.
---
Then I increasingly saw it as time wore on. Now I'm lucky if I get to my destination on the 3rd attempt.
---
I'm on PC. And the issue is certainly not anything on my side.
---
You're on PC? Can give you one for free.
---
Not thinking very hard. 
---
Remember the quest where it said go talk to the brother and he was always dead?
---
Crashing when exiting power armor?
---
The floating power lines?
---
Lever rifle reload animation?
---
Team and nearby players getting Berry Mentat or Targeting hud outlines causing crashes?
---
On and on and on...
---
Dont forget to put brawling or weighted on your armor limbs as well.
---
First month of launch was rough, but, many people were having way too much fun blasting ghouls with their pals that we didn't care.
---
As a Beta player, it used to be HORRIBLE. Constant server disconnects. Griefers who could walk up and kill you or your CAMP any time, any where, without provocation. Duplicated items by the hundreds of thousands. A new bug, glitch, or exploit every day. Completely unplayable areas of the game.
---
Most of these have been fixed. Server stability is still bad. The game is still far from perfect. But it's playable and fun.
---
Not everything will effect vats, some things do, and some don't.  And the same mod on a 10mm won't necessarily behave the same on a handmade.  So yes, things can be different.  And yes, some of it is broken and makes no sense (welcome to Fallout).
---
Kill it with fire.
---
It doesn't belong. That's it man. Don't know why you're so defensive. As I said, it should not be a perk. It's should be a mutation at best. You can still spam it. Jump twice, wait 3 seconds jump again. The nerf was pathetic.
---
It makes the game unenjoyable. I'm an avid NW player. I played during the Halloween event. Many, many frog abusers. As soon as we saw them . All fun is gone.
---
It needs to be removed. Simple as that.
---
No, I'm actually being sincere when I say that I hope things pick up for you. 
---
If you're having to base your worth on the whims of the upvotes or downvotes of people and bots that aren't at all based on logic or reason, you really need all the upvotes you can get.
---
Dude, you got like 1-2 downvotes and you flipped your shit. If your karma is that much on a knife's edge, things aren't good for you. That's why I hope things pick up for you.
---
If you read this as passive aggressive as well, I just can't help you sorry.
---
Yup, I always loot everything from them.
---
They creepily follow me around as I run around the map. It's like that cat that moves towards you when you avert your gaze.
---
I don't see on and on and on. I see five. Please, continue. I would love to know how hard Bethesda has worked for an entire year.
---
Floating power lines, man. Now *that's* an important fix! Good job, Bugfiesta!
---
I‚Äôm on the PS4 :/ but thanks :)
---
Fix the 250 while reloading bug for christ sakes
---
I should have clarified that I was talking about Heavy Robot armor being rare. I never used Map76. The information is still there.
---
You have to shoot it far enough or it won‚Äôt work. Easiest way is to shoot it straight in the air.
---
Just go to the water fountain by the whitespring Resort
---
&gt;Frankly, if I were a CM I'd completely ignore people like you. ;-)
---
The way you're talking, I wouldn't be surprised if you actually are one of the CMs over here on a different account to hide your identity.
---
That's weird af but ok. Get why the question is being asked now.
---
I downloaded Spotify on my PS4 and found a Fallout Christmas playlist with songs ranging from the 1920s-1950s. I leave it on in the background while I‚Äôm playing and it‚Äôs the best thing I ever did!
---
So this challenge is not worth doing huh lol?
---
All my crashes  I have to omit to being the hardwares fault on my end ,, the console has a Spaz once and a while / the game shites it‚Äôs servers when too much is going on against its protocol ,   Which bugs can cause ,   But even FALLOUT:3 had bugs and some of that was the funniest random occurrences as to NV not so much F 4 ,   So I take the good with the bad ,  never lost any gear besides loosing my junk bag cos died 3 times and game lost track of it ... if the ship goes down I‚Äôll be on it til it‚Äôs gone , too invested now
---
I mean, it's Fallout. Sometimes you have to play fast and loose with what constitutes a "limb" when you're dealing with FEV abominations. üòÇ
---
Pastors vestments count as responders gear and they have some fixed world spawns
---
Sinks. Kitchen and bathroom.
---
Interesting "surprise" patch, normally, the updates are teased some time in advance in the Inside the Vault articles, especially when there is so little to write about recently. Maybe it is a small patch, or released sooner than originally planned (for example, because of an important fix), or something controversial is coming again?
---
So, OP sent his credit card information in plain text via support ticket (BTW in the past there was a bug which allowed random people to read support tickets) and it got auto deleted by an algorithm because it's literally illegal to keep this info.
---
Because OP got "hacked" by a script kiddy while watching porn or whatever and then failed to use the ticket system in the way its meant to be used, he's instantly in the "FUKKKKK BETHHESDAA NEVA BUYING AGAIN REEE" mode.
---
Wasn't their fault that you chose a low password/ getting a keylogger and then sent your damn credit card information via ticket system.
---
But I get the point, everybody just really want to hate Bethesda for whatever reason.
---
Like I am really quick to call many things an exploit, but this isn't even something you really need to think about to do, you can just misclick and make it happen
---
They've got a pretty draconian 'downvote all game screenshots' unspoken rule over there, no amount of snazzy frames or filters will save you sadly
---
What other perks should I invest in nerd rage?
---
Go look up patch note data for yourself and do research on your own. It's not my job to list every single thing that has been fixed, it has been posted on multiple outlets.
---
May have to try this! I was thinking playing it on my computer and just have my headset on to spread the joy.
---
I see this a lot on here. So and so on you tube says the games a mess. Fucktard on YouTube says it unplayable. My god when did this happen that people watch people play games and what they think of said game is now gospel. 
---
 
---
 I‚Äôm not a huge ‚Äúgamer‚Äù (I cringe when that term is used) but I play a decent amount and usually buy 3-5 games a year. Here‚Äôs how it goes. 
---
Oh look a new game, that looks cool. I‚Äôm gonna buy it I think it will be good. 
---
Buy game, play game, finish game enjoy game. WIN
---
Or
---
Buy game, play game, game sucks, don‚Äôt finish game. 
---
THAT‚ÄôS IT. 
---
Can we just stop with the endless articles and videos of games sucking and being great and blah blah blah. 
---
Sorry to go on a tangent but yea the games good. It‚Äôs got its flaws, some bad some really bad. Play it until you get bored of it. Then play something else.
---
How much guys did you get this weekend? I up easily 10 levels on one character without play too much. (100 to 110) I'm sure in rushing you can up 20-30 lvl.
---
Nice, that is really cool to hear.
---
Serendipity is kinda broken imo lol, it definitely activates over 50% of the time if I'm being hit by automatic fire, stops fall damage, even stops your own explosives hitting you.
---
I have two characters, one is 5 Luck the other is 8, weapon/armor condition dropped by enemies is definitely effected (even says on the Special page under Stats in the pipboy), but I've never noticed any difference in serendipity activations or random spawn points but to be fair I've never really tested it.
---
Some people have said it effects cap stash amounts but at 8 Luck I still find them with only 10 caps since I farm three of them at Whitesprings (two at Blackwater mine, one above the enclave service entrance) when I need caps.
---
I wish luck had more effects.
---
Who cares? If you're enjoying it, keep playing it. I got it even though everybody warned me not to. The only bug that really pisses me off is when you take over a workshop and the game crashes shortly after. I got about 100 hours of enjoyment out of it, I'm just now getting kind of bored with it. The Reddit trading aspect does add a nice element to keep you grinding.
---
I made a new character and got him to 56, playing thur-sat evenings. I just kinda put points into whatever I wanted and expect to do some respeccing later. But right now he is just using vanguard armor and an AAE25 handmade, nothing special. I think I will lean toward heavy guns with AA prefix, I hate power armor but I love the heavy guns in this game.
---
What‚Äôs really sad is that it‚Äôs taking this long and this extreme of an issue for you people to stop playing this shit
---
That‚Äôd be awesome! I‚Äôm sure players would appreciate that!!
---
Maybe it's like "raiders of the lost ark" and you have to go on an adventure to find the top of the staff , Then align it perfectly to reveal the location of the ark!!!
---
not for me on PC
---
If all of the maps contained only small hills or flat plains, Frog Legs might be optional. That's not the case. Taking away Frog Legs would cause people to be trapped in the fire pretty often, unable to escape a pursuit, or a dozen other legitimate uses for Frog Legs.
---
The problem I have with complaints like yours is that you expect everything to be nerfed to suit your style. Today it's Frog Legs. Tomorrow it's something else. A successful player learns to adapt. Those who cannot adapt are doomed to fail. Sounds like you're already there.
---
While that would make sense, be glad that only having the one unarmed perk gives you the freedom to use the other 6 points elsewhere to increase carry capacity, sneak, etc.  Unarmed already has more base damage than slow weapons but with a medium swing speed.  You can also boost your damage with talons and twisted muscles.  It really doesn't need more perks as it is already extremely powerful if you know how to stack it.  Plus, if you go for a sneak build, unarmed works with covert operative and ninja.  The other two cards that are missing for unarmed are basically built into the base damage and mutation.  It just means that you have more freedom for survivability perks.
---
Man, should've told support not to worry about fixing and just give you your money back.
---
Damn I wish  I would have seen this before I posted my own Indiana jones comment
---
Can't think of any more, huh? That's because whatever they've fixed, it didn't make a difference to this dumpster fire.
---
Not a new toon but changing my unarmed bloodied build to heavy weapon power armor wearing char. Fun going around killing things with my harpoon gun at full health
---
Only server hoppin' fixes it, so it must be tied server side.
---
I tried a stealth crossbow build.  But it was too cold outside to test it much, so I came back inside and watched Runaways instead.
---
Might be in prep for a new atom shop p2w style item perhaps? Similar thing happened to food decay and repairing.
---
Never heard of it on Xbox. There should be a huge outcry if it's something are necessary as eating and drinking...
---
The only thing more popular on the internet than whining and being dramatic is porn.
---
Alright you get one since you're obviously too lazy to do anything for yourself. 
---
Plasma rifles not spawning as legendary.
---
Heavy robot plans have worldspawns, iirc they can spawn in Harpers ferry for example
---
Ohhhh okay gotcha do you know where I can find these mutations
---
What do you eat and drink?
---
Why end the event at all then? Why make it limited time? They might as well make a permanent challenge reward.
---
Hell, they can offer it as a participation prize for people who are capable enough to log in.
---
Then Bethesda better get ready for a world of hurt through major fines ober breaking the GDPR. They legally can't just ignore their customers, it is literally against the law in the EU.
---
Bethesda really doesn't give a shit unless it might hurt their bottom line. Did nothing until this post got bigger.
---
Power Fists are actually better than Deathclaw Gauntlets because the Puncturing mod gives them +20% Armor Pen.
---
Just cut your losses dude its game over for you and Fo76; game is trash anyway. Just make sure you square away any issues with your credit card and change any account's password that has the same password as your bethesda account.
---
Look up the GDPR laws in the EU. Don't need lots of cash, Bethesda is breaking the laws in the EU. So the government would be the ones hitting them with fines.
---
I believe I've seen the heavy robot arms in Harper's Ferry. That's the one with the incorrect name, right? Something like "Heavy Robot Right Arms" instead of "Heavy Robot Arms"? I remember finding and using that plan in Harper's Ferry and being relieved when both arms were unlocked.
---
I don't think I've experienced any issues on PC when around legacy weapons, maybe it's because my graphic settings are lower.
---
You're making a fool of yourself. It is an awful perk that should've never been in the game. They use in fights. Abusing it. I've gone in enough circles. You obviously like it or you wouldn't defend it. It objectively an advantage and annoying.
---
It's a Crux perk. When all the high levels run it is a Crux.
---
If it's a very small number, it may be attributed to other things like a corrupted file locally.  Unfortunately, there's not enough that I've seen to go on at all.
---
D√©sordre en Bogue, my fav
---
Except it's possible Bethesda was never involved, the hackers might have faked those.
---
I'd be down for a Hud attachment for helmets
---
I have very real evidence in the fact that recently i went 13 days with basically no actual responses and having to make tickets every day to try to get some sort of response from customer service. Multiple people have been having issues with this. Not to mention the fact that customer service is giving out blatantly incorrect information. I've talked to the community managers and they are going to attempt to get this looked at asap.
---
Nighttime in the Mire is the worst even with the pipboy light.
---
Enemies regenerating their HP. Oh, right...
---
Not brand new (started during Mischief Night), but got a good boost to my [Commando Junkie build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=67c9778&amp;d=es2en0ea0e20eg1pi0ph0pg0p00pp2sb2sg2lu2lt2l71a30a00ao0ar1s71ic2ib3c72c81cu0cm0eh1&amp;w=&amp;m=cf391&amp;nw=&amp;n=Commando%20Junkie). Got her to level 41 before the double XP event ended so I'm well on my way.
---
I basically want to be able to take all the chems and drink all the booze with minimal side effects. Primary weapons will be JE Handmade and JE Combat Rifle along with 4 pcs Vanguards and 1 pc Chameleon once I hit the level req's.
---
Have been running bloodied builds (melee and commando) for months, so being able to play with a full health bar has been a lot of fun. More of a QOL build which should be a nice change of pace from my normal min/max approach.
---
In most of the cases where someone‚Äôs account gets hacked, it‚Äôs due to them falling victim to a phishing scheme. There‚Äôs a good chance that both of the emails you got initially weren‚Äôt actually from Bethesda. Did you click the links on either email to change your Bethesda password?
---
Sucks that Bethesda won‚Äôt help you recover your account, but it was preventable
---
Haha, cheers mate! That's really great though, will defenitly try this.
---
the refund is because they lied when they said they would deliver a complete game when in fact you receive a uncomplete game
---
Frog Legs: I found out, this weekend, that you can use the points you get from duplicate cards, to buy cards you don‚Äôt have.  I‚Äôm NW level 50...and just bought it in game for 10 points.
---
At the bottom of the screen where you view the perk cards is an option to ‚Äúsee unowned cards‚Äù or something like that. 
---
Now I have Frog Legs.
---
Edit: Thanks ‚Äúbender‚Äù üëç
---
Wow I totally forgot about Evan.
---
I run with the high levels. I can count on one hand the high levels that use a build based on Demo and Frog Legs. Most of us consider it distasteful and pathetic. Mack personally recommends the Commando build to people he takes under his wing. Why you're complaining about a Demo build here is beyond me. Go watch his gameplay. Snipers and Automatic rifles.
---
Yep. Everyone can get it.
---
Idk man I've seen my fair share of incomplete games and this one is definitely not one of them.
---
They're removed some of the atoms from some challenges and replaced them with items. Also apparently there's a bug with NW completing atom challenges for you but you not receiving the rewards.
---
But yeah, short answer is yes.
---
Thats a core feature. Its always done that.
---
Mine is Berkeley Springs Station.
---
Someone else here posted a chem combination that would result in 6 rads/sec. Do you know how much rads/sec a hazmat gives?
---
You just said it yourself.... We agree frogger and explosive is pathetic. If he or anyone uses frogger at all in a fight to dodge is pathetic. I shoot them while hidden once and they weeeee jump away. Really don't know what has you riled up. NW would be better without it.
---
Hahaha wth is bush wookie
---
Fuck dude do you not know what melee is
---
They released a patch that broke the PLAY button on PC.
---
There's unimplemented lore in Tanagra, likely connected to the mythical creature/lore in Lucky Hole Mine. There are a few places you can visit with the giant metal heads and weird turtles drawn in chalk.
---
In time that I played I went fro 0 - 32 on the new character maybe 3 or 4 levels on one of my other toons I play regularly
---
Nuke Winter bush hiding
---
I haven't and won't play it.
---
Good luck getting the strangler bloom for radshield! Super hard to find lol
---
If they did that I would have to spend a good portion of my time shutting off wasteland radios.
---
Very poor spelling notwithstanding, you are wrong. If an account is stolen on PSN, they don't ban the account. They ask for proof of ownership and can get it back to you very quickly. I searched and found no proof of Sony banning accounts because someone said they were stolen. I found some people having a hard time getting them back, but just as many that had it back within hours.
---
And, no, they can't "sur" Bethesda either, but not because of some shady deletion of accounts. Because no one would ever bring a case of someone suing over a video game account to court. Plus, it's in the ToS agreement you agreed to by playing the game and signing up for an account. They aren't liable because someone stole your account. 
---
Now, what will Bethesda actually do? Well, it looks like he waited 2 months to follow up on a stolen account. Which, support would see this and the ticket probably expired or could have been lost. To assume they banned the account like "your friend" had happen to "them" is ridiculous.
---
You signed an agreement saying that you wouldn‚Äôt be compensated for server downtime. I would have deleted the ticket as well.
---
Disease cures are easy enough to make. Low endurance exposes you to disease, as does RadAway. However, the Disease resistance perks do help. I've run without them for a long time, but added them recently cuz I had extra points to use due to SPECIAL changes required for NW. They helped.
---
Evan haunts my fucking dreams. Lol.
---
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES AND HECK YEAH!
---
There may be some changes lately that slow atoms from challenges down, but as long as they don't bring back "Take 15 selfies with every kind of insect" or "Punch a scorched enemy in a nuke zone while not wearing armor, clothing, or power armor while at least 3 other people are watching" challenges, then I won't complain.
---
If only the Mechanist could reach him up thereü§ñ
---
I mass produce antibiotics and sell them. It‚Äôs how I‚Äôm able to find my lavish lifestyle
---
Junkies has become a popular build these days. Having full health has a ton of benefits. I haven‚Äôt been able to max it out like some others. I‚Äôd have to sit down with pen and paper to see what chems/ withdrawal to compile. The negative side I‚Äôve seen is that you run out of chems.  But that‚Äôs coming from some one who doesn‚Äôt pvp which I do. I think with this build I won‚Äôt be doing pvp with it as much but it‚Äôll be a commando build to farm with instead of my heavy build. Basically with my pvp toon I have to always switch perks around depending on what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Not at al, I don't know the name, but there's this chemical plant, usually has super mutants I believe. It's where you completed the radshield quest. Om the Shore of the rivier are a lot. Like 7-9, times two if you have the perk.
---
it contains the Limbic system ??!
---
Not at all, I don't know the name, but there's this chemical plant, usually has super mutants I believe. It's where you completed the radshield quest. On the Shore of the river are a lot. Like 7-9, times two if you have the perk.
---
I was in there about 20 mins ago...on pc
---
I'm on PS4 and have had this happen, but not as often as it used to.
---
There was a period of time a few months back where I had to consciously not open my stash, deal with the vendor, open the legendary vending machine, or basically do anything for a few moments after fast traveling into Whitespring Station else the game would shit the bed. It was horrible!
---
I don't usually even attempt Project Paradise, but my experience for Uranium Fever is very opposite as you. It's not wave after wave but I definitely have to move from extractor to extractor constantly.
---
Campfire Tales needs to come up more often I agree! It is one of my favorite events.
---
If you are on PC use "E" instead of enter/click, not trying to invalidate your post, because this bugs exists, but the only time I have had fast travels problems since I use "E" is in when I the first seconds I just loaded to a server.
---
You got me... Keep on doing what your doing.
---
I just want dailies that are more than 10 atoms (or the occassional 20 atoms)
---
Use E instead of click
---
that‚Äôs what mines doing right now. it has been for a couple months
---
Hahahahaha. I played that game when it first came out but then realized it payed off to be more strategic offensively then defensive because I found it was easier to get kills catching people off guard and get in their face. That being said I still die hahaha. But the times I got those 7+ kills were some tense moments
---
wow.... well good thing is you won't purchase anymore of their products in the future sounds like they dont deserve it... fuck em...
---
Im on PS4, so E isnt gonna help me much unfortunately...
---
The one and only time I attempted Project P was after a time triple nuked Prime and then bounced to Arktos, so I followed them to a full success.
---
Sad how posts like this are top of the reddit forum on a monday. Come the fuck on BGS!
---
Dyer chemical up by harpers ferry. Yeah the plants usually dont bloom and you end up harvesting just strangler pods which are of no use
---
Nukacrypt has a database of all weapons and how the various mods affect the stats. For example, the 10 mm pistol can be found [here](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/10mm). The AP cost modifiers seem to be the same as for other weapons I checked.
---
Looking for aids? I‚Äôd recommend the correctional facility.
---
Fix Jet pack please BGS!
---
you don't want "aids" items bro
---
This would be useful too where, if something is in displays, like bears, and you log in where your camp isn't available and say "whatever, let's play", you can accidentally get those things auto-scrapped because they aren't "protected" anymore.  I assume same thing for whatever's normally in your vendors.  A lot of the time the only reason I hop to a server where my camp can be placed is to avoid accidentally destroying all my stuff because I know I'll be crafting or repairing a bunch, or may have to.
---
Hmm, hopefully it's just the servers I've been in then because in the last two weeks UF has been pretty slow. Glad it's not slow for everyone though, gives me hope üòä
---
Same with Campfire Tales, I love it, hopefully in the future we get some new Tales!
---
I saw a guy selling ultracite jet pack for 50 caps, either he‚Äôs stupid, generous or has no sense of economics
---
Jet packs hardly sell at all. They are uncommon drops from SBQ. I have a few of each for 1c and they dont sell lol
---
not sure if your on PC or xbox but you can get gamepass for $1 right now and outer worlds is on that
---
Me too, Just yesterday I was just waiting for my 15 second ft timer to count down, it got to about "6" and just went away. I didn't get hit or tap Esc or anything, it just decided to end itself. Really strange bug.
---
Spoiled meat and propaganda poster. Toilet paper is too valuable.
---
Its actually a knoen process i didnt state this was recent this was around a year after ps4 launch, im sure they dont ban every account any more just saying companies are known to do it sometimes. Like microsoft did it with one of my accounts after it got stolenbut that was during the 360 era. So it does happen
---
I would even be happy if the 3* legendary enemies i killed didnt instantly despawn or fall through the map
---
I have a pretty expiranced crew and we have not been able to complete melt down or washout on expert. Unfortunately they are very difficult and there is not room for someone to just tag a long on any raid but dead in the water
---
I hope you can find a team, just wanted to let you know. Not trying to be rude
---
As pain in the area as those thing were, they were (Mostly) Simple, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Targets.
---
Not sure what changed but mine got better a few weeks ago. I'm on the East Coast of the US, so maybe BGS is using more Amazon servers closer to me than before, or they actually patched something... not sure, but I used to blue screen (PS4 blue screen, not PC) every 30 minutes or so. Adding intentional pauses to my play style when I went to Whitespring Station helped, but certainly didn't resolve it.
---
It got to the point where I could sense when it was going to happen. Things would get slow or jenky and then freeze before crashing.
---
Hopefully whatever update they are rolling out tomorrow helps with stability
---
yes, after 50 you can choose additional perk cards. You also have the option to move a SPECIAL point instead. Every 5 levels you also get a card pack
---
Do you have any other button that you use to confirm actions/shoot/jump?
---
I'm PC we are using the button to interact/pick things instead of left click. Give it a go, it may work :)
---
More opportunities to get atoms in game in general would be nice. Endgamers have already gotten all the Atoms via challenges already. Just  doing the dailys isnt much...
---
Sometimes I get XP and no loot. Other times, I get loot and no xp. I am just glad to not die right at the end and not be able to respawn...
---
Exactly
---
That's weird, I saw a lot of blooms. But i only went like 2 times, and there was a LOT of time between them. I Almost never use radshield, probably because they're such a drag to make.
---
I love how this is still very much a thing!
---
I have just started playing again and need to revive someone in water to finally get my glorious backpack. If anyone on PS4 could help me get a revive I would appreciate it. My PSN is VaultFreak and I am online now.
---
What's strangler armour?
---
But they aren't doing that.  Not even close.  They are admitting to a mistake and giving people more time to EARN the rewards.  They still have to earn 14k xp the same way you did.  It's still a monster grind if you don't like NW. They aren't being given anything for free.
---
This extra time takes nothing from those who have already done the challenges.  If anything its bragging rights you did it in 5 days instead of 10.
---
It was a myth that people on your friends list could join your "private" server was it? Because that happened to my friend and was all over the internet so I'd love a confirmed source saying everyone was just inventing a hoax.
---
I usually get between 50-200 per week with dailys and weeklys but I am casual.
---
Not playing the game.
---
Nope. Just "X" and a pop up to confirm. It bites. I might fiddle around with rerouting another key and see if that works.
---
I can guide you through the silo.
---
Omg... No the myth was that you were getting recycled used servers that had already been looted.
---
I picked one up off a random paper bag yesterday and it initiated the quest. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs easy to replicate but it‚Äôs possible.
---
Hmmm... never heard or experienced the legacy one! Strangler is definitely noticeable.
---
They dont compensate for down-time lol. MMO's would be in a world of hurt if they all had to
---
I used [yabs junkie guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/) to map out the addictions I wanted to get. I've accumulated enough Junkies weapons to be able to start my addictions at level 10, and then add one more each 10 levels until I get to level 50 with 5 addictions. In the end I plan on getting addicted to Mentats (-1Chr), Med-X (-1Agi//-10DR), Psycho (-1Str//-10DR), Daddy-O (-1Per//-1Int), and Daytripper (-1Chr//-1Luck) which spreads the negative effects out pretty evenly.
---
Nice, i was hoping you still get perk packs cause i accidentally pit a special point towards the right attribute but not the right perk and i was hoping i didnt have a limited amount of picks and those are the cards im stuck with at lvl 50. If you know what i mean, kinda confusing lol
---
Love it. I wish you luck on your next endeavors in PvP. Don‚Äôt hate on someone with a good build! They can teach you a lot even if you don‚Äôt end up using the same stuff as them!
---
Okay? But we're talking about how according to you "private servers arent really private" is a false and misleading title. 
---
So either "Private servers arent really private" is an accurate title to use, as I believe it is, or you have some concrete evidence that disproves that? 
---
Or did you not mean to use the example "Private servers arent really private" and meant to have a go at titles like "Private servers are just recycled ones". 
---
I think you're a bit confused here?
---
I had an issue with Blizzard two days ago not responding then doing nothing to resolve my issue. Then deleted my ticket. Blizzard is a fuckhead of a company man
---
Aaaaaaaaand this is why I'm not, nor ever buying FO76!
---
You could try to get lucky with rads or buy the recipes from the Enclave bunker.  However, I would recommend finding a player shop that sells serums.  Serum shops are fairly common at this point.  People usually sell them for 299-400 caps each.  I sell mine for 299 but that is rather low.
---
You get plans from completing raids for it. The only power armor with a legendary effect. It does acid damage to your enemies. It looks awesome and is super hard to get due to the special resources needed and the difficulty of the raids. It‚Äôs been known to create some serious lag and even crashes however.
---
I too believe we need greater support for other religions in the game. I herald your support for Pastafarianism

I leveled my Alt character 10 levels by crafting tons of stuff I acquired on my main. Only did one quest on my alt after I was done crafting!
---
I dont actively do them, but the rest of my friends do, and for as much time as we put into the game it would be nice to get a bit more. Especially since the game is still practically in BETA.
---
I appreciate the advice this is the third time l changed builds Im lvl 327 double xp just makes it a little faster... just replying to the ? thats all .... change just gives you something extra to do in game
---
Yeah... ever have this sequence of events happen?  "Yay, this enemy has 2 (glowing mass/hardened mass/high-rad fluids)" --- \*get smacked by a scorched or some other goof before being able to grab anything\* --- after the fight back, you have no clue how many steps you took from the previous body or in what direction, there go the ingredients you were happy to see.
---
This probably is no big deal for people who do a lot of nukes but I'm still between the "can survive the SBQ" and "launch a nuke myself" part of the game, so, I rely on being around when those SBQ events happen to get my supplies, and it stings to lose out on anything.
---
The greatest fun is that it practically never works when leaving certain daily quest locations, like FTing from VTU after handing in scorchbeast DNA. I take it as the game reminding me to check the gym across the hall for lead, but still...
---
I believe its 90. Armor plated gives 91 for whatever reason but lead lined and the energy one I cant remember the name of give 90, while the high capacity reduces energy resist and rad resist
---
Fort Defiance has quite a few med kits in it. However, for lower levels they‚Äôll need them right away.
---
One violent night event drops a fair amount
---
Congrats Mack! Every time i see you in my match you are dropping people left and right!
---
im confused..
---
Im going to get it on PC but my PC doesnt meet the requirements for the xbox app.
---
Yeah I wish I could but im going to wait for black friday/cyber week and see what pops up.
---
Yes with the perk and a lead lined back you'll be up over 200 approaching 300 so it would be minimal. The resistant backpacks gives 90 each but reduce carry weight down to 30 and the high capacity gives 120 carry weight but reduces energy and rad resist by 60

I thought i was the only 1 üòÇ

Almost all Christmas songs are public domain, they could easily do it

He is no troll. 
---
Giving you the benefit of the doubt. You bought a game, who knows when but considering if you purchased it a short while ago, you should've surmised you might not like it from the negative press, if you purchased it a long time ago you should've known you didn't like it. 
---
AND YOU STILL INVESTED MORE MONEY INTO IT!!
---
You probably want all the atoms you earned in game converted into cash and given back too. (Now that last part was a troll)
---
Imagine a horde of these like how Feral Ghouls run around with each other.
---
Well, we‚Äôll pay for it upfront but later make the Scorched pay us back!
---
aussie aussie aussie, oi oi oi!!!

Give Perception a Sniffer/Looter perk that highlights dead bodies, with higher levels increasing the luminosity of dead bodies/meat piles/dropped loot bags.
---
It‚Äôs just lighting fyi

Thanks good idea
---
Ok thanks
---
I'd be happy with even a chem.

Berry Mentats highlights living entities

Cranberry Mentats highlights dead entities

Do you listen to the pipboy radio? I was getting a couple of crashes a day on pc while using consumables from the pip boy, favorites wheel, or hotkeys and saw someone mention the radio as a possible cause.
---
I have been playing with it off for the last couple of days and it's still a little too soon to tell for sure that it's fixed it, but I haven't crashed since.
---
Awesome thanks for the info.
---
I‚Äôd like it if they all became meat humps 100% of the time after a kill.
---
Ghouls drop a lot of radX and radaway, sometimes chems and stims. I assume you mean containers to use Pharma Farma, though, I'd say Watoga emergency services building and AVR medical center have a good bit of containers, so does Flatwoods area actually... Really, if you're wanting something specific, I'd just visit player vendors and you can get the shit you want most of the time for a good price.
---
read the forum rules.
---
You are not allowed to trade here
---
im good thnx.
---
yes, but don't worry, they are cheaper than ever if only you buy their shitscription
---
Yeah, I just went through there yesterday and forgot all about this, definitely a decent spot
---
That explains it, always tried shooting the enemy with it. Like that episode of Archer.
---
I appreciate you, and your creative name.
---
The *compositions* for songs that were written before I believe 1924 are public domain, although that leaves out a lot of the more popular ones that were written in the 40s and 50s ("Blue Christmas", "I'll Be Home For Christmas", "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Clause", "Blue Christmas", et al). That's just the compositions though: recordings are handled separately, and almost none of them are public domain. So if Bethesda wanted to hire a band to perform "Deck the Halls", they could, but they'd have to license a Bing Crosby song.
---
Use that money in other places.
---
It is better because we know how to work around the bugs?
---
I wouldn't say that I missed it. I uninstalled the game a few months ago. Not trying to stir up anything, it was just unplayable for me. I do a drive-by here every few weeks hoping to see that the game is miraculously fixed, and decided to comment this time.
---
This glitch gets magnified during SBQ fights.  If the server is laggy you'll erupt into the sky as high as the SBQ.  Don't be like me and test how high you can go.  I hit the top of the world map faaaaar above the SBQ and burnt through 8 fusion cores in 30 seconds.
---
It was very unstable at launch and there were many bugs like any Bethesda game...made more annoying because the community couldn‚Äôt fix them due to it being online.
---
I really enjoyed it for a few months though, despite the bugs (like almost bugs, there were workarounds and they just became habit) and got to level 178 on my first character before I lost interest (just farming for legendaries at whitesprings was all there really was to do at that point tbh), though the fact my character was a god meant it was too easy as well.
---
Also, the story wasn‚Äôt worth going through again straight away as there was no possible difference like previous titles (new Vegas in particular and FO4...FO3‚Äôs story was rubbish.)
---
It was a buggy mess, but a fun one, and like all Bethesda games recently didn‚Äôt have as much to do as previous titles like Morrowind.  (The map is honestly on par with Morrowinds map in term of how unique the different parts of the map are though)
---
So I put the game down.  All the hate for fallout first made me come back and start a new character lol.  This time a pistol build, and I am having a ball because it is so much more challenging, as I can‚Äôt rely on sneak if I want to do as much damage as possible.  My character is a glass cannon, has two bloody weapons (well three of you include the pipe pistol/rifle.::but that started the whole stealth sniper route again so I put the gun down), a six shooter and a black powder pistol and packs a really big punch, one shotting most enemies with the six shooter and demolishing scorchbeasts with the black powder pistol, but is very susceptible to die easily despite having serendipity (especially to freaking acid attacks).
---
It‚Äôs much more enjoyable now and I haven‚Äôt crashed once OR had a bug since returning OUTSIDE of the fast travel bug now and then where you have to do it twice before it works.
---
So, to me, the hate was and is, largely, unwarranted, and I find spending too much time here lessens the enjoyment.  There are a number of people here who clearly don‚Äôt play the game, and some who have never played at all.  Yet they still spend their time hating on the game and Bethesda for hours on end for some reason.  I don‚Äôt understand what they get out of it.
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate because it then makes you view legitimate complaint posts or posts about issues the player is experiencing with a large amount of skepticism.
---
I‚Äôm not listening to anything on Pip-Boy
---
I'm with you on this one. Even some folk I know that love every Fallout haven't even tried this yet. They always laughed... They're houses now smoulder...
---
Paradise is easy enough if you have enough people who know what to do.    
---
I think the main problem with paradise these days is it's part of the public event system so you never know when it will pop up and thus can't really plan for it or be prepared for it.  
---
But in any event my main tips:
---
* Know the biomes.  Toxic sludge spawns exactly 2 molerats each time you collect it from the ground - kill these and search them as they have a chance to spawn more sludge and know it can take a couple seconds for the bonus mat to spawn after you search the corpse.
---
* For Venison speed is the key and also having a wide search radius.  Some of the mobs spawn off in corridors adjacent to the area so don't get tunnel vision and only focus on the big open area.  Get the mats in the hopper ASAP as it seems to speed up collection.
---
* rad kelp is similar to above: make sure you are searching every nook and cranny as there's a lot of out of the way spawn location
---
* For all the biomes I'm not 100% but it seems like the faster you get mats in the hopper the faster they respawn and thus the better your chances of a rank 2 or 3 friendly.
---
In a perfect world you would have at least 2 people in each biome ready to rock BEFORE you initiate the quest.  This is probably the #1 reason for failure: early start will result in low level friendlies that will get massacred fast.  You really need to start collecting mats in all 3 biomes the very instant the quest starts.
---
As for uranium fever it's just kinda hit or miss.  Sometimes it's a flood of mole miners, other times it's a snooze fest.
---
They clearly are not on support tickets all day either.
---
Also happens with the cargobot drop crates in the Morgantown Airport event.
---
Only those things are actually solid so if they pop up inside your camp inside your building with vendors you're unable to get to your vendor sometimes.
---
Thankfully it is only for you, anyone else can walk right through them, won't even see them.
---
Yeah thats sure as hell what it sounded like to me. I‚Äôm willing to be he put in all his info into a phishing dummy site and they used that themselves to ‚Äòrecover‚Äô the account from Bethesda, so they deleted all his support shit because they thought *he* was a hacker.
---
That makes sense. Still kinda lame the make a bundle end just before the date when the atoms go into our account lol.
---
I do that too. I‚Äôll just try to hop out of one of those pesky trenches, tap the triangle button (PS4) to marsupial hop, and BOOM get launched into geostationary orbit. Lol..... But it it doesn‚Äôt eat up my fusion cores like you said.
---
So Bethesda not actually doing anything until publicly outed for doing it?  Sounds like the a normal day in Bethesda.
---
Bah! Humbug!
---
Playing JFO
---
What kinda things are you looking for? Pharma Farma Perk card can gain you extra when looting boxes. But if you're after particular things you might be better crafting them. Solutions brought to you by Vault-Tec. ;)
---
Just because he wasn't a dick doesn't mean he was cool with you. Some people don't feed the trolls. Others people bring a bag of troll food and a bat.
---
this though I think it does increased "limb damage" to the head which can blind enemies, causing a large accuracy penalty.
---
This is my main farming way.  As long as I'm not buring through chems or stim packs, I usually walk out of there with a nice stash of both.
---
You're partially correct, but the issue is terminology more than anything. "Ban" is usually taken to mean "permanent ban, account is never able to be used again", while what the companies actually do when an account is reported as stolen/hacked is an "account lock" - no changes are able to be made to the account info, and it can't be logged in, while they work on processing who owns the account and restoring anything that was done maliciously/fraudulently.
---
Not really.  What I can say is that HazMat, along with Power Armor, "cheats" in terms of Rad Resist.  They have a hidden buff that goes beyond that.  They say they do 1,000.  But even if you manage to get your RR up to 1,000 through other means, it still won't be as effective as PA or HazMat.
---
Also, RadShield isn't the easiest thing to come by in the first place.
---
just the mistress of mysteries garbage
---
You're welcome.
---
I was doing the same. Lol.
---
Daily quests give a lot of stims, purified water, etc
---
It must be the easiest job in the world being the community manager for Bethesda. You get paid to sit on your ass all day, posting selfies on Instagram, and never actually managing the community.
---
It is, for the ones who take their job seriously.
---
berry mentats highlight living creatures.  even if there was another mentat that highlighted dead ones or something
---
No, I don't really dabble in the mutations RN.
---
I'll just be running around and randomly try to jump and instead of leaving the ground I will just slam down and it sounds just like landing in PA.
---
I've got a bad feeling about this.
---
this.  you can craft higher level variants of basic weapons and armor you know the plans for, but you cannot increase the level of existing items.
---
The only case this is a bummer is for legendary items.  like if you got some "god tier" item but it was only lvl 25, that wouldn't be super amazing at lvl 50+ and there's no way to boost it up.
---
I don‚Äôt support Blizzard anymore because I don‚Äôt like commie scum and Winnie the Pooh is the shit.
---
happy cake day
---
dude thats awesome, I literally just posted the same thing about berry mentats and if we just had another.  I agree with this
---
I don‚Äôt doubt people experience these issues but I e had nothing but smooth sailing in scorchbeast Queen fights since starting again a few weeks ago.  
---
Even with 10+ players all there and at least 8 go nuts with their heavy weapons and few sporting the strangler power armour.  
---
It‚Äôs run as smooth as silk on my PS4 pro and on my dodgy Australian non NBN internet connection, AND I connect to the router using wifi lol.
---
I am really lucky I know but it makes me question for PC users what their hardware is, what their internet connection is like, what their router and firewall setup is like and so on.
---
For console users I wonder if it‚Äôs their internet or router or if their console is just dying, or, if the game is too much for older console versions.
---
If anyone is going to have issues it should be me, and when I was playing at launch I did, like everyone else.
---
I wonder if the different server farms around the world have different levels of performance and different levels of traffic hitting their virtualised SANS
---
You know what's worse then a Scorchbeast body following you? A QUEEN SCORCHBEAST body following lmao
---
That‚Äôs......... weird üòÇ
---
Any place with a medical centre. For instance. there's a medical centre just a little south-east of Charlston. The green building next to the Charlston Landfill workshop.
---
Thats mostly wat i meant but i guess i should have explained it a little more. Oh well my B
---
Starched Genes üëåüèª

I have no idea what they do day to day. There's like, what, 5-6 that I'm aware of and I only ever really see from 1-2 regularly, Valseek and Ladydevann. Lonevaultwanderer I see occasionally the few times a year they stream on Twitch and that's it.
---
There are only so many reports that you can write up for management and dev leads to ignore.
---
I had three follow me the other day now that I think about it and they all had three star legendaries...I didn‚Äôt remember tagging them during the SBQ fight but there you go.
---
Thankfully they only followed me once.
---
Nope. But when you scrap and learn mods. So early level, scrap all the guns and armor you find, you'll gain scrap for doing so (even more with Scrapper Perk card) and you'll learn mods that you can attach to any weapon/armor of the same type.
---
-
---
Every 10 levels you'll be able to use a weapon of the same level. Some are 5, 15, 25 etc. Others 1, 10, 20 etc. Max is 45/50.
---
 \&gt; So does that mean that every time someone mentions poor performance the  two CMs that exist here have to drop everything they're doing
---
What are they dropping exactly? They barely post anything in an official capacity.Are you asking if they should drop what they are doing, to help the community they manage? They aren't dropping anything. This is part of their job. What is it, you think they are doing? Community managers exist to help the community. If that means forwarding a customers issues to the appropriate people, they do it. Many many games forums are filled with CMs helping community members with CS issues.
---
You know nothing about what a CM does.
---
if u jump up to shoot an explosive wep and this happens ur done for its so shit!
---
Haha! I have gotten just about everything I want from the shop for free.
---
I would like them to fix a few of the older challenges though.
---
Kill big Enemies (SBQ will not register at death)
---
Collect plants ( swamp plant no longer exists)
---
Both 80 atoms
---
This, at least I think so.
---
I have so much junk now it‚Äôs hard to tell.  I haven‚Äôt had my favourited toys scrapped for lead yet and I‚Äôm always low on lead, and acid.
---
That bug comes all the way from fucking Skyrim with the dragons. At least, I think it‚Äôs the same bug. If it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs very similar.
---
It's funny to think that down for an hour might only be negligeble pennies to the individual but when it effects several hundred thousand people it can add up really quick.
---
Pal had the same happening; cleaning up friendlist helped *a lot*. Do try it out.
---
&gt;You really need to understand the context you're in before you start spouting off opinions about how things are and should be!
---
You are literally making shit up. And doubling down.
---
Next time that starts happening, don't let go of the jump button, you'll see what I mean.
---
Speed Demon+lots of overland travel+long play sessions has made this a pretty significant issue for me, personally. Well over a dozen freezes in the last couple months. Happens with both hotkeyed items and items consumed from the pip-boy. Food, drinks, chems, meds... anything consumable can trigger it. The last culprit for me was a magazine.
---
Has happened to my teammates, too. Sounds like you've been lucky.
---
I'm still filling it. I'll let you know.
---
gator claws my guy. even if its just one in a sewer in the mire.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt have unstable isotope lol.
---
They give up after a while.
---
Regular police officer uniform works as well. That's been my go to "Responder Gear" for the last few months.
---
You talk to the manager. Because it's a physical store.
---
I had an issue after having my original copy for fallout 4 stolen where the replacement copy I got would not read my save file.
---
Both Bethesda and Sony played the blame game with each other refusing to take ownership or even look at the issue.
---
Turned out Best Buy sold me a non-US region copy as my second copy, so I had to repurchase it again through the playstation store to get my save working again.
---
Bethesda support is a joke!
---
I wish these hidden buffs were just plainly discribed. Apparantly so. Guess I had luck with my strangler blooms. The 2 times I went there, I found a lot. Stil have around 25 or so.
---
Nope.  Just randos talking to themselves on their headsets.  Sometimes in English.
---
All it mentions is 'several issues' and 'stability improvements.' So basically, nothing will be fixed. If it were, they'd be more specific about what's being fixed/improved. I don't even trust that they're fixing minor stuff. They just put that stability and performance stuff there to make it look like they're trying, with no way for is to know if and what they're working on.
---
Was waiting for someone to mention this lol.
---
The Super Happy Free Friends from Happyniceville, and your name would be Best Friend.
---
I don't know anything about servers but this only seems to be an issue on public servers for me. Events on private sessions have been spawning full waves in every event I have done. With Project Paradise in private so many radstags spawn that I've been able to get the rank 3 deathclaw every time, while on public I can barely get to rank 1.
---
I don't know how, but maybe the load on public servers is corrupting the amount of spawns.
---
BTW I read that the original menu music is returning in the patch tomorrow.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
As you continue to try to troll me lol stop riding dick and move on.
---
how much should i sell them for? been selling them for 10c each
---
I've ran with people that dont use mics you wont be the only one plus a lot of female gamers stay silent since creepers gonna creep and all
---
Oh I totally agree, Proj P is pretty easy, especially if you switch off the computer and enable the friendlies fo fight and heal but when legit nothing spawns in ANY of the biomes regardless of how quick you get what few mats you can get into the troughs at the very start (if any) it becomes a pain..
---
Just stretched out long enough to fit those precious 3 ads in.
---
beta was awful. Its gotten better and worse over time.  
---
Currently so many issues with lockups its pretty much unplayable.  Had 3 during a single queen fight. These arent minor hangs, they usually last 20-30sec so its pretty game breaking for me.
---
Only PC mod and people don't use it for character to character chatting. It's more like an in-game discord.
---
After a week, tops, you call.
---
Yeah I really have to depend on the flies after a while
---
I‚Äôd love to see more enemy types introduced, even if they are just from previous games. 
---
Obviously these would directly in violation of the existing lore but that hasn‚Äôt stopped Bethesda creating new lore to add them before (see; super mutants, in every game, ever).
---
Gatorclaws.
---
The worms from the western themed section of nuka world.
---
Cazadores (hate me).
---
Roboscorpions (...not really)
---
Um, the underground threat from lonesome rode (it‚Äôs been so long I forget the names :( )
---
Some form of new FEV enemy (like centaurs but definitely not centaurs)...if they are going to add FEV into every game they at least may as well make something interesting.  Perhaps something like the darkspawn ‚Äúmothers‚Äù from the expansion of the first dragon age.
---
Raiders (lol...wastelanders hopefully).
---
The sword is a good mid-game weapon. Not all garbage.
---
Yes they reduced the flow of Atoms by replacing some challenge rewards with items under the guise of helping low level people survive. Honestly, I have never found this game to be a challenge at low levels during all five of my character builds. A cynical person might think that was to encourage sales as this is how many games with MT do things, make the grind frustrating enough for you to get your wallet out. Thankfully I work in marketing and I am fairly immune to such things :)
---
I think he meant he went onto Bethesda‚Äôs site when creating the support ticket and provided that info to prove it was his account.
---
It should be a simple fix: allow you to favorite anything (even not on the wheel) and don't even ask if you try to scrap something favorited--just say "sorry, that item is favorited."  If you want to scrap it, you have to first un-favorite.
---
It sucks you can't favorite anything, and there are only a limited # items you can favorite.
---
I've run into a limited # of items I can favorite.
---
Someone's playing Borderlands...
---
Angry fanboys.
---
I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs damage after her heath bar goes back up that seems to matter (for me).
---
I‚Äôve annihilated her before the regeneration then spent the rest of the fight picking off all the other enemies and got no loot.
---
Next time I did nothing before the regeneration and only out a few clips into her afterwards and got loot.
---
Actually I‚Äôve been playing Terraria lmao
---
Leveled my new character from mid thirties to 78.
---
Makes a big difference.
---
Those bean mentats
---
Same here.  I walk into my camp and all the sudden there is a loud thump on the roof and a dead Scorchbeast is now draped over my house.  It makes for a great picture.
---
You need Fallout 1st Gold Players Club An additional $99.99 a month, but you get private servers that work, AND your support tickets are placed in a pool to selected and answered at random. Rather than being deleted. Also you get a free weapon skin to be determined and distributed later.
---
I would say the beta was pretty bad. The first few months were bad enough to push many of my friends into other games sadly. Characters going invisible, invincible monsters, game crashes (particularly when nukes dropped), and at one point the duping glitches and weight glitches nearly destroyed the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù at the time. It has come a long way though. I cannot wait for wastelanders. Feel like that‚Äôll be make or break for the game‚Äôs future.
---
I'm not sure, but Captainnoob has a video showcasing it: https://youtu.be/8KfvRfBZJ4I
---
A can of PorknBeans should be part of the crafting recipe lol, that and Silt Beans.
---
Just an FYI, I had both my ea and blizzard accounts hijacked (really, really, really stupid password) and part of the recovery process for both was to send them a cc# that I used at least once with those accounts.
---
I sent them an expired cc, which was good enough. I also had to scan my driver's license and send it to them, which seemed odd at the time, but everything worked out and I started using a password manager
---
I've made posts months ago about wanting some kind of chem to highlight dead bodies, hopefully the idea will gain enough popularity to be implemented eventually.
---
Doesn't make it any less scummy lad.
---
And you can can your own beans, spicy beans, fire cap, silt beans and pork and beans- +10% energy dam resistance or something, this bean talk has me excited
---
 \&gt;  There are only so many reports that you can write up for management and dev leads to ignore.   
---
I suppose that's true. They could at least *pretend* that they give a shit.
---
Adding a day of gametime literally costs them nothing.
---
Quick tip: never go full auto.  Short bursts.
---
I've been playing it for almost 600 total hours and have enjoyed about 595 of those hours. I've been frustrated at times due to bugs and glitches, some of which still haven't been fixed, but all in all its a fun game with a lot to offer.
---
Spark Kent aka Dial-El  :D
---
Hey, level 275 or so here. Experienced raider (have my full strangler set n can show my mask) , with lots of god roll weapons. My normal raid crew has petered out lately and I'd love to run it more
---
Not getting my lvl 7 supply crate stash is the first major bug I‚Äôve actually experienced in 500 hours
---
From 370 to 395.
---
I don't think using Frog Legs is pathetic. Using a Demo build is pathetic. Demo builds are for people who have such pathetic aim that they have to have a 30-foot diameter explosive that kills anything in that zone with a single hit. It's no better than an aim bot, an old-style Tesla, or VATS.
---
That being said, when Teslas were being used and abused in NW, a defense was discovered: Frog Legs. By jumping far off the ground, an enemy Tesla became ineffective. As I said, Frog Legs has plenty of roles. If you have trouble shooting a moving target, you need to practice.
---
Bean Mentats:
---
+30% energy damage resistance, Highlights Lootable Entities (bodies, meat piles, loot bags), lasts for 5 minutes.
---
Recipe:
---
Silt Beans x2, Porn n Beans, Fire Cap, Rhododendron x3, Mentats x2
---
Pretty sure there's a magazine that gives you a chance to not consume ammo with heavy weapons
---
That‚Äôs usually what I tend to do
---
Enclave will give you X-01 which is generally the best armor for overall defense. But T-51 has the best damage/energy resistance.
---
Yeah but the legendary effect would make it permanent and available for all weapons.
---
What's your platform? It would help to have as much information as possible so that people can start finding common threads.

For the last time it's bad and no body likes it.

The community manager for my company basically keeps our customer forums and Facebook page clean. Keeps people from fighting in the comments section, tries to keep misinformation from spreading, posts stuff about new product releases, helpful tips, ect. He also goes through to see what people might be having issues with, and gets them a ticket with tech support if necessary. He's also working with the devs constantly on different issues and bringing things to their attention if he needs to. Sure, a lot of the job *is* posting on Facebook and Instagram, but there's behind the scenes work, too.
---
 Far as I'm aware, he isn't in the trenches like the rest of us, but he does have a lot of shit to do, and is actually doing his job. The question, then, is how the community managers for a multi-million dollar gaming company with six times the amount of customers are somehow doing *less* work than a single community manager for a rather niche software company.

Does not compute.

After they kept showing up at my camp uninvited I got a stalking/restraining order. Fixed it.
---
The cores I find are mostly all full, the cap stashes I find always have a good amount, more than 10 ....I wanna say usually around 20? I don't have bottle collector.
---
Why?  There‚Äôs heaps of it everywhere. A run through the bathrooms in Whitesprings will get you a pile of tp if you are looking to collect ;)

Try to have a few different caliber weapon and even a melee one to deal with lower enemies
---
If you appreciate big guns, plasma gatling and laser ones offer cheap / easy to find ammo and can last a very long time
---
you could also make offers on a trade discord to sell gear you find in ammo it's a good way to fix your ammo issue for a long time
---
Sounds like you have a pretty good CM.
---
Part of me thinks Bethesda keeps a tight leash on what their developers and employees can actually say. But even still, the amount these CMs do seems miniscule.
---
Also ore should be highlighted when using excavator
---
you may not see the screen stuttering, but have you seen situations like gathering water, where its massively lagged and it takes several seconds per water gathered. the servers get so slowed up that things are miserable.
---
It sounds like you're bad and you don't like it. You want me to post some videos of people getting ripped apart for using Frog Legs?
---
"Oh no, he's moving vertically instead of horizontally! Whatever will I do??? My gun can only move left and right!!! How unfair! Nerf all the things! There's nothing I can do without Bethesda's help! Curse you, Frog Legs!!!"
---
What does the character stats Page look like in and out of power armor?
