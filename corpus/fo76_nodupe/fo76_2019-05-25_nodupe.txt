They've not reported this fixed yet have they?  
---

---
(I know it's part of their known issues)
---
---
---
No problem. Good luck. Prices on PS4 are less that Xbox or PC so you have that working for you.
---
Did I read correctly they can be placed in workshops? 
---
If so, its like ..... already in game? 
---
Silly. Needed this ages ago.
---
\*nod\*  
---
Posting "new" bugs, but I'll copy that one in, pretty brutal for us melee...
---
i wanna be here before the post gets locked
---
I'd like to see a modest increase to stash to account for vending or allow perk cards to affect stash as well. Whatever we can get away with so long as it doesn't impact server stability or performance.
---
Just check YouTube bro
---
Bethesda screwed up their patching. Again.
---
Will that still trigger the quest for them?  If so, I’m glad I’ve saved a few.
---
Yeah I’ve been waiting at lease 4 days and still no avail
---
Forgot about this one, Thanks!
---
Yeah, the kind that doesn't expire? Hit up all of the shoppettes around the Appalachian trials. Check Watoga tables there's a ton of dog food, cram, fancy lad snacks. Idk how long food lasts in stash but grab the butchers Perk in perception and cook you up some delicious deathclaw steaks for that +2 str or +10 carry weight. Toss in some lemonade or hard lemonade and click that open sign!
---
And assaultron heads
---
That’s me. If I put in all the work I reap the rewards. If you want to show up late that’s fine, but I’m not wasting my time for you.
---
No problem.  I've submitted a bug report on it as well.
---
I ended up scavenging for a new camera. Repaired it, it worked for a few pictures, then suddenly stopped again. Had to find a new camera and start the process over again. Good thing is it seems to be easy to actually find cameras. Maybe try the same thing, see if it works for you
---
I really hate camps at WS, but the traffic is certainly there. 
---
I know that where my camp is is SUPER popular as my camp doesn’t spawn about 70% of the time because someone else is already there. 
---
I’m level 291 and I’ve had same camp location since Level 35. 
---
Southwest on map, north of Sunshine Industrial. There is a junk pile for extraction, on the water, and in nuke protected zone. I run 4 maxed out vending machines there and always have TONS of players checking out my wares and buying crap. But the mini-summary is a HUGE help. Much more than walk-by traffic.
---
Ok well that makes me feel a little better, I was scared I might start losing other pieces.
---
I got a new camera and it worked (for a while. Had to get a new one again) so if it happens to you again just find a new one. First glitch I've encountered in the game though so I'm not too mad about it since the fix is so easy
---
I have clips that it wasn't like that but have your fun. Lmao
---
I have 15. I'll try taking out 5.
---
You’re fun at parties.
---
All the mods work with keywords. Power Armor parts have the keywords "ma_(PA VARIANT)" and "ma_(PIECEMEAL)".
---
 The MA stands for mod association.
---
So a T-60 helmet has ma_t60 and ma_pa_helmet, and mods designated for it will carry those keywords.
---
The X-01 helmet is set up properly, but only 1 of the mods call to both ma_pa_helmet and ma_x01.
---
The others, including the Targeting Hud, do not carry these keywords. Instead, they only call for ma_x01_helmet, which is not assigned to that armor item.
---
Bethesda, this is an easy fix.
---
I’m so f*cking sick of this patriarchy BS
---
Excellent idea!  I’d love to see this implemented.
---
[removed]
---
Hows a freshly minted wasteland warrior going have a 1000 caps?  Lol
---
Stick.
---
Need less nerfs on the baddies. Need more dodgy dodgy.
---
Have you done all the quests to unlock it?
---
In in ps4 have a couple handmades to trade
---
Did you try rebooting your PC? I have an issue where the game drops to like 5 fps at random for no apparent reason. Rebooting always fixes it though.
---
Absolutely nothing! Say it y'all!
---
Agree with the summary part. That determines more than anything if im going to a camp. Even at WS Ill skip a camp i can see if its offerings are garbage.
---
I concur. I’d also like to see a Memorial Day themed item in the Atomic Shop; perhaps with all proceeds going to a charity like the Wounded Warrior Project.
---
the sight ring was my first mod i got when i scrapped a gatling gun
---
*salutes*
---
‘Cause I’d rather somebody go into excruciating detail on this subreddit, bro..... lol, jk. I’ll go to YouTube. 😊
---
Seems to be the same as vendors.
---
Fun fact: Any boss fight someone should bring a cryolator. Scorchbeast queen, Imposter sheepsquach, Regular Sheepsquach, Literally anything with a big bad you should have one with you. Used properly it basically immobilizes the creature. Makes fighting the alpha laughably easy.
---
I just miss the days of the charge up and stagnant beam, now it fucking follows me.
---
Check jug? Or jugs? Not the porn magazine. It’s a YouTube dude. He posted a video about it a few months back.
---
I’d love to see Rose pick up the mic for this.
---
Crafting and scrapping is pretty much the only option. You're gonna need hundreds and it's gonna take forever.
---
Radium rifle mods are the true FO76 end-game.
---
Ok
---
Description sounds amazing. Toss me into the lot for android. Glad to hear you are working on it. Best of luck!
---
You’re welcome, neck beard.
---
Have you not seen GoT?
---
which ones are you willing to trade i would prefer the two shot but i could do the others
---
Or maybe I'm just not dodging enough. Gotta reinstall those darksouls instincts.
---
mine works fine add the secret agent perk. 3 minutes of invisibility? I am all about that
---
Still need help?
---
Finally a reason to update my iOS.
---
What kind of help are you looking for? That my help get some responses.
---
For instance,  I'm primarily solo because I scrounge a LOT. But I don't mind helping someone on some of the missions, though I'm only level 79 and for some reason my build must suck or my weapons because I'm not very helpful during the  big group events. (SBQ, Sheepsquatch, or Project Paradise) 
---
Or being part of a team where we both do our own thing but benefit each other with XP as we make our way around. 
---
But just to pal around Everytime I log in is not my plan of action.
---
Appalachian trials? I haven’t tried watoga yet but thanks for the suggestion!
---
Mistake by Bethesda uploading wrong file. File just happens to be massive.
---
Yeah, I run into them all the time, if you're expecting to be invincible in powah armah you gotta be kidding me. Lol. I strafe left and right and jump and Sprint behind a car as it blows up. It's great. I don't have much fun in a game being invincible to everything 😅 I'm weird
---
That is a fantastic idea. Yes, please.
---
(BUG) Most vending terminals in the Whitesprings Bunker return a "Busy" message when interacted with. This is an ooooooold bug that has been fixed before, and apparently brought back.
---
Yeah lots of the trails lead to picnic areas they usually have tons of canned goods.
---
Did a few, painful grind.
---
Yes please. I have when objects or enemies pop infront of me.
---
I have an assassins one but you probably don’t want that unless you PvP.
---
Same!! Was hitting 4.2k+ at a time because of this and it's WONDERFUL.
---
my ps4 username is joon102201
---
tell me what yours is so I know its you, and btw how much will you sell the two shot for
---
I don't know why they don't make the files be broken up into smaller files for easier access instead of giant junks.
---
Do I have to complete all the Pioneer Scout challenges first?
---
Thanks
---
Players load in where your camp module was originally placed.
---
Lol the one near solomons pond did this for me the other day
---
God rolls are still outside of max caps right now. I don't put any of my nice stuff in vending because I have 19k caps right now and a 15k TSE 3* lever action would only net me 6k in caps.
---
Lots of 308 rounds
---
Yes they are in workshops
---
Yes it's about 20 hours from the first item you traded in the last time u used it
---
Yes, but some, probably most people move the camp module and forget or, build large builds and need to move it
---
No just 3 of them to get  3 badges
---
Hunny we got customers!!!
---
Ok. That makes sense. Thanks.
---
I found that when people were there, too, they didn’t always show up on the map, if they were underground. The mission seems pretty glitchy right now
---
Same when you fast travel to someone’s camp to buy from there vending machine and get stuck in there wall or floor.
---
Add in some drugs, booze, and adrenaline~
---
I feel like it gets harder and harder to get sneak attack critical every patch. Am I making this up?
---
Buy cheap 1* Unyielding crap armor. Then go get radioactive. Instant +15 to charisma when you need it.
---
So you bravely go on Adventure mode where you are safe and kill other players brahmin for 1 piddly piece of meat, you sound so fun and must make a lot of friends. Winning...
---
You can't play this game without easily having more food than you can eat before it rots, this makes no sense.
---
I've been thinking about this for a long time now. I would love to have one that matches the new metal stairs.
---
I'd really like to know their reasoning for keeping it out of the CAMP item set then. I really hope there is something not just "meh they don't need it."
---
I really REALLY would love this. It's what the game needs spice it up a little
---
Take my money!
---
They just don't give a shit
---
It was in during the beta, but got removed. A few players still have them
---
If you're talking about the max level charred or glowing ghouls that are currently in the game right now, I think its entirely fine the way it is. They are not bullet sponges for end game players, but are supposed to be variants that pack more of a punch, so they don't all die immediately..  
---
For just a hypothetical, I think its safe to say that neither really work very well. Because of Vats, AOE/Exploding weapons, hordes of low level ghouls just get killed too quickly to be any sort of challenge. As for just one bullet sponge, that is also problematic for the exact opposite reason. Its not as much that the bullet spongyness of it thats the problem, rather having just one enemy. The cryolator, and cryogenic grenades can either work to pretty much freeze ANY enemy solid (SBQ fight is a joke once she lands and you use it). It basically turns into "Lets all shoot the stationary non-threatening target.   
---
Honestly, the best solution is like it usually is, somewhere in the middle. Having multiple targets is important to avoid cryolator or other disabling effects from trivializing the fight, and they need HP pools to make it so that high damage players can't single-handedly wipe them all out.
---
I’m sorry Ja! [WHERE IS JA](https://youtu.be/Mo-ddYhXAZc)?!
---
Excusable for the first brahmin, not the second
---
https://youtu.be/VpzPUmfv960
---
If you need more help after this and are on PS4, I'd be willing to help you out.
---
..And right after Beth makes this possible, I know where all of my extra things from my stash that puts me over the limit is going for an exorbitant price that noone would dare pay so that I  then have 5 player stashes for each of my characters: my normal stash+each vending machine. Server stability never stood a chance👍👍👍
---
It’s only sad if you take payments in upvotes. +1
---
Ahh... Your complaining about an issue of permanence when the whole game is built around a lack of world permanence.
---
Found one near Watoga coming out of a nuke zone lol
---
I've encountered that one, actually! I put a drum on the Instigating just to make sure that bug wasn't happening. Unless maybe the bug just swaps stats and not mods?
---
You can take couple of plasma or pulse grenades with you, throw it, then target it with vats and shoot when you need for precise explosion
---
This ain't fallout 3 boy, we in West virginny now son!

I'm bookmarking this so I can tell you exactly where to go!  It's near the vault

Cool. Though I’m not sure I want to do it because the ceilings don’t look too sharp. I just want to know how. I’ll check out the link. Thanks :)
---
Small update: logged in Tues/Wed and the quest was not active at all.  Read the poster and it popped back up to the 2/4 completed status.  (probably should have gone directly to Jaggy instead).  Was at Dolly Sods getting pics for the weekly challenge and Stings and Things FINALLY triggered!  I did that and headed over to Kiddie Cabins, but still nothing there.  :(
---
Never heard back regarding my reply.  Got video of me spamming the Helpfulness robot and it not responding for my next ticket. Also, they added Order of the Tadpole to their main tech support page so I submitted a Feedback on that, but "Feedback submissions won't get a response email".  Also brought it up a couple of times on their facebook posts.  :-p  Going to keep trying....
---
If I'd have taken a vodka + fury... :0

Great I have 1 other
---
Sight sucks anyway. Save yourself the weight. A twoshot gatling gun would be wildly innaccurate anyway so go for hipfire or 3rd person view.
---
I suggest Whisky + Psycobuff! Or if you have it, Nuka Dark! Whisky provides the best strength buff for prewar booze a Nukashine can also be added, but I recommend only for the last half of her health bar!
---
This might fall flat because I'm so dang old, but it reminds me of the "about our photographers" things National Geographic used to run.
---

what legendary affect does that give again?
---
This is a guy that had his CAMP raided by griefers before the patch and has a lot of unexpressed rage to work out. 
---
At least he’s stopped kicking his dog.
---
Yes I’ve had this for ages as well it’s annoying seeing all the ground textures glow in the dark.
---
I would say in the event that you can't place your camp those items are just not available but you still own them. If you remove the machine you pick up those items until you place them back in to a machine or your stash.

I have seen someone make a really good looking roof.

Looking for someone who can help me to level up until I'm strong enough to work on my own. I too am a solo player, but seeing that I have only started out, I need help to level up fast so I can play on my own with problems. So would need people who can team up for a bit kill high level monters. 
---
I understand that those who are high levels would be killing the most monsters until I get high enough to help, but I'll help where I can.
---
Not just that, but some floors just not having any shading at all, and being able to see the seems in the ground!
---
Welcome to the wastes. I’ve had absolutely lousy rolls, and then a couple days ago I rolled an assassins sentinel piece. Life is like a box of chocolates...
---
THAT I’d like to see.
---
There's a reason I always camp by a river...
---
I tried psychobuff, and for some reason it brings my damage down compared to when I use fury, but I ought to try whisky next time I see the queen! Thanks!

Shhh. Don’t ruin the dream ;)

That sounds terrifying lol

Ya, I think that's it!! .... it was pretty tense :) ......... Sheep's life bar down to about 10%, Scorchbat circling and I'm almost out of ammo .... ya baby!

Yep (about halfway down the page) [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Automated\_turret\_(Fallout\_4)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Automated_turret_(Fallout_4))

I’m not sure I’ve noticed that but I’ve noticed something around the forest area where textures will go blurry and repeat leaving behind shadows like the dev room does in Fallout 4.
---
There's nothing in the sidebar mentioning discord
---
In addition, having a headset on for hours at a time is possibly, maybe, kinda detrimental to one's hearing.
---
1000 was an example but for a good sale I think it would be a motivator to grind for a couple days especially for a fully modded weapon. I'd probably have lower config packs available because I'm a explorer/crafter

So, what about the Mormons?

TRIPLE XP.
---
I dont farm legendaries, but one Paradise run and one white spring run your going to have the 150 no problem.
---
Hadn't thought of it that way, but I would also like to say they should have cap limits on items. I think its crazy people are paying for items with real money or that people charge anywhere from 10k-100k worth of caps for items. It makes me worry about humanity. We are playing a video game that is based on the post nuclear apocalypse and people are profiting from the game. Wonder what they would do if it were to really happen. All of us are fighting for the survival of the human race yet they want to do nothing for their fellow man but take advantage of them and make a profit. But then again that's a whole different discussion isn't it.
---
Well that's hilarious, I didn't realize they were a thing in FO4 either.
---
Trading discords and sub reddits exist, go there dude.

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

I don’t remember ever having it that bad haha. But this lightning file they updated today didn’t solve the issue that’s a stone cold fact.
---
I loaded into a paradise, the alpha spawned, and was killed, all while i still couldn't see any loaded in mobs.  I could see where all the players were shooting, and just shot in the same spot.  Shortly after it was killed the dead body popped in.  It was unlootable :/
---
Ps4 if you delete it in game it will still be in the game folder in the media viewer

Its a spear, not a halberd or polearm.

I've got a cryolator that only does 36 damage. So you slow'em down, and then heal it with the gamma gun.
---
You've not seen a martial arts film, have you?
---
Shit. Sorry man.
---
Yo that's a dope picture
---
Death during these types of events is a total crap shoot. I did the new event once. Died and couldn’t respawn after killing kits of trash and doing significant damage to the legendary that was up. We completed the event but I couldn’t respawn to get any loot, AND since I had to crash the game I lost my junk too. So that’s nice. This is exactly why I don’t do sheepsquatch or sbq anymore and I will not be doing this event either. 
---
Fix your shit if you want people to keep playing. After work and I get the kids fed and in bed I have like 2 hours to play Xbox maybe. I can do something fun, or I can play a stupid event that takes a ton of stimpacks and then I get nothing due to bugs. Guess which one I’m going to do.
---
Check it out. You might be surprised.
---
Seems risky. Theres also a way to turn the robots on your side and they will heal the friendly creatures between waves.
---
You realize each workshop has its own resources.. so when you build things, if it's showing up as green in the components, it's the workshop resources and not your own?  
---
Also, this would be a huge tax on the servers, and I think they'd be better off implementing permanent camps instead since the vending update, but they more than likely won't be able to do that anyway because of limitations.
---
See the problem with the limit for people like me who usually only get four hours a week in one session is that you can easily get that 150 in about two hours of doing one paradise run and one whitespring run. Id just like to see 200 limit so you can get two weapon rolls a day instead of 1.1 roll a week sucks.
---
A quest that allows us to build an insult bot and then select random people on the server to insult. Can't do another insult until the bot gives his and comes back with the reaction like how the guys at the school designed it. We could finish their research for them.
---
Blueprints Exist, Use them. blueprint things you don't want to manually build again, and you're done.  
---
Also contractor perk + the resources that are there when you get there are plenty to build a ton of stuff

resources also return to the workshop over time.

I'd get sick of hearing his voice.

---
Yes they are and they have a valid reason for being so they used satellites to communicate with the west coast chapter that got created around when the bombs fell actually on october 20 2077 when Roger Maxon chose to desert from the army with his men.. Synths havent been invented yet so there wouldn't be a faction to free them and the minutemen only rose to prominence when they successfully defended diamond city from a super mutant attack in 2180.
---
Dupe wipe?

You could make Modus do that and for each creature it lights up downstairs in the Lab in the Bunker.
---
I translated the audio files from xbn (I think) to mp3s so I can listen whenever I WANT. Yes, I have it on my phone and listen to it pretty often when driving, lol.

With player vending I run a Toy Store and I'm getting a notion of wearing my Santa costume and running around giving people teddy bears and toy cars
---
It's a good ifldea but someplayers would scoop them up and resell at a higher price. I like to look for low level players on the map drop some good level 1-5 weapons then leave. 
---
So if your low level and you see a high level player don't run honestly we want to hook you up with items. We do not want to kill you
---
I wouldn't understand why, we bought them straight from the traveling responder bot. Unless they're wiping them all out?
---
When I get back on later I'll try to get a snapshot of it.
---
Time to find my iPhone.. I know I put it somewhere. Lmao. Great job! I'll happily support this, can't wait for the Android release!
---
Yeah you're right because the first was food and second was an @sshole move for sure. The cooking the brahman in front of you was just too funny to read and if there was an animation for said eating then it woulda been some Negan style f*ckery
---
I completed collector. I had most of the magazines prior to the challenges ever being around. Had to find issue 3 and issue 4. Found both of them. Trading from player to player (along with dropping on the ground or selling from vending machine) does not count towards finding magazine collection.
---
I also completed photographer. To find a easy cargobot do the event at the Morgantown airport (can’t recall the name but where you fight off a few waves of scorched) at the very end a cargobot comes down slowly and drops off a package giving plenty of time to take the picture. For vertibots, just head to either Poseidon Energy plant of Ammunition factory and repair the vertibot defense systems there and take a picture while it is parked.
---
For chemist I believe I have the pulse grenade plan, but not the plasma grenade plan. Been grinding out dozens of events in the ash heap for said plan with no avail so far. Additional shoot a wolf with a syringer is bugged out for myself and my friends no matter how many wolves or types or levels we have shot. 
---
Everything else is completable I can confirm that. Found 1 deathclaw hide, have not received plans for diffuser and musician is super broke
---
I was in this event by myself the other day, and failed because there was no way for me to kill everything. Knowing I can slow the ghoul down and heal it is great news. You aren't forced to try this, so why argue about it?
---
One of these days when your running around adventuring and you stumble across a hideous looking sheep with a brutally annoying howl, just run! Don't shoot it, Its just my neighbors mom.
---
YES and I have like 50 freaking broken pro-snap cameras too, they're in EVERYTHING
---
Pfft Yeah next you're gonna tell me. Pole hooks should get stuck in the enemy we're attacking

Yea..and while i enjoy the show, they have a very poor grasp of ancient warfare and how it works

This has happened to me a total of 4 times now. Loosing power should un-list your machines, but not affect their ability to make sales when people find your camp "organically" by the way, so it's not a power related bug.

If you'd like this song, buy it. It goes to the record company that ownes John Denver.  I know that's not what you want but I don't know. I  did that same thing to NFSU2 LOL.
---
Im not arguing. I was just saying it sounded risky IMO. I was also just sharing information I learned, that if you go into the area locked by keypad there is a terminal and you are able to switch the robots to friendly and they will also aid you in defending the creatures and heal them. This might be especially helpful if you are doing it solo.
---
Oh yes pls
---
Brilliant!
---
shhhhhhh. This isn't a bug, it's a feature, as long as no one at the studio bothers to fix it.

Also, along that line of thinking, yesterday I was setting up a 4th vendor station, and filling it with wares, and someone kept shooting at me like that was going to make it go faster (In Adventure so it's not like they were trying to kill me)? Maybe some kind of "dude I'm filling it calm down" notification when the person that owns the vending station is actively stocking it. I didn't even have it plugged in yet, thinking that would indicate what I was doing.
---
This is a solid idea. I’ll call Todd. Brb
---
Candy weighs 0!
---
Good job for putting these up!
---
Even if you move it their spawn point goes by its original location. Your spawn point will change if you move it. Some players are using this to set traps. They need to spawn visitors outside the build circle.
---
True tho. I'm on PS4 and this has happened a good amount of times. I'll be getting hit be invisible enemies. 
---
Sometimes you'll see them laying down but yet moving a long. It's a funny yet annoying glitch. Especially when it's high levels.
---
how much?
---
Are you changing perk cards/ check mutations. 
---
Sounds like you have perk cards changing/adrenal reaction.
---
kay np thanks!
---
It's a random location within my camp boundaries!
---
This, even still the rug would fix it still
---
Personally I just sell everything, no natter what, for 1 cap because I hope to help new players/characters. Plus I know I'm always hurting for caps so I hope to help others in the same boat. Idk, just my personal thing. But yeah, there's no stable economy. Probably never will be.
---
That’s because that it was a dupe glitch. They purposely only allow one of the terminals to work at a time so items can’t become dupped. Easier to make them busy instead of truly fixing it, same with Whitesprings  dinning hall
---
I would also like to see it, cause when I tried it all I ended up doing was using multi-layer roof and rugs on top of that and it didn't look...great.
---
I hear you. I think most would share your definition. Perhaps it's a spectrum. Once could say that anyone who brings grief either, as a primary intended result or as an unintended but also unapologetic consequence could be termed a "griefer". 
---
I don't have a definition or investment in the term. My main point in (hopefully) support of OP is more people will be happier if we all are aware of our behavior in group situations and make the kind, pro-social choices.
---
Found it
---
My thoughts exactly. I’ve seen people use tables instead, but that should be unnecessary.
---
We needa Codsworth type
---
What you think is fair
---
I can’t see that in my minds eye. I’ll have to check it out.
---
So instead of limiting how much scrip we can earn, limit how much we can spend instead?
---
first off dude, buddy was trying to help you, chewing his head off just makes you look like a dick.  
---
Secondly, Bandwidth is one thing, latency is another. 100mbs from satellite internet will be awful and have like 800 ping for example.   
---
Thrid: Your connection into your home, your computer or consoles connection to the internet, and any or all of thier connections to the amazon cloud servers are entirely separate things. You might have a shit wifi router, and so your connection would be garbage. Your router could also be malfunctioning, causing packet loss even over ethernet.   
---
Really my point is, if you're going to act so angry to those trying to suggest solutions to you, maybe consider at least being correct with your sarcasm, at risk of looking both dumb and mean.
---
Player Vending is definitely a boon to the community and has made things more social
---
The LPT is always in the comments.
---
So what, everybody should get a participation trophy because they showed up? 
---
I know it won't be a popular opinion here, but if you're hiding in the bunker, crouching on the shack roof or hanging out on the edge just so you get the event reward,  then that's already more than you deserve.  If you don't contribute to killing the boss, you don't get loot...and if someone is killing it before you get to "tag" it, perhaps build your character up to fight and not tag.
---
Like first time ever? Fo76 is different in that you have to learn plans in order to upgrade
---
Same. Always have free ammo, pocket ammo, that I got for free. Free food and water listed in my machines in case you’re thirsty or starving or need a couple of bullets.
---
I used it for the quest then haven't since.
---
I'm sorry I wud not even touch that vendor.. It looks so "suspect"
---
I know in survival when I spawn at someone camp who's vending, it takes a minute for their camp to load and if they're in their camp and the walls haven't loaded yet, guess what I can shoot them, and most the time they aren't expecting that since on their screen they're safe in their camp
---
They used the Artillery glitch earlier this year, they must've had an overfilled stash this whole time!
---
To server ANND protect.
---
Well, if you don't have any ammo...
---
26592 beer bottles, what an OG
---
I believe it's leftovers from the artillery dupe way back in the day. It was tied to your stash so you could exceed the limit. But that's a lot of dedication to cheating, since the guy literally couldn't store anything in the stash since then, even weightless items.
---
I like this!
---
Considering you literally need 2 pairs of pliers to break down ammo irl yeah...we can hope.
---
Yeah first time ever! And that makes much more sense. I was wondering what the metal bed blueprint was for duhh
---
Same. Note to Bethesda: impossible daily challenges won’t make me buy atoms, they just make me play your game less.
---
I'm all for a higher spending limit, but this was an attempt to keep a balance. This would also free up carry/stash space on an ongoing cycle.
---
Lol. Yup you have to buy trade or find them.
---
I don't have iTunes. And since that's the only way to buy it, and it's already mine and on my hard drive, I don't see why I shouldn't be able to listen to it.
---
My Red Dress and Tattered Dress wasn't smart enough, neither was my friends Civil War Suit and Top Hat! Perhaps it means only whitesprings golfer garb?
---
At least let the atom gained from it reflect the difficulty lol.
---
* Gatling plasma bug has returned where, when you first equip it, it shows the ammo count on your first core as equal to the number of cores currently being carried. So for example if you are carrying 8 cores, you will show 008/008 instead of 302/008 (or however much a full core ends up being for you). Reloading immediately after equipping the weapon fixes this, but since the reloading animation takes approximately 13 days, this is sub-optimal.
---
* Unsure if this is a confirmed bug or just something weird that happened today. Activated the "locate the source of the seismic activity" misc quest from the personal terminal, then traveled to Berk Springs railway station and wandered around trying to find the sweet spot in the quest circle. After about 10 minutes of searching, the quest just disappeared from my quest list, no results announced.
---
* Another one I'm unsure was a bug or a quirk that happened today. On the same session that the above issue with Berk Springs happened (which was after the DL of the lighting update FWIW), I joined a couple of players trying to finish Powering Up Poseidon. They had the quest items down to "Finish completely fixing the reactor" and "Start up the power plant". There were 4 or 5 diamond icons within the reactor indicating the final items that the game wanted to be fixed, but all of them were already fixed. Went to the terminal in the control room and the only options were "About your power plant" and "Blast shield control" - the "restart your power plant" option was not there. It was only then I noticed that there was no countdown timer running for the event. I tried to help them along a few different ways but nothing progressed the event.
---
* Several issues with vending. One, if you have 30 slots occupied on a machine, and want to add more items to one of the slots already listed (i.e. if Fragmentation Grenade is one of your 30 occupied slots and you want to put more Fragmentation Grenades in the vendor), you are told SLOTS FULL. You have to have 29 slots open to add stuff to a vendor, even if the stuff you want to add is going to go in an existing slot.
---
* More vending issue: Game seems to have a bit of trouble counting the slots in use. I haven't been able to pin down exactly what causes it, but sometimes when you add items to an in-use slot (see my example for the frag grenades above), the slots in use count will still go up. At one point I had a vending machine saying its slots were full when I only had 26 slots in use.
---
* Not sure if this is my graphics card or the buggy lighting package or something else, but in the habitats in Arktos Pharma, items like the venison meat etc have blocky glowy orange polygons surrounding them. This seemed to be still in effect after the lighting update was applied today.
---
* Every now and then the event marker for Uranium Fever is showing in the wrong place completely, in the mountains somewhere SW of Top of the World (IIRC) instead of over the mine near the Whitespring. Clicking on the event marker does take you into the mine properly though.
---
* Breach &amp; Clear - Used to be able to hop up on some of the containers that stick out of the drill in order to reach the top row of containers. For about the past 3 patches, once you hop onto the 2nd row of containers (the first place you have a chance of reaching the top row), you are teleported back to the ground a short distance away from the drill half a second later.
---
&gt;I've literally watched players get on high vantage points away from damage and then do nothing at all.
---
This happened yesterday at ISS... I had all three conduits and got popped by a few bots all at once. As I was doing the count down to death I see at least 3 vulture on top of the shack looking in my direction, not 20 steps away. In the end, the event failed because there just were not enough people contributing,  not even doing medic runs.
---
colonel gutsy = sam the eagle
---
Maybe I’m dumb but why have all those beer bottles?
---
The only swipe right on other goood looking Spears
---
ok
---
Yep, I'm using bookcases, not a bad look but a railing would be great.
---
I heard it was a huge patch for the game lighting. Last night playing it was doing some weird stuff on my screen. Like monochrome.
---
I tried it in the bowler, which works for the pictures in formal wear, but didn't work at the event.  Gonna grab the tan suit too and see if that works.
---
I killed a legendary last night and before I could loot it the corpse just vanished.  Has happened a lot to me lately
---
A spear is not a quarterstaff. It was historicly, at least in western history, used to thrust and stab. Their blade is so small. You can easily miss by being to close and striking with wood or miss completely if it swung.
---
Maybe a "namaste" emote? :D
---
Ah Oki. Guess I will have to check it out when I can.
---
That player should have his characters wiped lmao
---
&gt;Those "freeloaders" don't affect you, so pay them no mind
---
That's where you are wrong.  Several events scale based on numbers present and so by them just sitting there, refusing to do so much as to revive someone, they are affecting me.
---
Hopefully that’s a bummer
---
It happens to me often as well. Sometimes the server has a big effect on it. 
---
I think the game has a hard time updating the damage value's in real time with all the variables involved, especially with bloodied builds
---
Agreed. Maybe even special challenges, like place american flags in your camp, take a picture of a dweller in military fatigues and an army helmet, wear patriotic clothing
---
The audio from the Guided Meditation event lol
---
Like the assault gas mask without the mask?
---
I'm online right now. I haven't tried it yet. I've watched some videos on it though.
---
Actually found him once outside near the acid workshop by Hemlock months ago, but I very rarely every do see him.  And he wasn't in it, I was running over to the east and he was nearby.
---
Gotcha. Does the instigating happen to have the +250 DR while reloading effect? Cuz that is also bugged and negates the primary effect.
---
Not true. Chameleon gives you sneak buff when you are motionless, but to achieve situation where you can jump onto your enemy face and remain undetected one must also use harder to detect while sneaking armor, and 1 chameleon + 3x harder to detect is much better than 5x chameleon.
---
I can't wait for them either. I've already got a ton of items stored up for a glitch museum. I'm hoping we can display more than just weapons and armor though
---
You really deserve a career with Bethesda.
---
If they don't find you handsome,  at least they'll find you handy.
---
&gt;If you cant beat the boss because a couple more people showed up then you have some things to worry about on your end before examining the impact of other players
---
And if they can't get loot because I need to use my heavy weapons to ensure I can beat the boss then the same applies,  right?
---
I've found one on that bench around the back of the whitesprings bunker, and recently also found one on a table in that abandoned camp to the NE of whitesprings where three toads spawn and there's an empty water purifier
---
I hope for you too, but it might not
---
RNG sucks.
---
....Until it doesn't.
---
^ accurate. Especially armored sword fighting.
---
I just did the event a little more and now the server stopped working again
---
I don't want to know which chems you are on, I just want to know your dealer
---
It's okay. I heard that making apps on Android is much more difficult. Take your time!!
---
There's a bug related to low disk space that prevents unpacking the changes files or something like that, but basically forces it to reload all files. A workaround is to clean up the drive to like 20gbs so that the launcher doesn't go bonkers. This is the root cause of the problem you are facing and a workaround.
---
YES! Well that sucks.
---
White springs is nuked at least once every day I play, and the spot is pretty glitchy because of the number of things going on. I had to abandon my first 76 play through because I went to white springs the first time and was stuck in glitch hell. It’s definitely improved since then, but it’s nuked pretty regularly and is still kinda glitchy so be careful.
---
Thanks!
---
Fuck double XP we need shit to work like for reals
---
I sort of like them, but I am tired of taking pictures that don’t count toward the challenge. Oh, you thought the very clear and close picture of a glowing honey beast with a bee swarm would count toward the honey beast or bee swarm photo? Nope. Try again.
---
Well that's not what I was thinking at all.
---
Always place a little welcome area around the vender~
---
Trash cans specifically
---
this would be a good use of the personal terminal.  i would love to know what plans i should seek out, particularly mods.  could even be linked to plans you know: learn an armor piece and your terminal lists all the mods for it, checks off the ones you know.
---
All good send me a friend invite
---
A level 90 can one shot the legendary just as easy as the Lev 343.
---
Thank you for suggesting this be an option in the settings. So often I see people make suggestions that are good ideas, but something I absolutely do not want in my game. For example, I am grateful I can turn off the cross hairs. I don't need a dot to tell me where the middle of the screen is.
---
Hehe I store everything on my HD. I just bought the guardians of the galaxy vinyl.  I miss the days that you can just load whatever you want.
---
*\[Note: All of my issues, in any of the bug threads, are experienced on PC\]*  
---
**Consumption of AID Items (specific ones/types?) Can Cause Game To Lockup/Crash**  
---
Started with Patch 9 as far as I know; at least for me. Many others have experienced it.  
---
Some people get a full crash, but for me it's always a lockup, which requires me to end-task on Fallout76.exe. Unlike the other (though seemingly fixed) Freezes/Pauses, this never seems to recover. Tends to manifest after having been gaming for a little while as I don't recall experiencing it with less than an hour of game time.   
---
I cannot verify if it also happens by selected it with keyboard, but definitely does with clicking via mouse. Don't know if it's specific item types, or if certain types are *more* prone to trigger it. I believe some have had it with chems as I seem to recall someone mentioning it doesn't happen when they use the same chem through the radial menu. Personally, it's usually the Canned Dog Food that does it for me (like just now). 
---
**Terrain Texture is (still) Over-brightening in Distant and Player Cell**  
---
Pretty sure this needs no introduction as we've likely all experienced it. I think it started in Patch 8.5, but *maybe* 8?  
---
Seems to occur after one or two night cycles. Why? \*shrug\* "It just works." \*thumbs-up emote\*  
---
(Had sure hoped it'd have been resolved with us having to download 8GB worth of the 'Enlightening' archives. Guess not...)
---
Now, worth mentioning, since IIRC you also experienced this... As of Patch 9, I can't say I've experienced **any** of the periodic freezing during SBQ or Impostor fights!! Granted, I've only had Patch 9.5 since today, so I don't know if that's *still* true, but god I hope so... Has been incredibly night being able to participate in those events w/o interruption!
---
Are they gone for you, as well? I hope so :)
---
I now love one of my favorite weapons even more, and I have the most notorious reproducer, QE.
---
Happening with my Instigating Combat Shotgun as well.
---
On the PC version, I can't run the game because my hard drive space is under 16 gb. Has this been a thing since release or is it because of a patch?
---
This is true, but the gamma gun would help extra since the robot doesn't necessarily heal them completely
---
Happening to my Instigating Combat Shotgun +250% DR.  Where do you submit the bug report? I'd like to help where I can!
---
I love the Gatling gun but the sight is pretty annoying. Its hard to see through and isn't very effective. Also the drum mag is chunky as crap
---
Nah, chameleon on it's own definitely gives a sneak buff. Watch the first couple minutes of this video from Captainoob. He's got five pieces of chameleon armor and none of it's 3-star so none of them have the harder to detect effect.
---

---
I did a horde event at the powerplant next to Watoga. Had 4 spawns, 1 albino deathclaw and 2 monarch deathclaws. Crippled everyone of them with my shotty build. Didn't get a single hide. I don't think it's a viable drop.
---
Had something like that happen when I was lvl 15. Had my camp near Camp mclintok (I botched that didn't I) and a guy came over and asked if I wanted a set of raider PA. He gave it all to me for free, which I used until I was lvl 40 and realized I could use T-45
---
I play solo and most of these include either complete RNG (find a cryptid, find 3 unlikely events happening at once, find some rare spawning items/enemies) or a friend willing to waste their time doing something silly for you. Most of these camera challenges are just a waste of space to me. I'm not even that upset about missing out on atoms, it's just not fun to have 2 challenges I actually consider doing. I like having something to work towards
---
I’ve actually seen this on a friend. He screenshotted his screen and showed me and it was just a couple of each item. I think it’s a bug.
---
kill two birds with one stone and revive whomever takes you up on this in water. tick one off for the swimming badge too.
---
Good Mythical Apocalypse.
---
Should have. My mistake. Guess I’ll have to offer more caps for that next time.
---
watch "hero"
---
I have never had a satisfying 3* roll, at least one that is useful to me. I go for 2* armor and weapons now, they seem to have better rolls to me anyway.
---
The other 2 needed to log off
---
You can stack mutations?
---
I've only ever found one in the whole time I've been playing. Tried it on and found it looks shit because it removes your char's hair.
---
There are concrete plinths on the atom shop, meant for placing decorations, but it stacks ontop of each other too!
---
I'm a stay at home Dad thanks to my lovely wife making enough money for me to do so. What's your excuse?
---
That is my usual experience with the event!
---
Because a raider would never build anything
---
Hell yes.
---
Whitesprings Resort. Spread out dead on a red car right where you spawn in.
---
Weird if that's the case.
---
Both machines had incredibly out of whack numbers.
---
60% of the time it works every time
---
I'm pretty sure he is near my camp, I found a burried 51b near a road, thought I could loot it but I can't. I'll see if I can't find him again and share the image.
---
I know right? It’d be... well, probably still bad, but it’d be cool! Also it’d be funny if drills got that before chainsaws.
---
Ive had that issue with my two shot tesla gun. It displays the exact same damage as my non two shot
---
Cheers for the group. Sorry I had to bail so soon, I'm in the UK so it's getting late here :/
---
Same with my friend. Even when I tried to trade with him it was off. If he had more than one of something it would show thousands.
---
You can have all the mutations at the same time, if that's what you mean.
---
Abandoned Waste Dump.   Invisiclaws and snakyclaws.  Still an excellent daily source of essential spoiled meat and stimpacks.
---
Hes saying they may not mesh well with bloodied. The game changes values for your reload and it might be whats causing the damage to reset.
---
derp.
---
Last patch, it was the other way around! O_o
---
That's great; it never even occurred to me that I could set prices to zero!
---
Na it’s just a skin, u can just apply it to your backpack.
---
I have a ping of 10, dont use wifi and everything else works perfect.
---
And as i said, it has gotten worse with new patches and is a CONFIRMED bug so it is not an internet connection problem
---
Met two assholes today.  A rare experience.
---
They also have a poor grasp on how to properly end one of the best stories ever told on film.... fookin' D&amp;D 
---
Yes, I'm bitter and salty, and eating lemons until my face looks like Arseface from Preacher... *shakes fist in rage*
---
One sometimes spawns in the shop across from the hospital in Charleston. It’ll be on a shelf in the middle of the room. Shelf will always have a swimsuit on the bottom and random hats on middle and top.
---
Not a few. Heck they said 2 weeks. Also can someone tell me what happened to taking things from your stash and decorating your camp with them? That shouldn’t be considered display cases right?
---
Oh my f***ing God seriously?
---
Oh yeah I know it's super common for it to get nuked because of the ghoul farming.   
---
My plan is to just run down there when I  got stuff to sell and then bounce in case there's trouble.
---
i'm with you.  i play adventure with pacifist on, and loathe pvp.  i get trying to take over a workshop for the resources, but doing it just to force pvp for the sake of pvp is a dick move.  go play survival if that's what you want to do.
---
I'm so tired of this. Honestly i'm so done
---
Yep super annoying
---
The underground Machinegun Turret is a deadly bug:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/luLyeeM](https://imgur.com/a/luLyeeM) 
---
Also noticed yesterday, but needs more checking, food lasting longer while in game? Did some questing and fast travelling to player vendors, usually all food spoiled after that, but some fresh Corn soup I made at the very start was only 50% towards spoiled. Logged out and back in later and when I checked the soup had spoiled. BTW I have no food perks.
---
follow the wires
---
Have you tried removing the top stair then the bottom one?
---
Have you not played Nioh?
---
Could be. Seems like something that could happen. As others have said also having 2 of same gun in inventory can make weird things happen with effects. Unequip and equip to fix it most of the time.
---
Get it done or still need someone to do it with?
---
Yup you just gotta be aware of the players around you and you’ll be fine.
---
lol
---
I always use the red dress and the White Wolf Fedora.
---
Thanks.
---
Going to try it and see if I have magic or average.  If it doesn't work out I'll let you know.
---
The sign behind him looks like the one at the entrance of the missile silos
---
Did it, but I'd be willing to do it again if you'd die in water. Any idea where to do it? 750 caps if we can get this done
---
That works for swarm of suitors?
---
I might... Helped a guy the other day with one of these and i dont even have a camera. Lol
---
Yeah it does fix it but only until the next reload. And i reload like a lot i don't even make it consciously
---
Next you're going to tell  me we need to jab with Pitchforks
---
when will you get on?
---
Sent
---
Zingbot?
---
If everyone could hold onto workshops then no one but the original person that got that workshop would be able to get workshops. 
---
Use blueprints if you want that exact building every time. Personally, I just toss up a few generators and let it go. Sometimes I'll make a really neat structure, but that's fully intended to go to whoever gets the workshop when I log out.
---
I do wish you didn't lose a workshop when you get dropped from a server, though. You should be able to go back if you own a workshop.
---
Haha off topic but i use to reload like that until i played arma/dayz. You have to reload each mag and i would reload like crazy until each mag had 3 rounds lol
---
I find "Junkies" annoying and didn't know anybody enjoyed them; been selling them for pennies. Goes to show, one man's junk is another man's reason to become debilitatingly chemically dependent! ;\^)
---
Depends on how big their health bar is, you need to do a decent percentage of their health bar, it needs to be more than 1%!
---
It’s called an analogy, jackass.
---
Actually the cooking in front of was someone else's story, I just logged off cause I had to go anyway.
---
No clue, are you on now? My PSN is lennon316smith
---
If you leveled a char specifically for pvp you don't need to be level 200.
---
It's always worked for me when the game requires formal wear. Before the WWF was a thing, I used the bowler or the Captian's hat.
---
And with Class Freak, the negatives are negligible. I'm running like 6 mutations currently.
---
Right the bowler works for formal wear for pictures, but did not work at the swarm of suitors event.
---
Yeah i know this issue, i use gatling laser/plasma and when you reload it just uses a new core until you don't have any fully charged ones
---
Source?
---
Loot bags should be locked, sure let people steal them, at the cost of the time it takes to lock pick, and get a bounty in the attempt!
---
No, I tend to keep my cards the same.
---
Oh, did they change it? It wasn’t zero.
---
Isn't that obvious? I was talking about trying to get rid of the top stair.
---
I will.  Caps and Repair. I buy a lot.  On PC.
---
Gameplay experience of me and my freinds not getting anything from the Queen after emptying several hundred clips until we got a suitibly op weapon to properly contribute!
---
That is pretty awesome. I’m happy to hear about it.
---
PREACH!!!  🙏
---
Max discount is charisma TOTAL of 20!!   
---
Hard bargin 3 = 9 charisma so charisma of 11 is the MAX discount price.   
---
My charcter is charisma 6, + 1 grape mentants (5chr) + hard bargin 3 = BEST PRICE (this is at level 15)
---
You can't stack the same mutation multiple times but you can definitely have multiple mutations at once (I don't think there's any limit, actually) and can sometimes enhance mutations with similar perks.
---
Oh you think you have it bad imaging freezing every 20 seconds for 5 seconds every time you play due to your friends list
---
Yeah, I'm using that for the one I have. So you have to use serums to get the others? Or can you be mutated again by rads?
---
"move" the camp even just a foot outside your circle will force everything to be stored. Will cost you a couple caps but save the headache.
---
Still have yet to have the plans drop for my main, and consumed it on my alt on accident (who isn't spec'd into crafting really at all).
---
Been trying to get the reward but Impostor is so rare these days. Was feeling flush the other night &amp; bought a keycard, first one I've purchased. Looks like I'll need a few more :p
---
Lol Rip my dude
---
In 5 minutes
---
Yup I am still waiting from my last reply 2 days ago but they have been keeping up with me but yea like you could only get stings and things still can't trigger kiddy corner cabins bot
---
I luckily bought mine from a player vendor. Good luck man :)
---
Haven’t been able to play for a solid 5 mins without it happening ever since lying Lowe cape out ...
---
Yes, all the toxic players were forced onto survival servers when slap damage was taken away. So many bugs fixed, so much new content, FO76 is hands down my favourite of the 3d fallouts.
---
Thank you
---
Could be a new use for Rose, and a natural for too. Wasn't part of her mission about a broadcast of some such? Has been a while.. heh..
---
I'm kind of annoyed the Fixer is only like 4 damage higher than a handmade rifle.  The handmade rifle powerful receiver seems to be quite strong even at level 45 compared to a level 50 weapon.
---
But yeah, I'm considering going to this improved combat rifle.  It may only do a few extra damage, and have a slightly lower fire rate, but the stealth bonuses seem pretty beneficial, especially since I have yet to get a legendary handmade rifle.
---
This sounds waaaay better
---
What's exactly the issue?
---
Three Dog, Top tier
---
Mr.New Vegas, a legend.
---
Travis, well that was a disaster....
---
I was just off to your right, at whatever that wooden tower structure thing is. Not sure if you noticed/counted me but I may have been the 4th guy. As soon as it impacted we all ran in. I slowed down a bit to gather the flowers for orbital strike beacons, then continued on. All I could think of was when Nero fiddled as Rome burned.
---
Yeah, I dont think 1% minimum is a mechanic because I have a ton of low level friends who tag the queen once and then wait around while the rest of us kill it and they still get rewards.
---
I just realized your statement is the opposite of what I was trying to suggest.
---
Something to do with the amount of friends you have on your friends list in the beginning I had around 1100 on psn 1 hour later I had 700 and it was fixed for about an hour and it’s back .. sucks because you freeze for 5 seconds and are dead when you load in can’t try any of the new content until this is fixed
---
Why not just delete some friends?
---
🇱🇷
---
I would love it if it was an event where multiple people are involved everyone in that area is squaded and any event enemies killed everyone gets the xp and loot but if you dont tag you get a percentage of it. Because I know the feeling. Or at least increase squad size to 8 if the game can handle that. Its fine when it happens once but when its a legendary it stings so bad when you dont have any or any good ones.
---
I definitely think the Handmade/Lever will be better in the long run but for now The Fixer is doing wonders until I unlock my suppressor mods.
---
I have, I’m at around 400 now and at this point it’s not worth it because I heard u need around 200- in order for it to work and it takes to much time
---
Maybe not westek but farm whitesprings as often as you can and you’ll get a lot of xp off the ghouls plus loads of junk chems etc
---
Pure win and completely with the lore.
---
Shut up and take my money.
---
The first time no, the second time I had no one online to test it.
---
Pro tip to anyone about prices and stuff from Vendors.
---
Your charisma TOTAL must be 20 to get the best price. Factor in Hard Bargin 3 is worth 9 points. Stat of CHR 11 without drugs/armour is it.
---
I run charisma 6 + 1 x Grape Mentants (5chr) and HB 3 = 20 charisma on a low level character.   
---
 Info taken from a indeapth article I read on here somewhere, and it works, have tested it across 3 characters.
---
I was ables to do the event fine with my new character granted I already had one. I ran a commando build and was using the pipe gun for the time being. I will admit that when it came to scuiciders I only got a hit in because my perception was high
---
Unfortunately you can't drop or trade cameras at all. They get treated like an atom shop item. 
---
The reason they start showing up all over the place is a sort of failsafe, in case you accidentally scrap or otherwise lose the first camera you get from the quest.
---
You can play the game solo not do every little bit of it easily like an op fallout 4 character but it can enjoyed as a solo experience.
---
Duper’s would get unlimited scrip ,... umm no
---
I never pay more than 600 for 3 star weapons but for legendary 3star .308 pipe rifle I could pay up to 1500 because I'm true wastelander and wear gasmask, scavenger outfit, backpack with showel and use pipe rifle and some melee. I have never encountered any. But legendary .38 and .45 are not so special to me
---
Congratulations ! 
---
I use quad explosive pipe bolt action and double explosice automatic pipe. Both are just level 40 but for most encounters this is enough. And with LP rank 3 equipped, their repair cost is ridiculously low.
---
Yah that sucks
---
Sorry you had to wipe out everything but it was a 100% way to fix your issue.
---
I can make one if you're unable to find the plans.
---
I tried to get them "naturally" with rads, but ended up with stuff I didn't want, so I just bought serums from the market subreddit. Now with player vending you can normally find them at CAMPs. 
---
Once you get what you want, lock that shit down with Starched Genes, though.
---
If you're on xbox friend I'll craft one for you
---
Fair point and I hadn't considered that.
---
What are people bringing to the event their so attached to junk wise? Hit yer stash before you go. If I see SBQ pop on my screen I'm hitting a stash for aid anyways, just hit the store junk button. Jeez.
---
I'm not condoning brown bag theft, but there is a built in solution already.
---
I'm willing to join if you get a group. Nukemanrunning on PC
---
Dunno what to tell you, over 700 hours in game that daily challenge has come up numerous times and that combination has always worked for me.
---
They do stab.
---
Alright thanks much for the info!
---
I've been steering clear of them, but I did get a fairly nice [Black Powder Pistol](https://screenshotscontent-d2001.xboxlive.com/xuid-2535439614426281-private/12f7f65a-8f3a-4b35-9ab5-fb7ce42b9154.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=SqACVFP562k2engO9x4Du%2B1JopYcy41WiK9WR9nxRio%3D) from the Purveyor the other day that I've been using just to do something different.  The fast reload (along with Speed Demon) is nice, and it weighs next to nothing so there's no reason not to bring it along on runs.
---
I believe they're in the files of the game, I remember exporting mine like that.
---
In Fo4 I was all about pistols. Mainly because good mods gave ton of nice pistols and mods to them. Bethesda never can make the best out of their games :/
---
Fantastic!  I was hoping everyone could hear it!
---
Lol dad jokes.
---
You complain about the game an awful lot. If it’s not something that you enjoy then it may be time to move on.
---
***DEJA VU I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE***
---
---------------------------------
---
You say lmao like you’re joking but honestly why would that not happen? Clear cheating and surely they can see player inventories and sort through to look for ridiculous outliers like this guy right?
---
Sorry man! I’m on xbone
---
&gt;are there no neutral/friendly npcs at all of any kind
---
There are some.
---
&gt;What kind of co op content is there?
---
The entire game is co-op if you want to play it that way.  There are at least two events which are really hard to do solo, but it's not required to do *anything* solo.
---
&gt;Is co op required to complete anything 
---
Not required per se, but there are a couple things that would be a big challenge to do alone.
---
&gt;and is there an easy way to find others to join up
---
Here, or the "Looking for Group" feature on XBox will usually get you some help.  Or just using your mic and asking random players.
---
&gt;How are quests generally acquired? 
---
You have a lot of questions.  Just go play and discover!  :-)
---
irl
---
All I get from her is heavy and rifle weapons, both have been explosive which is why I've decided to switch to auto rifles.
---
I've got several thousand rounds of ammo of certain types for sale, like .38, just because I've been stocking up but nothing compared to this. Yikes
---
It's rng man, i mostly got garbage
---
Apparently I should be there instead of here because reading these posts makes me feel like I'm playing the game wrong.
---
Put it in the title next time
---
So even though my TS Gatling gun without sights has an accuracy of 19, it's going to better than my Troubleshooters Gatling gun with sights, that has an accuracy of 52? 
---
I'm doing a confused, I have no problems aiming down sights and the extended mag doesn't seem to cause  me any issues?
---
I have to admit, on some occasions, the Gatling Gun does feel better aiming from the hip, so mebbe you guys are on to something 🤔
---
And more songs. Hearing the same few songs is torture
---
Even then, it's not stopping me!
---
In game. Just picked one up. It stabs when you are actually hitting an enemy.
---
Fucking awesome! I would have loved to be in the server when you guys did this.
---
Swift and Java are two very different beasts. I'm a Python dev myself, though
---
Now this is a movement i can get behind
---
Sometimes, I just exit out of build mode and go back into it
---
Suppose I really only need the one so I will happily buy one from you. I am available intermittently from now until 5 AM EST. How many caps would you like ?
---
Possibly find other recipes/drugs that use those components in your chem/cooking tables then tag and untag them (should show some kind of tag option when you have a recipe selected).
---
I also have this problem, it’s a little ridiculous. At the moment though it has not been addressed. It’s been this way for at least 2-3 weeks now.
---
I git the exact same Flamer, twice.....and I have only rolled 5 times.
---
Other time I got a missile launcher.
---
And a pipe.....
---
Garbage.
---
My experience with other players has been mostly positive, save for a couple rare jackasses. Had 1 guy stomp me into the ground repeatedly while I was farming a workshop. I was level 10 I think, he was level 280 something. He jumped a good 25 feet in the air and one shotted me with a meat hook. Every time I respawn I got murdered. Then a few days later some level 4 or 5 dude tries takimg shots at me on a road. I was around level 15 at that time and carrying a hardened .44 magnum. Two shots later he is rethinking his life choices. The other experiences are great. I've had a few players buy stuff from me and leave some stuff in my camp as thanks. A couple plans and recipes, a gun or 2, and a sheepsquatch skull.
---
I just got online. What’s your IGN
---
Thank you!  I've had an abysmal time dealing with Bethesda Customer Service, who've told me things like my internet connection is the issue (for a crash?) or that I need to upgrade my 2080 Ti to meet their minimum spec (?!).  It'd be great to get some capable eyes and brains on this.
---
I'll do it free if you'll wear formal wear at WS for me to take a pic
---
I'll help you if you help me with this as well.
---
Sorry everyone logged off.
---
I’ve had this happen to me too but it actually moved and/or turned into a meat pile because I was able to find it.
---
Lol you ain’t my boss 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Granted, but the result is the same.
---
Looks like we have found that one guy who has never had a bluescreen or been disconnected from the server. You don't always get to choose where you log off.
---
Sure, what's your ign?
---
Oh i have
---
DoctorDisc0
---
Thanks for your support, stay tuned, new features coming soon.
---
Thanks man, will notify all of you when Android version is out.
---
It seems to be way more powerful than others though
---
Id like to see a traditional white picket option
---
Nukemanrunning. I'll be back online in a sec
---
Thanks dude, I'll try my best to finish it for Android.
---
I re did it today worked in rain i think i needed a person in the pic
---
oh i see, it looked like an ad
---
Sent you a friend request
---
I need this weekend
---
Oh man, having the announcer declare active events would be great.
---
Maybe try the Captain's hat? I have used that a time or two because I don't like the bowler. Maybe it'll work?
---
&gt;Will that still trigger the quest for them?  If so, I’m glad I’ve saved a few.
---
Sadly, youcan't trade, sell, or drop the cameras, so they're no easy to help others jumpstart the quest.
---
Nice, I've used python to work on the backend of some web apps. Wish I could use Swift to develop on Android, I don't like Java that much xD.
---
I get t two amazing rolls for 3*, and then the next 8 were pure crap. Now I only do 2*, as it's much less expensive and you can still get amazing useful pieces. I still wish you could choose the lvl though, I don't know how it works for low level players
---
Thank you for this reply. I did know that about the magazines. I saw a post here saying one wasn't found in game files, but they had to be wrong. I've just been grinding spots looking for them.
---
I just grabbed the red dress and put on the wwf so I'm gonna try it again
---
as far as i know it is like most other events. it will stick around
---
They're incredibly strong. I use them constantly for leveling up a new character. 
---
I recall killing a level 80 scorchbeast when I was level 22 with 2 mirv grenades thrown right under it's belly. 
---
They still kill my main when I'm using dense and 3x fireproof if I have some adrenaline stacks. The only issue is they seem to just get stuck sometimes.
---
or a mega sloth gauntlet
---
Short version: They cocked up.
---
Legendary pipe revolver is the best gun in the entire game. Benefits from rifleman and gunslinger at the same time, unless they patched it. I loved my non legendary pipe revolver, it was my main from lvl 15-lvl60
---
Thanks m8.
---
I don't currently own any formal wear but this sounds like a great deal to me.
---
I tried this event the other night twice, and I had no idea what to be doing. When I filled the hoppers nothing changed score wise, noone seemed to defend the friendlies, it was a shitshow.
---
Plus side, I did get a 3* anti armor railgun from the squatch, downside I've yet to complete it.
---
Anyone know what the unique loot rewards are?
---
And this is why I love this game.  I can count on one hand the number of dicks I've run into.  Everyone else has been either friendly or hilarious, sometimes both.  
---
Then again, I play on PC, where I hear griefers are far less than the consoles.
---
well thats just silly
---
There is one pistol that is amazing: the pipe revolver. It benefits from rifleman and gunslinger both, unless they patched it. My no* hardened pipe  revolver did 150+ damage, vs my exploding western revolver at 125+.
---
Cheers for the assist!
---
I think you do now. Last couple of times I tried the - take certain workshop just for atom challenge, relog (to same server) to clear ownership - I still had ownership.
---
At least these days, they can't destroy your camp.
---
While weight would be useful, what I really wish we had is refrigeration for our stashes and vending machines. Then I could sell more high grade food dishes and drinks.
---
I sell them for 350-550caps in my machine add me gofukyurslf326
---
Yes there is that.
---
Molotovs?
---
I actually just got it done with a friend but I'll still make it free.  PSN longtrainrollin
---
Should get better too, Devs have said they will add to the world notifications, so it means no longer doing it alone joined by like 1 person towards the end
---
i sell mine pretty well
---
We got refrigerated mods for the backpack, why not for the vending machines also. They could make it so you could only put items in that have spoil condition bars and allow us to make fine dining for the waistland.
---
Great story.
---
I was waiting in line to trade with a guy today when another player showed up and cut line in front of me.  I nudged him out of the way and took my place back.  So he started running in a circle around and around and around me.  I entered photo mode and threw up the "chic" pose.  He got behind me and appeared to be sniffing my butt.
---
It's a crazy world out there.
---
How much did you sell it for
---
‘Take a picture of 7 players with Glowing Alpha Deathclaw pets gathered around an attacking SBQ and giving the Tricentennial edition emote’- 10 Atoms
---
I just use my camera to take pictures of nice views or cool camps I visit when looking for stuff.  I quit trying to do those challenges.
---
300 they are not super rare i have a bunch of them
---
Can we get a sneak peak? Glitch museum sounds interesting.
---
Good doggie you can eat whenever you need not stop and chomp on a corpse
---
I had a god roll junkies 10mm I was attempting to make work and it just sucked. Would've been better punching things with my 1 str build.
---
Felt this
---
This update messed something up, it keeps re downloading the patch after it already downloaded it when it seems complete and I hit the play button. 3 times now.
---
What makes you think you wont get attack behind the load screen?
---
Do you want it modded at all?
---
Were you in a group? If not that's really good news. I haven't really taken many workshops lately because of the pvp aspect, and not wanting to die.
---
Server doesn't crash when a nuke is launched.
---
I was playing my new survival character today. She is level 15 or so. I was in Flatwoods selling some shit and I see a level 4. I wave. He waves. We go our separate ways.
---
A few minutes later I see the guy again. He's now level 5 and can PvP. He shoots me. I end him with a head shot from my level 10 50cal hunting rifle. He msgs me and calls me a cheating bitch.
---
Some people, man...
---
Usually
---
Eating right now, 10 to 15. Still need help? BTW do you have a mic ? No big deal just makes things simpler
---
Been saving one of each for that bobble head stand, hoping it comes out soonish
---
Sounds neat, where's the pics?
---
I scrap all mine as the ammo weighs a ton (no bandolier perk on my build rip) and it's only good for certain circumstances imo. Up to you. Sometiems I wish I had one for crowd control lol.
---
This is still a problem? Jeez I quit this game months ago after hitting lv100 in hopes of it getting better in the future.
---
 Currently on a server with the tourist spawned at the water park. On XBox.
---
Move you camp locations and everything should be stored not the best solution but a solution nonetheless
---
Last night I did think it was strange that my pipboy light didn't light up tabletops or desktops but did light up everything else on the floor under the tables/desks, or is this fix something totally different and I just encountered a new or unresolved bug?
---
Someone get this guy a beer
---
Best meme
---
It was a couple weeks back so i never took any. Im new to reddit and needed to share some building tips since alot of post and videos have most things covered lol.
---
It wasnt a bad ending. Its how they got there. They needed way more episodes to have led to the last two episodes.
---
Yeah i was lighting a guy up with my explosive gatling plasma and did 0 damage the entire time. Was whack.
---
West tek and Whitesprings are probably the best. The Burrows are ok, there's normally 1-2 legendaries in there.
---
That would've been awesome to see lol
---
Great then, thanks!
---
Snallygaster spit attack (should be obvious)
---
2* assaultron head without a prefix (formerly a 3* from the purveyor)
---
Spare commendation from the enclave questline (I got two while at 9/10 and the game never took away the additional one)
---
Serrated bowie knife (it's supposed to be a normal mod, but due to a glitch you can't mod this or the cultist dagger. you can only get already modded ones as very rare drops from enemies)
---
Tesla rifle with "scope" as the sights attachment (glitch with teslas that spawn with a charging barrel)
---
Combat knife with an invisible blade (still not patched, just try to mod it and choose the "no upgrade" below what it starts with)
---
Handmade rifle with "no color" instead of "no paint" under customization (idk if this is a glitch, but I have another handmade from more recently that says no paint)
---
Marine combat helmet (bought and scrapped one from a player vendor, only available from those who got it from the dev room or those who learned to make it)
---
Might be a bit more that I'm forgetting. Current plans for more stuff is to get the behemoth attack item, a serrated or stealth blade cultist's dagger, a bone club or hammer with the no-text upgrade, and maybe an explosive bobblehead to commemorate the duping and stacking of those that led people to one-shot the scorchbeast queen
---
I usually find one at lake reynolds. There's also a chance for them to be in the lake close to the pioneer scout camp.
---
Agreed. 1000 is a nice round number. At least until they add new content.
---
Good news! Then hopefully it will be even better when I can play, thanks!
---
My experience with this event is I had to do the 2 key cards part just to get to the keypad about 7 times. Then I got through the to keypad and made it to the key and the key wasn't there. That sucked. That happened about 4 extra times. So I did the whole experience a lot.
---
No way to go but up.
---
Yeah been to both several times . I'll try server hoping and see if that works.
---
Good doggy hands down.  Pair it with slow metabolizer and it's one can of dog food and you're good to go plus it can be used as a slow yield stim pack in combat.
---
I’ve down the keycard part, I’m physically stuck and can’t get to the key pad
---
give it a try, you might like it... make sure to put on the explosive perks
---
Well shoot.  Would be nice if there was crossplay across all platforms.
---
Cap limit is 25k. And anyway are you against a free market? COMMIE! COMMUNIST SCUM!
---
Think about it?  I have it.   Pc mods make the game actually playable.
---
Was wondering why the game was all screwed like i was on nuka shine
---
Glass Cavern. I believe that they're a guaranteed spawn.
---
They also said a couple of weeks ago that it has been delayed...
---
[Video for people confused](https://imgur.com/gallery/G8WZc6F)
---
Yeah you gotta hop servers. When you do, it restarts your progress so you have to get the two key cards again. Then zip em and dash to the keypad with the key code and punch it in.
---
How are junkie weapons any good? Every one I had and tested I got addicted to everything I could and it had lower damage than a normal crafted weapon with no mods
---
There are several OP builds, but they're really not necessary for anything besides the Scorchbeast Queen. Melee is still good, and heavy weapons were recently buffed.
---
I want to say something like that is uncommon, but it’s not. The weird ass shit I’ve seen happen is effing hilarious.
---
Well sure, no game has characters that are 100% unique for every player. But you'll be hard pressed to name a popular RPG that doesn't have some kind of class or spec system where characters fall into very distinct roles, which is something this game really doesn't have. The classic roles of Tank, DPS and Support don't exist in any real way. The classic archetypes of fighter, sage and rogue don't really exist either. It's not that these wouldn't be at home in the setting either, there is an endless number of scifi games where playing a doctor or engineer is just as viable as playing a soldier or scoundrel.
---
I’m in the room with the key pad, that’s not the problem, there’s an invisible wall, do I have to server hop for that?
---
I agree. I use the Fixer as my primary even though I have an AAE LAR. The fixer does more damage over time and works better against mid-tier bullet sponges (E.g. Yao guai).
---
Bah dum psssh
---
Try the swarm of suitors event near grafton dam. Really high chance for at least one to spawn in among all the mirelurks
---
Nice. Never knew about the tesla and behemoth ones.
---
Wendigo cave has 2 guarenteed
---
Duh. Yup I’m dum lol
---
I was, but I quit the team before reconnecting - if you didn't then a team mate used to inherit ownership, would be interesting to test that too.
---
Don't know if this affects anyone else, but I can't remove the mark for aluminum -- even though I unmark it in component view, it is still marked in regular view and in my stash.
---
This is good news indeed. No more going in home alone.
---
But if it stops lasering you, it punches you. If you think the laser hurts, wait til you feel the pinch. 
---
I, too, regularly die to assaultrons half my level.
---
no it spawns out in the world, no clothing (other then some of the colored asylum uniforms ) that spawn in the world are worth much
---
Yeah invisible walls aren't good. You likely got bugged in. Either the wall closed and you opened it back up and the fame didn't register, or the graphics show the game door is open but the secret wall compartment closed for whatever reason. I mean, if you already punched in the code correctly, you can fast travel to a nearby location and run back down to the basement. The key room may be open, because that room is instanced for players. 
---
If it's not open, youll have to hop servers and get the keys and code again and retry.
---
I've gotten plenty of stuff I'm happy with tbh. On the first day, half my rolls were explosive. Managed to get what I consider to be a god-roll (junkie's explosive weightless assault rifle)
---
If you have time to shoot out a leg, you probably had time to just kill it. Even on ‘trona half my level they melt me before I even know where they are. Especially the invisible ones.
---
Red dress and wwf worked.  Thanks so much!
---
Well it surely gives a buff to your sneak and it surely stacks. The datamined information suggest each piece gives a "magnitude" 20 effect, and chameleon mutation that gives this effect with magnitude 100, suggesting that 5 pieces of chameleon work as efficiently at buffing sneak as chameleon mutation does.
---
But on the video we see a single stupid melee monster running around in caution, trying to locate the player, unreliable and had ended randomly. What I am talking about is more like standing so close to a scorched that when you shoot, recoil could bash damage them, shooting from silenced weapons and fail them to register that fact. Unlike chameleon, its reliable.
---
This is brilliant. 
---
But no more Mr. Handy. Stephen Russell, awesome as he is, Is already voicing what feels like 90% of the game.
---
Red dress and white wolf fedora worked
---
I sold mine for 900
---
Ugh, this game is super frustrating
---
+50% damage for having 5 addictions.
---
If you're on PC there's a mod that basically what you are asking for.
---
True.
---
And this is why the base concept of fo76 is a joke and it won’t last another year.
---
They Want fo players to play a game all around other peoples  without other non humans and bot resellers priced to not move a damn thing?
---
This is what you get- griefers in quests/group play and people who don’t give a shit fucking up vending, both of which make the entire idea of an “eve type” fallout a complete pipe dream.
---
All of the vendor caps are in one pool now.
---
Honestly, While I do not run a 1 shot build. It's in the game available for everyone to use and to do. It's not the player's faults. It's player nature to min max. Why would they not have the best killing build possible? Its poor game design. Stop berating players for doing it and start calling Bethesda for allow ing it. The Balance in this game is Garbage. It's still a fun game though. 
---
Point your Pitchfork and torch towards Bethesda, it's their fault.
---
My lack of hat must've been stopping me...
---
Yay! Glad it worked. :)
---
That's my guess too
---
I can put a suppressor on your handmade if you like!
---
Oh, that's a good point, interesting. I have noticed the last few updates it seems like you go back to the server you were on much more often. It sucks when you're server hopping to look for something, but it's really nice when you were booted and can come back and still harvest a SBQ corpse.
---
Across the entire map? I thought each faction had a Cap limit of 1400?
---
yea well i have like 30 of them just trying to get rid of them
---
Yeah it's buggy. The room is instanced to players, but the key is a world drop like a magazine, unless they patched that to instanced as well. But when it was first patched in, it was a world drop. That was super frustrating. Because then even though I made it through everything, the key wasn't there. So you have that to look forward to aswell. 
---
Then when you go to the dome, the X01 paint is usually farmed because that is a world drop, so you'll have to server hop a few times to find that. So you got that to look forward to aswell. 
---
As a note, my experiences are based on the new patch within a few days of it being discovered, so now that it's not as fresh, you may have better luck than I.
---
Starts at 1400 then gets subtracted from each vendor.
---
A couple if days ago I claimed a workshop for some challenge it another, and some guy comes out of nowhere the second my workshop is claimed and activates it for himself and one shot kills me. 
---
He then sent me several messages when I wouldn't try to take it back from him.
---
I have gotten 2 from events 1 from camp fire the other from insect part quest. I then did 2 badges, not sure what I want to get yet tbh
---
like the 700th time, this has been posted. 
---
Most of the time they go back to where they spawned and turn into a meat pile. You can be sure the body/pile is somewhere nearby. They just aren't always easy to find and they aren't always in an accessible place. 
---
Granted that. Bethesda needs to fix this garbage.
---
Its 50% bonus damage for having minor special negatives. I play rifleman and have 1 strength anyway. Those addictions lose me no agility which is all i care about.
---
Take a picture of the entire server at the top of the Satellite Array wearing Old Man Winter Fasnacht masks and Western Outfits” - 2 1/2 atoms and a coupon for 10% a sandwich
---
I’ve heard all about that, I think I might just ask someone with the key to open it up for me
---
Tomorrow tho, I’m too frustrated and tired to deal with  this stuff
---
Each vendor faction used to have a cap of 200, but that severely limited higher end items from being sold at all. So they updated it to 1400 caps shared across all vendor factions.
---
No they combined the 200 caps of the vendors into one pool shared across them all.
---
My wife and I were just saying the same thing. I’d spend atoms on wallpaper or even just smooth paint for interior walls.
---
I love seeing all this stuff. I'm sure there's more out there I haven't seen
---
&gt;A Guide section with lots of useful information. The guide is crowd sourced so if you have any good tips for new players you can post it. Doing this will reward you with points that once you’ve earned 500, you can redeem it for $4.99 which you can spend on 500 atoms.
---
Oof, fuck no. Enjoy dealing with people gaming and botting your system
---
That’s a malicious website according to my phone
---
Someone had posted seeing a builder use power lines and connectors as a rail. I thought that was an interesting and cleaner suggestion.
---
Good idea but it wont happen, otherwise vending machines would just get turned into extra stash boxes and not vending machines, I for one dont wannt to show up at a camp just to find everything is 25000 caps to prevent peoplebfrom buying items they are just storing.
---
Me too. Maybe one day.
---
The quickest way to getting the Camera Quest is just going to one of the monumental spots, and just server hopping until the body appears. Took me about 5 times until I found one.
---
Upvote for that.....but then again a commie would try to cover himself up by calling someone else a commie.
---
If they have a window at all it's easier to get in as long as you have power armor on you
---
I promise in the real apocalypse everything of value will be extremely over priced.
---
BigBallsBob?
---
Second this. Thanks for sharing anyways tho, op
---
Interesting, I've heard of people trading them to others and starting the quest. Haven't tried it myself so I can't confirm our deny. I'm willing to try if someone else is. If course since I said I find them all the time I haven't found one.
---
Thats the highest. Same for marine
---
I play on PS4 and have had no problems at all  
---
and i hear that  griefers are far less than the PC  
---
maybe they all on Xbox
---
Supermutants are endlessly spawning at grafton steel yard for me
---
Others have mostly covered it but two shot is +25% base damage on the second bullet, not 20%. It kills hip fire accuracy though so it will significantly affect VATS accuracy. I'm not a fan of it personally.
---
Explosive adds +20% base damage, as others have said. It's one of the top two or three secondary effects depending on your build.
---
Personally, I prefer bloodied, instigating, and anti-armor legendaries over two shot.
---
I’d consider it demi-god cause I hate the junkie leggy effect but rage other two are dope. Just my opinion though I don’t like being heavily drugged so I can have withdrawals
---
I don't have any explosive ones
---
You’re not being constructive though. None of your complaints or suggestions are practical. The event is fine as it is if you have enough people there who know what to do.
---
Checking in here haven’t moved my camp since early January and can’t delete anything on my whole top floor and stairs lmao
---
Aww. Darn. Thanks man.
---
Same thing happened to me. You need to take a picture of a team mate in a storm. That made it work for me
---
I'm not into pvp. I've had that happen with a workbench.... now I sit with my finger on the computer power button when i take a workbench and look around the whole time. If someone attacks I flip off the computer. When I log back in all my stuff is still with me.
---
The monkey doll on 2nd floor at the main building, and locker at the entrance building are spawn cycling for hats. I got both from that spot.
---
When I get home in about 6 hours I'll check my stash. If I have extra one, you can have it for free :)
---
Still, a Matrix group would be much appreciated. My distaste for Discord is ever increasing.
---
I find them pretty good for running a Nuked Whitesprings, provided there are a few more people there. You can fire a few rounds into the thick of the fighting and guarantee that you get loot from most of not all of the enemies. Works beautifully when a melee build blocks the golf course entrance. You can light that choke point up.
---
Yeah, I starched my marsupial and used class freak. Thanks for the tips.
---
Cute :))
---
Glad that some people had an easy go at the Radscorpions last night-  
---
i server hopped at middle mountain cabins for 3 hours to get them all because they were always already dead (or it was Yogis or Beests)  
---
(no it wasn't pure straight- some Uranium Fever and Free Range when they popped)  
---
but yeah, kinda tired of near impossible ones not necessarily the camera ones-- i am level 120 with 700 hours in and seen a grand total of 3 flatwood aliens
---
Could be.  I'm going off what I hear, but it could be Xbone has more issues with that.
---
Always thought it was weird, but then I remembered they probably had massive climate change before the war, droughts, overused land, so they may not have been growing so many apples. And Apple flavoring isn’t really a substitute for real apples when you’re making a pie.
---
Sure, I'm not disputing the value of the harder to detect effect. I wish I had more pieces with it.
---
As soon as i get stomped by a player, my  computer power switch is off. I restart and log in on a new server. I have it set up to happen so fast i never lose any stuff.
---
Play survival, if you do you would be singing a different tune
---
I'd rather a system I can sell ammo for let's say... 3/$1
---
I'm having a hard time formulating why it works but it does. I've been running a non stealth commando build lately to extreme success vs even the most annoying bloodied builds. You can win!  Its not unbeatable.
---
They're pretty good weapons, but they're heavy with heavy ammo, pretty inefficient and the ammo itself is costly. it's one of those weapons you save up for,then go on a spree with, not an everyday weapon.
---
This happened to me. I had to server hop
---
I drank some nukashine and ended up at the volleyball court just down the hill from it! Had no idea what it was, and totally freaked out!!!
---
I stopped using grenade launchers around lvl 35. It really depends on your built but it's not worth keeping IMO. I only dust off TS nuke launchers if I want kaboom effects :)
---
Yep got a three star at pharma
---
Yes... This... Now...
---
I see you never met Spike before
---
Thanks for being our ambassador to the normies.
---
Everything you said here is correct. Anything that reduces dmg by a % is essential!
---
Something like this is so intrinsic to the modern fallout experience it boggles my mind that it wasn't included in the game on Day 1. I was blown away when I found out that Applachia Radio was just music.
---
Speaking of, has anyone seen any legendary scorched (human variant)? For the life of me I cannot recall ever seeing one, which is really odd given how many of them there are.
---
Nuka polka!
---
I have bought 2, one for 35 caps and another for 100.
---
Well congrats on that elusive car-struck tourist :)
---
Good question. I thought it was supposed to be in one of the last updates...
---
Good doggy, dog food is very common in the game and cheap to buy if needed. Cannibal is useful for a "survive off the land" approach but the rads are annoying at best.
---
I don't use VATS or melee, so special debuffs are not an issue for me. Junkie's is just a free 50% damage bonus, so it's better than two shot or anti armor for me
---
ps4
---
Oh shit. I knew about the code but didn’t know it was for a mini quest inside the quest. Thank you!
---
Have you tried just going to the dome? I ended up going through everything and getting the key, but during try 6 or something I got all mad the key was never there and just checked the door and it was open.
---
You're a skin
---
Cockroaches
---
I'll be sticking to my solo exploration then.  With lack of npcs from what you're saying I take it there's no like... Quest board or something which is basically what I was asking.
---
If it's just through exploration then that's good and what I'd prefer.
---
Melee bug is super obnoxious, I feel for the shottys because of this.
---
Awesome! Usually when I see a player lower level at a workshop, I'll run over to see if I could help. Its fun to explore the world and be nice to newer players. Unless its a guy who's main is lvl 300 and the lvl 25 is his new, and he threatens you. Besides that, its fun.
---
I wonder what will happen if 3 silos launch nuke at the same time at prime fissure :)
---
I’m looking for people to lvl with. I’m lvl 25.
---
Oh... I'm on PC
---
South of lewisburg station ash heap
---
Can you take more ranks of good doggy? How much does a can fill you up at max?
---
i would love to team up with someone,considering i had to factory reset my pc bc the motherboard broke and just reinstalled it like 5 minutes ago and dont know if all my stuff is saved
---
That's strange, so it appears this doesn't exclusivley affect IE, but also just instigating! thanks for the input!
---
Not your Brahmin. It’s a Brahmin on the server. Don’t give a shit if hurts your feelings.
---
I’m sorry. But no I haven’t. Is he a tiny deathclaw?
---
No found a few on my travels and currently have some
---
It could just be my play style as well, I generally don't defend my workshops or use them or resources- fast travel points only but I have also never been shot in the back or tracked down before the latest patch did away with that method
---
What IS the deal with that? I sometimes wonder if like I tripped on a rock lol
---
Don’t point at your toes
---
Up vote from me :) I want to be able to hang rolling pin with pots and pans while wearing chef hat and outfit :))
---
That...is good. Two shot on it does do double damage. Its reload keeps it from being great. Same thing on the auto grenade launcher would be amazing.
---
Just the one rank, I think it makes cans 3x more filling. Plus adding the "canned good" or whatever it's called perk in the luck category makes it a lot easier to find while searching so you're usually stocked up
---
Sliding Ghoul attack is deadly and obnoxious
---
Is your computer turned on?
---
As others have said, it's 1400 shared pool at all vendors. They reset every 20 hours. HOWEVER, sometimes there is a bug where it looks like it's 0 caps after 20 hours but if you try to sell something it resets to whatever it should be.
---
The  bug affects wood armour and assaultron heads. Scrip those before you even log off. Bethesda has posted about it in another thread. It'll hopefully be fixed in the next patch.
---
I load into the game world just fine, but it's all the things like camps or DLC items that require a download time once you're in the game that takes forever.
---
Ill have a more detailed poat later. I've dedicated A LOT of time researching into what works and what doesn't. I have builds to share as well
---
Big essential; get sentinel assassin or cav Assassin gear, without it, you’re meat. 
---
People say it’s “OP” but really not that hard to get a set
---
Or get carnivore mutation. Everything drops meat.
---
For those of us with Windows 7/lacking WinDebug, are there alternative steps?  Looks like I've got four of these bad boys on my 'puter I'd like to contribute somehow.
---
Yes because changing the XP we earn will effect the speed at which they fix bugs, because Bethesda is one person apparently?
---
I'd pay good money for a white picket fence that I could put around my base, personally.
---
Yep my store has a pressure plate that open the garage door to the shop and simultaneously triggers two speakers and a lighted sign that says “communism is at your door”
---
I got shanked at Grafton Steel Yard yesterday, by two dudes who sat back and watched me destroy waves of Super Mutants, then came in at the last moment and one-shotted me. I just left. If I wanted PVP, I'd be on survival.
---
Good idea! But considering what Memorial day is, perhaps Children of Fallen Patriots or something similat would be a better choice.
---
WWP is amazing, but they get a lot more exposure and support than other charities. Memorial day is to commemorate the fallen, so I feel like the timing is better to donate to something tied to them.
---
Anyway, thats my two cents.
---
nah youre good. power armor with emergency protocols.
---
That's what I'm trying to avoid. I don't run either of those things and I'm never just meat online.
---
Sure, I'm mostly done with pioneer scout challenges but I'm always down to team up.
---
Good for you, but it's just a game bro :)
---
Well, he'd have to be level 5 by definition, right?
---
How about double xp weeks for people who have more time to play during the week and almost no time during the weekend?
---
Well there isn’t really any guarantees in PvP.
---
Everything is just in the pursuit of improving your odds
---
Welcome to the party! You’re story is basically what I wish would happen with several of my friends. It was great to hear.
---
WS is the easiest of all since WT has those pesky mutants with mini nuke. But the mutants drop caps :)
---
Phoe4 ill help you. The fixer is great. A must for any stealth build. Combined with shrouded wood armor and speed demon you can move pretty fast in stealth
---
Fair. I just see a lot of the normie type guys complain that you NEED those things in order to survive. My aim has been to find ways to go around that to avoid the age old complaining. To show that they aren't so broken because they are beatable even if you don't have them.
---
Yeah, it is my brahim, my property, you dirty commie
---
Idk I've had that happen sometimes, the pip-boy light is just kinda shitty.
---
You sold yourself so well!
---
I will say, this latest nerf to the armor has been probably a good thing. I think they could have done it differently, but the changes they made; made it no longer impossible for people like you to compete.
---
The name is ironic, I didn’t really do nothin like that lmao
---
Lol nah man my political party is just liberty prime.
---
What is that?
---
A festive day?
---
This is true and I appreciate them for that. In kind, I aim to stop the call for further nerds because what's done is enough.
---
I definitely still feel my repugnance towards this game but it's suppressed by how fun the game is. I'm glad Bethesda hasn't given up on it. I was actually really surprised to see it updated only a few days before I got it.
---
Because roleplaying isn't only just about shaping your character how you want, but doing what you want with it.
---
You wanted to pretend to be a bounty hunter in previous fallouts, you could only do as much as the storyline lets you.
---
Fallout 76 lets you constantly hunt those wanted players, take bounties from people on marketplaces like this.
---
I enjoy base building. But spending hours rebuilding the Castle for Preston Garvey to show his thanks by saying "another settlement is in trouble". But on here, I had a side business building camps for real people. Who actually had opinions on what they did and didn't want.
---
It's not better, it's not worse. It's just a different experience
---
It's more a change of perspective on a topic I had strong feelings about more than just "oh yeah this game looks cool"
---
I’m also enjoying FO76, but don’t sleep on FO4, I really liked that game.
---
...and here I am remembering our fallen brothers and sisters.
---
It's a more personalized and sandbox experience, which I really enjoy. I don't like being handheld from point to point, I like to do it my way. This game totally let's you do that and I really appreciate it.
---
Yeah it be nice to get a group, but I think bethesda needs to fix the d/c issues with the event, like was defending the monster then seemed everyone got d/c from it since me and my friend on the same server got d/c, also that elevator d/c too. Also, bethesda needs to announce the event like scorchbeast queen and imposter events.
---
Forget the gardener. I want a personal assaultron. Why a...personal assaultron? Mind your business. Thats why.
---
Or Fisto! Lol.
---
If they're on Adventure we couldn't kill them if we wanted to.
---
Why can't we just have two stations?
---
Both really.
---
Yeah, it wasn't the fallout I was hoping for. But I've truly enjoyed it. That being said, I also can't wait to play the next installment which should be in the vein of its predecessors
---
Got a screenshot?
---
I don't play anymore, but I agree.
---
Bethesda, you said at Pax, you LOVE the Camps. Show us a little love and listen to this guy!
---
Aye, but when you get to around lvl 200, you should have a slightly different revering opinion :) It's a good game nevertheless.
---
Ah man, I hate myself for it, but I got into on the main fallout sub today with a kid that insisted FO76 was the worst game ever made...but of course,  he's never actually seen it let alone tried it.  I tried to reason with him, he insulted my intelligence,  I tried to get him to give me a reason it was horrible,  he questioned my lineage, I conceded that FO76 wasn't for everyone,  he suggested I try to do a couple things that I'm pretty sure are anatomically impossible.  Oh well, I guess those lucky enough to find their way out of the echo chamber,  like you,  will have to spread the word that FO76 is actually quite fun and a massive time sink. Perhaps you'll have more cred there than I do, even though I've played every FO, including the first,  when they released...yeah, I'm that old and then some!
---
Anyway,  I'm glad you're enjoying it and even gladder that you gave it a try to see for yourself. If you're on PC,  feel free to send me a friend request,  I can hook you up with some bad ass BOS gear. 😂👍
---
The only thing that co op is required is to get some pioneer badges to get the backpack, and when you try to take down a scorched beast queen. Other than that you can solo everything. The co op stuff is doing events  but I would take advantage of player camps they sell stimpacks sometimes for 15 caps, 1 cap per ammo and good plans but you don’t have to team up with them at all
---
spears should be thrown not swipe or stab. change my mind (unless used for a back  scratcher).
---
Agreed! There isnt much the fixer cant take out in a few hits. Paid a pretty penny for a lvl 50...just to find the plans for 50 caps an hr later.
---
Wow, you and I basically have the same Fallout origin story except I enjoyed Fallout  4 for the most part. I received 76 as a bundle with my Xbox and didn't touch it until a week or so ago because I was so sure it was an abomination. I'm extremely happy to say that I absolutely love 76.
---
I don't have the results the previous posters do, but I'm within a couple caps of vault 76 and Camp Adams, so I get fairly regular traffic. Plus I'm not in a nuke zone, and only low level stuff spawns there so my base isn't destroyed every time someone FTs in and doesn't take out the mobs that spawn.
---
EDIT: Ghram is a neutral Npc that will fight with you and trade (he’s a traveling merchant)
---
I want sliding-attack perk card when you slide on the floor 24/7 :]
---
https://youtu.be/q0PuJ-Vx_jY
---
Can we do it for 2 weekends? No memorial day here, but we get the Queen's birthday off the following Monday.
---
For some dumb reason they still run
---
Sounds great, looking forward to an Android version if you eventually figure it out.
---
Fallout 76 is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.
---
I was just thinking this. They are pretty useless. Easily outclassed by everything. But i always carry one anyway. For roleplay reasons. Tho i do love my explosive single action. Even tho it sucks
---
Very excited to see someone using the Resusci Anne outside of the healthcare setting.
---
What system are you playing on? If it's PS4, I'll be happy to give you some plans that are just cluttering up my inventories. You can read them and learn how to build a crapload of new objects.
---
Couple bugs not in the list: When you have 2 guns of the same type in the favorites wheel, on a server hop, one of them disappears from the wheel. It doesn't happen every time in this patch. If it doesn't happen, you lose all the ammo in the current gun equipped instead.
---
Iiiiiiiiiits GRAFTON Daaaaaaayyy
---
Surprised you don't have Serendipity. I'd probably go with that over Ricochet. It's basically a coin flip chance to avoid damage altogether at low health.
---
I carried my team through the alpha portion if the event by tanking and dealing a shitton of damage. What do I get? A ghoul running in and dealing damage, something my VE Gatling Plasma CANT heal.
---
They swept up the last 5% as I watched. No chance at a revive, or ability to respawn, or fast travel.
---
...like why?
---
Welcome back!
---
 I'm sure you probably realize this, but the tolerance level for dupers is really low, especially once word got around about why server stability was really rotten for a while...
---
I'm going to assume you've...shall we say, repented? I'm guessing so or you wouldn't have been so honest about your imposed exile.😂
---
Anyway, a lot has changed and quite a bit has been added and a ton of bugs squashed.  I hope you enjoy your new found freedom! Cheers
---
I would ditch ricoshet in favor of serendipity. 45% chance to avoid all damage while under 30% health is much more useful than reflecting a small portion of ranged damage. Especially when you're playing at a level where you're melting things in seconds, the small amount of reflection just means they die .1 seconds faster, when instead you can have an almost 50/50 chance of avoiding all incoming damage.
---
Other than that, it's a solid build. If there was anything else I'd change it would be ditching aqua boy and getting a 2nd point of fireproof.
---
Please! Work on radio channels would bring so much new life into Appalachia!
---
Bethesda is giving away the Army themed armor paint in the Creation Club for Memorial day (for Fallout 4)... they could do something here too
---
Dont do this bruh idc how wealthy u are
---
On PC at least, if you go to  
---
    %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Photos\CustomID
---
Cats will melt a leg real quick, even with my 10mm.
---
That would be amazing also. Perhaps one that you could place on both structures and on the ground.
---
Anyone have suggestions for killing the boss beast? 3-4 of us couldn't put a dent in it..   I'd get his health down maybe 15% but I swear he regens.
---
Welcome! I'm glad you're enjoying it!
---
Don't hate yourself for liking something. Why would you do that? Cause some people on the internet say you should? Fuck that, and fuck them. Just like what you like, and don't stress about it. 
---
You'll come to love 3 and 4 eventually. They're great games.
---
Drop ricochet for one gun army.  Serendipity doesn’t work in PA.
---
Should be a recipe including Dandy Boy Apples. I would like to see more recipes with prewar food.
---
Vats a leg and you’ll be good. I take them out with a non-legendary 10mm.
---
The second this is on the play store it's getting downloaded IMMEDIATELY!!! This is a fantastic idea and I'm 100% in love with this, I can't wait to see it
---
Quite frankly, I don't see how this constitutes as a "nerf" when it simply is an indicator for player behavior.
---
go buy the prospector maps. three maps, under 350 caps total iirc, go dig up the mounds, have tons of ore. then go do the big excavator thing event, and get even more. takes 30 min.
---
I haven't bought any armor, and I refuse to until they fix the wood armor bug. That said, I've seen dozens of reports of people getting damn good stuff, including previously unattainable 3 star legendary scout armor pieces.
---
The patch replaced both exterior lighting files which are 4 GB each. Apparently that was not supposed to happen and they are reverting the change.
---
They have the adventure mode now which is PvP, so I think the griefers went there?
---
90 reduced weight is never god roll. The third slot has to be beneficial to combat, and the best out of them IE. Reload speed or DR while aiming
---
It means servers are down
---
My setup
---
I’m not sure why this is thought of as the future of the fallout franchise.  Did someone at Bethesda actually say that?
---
Yeah I think items from the vendor should be locked at 50 and not give us 45s.
---
I’ve just decided to tell myself I’ve tripped on a rock, brushed against some thorns or got bitten by an unseen insect.
---
If it ever gets fixed it’ll totally mess with my mind.
---
Found it, thanks!
---
Because this is the newest game and just expands on Fallout 4 features I don't particularly want in a Fallout game.
---
I'm betting its the nuclear winter update.
---
Most important legendary effect to seek out when considering whether to keep or sell off a Grenade Launcher, Fat Man, or similar? REDUCED WEIGHT. ;)
---
So what is class freak mitigating?  Could drop that and snag serendipity and keep
---
I forgot to mention, there is a limit, (like 5 rewards max per month). I'm not reach to pay atoms for everyone xD
---
You get the sight from scraping i don't think npc vendors sell them
---
Having this happen on PC as well.
---
Friend and I are 6/6 for crashes.
---
These artificial limits how much you can sell by daily are boring and idiotic mechanisms, including 25k cap limit and 1400 vendor cap limit. Only companies that don't trust their games economy will use such kind of restrictions.
---
With the right build they're completely viable. I'm not even specced for pistols, but the Bloodied 10mm I carry as a pea shooter does over 130 dmg per shot and I can fire off almost a full mag in VATS. I'm sure if I specced into the pistol perks, demo expert, some of the VATS/crit perks, and managed to find a BE version of the same gun I could probably crank that up to 200+ dmg/shot.
---
YES. Did you know there are like 2 or 3 coal nodes on top of the WS bunker entrance? (not the service entrance, that other entrance). Blew my mind. I really could have used that information a long long time ago
---
The negativity in the beginning ended up being a deterrent to the trolls.  Now only the real fans remain and they know how to have fun.
---
I like how pc suppose to be master race and consoles don't have to download this shit taking up all my space............
---
Also the train station at the top of the world has a potential spawn out the track side door and under the skeleton on the left.
---
45 is the max level for like half the weapons and armor. It would be kind of silly to leave that much off the table.
---
What color asylum uniforms are rare?
---
Until the day Beth STOPS releasing new content, then everyone will be crawling back to PvP.
---
this happens to me ALL THE TIME
---
Also an Android user. :(
---
Not sure what is going on but I logged in this evening, after playing this morning and early afternoon,  and the launcher is pushing a 7.73GB update...unannounced.  very odd!
---
I’ve gotten some good drops from the purveyor, decent armor upgrades for sure, even a couple of god rolls that I traded for good stuff. 
---
I haven’t been so lucky with weapons, but I’ve gotten good ones, just not good for me specifically.
---
Check out the official word from Bethesda .......

---
I can’t seem to get the vertibot or cargobot part of the challenge done.
---
I can't believe they aren't considered bugged. That behaviour turned up in Fallout 4 and they patched it out. But 76? Nah its good.
---
How about a FREE day weekend, get some new blood in here.
---
Cannibal for the PvP execution.
---
Same
---
Wow, not sure how I missed that when I went to look, but thank you much for the link! That's a hell of a large patch for a lighting file. 😂
---
The damn jumping while wiring bug will be the death of me but I love the game, it's community, and direction it's headed. But man... Fuck that glitch for real.
---
That is true. I have never seen one. You would thibj it would be similar to gouls and there would be a lot.
---
I love The Fixer. It gets a bad rap because it doesn’t have a high damage number, but for sneak builds it’s magical. Easily 2/3rds of my shots are sneak crits without even working for it.
---
No then the player base will drop.
---
i realize im a bit late,but i just got my account "info" back (couldnt remember it) and just re-downloaded the game since i had to get a new motherboard.
---
Doubtful that  Bethesda will ever expose any APIs :(
---
Yes
---
Apparently mine is caused by a bug with +250 DR while reloading (which is documented with Bloody as well).
---
I built at a ruined monorail pylon and got the stair bug.  Had to strip the place nearly down to the foundation to re-stair it.  What a disaster.  Moreso that the game considers an unwanted ramp the “start” of my camp, and I can’t for the life of my reset it, not do I dare move because this place requires incredible precision on placing I don’t dare lose.
---
Stairs are the bane of my camp building existence.  I cherish a nearly flat spot (south of sunnytop station) where I have one camp.  Single story, ahhhhhhhhh.
---
I made this same post a few weeks ago. I’m absolutely sick of them. I don’t even do them anymore. Bethesda making it too hard/time consuming to earn atoms.
---
&gt;Serendipity doesn’t work in PA.
---
Um, what?
---
As a military member who isnt off this memorial day... just give everyone a ticket for 3 days of double XP that way we can use it when we have the time. Please.
---
Yeah :( but, one can dream.
---
No worries amigo - glad to help :)
---
It’s a random encounter, so it can happen anywhere.
---
Add me on PSN molehands135. I play with a pretty chill group of guys.
---
I am glad you are loving it and welcome. and have you seen the roadmap by any chance? But fo4 is pretty good, far harbor is one of the best fallout stories imo.
---
The perk serendipity doesn’t proc in Power Armor
---
I’ve played 210 hours and ran into him only once.
---
What console?
---
I remember reading that in various lore sites. Tho, they might have changed this for two reasons : one, Fallout does have compact circuitry and even chips so they probably invented the transistor at some point.
---
Second, the transistor wasn't something discovered by random luck.
---
The Soviet inventor Oleg Losev created the first LED in 1927, and as quoted on Wikipedia " He used these junctions to build solid-state versions of [amplifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_amplifier), [oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator), and TRF and [regenerative radio receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_radio_receiver), at frequencies up to 5 MHz, 25 years before the transistor "
---
"Solid state amplifier"? Isn't that a very complex way to say "transistor" without saying is so Bell doesn't lose the title of discovering it?
---
Anyway, in 1948, Herbert Mataré and Heinrich Welker, two physicians working for the French branch of Westinghouse, also discovered, completely independantly from the Bell Laboratory discovery, the transistor, again.
---
So basically it would take a serious twist of history NOT to discover the transistor.
---
But, as Oleg Losev found out, when there was no interest in his invention, it faded into obscurity.
---
Fallout lore generally say now that instead of focusing on electronics and computer, Fallout science focused on robotics, so progress in the field of electronics were much slower (which doesnt sound that far stretched.... at least for the end of the XXe century? There were high power tubes in televisions up to the early 70's, for example)
---
Anyway, Fallout is basically "how the future was seen in 1950" so obviously there has to be some details that are, as in 1950's fiction, exxagerated.
---
But if you read sci-fi from the 1950 (or want to, start with Isaac Asimov and his Robot cycle) then Fallout really pay homage to it.
---
Cool thanks
---
not sure thats not my thing
---
Just use class freak level 3. I have that and First Aid level 2 and there is no noticeable difference.
---
3000
---
Damn! Stubbed my toe again!
---
I was in my camp crafting stuff and had an Asian bloke start talking to me over voice chat. I don't speak anything but english so used the ??? emote. He then dropped an unyielding 1\* item and started attacking one of my vendors. I got the message that he was looking for some, so I grabbed out all my 1\* unyielding stuff and dropped it for him. He took what he wanted and left the rest. &lt;3 emote and we part ways.
---
Sent 👍🏽
---
Capitalist pig!
---
What are you playing on?
---
I hope you enjoy Mutant slayers 10% damage while aiming reduced weight weapons... If you only want to pay 600 that is.
---
Would still smash that character of real tho
---
Depends on the build. And they shouldn't be excluded because they have a low level character. I'm running heavy weapon explosive on my alt and all I need are grenades and he can prove useful. 
---
Low levels come to SBQ, Imposter, and Free Range all the time. No different with this event.
---
I'd be good if basic attack was swipe whereas power attack was a stab.
---
I would so love to see that
---
Whitesprings takes forever to load - would you say West Tek is just as good as Whitesprings?
---
I had someone try to kill my pet in front of me with the new patch, they did no damage and the pet ignored him.
---
Gotem Ruby, GT:donodonovan
---
Xbox
---
yes at the Free Range event
---
Oh, well darn I’m on ps4 or otherwise I’d help you out
---
Xbox?
---
It will start out as zero then start to reduce by the amount you sell, can be confusing in the beginning
---
I love this idea.
---
Sort of off topic but is it a pipe dream to have our own radio station? Build a dish, power it up. Pick out songs we like. Allow us to broadcast our voice when we choose to alert people about event quests, player gatherings, griefers, etc. Maybe even let us expand our song library by adding song holotapes that are lootable.
---
Yep landview lighthouse
---
I know right the first month of launch I had every color and thought they where common
---
I like it but the only way I could see it working is to have it so that then tuning into your radio station connects them to your "area chat" but only one way so that they cant talk to you.
---
Can’t see your GT will keep looking! Thanks
---
It's a feature of the game it is your character tripping it happens most when running it was in FO4
---
It's not as many mobs, but still decent. Dunno about loading time, though, it all takes forever to load in the first time on a server for me.
---
O ok
---
Do the maps differ dor different platforms?

serendipity doesnt work in PA. use class freak to have one or two vats shots when needed.
---
ricochet over onegun unless SBQ
---
Still counting against chameleon
---
Adventure is mostly pve. Survival is pvp.
---
serendipity does not work in power armors. endurance is malleable.
---
Exactly
---
serendiptiy dont work in PA :(
---
That’s what I do.  Load in at the golf course. Jump on the bus. Go get a drink, use the bathroom, maybe make a snack. Watch some funny videos. Then I’m usually good to go.
---
The airport got reworked, can tell you that the key or keycard is in the cellar.
---
This isn't new in patch 9.5, there have been documented reports since patch 6. It's extremely easy to cause this bug with an automatic tesla rifle
---
My controller is glitching out, it's at the top of the lighthouse
---
Alt+F4
---
The software and hardware can have problems if you force the shutdown.
---
This is true, but I haven't been lucky enough to get some of the more OP weapons to do that. And also my point in stating their level is they've played enough hours to know how it affects people if they one shot a boss/legendary.
---
I bought nuka grape and 556 in mass quantities before when it was everywhere cheap, I didn’t dupe or anything, I only made it to level 50 DAYS before my account was lost so it’s not like I was making use of any high value weapons/armor/junk, I just didn’t want to worry about caps and ammo for a while, I know you won’t believe me, but most “duper’s” are really just friends of friends of friends that got caught in the cross fire of “hey do you wanna make max caps real fast?”
---
I mean I can kill an assaultron in one clip of my auto rifle, but if I get tag teamed they can kill me faster. Nothing else does damage to me like that.
---
I am only lvl 30 but my pipe relover does 62 dmg. The lever action i just found does 79. I have max rifleman and 1 expert. 
---
Crazy how good the pipe revolver can be. And cheap. Perfect side arm
---
My CAMP on the map has changed its name. Also shows my new name under the Social menu. 
---
I'm on PC here.
---
I’ve never been quiet about my exploiting a Bethesda game. Personally I think the inventory wipe was justified but *denying me access to my game* is a step too far, thanks for being so welcoming!
---
Thanks so much!!!! Xoxoxoxo
---
I've been using a quad and the Furious Tesla rifles both automatic 4 weeks no the bug just happened today for the first time fighting ghouls
---
Aww man, what a totally original and novel idea that isn’t ever 1 out of 4 posts.
---
Maybe I've been lucky?  I've been playing almost daily since launch on Xbox and have run into griefers two or three times in total.  Weird!
---
I've only used a plasma gatling for a couple days, but I never figured out why I'd end up with 20+ 5% cores when I was done with a SBQ. Like, use the whole thing and toss it. All those nearly empty cores weigh too much to hold onto, why does the game just lower them to 5%?
---
NP, I was looking for it for my buddy and I found it first hop!
---
Actually,  I do believe you, I've heard the same from multiple people. I did really mean the welcome back. I know the penalty was Uber harsh, but let's face it, it was out of control and Bethesda had to go nuclear. 
---
I hope your new adventure is less perilous! Good luck out there
---
cool,sorry had to go afk for like a hour and whats your name on 76?
---
I’m 97% TH melee. I have 50 or so Melee bobbles that give me an extra 20% Damage for two real time hours in game with curator perk card equipped. Brings my Grognak to over 600 Damage with full health (I don’t do Bloodied, quite the exact opposite actually) enabling me to one hit kill pretty much all super mutants, ghouls, including glowing ones, scorched, and bugs. 
---
Sure it’s only a 20% bump, but why the hell not? I paid like 50 caps each for them. Whatevs.
---
Yes. Would use regularly and greatly appreciate.

why are you required to sign up to use the app?
---
Seems like bloody is pretty popular. 
---
Bloody explosive for 2*
---
Anto armor is another paired with explosive
---
Thanks! I somehow missed that when I went out to Bethesda. Net.
---
Hell yeah thanks man, the attitude on my last posts has been nothing but salt
---
Yeah it's a while thing now. It's up down up down (grab the card key) back up, up again and go all the way to the back to the right.
---
Still....
---
I was trying to make a build around trapper armor and this legendary effect and only realised after I gathered all the gear that they didn't actually work as intended.
---
I had the exact opposite last week. Captured and held the ammo factory for 4 hours with two other friends. Our highest level team mate was level 42, then a level 140 player came in and slaughtered us. Tried messaging them and asked if we could work together and share the factory. Then he had a level 150 player join him and considered the slaughter till we signed off
---
No. I just don't do them :-)
---
Fun fact about the camera, if you have it out and change photomode poses, it'll glitch you around the map. Totally unexpected
---
Seems a glitch maybe. It was definitely not using the cores up as I reloaded. Seems the opposite. Also I noticed three of the cores were “selected” as if the game was confused on what was actually loaded into the weapon. 
---
Aggravating when you reload what is supposed to be 500 shots and it’s 250 because it’s loading a partial core when there are 15 full ones.
---
So which build(s) would you recommend for all content solo?
---
Yeah it's kind of annoying but I also use prime cores, so it saves on resources, just annoying to keep reloading so frequently since my cores are at 500 and these are at like 50-100. I usually drop the low charges for weight issues.
---
I used to jump on the bus but one day it exploded so now I jump on the roof.
---
Facts!
---
I don't know anymore. I wish Bethesda would take many ideas and systems from other games. I love the game just not some of the headaches we have to go through. And I've been through almost all of them since BETA testing.
---
Downloaded the game on my mobile hotspot during deployment. Got my next shift off and then had the issue of the download being deleted. Worst of all, I had to purchase more data and miss a gaming session because of it. Stayed up late for nothing. It was 2 Pm for some folks while it was 10 Pm for me trying to get the data purchased again and trying to download it again. 😟 $47 down the drain.
---
ohhhh Clothing should be separate, that I'm onboard with!
---
The armor has 12 rad resistance but equip it and your rad resistance should be 12+25... At least for me it is
---
Where does the keycard go?
---
Still waiting for the Queen to drop me a prime receiver for it.
---
I had something similar happen with Site Charlie codes. I'd look at one, and a copy would appear in my inventory.
---
Thanks!  
---
"Mostly band-aided"...    
---
RMA love and back up parts
---
Guns is TSE, Bloodied +Explosive, Anti Armor +Explosive, Furious +Fast Fire Rate.
---
Melee is Bloodied +Swing Speed, Instigating +Swing Speed, Furious +Swing Speed
---
If you're on PS4 I can slap one on there for ya later this weekend or next week.
---
Luckily the codes don’t have weight. The cores are a pound each.
---
Ok thx
---
Are  the medium generator plans and water purifier ones still there or did they get moved
---
A regular legendary one will occasionally spawn at cliffwatch.
---
Thanks but I’m on PC. Very cool to offer though!
---
Kyle21gunz. I play solo and my schedule is wack but we can chill whenever, I don’t mind helping.
---
To the door blocking the stairs to upper floor.

Right on! Added!

Thanks man! Cant wait!

Because that is the only way for the app to allow you to make posts in the Discussion Screen , Keep track of anything you upload to the guide/atomic shop, award points, detect if you are a premium user and follow other users.
---
I built a character to use the .44 survival reward from a while ago +vats hit -vats action cost. Speed demon slows up the reloads, concentrated fire to the head. If I can just find a bloodied .44, have a bloodied black powder pistol doing 900ish and I must say the reload is reasonable compared to the black powder rifle &amp; The Dragon.
---
Awesome! Was looking for my team mate too! Been looking for 2 weeks! Just let me know if you need help with your tadpole badges!! Happy to take one for the team!
---
Thx
---
I get the item floating msg all the time exiting build menu and going back in tends to fix it for me
---
All signs point to possibly. Also, they farmed the game out to "Bethesda" Game Studios Austin. Which I assume is just a couple of hipsters they hired at a bar on 6th street while on one of Todd's benders. 
---
Lived there 5 years, totally allowed to call y'all hipsters.
---
White picket fences? Yes pls
---
I'm having a hard time building the perfect character for me since I can't be the overpowered person I want to be. Currently level 53 but not completely happy with my current build. Haven't gotten any new cards or moved points yet. I like to be the jack of all trades but they've made it pretty impossible to do that. I mainly play with friends but play alone sometimes.
---
I believe that one only spawns as a noxious one
---
Having a similar problem with government supply holotapes. I keep trying to sell some, or remove them from sale, or even pull what's in my stash to my inventory, and they keep duplicating in either places.
---
When's the next time you are doing it
---
I miss the stretchy bois.
---
yeah but 95% you will scrap again
---
Collector 'only' needs the Unstopables magazines, the magazine missing from the game must be a different category because I completed collector.
---
I say 'only' because as far as I can tell most mag spots spawn a random one from the ~100 different mags, I only completed it because I constantly hunt for magazines.
---
Spent a couple hundred hours getting to the last couple of magazines, only to realize one of them is just an category counter bug, 9/10 even though each magazine in the sub list is checked off, and the other mag is the one apparently missing from game (can't recall what off the top of my head).
---
Also of note maybe is I have several hundred hours of gameplay, played all events many times over and haven't got plasma grenade plans. 
---
Another player here says with 1000 hours he hasn't found one
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brba8d/plan_for_plasma_grenade_myth_or_reality/
---
And someone here saying that looking at the game data it isn't in the usual grenades and mines list, and though it does appear in the quest rewards list for ash heap region but that list isn't actually referenced by any quests.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnz874/anyone_know_where_i_can_get_the_plan_to_make/
---
That interactive map though.
---
I'm sure I've seen video of it working in PA. From Oxhorn, iirc.
---
I’m on pc and can put a primed receiver on if your interested. The primed plasma cores require  yellowcake flux to craft however. But you do get added damage and durability.
---
What mutations do you have?
---
Uggg have also experienced agro’s at Whitesprings. Block them for the session!!
---
Bloody builds arent that op they cant even 1 shot anything while others can 1 shot them. Full health builds definitely beat bloodied lol
---
Why does no one do the objective in this event?  I feel for U guys. I don’t understand , why do the event if ur not gonna actually do it?
---
It’s been happening a lot
---
Is the one from IGN
---
I've only met wonderful people so far. Was only player killed for a monument once. The big mining rig. Honestly if he would have asked I would have gladly let him have it. This game has a fantastic community that I love being around.
---
well if that were the case i'd def use it. i only dotn because ricochet procs and serendipity doesnt.
---
Head out camp mode and go back into it. Usually does the trick for me. I think it's just a game glitch
---
I'm all for a white version. My porch has the Whitespring carpet and white patio furniture, it would be perfect.
---
After my first roll was a godroll weapon, I’ve been going for nothing but 3* armor to upgrade two characters. It’s been a mixed bag for me. A few wood pieces. Most armor on both characters have been upgraded. The rest go back in the wood chipper if they aren’t worth putting in a vending machine. 
---
I’ll keep going with armor rolls, since I’m mostly happy with my weapons.
---
Spears are used to swipe too irl I'm pretty sure, Not as effective as a stab but useful none the less to stun and weaken
---
Umm  no game is already too easy.
---
Since I have to login every time I want to run a Bethesda game, I won't buy another Bethesda game.
---
Concentrated fire, Action boy, Critical Savvy, Better Criticals, Four leaf clover, Penetrator, Gun Fu, Psychopath, Mysterious stranger, Grim reapers sprint.
---
There are lots of perks that help with vats, you will mainly be doing high Perception Agility and Luck when doing a vats build.
---
Also get the eagle eyes mutation and any legendary weapons with vats effects.
---
Don't join groups
---
There is an occasional bug where it will show as 0, but will fix itself as soon as you buy or sell something from the vendor.
---
Also, as others said there's no different cap pool for different vendors now, just one big pool shared by all the vendors.
---
I get a whole different experience, I have levels one hundreds attacking me and my friend. Me being level 25 and my friend being level 15
---
True but my post isn't just about bloodied lists. Its about optimizing your perks to be viable without relying entirely on assassin/sentinel gear or stuff like that. Of course having those helps a lot but even on less optimal gear, it can be done.
---
This is why I love bloodied melee builds, assaultrons are not a joke to me.
---
No way is it the most iconic.
---
That’d be the 10mm or That Gun
---
Probably tomorrow!
---
Let me know when. I'm absolute trash but I'll try my best
---
Maybe some people are having a hard time searching for the search function.
---
Starting to feel the same, I have great armors but trying to perfect them
---
I just want to hear one shout "Imma firin' my laser' when they do it.

A robot that follows you around and collects stuff for you and also helps attack enemies and you can also get it to broadcast radio over it's speakers 
---
And if you're in a search area it gives you assistance to find the item lever box quest etc.
---
...inspect the object in your inventory. Take a screenshot. Put it on imgur or something. I need to see this.
---
Fallout is not a franchise that supports those things in any capacity.  Expecting them to suddenly shift towards that is an expectation nobody established but yourself.
---
Did you have pacifist on?
---
Did you have one of the mutations that does damage to other players?
---
Were any of your teammates flagged for PVP with those players?
---
this game was a waste of money
---
Yes. I've also had it happen with protectrons. I seem to get a lot more legendarys when it happens. But it's only ever been in the club house
---
Ikr?!
---
Might as well use a minigun and 5 shot it
---
The other day I started the tadpole scouts quests (I haven't played since a month or two after launch). I saw the "revive a teammate" part and thought that's gonna be hard because I run solo. I'm cleaning the lake muck when another player shows up in the scout uniform and helps me out with fighting a mirelurk queen. Then he motions me to come over to him, then starts throwing grenades at his feet. I realize what he's doing and do the same after I revive him. We had a friendly goodbye and he went on his way. I love the 76 community. People heard "base building survival game" and thought Rust but we got friendly weirdos and scouts honor.
---
Dunno if it still happens but there used to be a couple who ran about, her in an asylum uniform, him is a Nuka Cola power armor, handing out Nuka Colas to randos. 
---
I love this kinda stuff.
---
Don't forget about the Gutsy's, level 111 in power armor, and level 22 Gutsys still manage to fuck me up.
---
That would be great. Going about your own business in the middle of nowhere when you get run upon by Ol Saint Nick of the Apocalypse with tidings of good joy!
---
Happens to me mostly against super mutants, but I did get it in the last stage of a nuke silo. Ghouls probably die too quickly
---
Combat rifle, With commando perks, and less AP cost.

You can do this on the combat knife fyi. Not sure about the sledge, but sounds like that works too
---
Yeah I stopped playing a few hours ago because it was outright unplayable on PC. I was doing campfire tales with a crossbow and kept teleporting around every few seconds. Impossible to hit anything
---
No one was fighting
---
You have a face that only your mother could love

Except your family is already dead in the great war
---
No

Maybe try not to be a duping scumbag this time around
---
Damned good comment sir
---
Nowhere near most iconic, if anything that would be the OG alien blaster before it fell from glory. Maybe even the gauss pistol or 5.56 pistol. It would be nice to get it back though, surely it's in the game files. And we have the radium rifle, it's not like they would care about lore breaking even if it somehow did that
---
Ah thank you so much! None ever seems to die in the water!! &lt;3
---
Juicehead told me there another active glitch, where’s your camp because I have a few friends with level 5 legendaries?
---
Well it wouldn’t be lore breaking really. It could just be a different handgun design favored by people who like stealth.
---
I cant imagine soldiers being able to swipe with any efficiency in a phalanx. Spear is such a loose term. Like viking spears had a huge blade. I could see that swiping. But thats not the spear in game. A naginata could be cosidered a spear. And that is definately made for swiping.
---
Camera's are really easy to find now.  They are all over in containers and chests, I found three yesterday and mended one and put a lens on it.
---
I don't know if for me this is because I had one when they first came out or for the possum photography  challenges.  I was going to sell them but they cannot be sold.
---
It been hit twice today and i got a good haul of legendary weapons and armor
---
Haven't seen the protections myself but the liberators a dozen times over the months. Random chance. Still get legendaries. They can sometimes run and hide though so it's a pain.
---
Hope you get banned again with that clown shoe GT
---
I agree with this, it's a big map with a relatively low player count. I'm definitely not on board with adventure is for PVE and survival is for PVP mindset though. The story, missions, PVE etc are a core part of the game which should not be relegated to the sideline just because survival mode has unrestricted PVP.
---
They should've done it with the Raider Rose signal.
---
...wow, that's pretty good damage for a stick.
---
Me too needing some constantly players

But why? You don’t play anything else?
---
I’ve finished Red Dead and played lots of R6 Siege in the mean time, maybe ~10 games of Fortnite and ~10 days of Borderlands 2, I just like being an internet dick
---
I take issue with the idea that the most iconic gun in Fallout is the one based on the gun from Bladerunner.
---
Yah. Tonight. I was loading into the game at the Purveyor and suddenly the legendary toxic sheepsquatch ran over to greet me from outta nowhere.
---
So you can’t cut it as a ruthless dickhead on Red Dead Online?
---
What is this supposed to prove? You clearly attack him back just before your death. You accepted a duel. If he killed you previously and was Wanted, your unstable isotope mutation would damage him and open up a duel as well.
---
I only see it at the end of a nuke, after the cloud is gone.  Always thought it signified the transition from glowing ghouls to bots, and then the normal bots?
---
I'm on PS4 but I lagged on during project paradise, I also just got some teleporting super mutants
---
I had a much higher legendary drop rate than with ghouls. I’m level 128 and haven’t ever seen anything other than ghouls there, which is why it was so odd to me.
---
You know how the hot-swap button lets you swap to your previous weapon? Let me show TWO weapons!! One on each side of my back, or each hip, or one on my back, one on my hip. Maybe have my grenades appear on my belt? 
---
Please fix all bugs before even thinking about this one, please and thank you. Like patch 100.5 at least.
---
Hey, are you still willing to craft one? 😎
---
well, the truth hurts.

I've never seen a toxic one before so it might be new

I think Red Dead Online is kinda half hour-hot shit, I liked the story a lot better, I think the gameplay of 76 is *good* I mean it’s multiplayer Fallout, but I really play it for the social space, I’ve made three handfuls of friends waiting in line at somebody’s C.A.M.P. to buy a plan or doing scorchbeast queen to not get a plan. The way the players *interact* (or at least used to interact) with the game is fascinating to me, and I can’t wait to jump back into it
---
Sigh... I feel that. New building pieces as an update, new walls, new cosmetic earnables in events, new wallpapers for interiors, ways to let us connect building areas together with teammate friends so we can at least build closer to each other and cooperative work to make larger settlement kind of structures. 
---
There has been a lot of cool ideas about Towns and rebuilding permanent changes in the world from large scale world changing live service event arcs. There is so much potential for things to do with the bones of this game.
---
Recommend building all extractors and a tiny bed/campfire/water/bench type of base before leaving. Thus a stranger could resupply there.
---
Good use for the Tent-style player camp.
---
P.C.
---
What is this weapons perks? At lvl 325 i have not seen i think . Or i got a lvl 30 i threw once . I bought plan so cheap off a vendor
---
What platform
---
Does your second set of stairs have a foundation on them? If there is a set of stairs that goes to the top floor and it has a foundation, you should be able to delete the other set of stairs that goes to the top floor.
---
Yeah I don’t get it.. if he attacks him back (which he did) it initiates PvP &amp; the other player just killed him first.. am I missing something? 
---
PSA: If you don’t want to PvP never hit them back, let them run around punching you like an idiot I promise you won’t die..
---
I do that too. Just got the factory to help get me a bonus few rounds. Running automatic weapons is hard on my stockpile.
---
It's an expectation that comes with multiplayer roleplaying games that focus on progression. 
---
This thread is pretty much proof that the progression system has no actual appeal. The people who like the survival stuff feel like it gets in their way and just want to be able to change builds to be able to use whatever cool thing t hey just found. The people who like mechanical roles for characters aren't even here anymore because the game doesn't offer it. I just happen to think that it's pointless to de-claw the progression/build system in some half assed way where everyone just respect all the time. Either dump it completely or make it worth something.
---
If you appreciate the player community, why are you so intent on duping? It makes things worse for players who don’t.
---
Improved stealth and faster sneaking moving speed
---
I have aqquired a few good 10mm pistols i use for fun when im boored. If pistol perks was under perception and tank killer kind of perk i would run  pistols much more
---
I just want them unique in being the only weapon thats a melee and a throwable, is that too much to ask?
---
I have spare commendations aswell.
---
A normal sladge without a head, it is the same as your knife. Its a basic stick.
---
He was attacking in hopes that you had a mutation that would  spark off a fight.   You did and it opened up a valid pvp snd he won.  Get rid of the mutation.
---
Bethesda cant fix bugs, that's what fan modded patches are for. Its amazing how far a company can get with shoddy coding.
---
Ok , thanks 👍 got to craft one if its similar to the combat
---
I totally agree! Why make others life miserable when you can go play with people who want to PVP! Honestly I can't wait for the promised PVE and private servers. If they're still coming.
---
No just can’t crossplay platforms
---
You sparked off on him and he killed you.  All legit.
---
Side-step and shoot
---
Pro tip: Basically side-stepping in a circle around the enemy and shooting is the most powerful tactic against most ai in the game, particularly large enemies.
---
Can i also have the upper floors become regular floors that sit on the ground again,
---
Yeah i wanna get to level 300. lol
---
I have some gatling sight in my stash. You on pc?
---
Shout out to the guy that PERFECTLY was tagging enemies during uranium fever. We we're both high level. Didn't say a word to each other but both politely let each other tag the legendaries as they spawned. 
---
Though a solid amount of people don't do this...
---
I had a random glitch where it wouldn’t let me place a floor tile above a set of stairs. It would either tell me the object was floating or needed support. I had to go into edit mode and flip the stairs backwards, then place the tile, then turn the stairs back around.
---
The worst 2 things I've run into was on 2 orn3 occasions some guy shooting or bashing me sometimes upwards of 10 minutes and making the pvp emote.
---
And the only other remotely toxic, griefing, or annoying thing I've seen depending on their motive for doing it are the dude who one shot legendaries.
---
Otherwise I've met helpful players, had random team ups, and funny moments.
---
The one thing I think Bethesda doesn't get enough credit for with this game was really thinking through and cutting off the griefing that's usually common in these types of games.
---
Step One - Build Heavy Build
---
Step Two - Get TSE Mini-Gun Max Level / Secure The Keys Reznov
---
Step Three - Mod Accelerated Barrel Onto Gun
---
Step Four - Aim
---
Step Five - Hold Trigger Until 500 Round Mag Is Empty. 
---
Step Six - Realize Target Is Gone.
---
Repeat
---
TSE style
---
As long as it has a clean pre war and a falling apart post war variant. Depending on my mood for my camp I like to go full nice home or post war hovel.
---
Jesus Christ
---
That would be roughly 400 rounds. I seriously doubt it but I'd love to have one
---
I keep finding them all over the place recently.... they are in random toolboxes usually.
---
75 x 4 is 300 rounds but same and are there any mods for it or no?
---
Please read my other comments on this post, I’m not a malicious player, just a sarcastic asshole that treated the game a little bit too much like a sandbox for Bethesda’s liking! I love the game, and I’m pissed that I’m “suspended” after putting in weeks of hard work *actually* leveling to 50, if all goes well this will just be a temporary account until I can finally play on Big Haydog with the sweet house hanging above Uranium Fever. I made the gamer tag that out of P U R E   I R O N Y. Personally I think that the people making Kent off this game are the lowest of the low and should get a job, I just got SICK of the 35 cap tax to EVERY vendor on top of the ammo I was wasting on super mutants that dropped me nothing but gunpowder. *I was in the trenches with you when server disconnects were a problem. I was there getting one shotted by level 269’s. I hated it just as much as you did. I’m not a “bad” player, most of us weren’t (!!!), I’m just the guy that set.playeratt.speed-&gt;100’ed Morrowind. I made the mistake of thinking that would be allowed in Fallout 76.*
---
Had a guy 2 shot me with a railway rifle at Poseidon. I have a full set of vangaurd bos armor, so that was kind of bullshit. He didn't claim the workshop, just took my junk. Jokes on him, all i had was a roll of toilet paper and 1 raw fertilizer.
---
It has started happening to me at vendors as well.
---
How can it do double if the modifier for TS is only 25%?
---
Yea usually back out and back into build mode. Sometimes when it gets real fussy I join a new server, usually fixes it. Make sure there's no wires or anything in the way too
---
Last few days for me
---
Hey!! I thought i was imagining things!
---
I thought it was a bug or something where the patch deleted itself and redownload.
---
Glad to know it's actually new content.
---
I like letting it run while i dig them up.
---
I just played Fallout 3 and it was so awesome to see assault rifle going on my back when I put it away. It would be nice to have this for rifles, pistols and melee weapons
---
I recently rebuilt and excavator arms for mining lead and decided to just build a whole suit... this mod would be perfect especially in lucky hole mines.
---
I'm on xbox since beta and I've had 2 or 3 greifers  in that time. I might have just been lucky.
---
Having trouble placing those coal spots in my head. Got a picture to help out maybe? If not that's okay the informations still great.
---
I’m on Xbox how much you want for it? I’m running an explosive build
---
yup definitely a good idea :)
---
Not necessarily. Before the legendary forge arrived it was possible to buy decent 3* items from vendor bots. I suppose now such good deals are also available at vending machines in traders' camps.
---
Or they can just tap enemies once and then let others to do the job...
---
It is/was a TV show. (Idk if it’s still on though).
---
Something that is confusing to me is in the trailer they released a while back they showed a mirelurk queen boss. I know it's not likely but I want to believe if you get a perfect run with 60+ on all habitats than you get her to spawn and maybe get formula Q out of it.
---
Agreed. Having the vending machines and fermenter tied to storage is lame.  800 lbs would be fine if those weren’t tied to it.
---
Glad for this! Hated using my account name. Picked it somewhat hastily during Beta days thinking I'd still like it later on in life.
---
When we add people now though, do we add via account name or display name?
---
Lets post about it a thousand more times. I dint think they saw any of the others.
---
But bloody mess is such a better perk
---
Ah, I was hoping this was a new chems thing :P
---
Not gonna lie. An artkos backpack irl would be cool
---
true. even 1000 lbs (haha not kg) would be enough for now until they add more items with high weight
---
Load outs would be great, but how do we address the problem of point allocation?
---
As a restauraunt helpdesk worker who got lucky enough to only work one day of the 3-day weekend :
---
This here 2-day weekend
---
I don't think there's a quad version of any of the automatic heavy weapons.
---
Currently I have a tick, radstag, wolf, yao, owlet, stingwing, and wendigo.
---
But I have seen a bloatfly and blood bug
---
And guns should kill anyone with a spear before they are close enough to stab or swing it, pffft
---
After seeing it on a post here, I'm stocking toilet paper and fertilizer.  😉  Just for shites und giggles.
---
It's only mildly irritating and funny as hell.
---
Well it’s certainly more iconic than one based on James Bonds old side arm.
---
I’m on Xbox as well and I do typically defend and honestly in my couple hundred hours I have only run into “griefers” once and it was in survival. I put quotations as we were in survival and we had camps relatively close to one another. This resulted in a battle leveling my camp and me trying to attack theirs. In the end we offered a peace treaty and traded legendaries. Still occasionally see those guys online to this day. Never really had a negative player experience except for the 3 star kill stealers, objective-phobics and silent types, which ultimately aren’t that bad.
---
I don't thing its irritating at all. Its funny.
---
I'm now inspired, I want to leave fertilizer and a molotov on doorsteps.
---
This is not a bad idea.
---
Ore sniffing as a chem effect would be awesome.
---
Miss your input at work in Gamestop but glad to have your input here for FO76. Please get this idea out to the development team.
---
Big - no, hu-fucking-mungous yikes.
---
Well hello there, stranger.
---
I also think that with the addition of vending machines, we need more stash space. Because now we are holding onto more stuff to sell it and it takes up more room
---
Probably here
---
Kinda how it is in PvP right now.
---
I don't die and I run a bloodied build.
---
Thanks, didn’t known if there was a particular subreddit, or a subreddit of a subreddit if that even exists.
---
Yep, right here. Try to set up a time to do it. This way the respondents will know when to be there. Maybe even set up who's going to be doing what.
---
Stop crying and get your own one shot build if it bothers you that much. Or play events solo.
---
Incoming! Thanks!
---
One of the most fun guns in the game, all in pa heavy gun build. Since I got a insitgating auto loading gernade launcher I don't even use my AA missle launcher or bloodied fatman
---
Same for me on PC.  I've just seen a few videos from guys on console getting griefed, guess it's not as prevalent as they portrayed. 
---
One of the funniest ones I watched though was a guy found a griefer's base and moved his camp within artillery range.  And built a bunch of big guns.
---
Him and his buddy then sneak to the griefer's camp and lobbed a bunch of the smoke grenades and wrecked this guys camp.  Quite hilarious.
---
Yay! 😃
---
You can mod it to fully auto
---
I've been saying this since the camera came out. I'd love shots we take thru the menu to be only for loading screens, and a second small album for the in game camera that users can view only thru a camp album decorative book.
---
I had a guy just build me a basketball court the other day. Explained it could be played with grenades.
---
They did fix this, and it's been unfixed since last update. Happens on melee weapons and my rifle as well.
---
To my knowledge that only starts after you get the original and quest from a dead tourist.
---
Then you should probably remove many other mods. The Excavator armor should do one and one thing only.
---
Question: Why does that matter?
---
You should also post what timezone, platform, and time you can do it.
---
Or bring Kelo back from FO4, "we got some smooth tunes for you baby."
---
I can confirm it works, found out myself accidentally.
---
Can't you just kill the game rather than the computer? Or even leave world?
---
Good for you.
---
Isnt the spear heavy attack stab?
---
It's a huge accomplishment for Bethesda. Servers didn't crash!
---
Jokes aside, good job!
---
Maybe you should give a try to The Sims.
---
There was a nuclear war some year ago, and you think about paneling?
---
Oh boo fucking hooo
---
got mine to charleston vendor
---
I agree. They fucked with the collision too. Spent 4 hours building my tree house and after the update i accidentally delete my wall and now i can place it back. For fucks sake. Give us something to work with. You literally have fallout 4 to pull shit from.
---
Okay guys the reason behind this is so you dont use it as a stash box for that would be expanding your stash limit by an obscene amount .
---
Only be able to preset with the points you currently have - any point allocation should still be done by you.
---
Yes. Everybody else. 
---
We're especially tired of the "Take a camera picture of a Graham at a camp fighting an alien in a radstorm at 5:54pm on a Tuesday" camera challenges.
---
So true gold will be worthless and bullets will be currency
---
That's no fun. I price all my stuff nicely, but have 1 random, worthless item at 20k caps. A token. Just to see if someone will buy it
---
They don't even have to add it into the game - it already exists in the game - the problem is it only exists for workshops. You can define where you appear within the workshop, so it shouldn't be that hard for them to code the same mat for player camps and attach it to the players camp fast travel point.
---
Nah they fucked with the building collision. Ive tried 3 separate days with multiple log in attempts. Ruined my tree house build. The time I invested all for them to just fuck it all up with unwanted fixes while ignoring actual problems with the game.
---
How about stop telling people how to build their base as you see fit.
---
Well now. This is a first. Guess it shouldn't be too hard to make it happen then.
---
Need to keep those dicks out of your hands
---
Did you just assume his gender? Triggereddddddd!
---
I've seen a double mini gun. But that's the only one I know of
---
Stimpacks are 1lbs each right ?
---
I’d rather they just fix their shit so we don’t have long load times OR invisible enemies.
---
I got it during the campfire tales event im pretty sure.
---
Nope PS4 here too. I've only really ever been half griefed once. Was busy rebuilding CAMP after moving,and had a guy show up in a clown mask. Took a couple of shots at me to test the water, so i thumb down emote, he made the throwing up emote to indicate his displeasure and left.
---
What build and weapons are you running?
---
PC, so most likely not what everyone else owns :/
---
Ye I’m on ps4
---
So glad someone said it haha
---
This would be ideal.
---
Joining your world now. Need to grab something formal from my camp first.
---
awesome! thank you for helping out (Y) I'll head over to Bubbles to go grab some nuka colas in the meantime :P
---
Well it depends on the weapons, but since they released enclave armors as legendary, then it be nice to have them all max lvl 50 at least, it would hurt all the dupe weapons that are stuck at lvl 45.
---
Put a chair or another item they can interact within reach of their spawn. If they click use the item will pull them out. Helpful until they fix this without rebuilding.
---
I haven't even checked my ticket after me responding a lot about the missing 500 atoms lol.
---
I downloaded mine, so did I just waste all that time downloading a patch then.....?
---
Hi, lifelong fallout fan here, been playing since 1. This game is totally worthy of the title and is one of the best entries into the series. 
---
The people just hating on it and not playing don't know what they are missing, and sadly there really is no reaching them until they just log on and start playing.   
---
The game has its flaws, but then again the entire franchise does.
---
I agree, loadouts would be beyond cool. I think  most people who ask for them want points included, which would kind of ruin the system if you ask me. I personally would love to switch between an adventure/combat build and a c.a.m.p. /crafting build. that
---
Just to verify, that worked for you right?
---
Agreed! The 10mm is iconic!
---
Sure did! Many thanks, I've been chasing down people all day around WS snapping pictures of them to no avail, finally you came along though and saved the day :)
---
 
---
I'm doing the "take all the workshops around Appalachia"-run now to find hopefully Grahm soon. If you want, I can send you a PM when I eventually do (Y)
---
That would be great. Thank you!
---
He looks like Freddy Mercury
---
I hear talk that the pipe bolt action pistol benefits from both the rifleman and pistol perks.  I guess because you can mod it with a rifle stock.
---
Now this is what I've heard, I think I'll test it tomorrow since I have a couple of pistol perks.
---
This is barely a multiplayer game, and it has zero progression.
---
Just strafe in a curve around them while firing
---
How much you paying? Maybe I'll start doing the quest everyday
---
Or maybe a beep timer signal , so we know its gonna blow ?
---
Yeah, I do love that pistol.  Certainly loads faster than my Dragon!
---
Just build a stash box at the workshop and store all your junk. Then you don’t lose anything
---
Haha that what I saw
---
"Good morning, Vault-Tec calling!"
---
I can do like 10 caps each? I honestly dont know the worth but I know the quest is a PAIN
---
It's not bad you can store the items in stash then only have to find a few. I already dropped mine from today but I'll hit you up when I have a supply.
---
O.o umm it's foundations they spawn in and its far down below in a creak. It's rather hard to make it happen for them.
---
Definitely! Let me know! I'd love to have grenade dealer lmao
---
Totally agree, I'd like to sell so many things but just don't have enough stash space. I have four vending machines and only use two... 
---
Also, I think we need higher carry weight for power armor / better ways to mod it. Because it seems like an imbalance between, since I can mod my normal character to carry lots of weight (deep pocketed everywhere, backpack) but ones I'll enter the power armor I'm too heavy even with calibrated shocks.
---
i have a TS pipe revolver with all rifle and pistol perks maxed and am at 186 dmg per shot and a pipe bolt action with 220+ish dmg. the pipe revolver gets more shots in at the same time, so i am using this. combined with stealth/sneak? you have 2.xish the dmg - so for me at lvl 77 its a good value.
---
Read it all, and in general agree with everything.
---
I too hope that one day a few npc's start appearing, maybe just roaming traders. Or some living raiders at the raider camps, Maybe a vault full of people.
---
Can confirm. This guy is the man.
---
I wouldn't go that far but I dont use them so. I'll start putting them in my vending and if you see me on check my supply.
---
So would a West Tek canvas bag.  I could probably fit a power armor helmet in it.
---
My freind has a tse lmg that he got the first week of 76 but i think it osnt possible anymore
---
You know who else would accuse a commie of covering their own communism? A synth.
---
Spears need Larger range. 
---
They are literally the best general use melee weapon mankind has created, but Bethesda treats them as inferior to a sword, ludicrous.
---
Too late to the party , someone on YouTube all ready launched 3 nukes at the same time and nothing happened.
---
*muffled screaming*
---
*Name floating above concrete block*
---
My camp was completely destroyed on release day by two level 38 players in PA. I was only like level 10 at the time (played the beta but I was a late starter).
---
Since then though, I've had a mostly positive experience with other players, which is refreshing considering I play the Xbox version of DayZ; everyone on that game shoots on sight.
---
Finally got one. It actually looks pretty dope. No clipping as far as I can tell. Looks very WW1 battlefield doc. I'll see if I can get a pic if you want.
---
I don't know if it belongs here but I'm not quite sure what to do. 
---
Remember the fire breathers mask? Well, they must've made it do that certain pieces of clothing don't have durability anymore or something along the line of that in a recent patch. Because my mask was broken before this happened, its stuck in a limbo of being broken but unable to repair it.
---
I have 8 points in luck. 3 for bloody mess, 2 for starched genes, 3 for class freak.
---
Correctional Officer here, we never close. Shitty hours, shitty pay. But I meet people with the most fantastic stories.
---
I beleive you are better off submitting 1 at a time and the chances for dropping Rare loot remains the same regardless of quantity. You will get extra xp and caps if you drop of more than 1 which caps out at 4.
---
 I will caveat this by saying I only did multiple drops 10 times, and frankly that's no where near enough to be definitive.
---
The ball is in bethesda's park. I think we'll see NPCs by the time of Wastelanders DLC and tbh there are a lot of ways Bethesda can add them in while still explaining why there initially weren't any.
---
No I don't think so. They just seem to run away and you have to chase after them.
---
I don't KNOW if the event is at the last minute...! I look around and I see an Event! Jeez: I WANT to contribute!
---
so many build bugs lately ...I feel a break coming on again because some of these are worse than even beta. I really truly love this game but I'm so over the building buginess. a new meta in this game is just figuring out a work around for how to actually just build basic.
---
usually a work around can be found but this time it's different work arounds and then sometimes a lot of times, nothing works.  like taking a wall to store and trying to put it back to fix the orientation. and having it tell me it intersects or this floating or nothing is selected. rinse repeat for roof tiles and anything that touches half walls or triangle half walls...
---
and this evening I'm able to find and tame a new camp pet and finally Lucy my new deathclaw shows up at camp and wow I was so excited, I'd had people spawn on multiple times and nothing spawns. very quiet spot, I figured she's my forever girl and we can settle down in the spawn but noooooo multiple level 40's (and one 60) crickets spawns and murder her before I can retaliate. I'm so salty ...the business of pets actually being tameable and then tamed and to actually show up back at camp is so rare already it's more than frustrating to have them just get 2 shot.
---
I playbon xbox and never had grievers,im level 149.community is awesome!
---
Too soon
---
The word your looking for here is neither "not" nor "or".  It is and.  Spears should be thrown, and swipe and stab.
---
XD yup that's what happens every time
---
My favorit is the play for 7600 hours challenge for only 20 atoms.
---
If they ever got that down, I'd want to be able to throw hatchets too.  Though, I'm sure there would be profound panic when a choice 3 star was thrown and couldn't be found again.
---
I think we're actually at the point where they woundnt need to explain why they weren't in at the start. I'll just be happy they added them. 
---
I think it's easier and less messy to add something later on, than take it away if it hadn't worked. 
---
I to feel like wastelanders is going to bring some npc's, or atleast I hope so.
---
Nuking the Queen just resets her health (but not the event timer), unfortunately.  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OORTfMpXcVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OORTfMpXcVI)
---
Now I know why that update was so big last night.
---
Great idea!
---
Vending is incredibly hit or miss. You cant sell to the machines only buy. Some people are giving stuff away others want insane prices. I got an explosive 3 star shotgun and 3 star explosive hunting rifle for under 2000  caps each from different vendors. Though typical vendors sell sh*t, common outfits, non legendary items, the most common plans at high prices. Im only shopping hitting 30-50 camps a day and i probably get 1 good score a day. My camps made me some good caps probably 15000 caps so far, most of that was from 1 weapon though. I see a good amount of traffic but most just look. It depends on server though, offerings and location.
---
No, there are POSSIBLE consequences. And removing one of them, the most common one, makes death a complete joke.
---
It did before the last patch. I’m going to do some more testing. I was able to tank the imposter sheepsquatch before the last patch with basically infinite %20 health
---
I'll gladly see the junk "protected" in any way as long as death gets more or other consequences, but right now we are getting of too easy. The risk of losing junk is the only real threat.
---
That is supposed to be fixed, I was waiting for this patch to re-apply and so far so good. 
---
From the patch9 notes:
---
Power Armor: The Targeting HUD helmet mod’s “Detect Life” effect is no longer applied to other nearby players.
---
Survival mode is nothing but a bag of dicks.... see someone and just assume the worst. Problem is, they get some of chems &amp; stuff, which makes it an issue.
---
Got my camera at The Whitesprings. The body was on the red car right in front of the entrance. I also got the "upgraded lens" but I don't know why or from where.
---
How does it have zero progression? You play to level up, earn more perks, and then find better gear. That's absolutely a progression system, it just doesn't go anywhere.
---
Still no chance to get players high tier loot, so where is the motivation in that ?
---
The game gets easier if you have someone to play with. I too started out a lone wolf. But I decided to go to reddit and ask for companions. A lot of people came forward wanting to help a lvl 7 player even though they themselves were above the 100. After that the game got more fun to play and I levelled up faster since they would lure all the ghouls in whitesprings out and i got to tag them before he killed them. 
---
TLDR: other players are optional but highly recommended.
---
Thanks for all the comments everyone! It really helps me obtain a nice weapon.
---
One of the biggest problems I have with pistols is actually not about pistols themselves, but about perks. One, there's ZERO armor piercing perks. Two, the cripple perk is WORTHLESS. Three, having all the pistol perks in the agility tree actually creates a massive competition for other very useful Agility perks. Gun runner? Action Boy? Gun-Fu? Mr Sandman? Covert Operative? Escape Artist? Sneak? Adrenaline? White Knight? Dodgy? There's an incredible amount of VERY useful perks in Agility. Having to compete with those for actual damage perks makes Pistols very sub-optimal.
---
True man but was jus joking lol am not a pvp person
---
Huh i must be all in your head then?
---
You haven't changed my opinion about you and i wish your not on ps4 because we play differently i guess. 
---
You play only for yourself.
---
I don't, it's fun helping people.
---
You're entitled to your opinion, even if it's bullshit.
---
They can still see out and interact act with nearby items when they are stuck under a foundation. It's either that or you remove your foundation. Your pick until they fix this.
---
I finally found one!!!   
---
I was doing a Mutant Horde event and was running between sites, heading to the National Antenna Array.
---
I used to see them all the time around Site Alpha where I had my camp.   Happened at least once a week.  This time it was near Sugar Grove, west of Site Alpha.
---
They?
---
Harpers ferry
---
Two places that can spawn it in that crumbly house on the way to the vendor from spawn entry
---
Got lucky today someone had a 3* unyielding cavalier with ap refresh scout armor for 750 caps
---
You did a hell of a lot better than I did the other night! There were 3 of us total, but only 2 of us that I could see actually trying to complete the event. It’s a little discouraging, tbh because so far I’m 0-2 on that event! Here’s hoping 3rd time’s the charm!
---
Never understood the hate for Fallout 4.  I had a blast with it.
---
I could place a foundation because if a SINGLE golf ball...
---
Very rare thing ive only seen me and 3 or 4 other people have, but heres the video i sent bethesda about it.

Kind of a pain to explain but tldr is the pioneer questline randomly started for me a few weeks before it was released and now its impossible to complete because the npcs dont know to start the next quest stage.

sexually Identify as an unoriginal joke. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of surfing reddit dropping shitposts and derailing actual conversation. People say to me that this has been really going on for far too long and and it trivialises gender identity but I don’t care, I'm a massive asshole. I’m having a plastic surgeon install a mountain dew dispenser, a catheter and and a poop shoot on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Logical Gamer” and respect my right to freeze peach. If you can’t accept me you’re a god damn tumblirina sjw cultural marxist liberal and you triggered lol?. Thank you for being so understanding.
---
I have yet to get a successful run. I’m just hoping the holiday weekend will be kinder! I’m feeling like a paradise failure atm!
---
Yes, a few days.
---
I'm down to group for event. Peregrinator
---
If youre on ps4 I have limbs....I just need the chest one
---
I feel you! I know there’s a bit of a grace period time wise if you wait a few minutes to allow for others to join before hitting the computer to start the event, but we waited almost 10 minutes, all in vain. 3 people just can’t cut it, at least in my experience!

---
Just redid my camp and not only did this happen so many times that I wanted to throw my controller, I F\*\*KING HATE STAIRS!!! You can't build over them and when it messes up you have to redo everything around it. Miss Fallout 4 building more than ever right now.
---
Okay - but after reading down to your comment "easiness of making one hit builds": I just don't understand how players do all this "maximising"?
---
  I'm only approaching level 85 after playing since 'Day One'... I have found no hints in the game..?
---
I play PS4; and I'm wondering if there is some "other level" of information that goes on with PC peeps...?
---
Some sort of fraternity? 
---
Honestly, I liked All the previous 'Lone Wanderer' vibe's better than having to search Reddit for explanations..
---
heh!
---
Agreed, Fallout 4 building was the best. They hyped it up so much that we could now build where ever we want and 99% of the crazy stuff we could do in FO4 we can't do in 76. I miss my bus home, and my truck trailer home, and my RV home, and my train car home, and my storage container home.
---
i think it all also depends on location,   i dont really have an ideal spot for players to -want- to FT to it.   its damn near prime fissure
---
Don’t forget to go to Gauley Mine and grab some coal for the naughty ones
---
Mostly nothing to right home about but did get 3* vanguard cavalier ap refresh forest scout chest piece
---
Funny story, I put in two tickets about that cos I messed my first ticket up and ended up getting 500 atoms twice 😂
---
The place where the fasnacht event was.  Lower level Scorched always have 45
---
I feel your pain. Took me way to long to try buying the one Grahm was selling.
---
As a heavy gun build, this would be difficult, but I like it!
---
yes, Thats why I mean. The idea is to have different presets for one same SPECIAL points. I mean we don't want to ruin the perk system with this XD
---
yes having presets for points will ruin the system, what I'm asking for is a preset only for perks.
---
Wow nice, I was thinking of doing 2nd ticket, but didn't feel like screwing my chances at the bag. It just annoying after they confirmed my ticket they said wait few days, I ended up waiting 2 months then started asking about my atoms, then when they finally took their sweet time to respond they said you got the atoms, I didn't get the atoms until 2 days after that response lol. When it comes to bethesda giving players stuff they will take their sweet time, its why all the daily challenges are somewhat impossible to beat now. Its cool you broke their system lol, I swear their penny pinching their atoms.
---
Was thinking the exact same thing last nice for my all steel home, decided to go half wall for the deck but not as great.
---
In fallout 3 there was a radio
---
Host (who was amazing) and his name was three dog
---
Went straight from The Last of Us to 76...
---
Let's just say having no visible weapon on me is more jarring than expected.
---
As someone who simultaneously plays GTA Online, you have no idea how desirable a friendly playing environment in an online game like this really is.  It's just maddening playing a game like GTA that encourages being a dick for really no reason when working together serves to benefit you far more.  One of the reasons i quickly tried to find a find a friendly crew.
---
Meanwhile on 76, people are overall very decent with very little malicious intent.  We're all encouraged to work together and interact in meaningful ways. That player interaction is what brings some color to the otherwise dreary atmosphere of the world that was left to the vault dwellers.  It just really is something you can't take for granted when so many other online games just seem to encourage being a prick just because you can.
---
Sure, I still need to Revive an Ally as well. What’s your PSN?
---
Enjoy the path, forget the destination my friend. Im at level 91 and i kinda miss the early game
---
Psn?
---
Good to see!  I had to actually ask them recently about it too. had to change my account email and noticed I didn't even have my bag ticket listed anymore. Long story short it's still active, and I'll get an email soon too.
---
I am on PC, unfortunately.
---
Same thing just happened to me. I'm using a quad 25% faster fire tesla rifle with automatic mod. Was farming whitesprings glowing one and then all of sudden I noticed I wasn't doing any damage. The only way to fix it by relogging. Which means I lost the nuke zone, unless there was a friend in that server that I could rejoin.
---
How can they release new contents with the old bugs back.
---
You are right of course, the consequences of dying in this game are horrible. Just horrible. We should definitely remove some of them.
---
Let's put it a different way. Why is it so important that death have consequences beyond loss of time?
---
Now that survival exists as a separate set of servers for the sociopaths the community is incredible
---
needs more sunburn, but otherwise looks close.
---
[Ps4] ever since the last update I've been experience super lag at random times and some areas taking 5+ minutes to fully load in. I have cat 6 connection so it can't be my wifi
---
Lucky, I got it to spawn after soloing the event. One wolf left. Someone came and barely damaged it as I got it to reset its health bar. 1/4 of the way through after the reset, I crashed and gave up.
---
I haven’t had issues with freezing or the arktos boot and I’m on the same platform. Not sure if it helps but my system always clears the cache when I power it down.
---
All about perspective heh lol
---
What hotswap button?
---
Sunnycide
---
I’ll add you, mines Sunnycide
---
I think it's even worse than before.
---
and the 'checking' is useless, because you still see completely awful design everywhere anyway with no physical logic at all.
---
As someone who only builds in pre existing structures and houses, this update has made it almost impossible to do so. I can only place basics like a cooker, storage and tinkers work bench if I tether them with rubber mats. Otherwise they disappear or teleport onto the ceiling. Now I can't fit any other benches in my favourite house. 
---
Not the end of the world, but really annoying for builders.
---
That’s where people are getting angry. Sometimes they can’t tag enemies because some players one shot them and nobody else can loot the body. Then that comes to the next problem everyone here is downvoting me for, allowing everyone to loot bodies without tagging during events will cause campers just hiding causing events to become more difficult for those actually trying to complete it.
---
Thanks for the reply, she's really hard to make
---
Me too, and lvl 50 instead of lvl 20
---
Can't remember if its left or right on the d-pad. Faster and less fiddley than the weapon wheel. Unless you're on PC, pretty sure its just 0-9 at that point.
---
Still, the mechanic exists to track your last two used weapons.
---
just remember, you are only allowed to use T-45 without the helmet to keep the appearance up
---
Sad face
---
Yes, ive had lots of freezing the last few days.. its frustrating for sure
---
Yeah, Alt+F4 does the same.
---
Because it is not even that, most of the times when I die I am on my way somewhere, and now and I can get a free fast travel there by dying. It saves time! It heals me! Death is something positive! The one thing stopping me from constantly offing myself is that I am carrying junk and have no stash-box nearby, Remove that and death is a free stimpack with travel benefits.
---
Me, and a lot other suggested this too several time. I upvote again and I still have hope, they add it some day.
---
Since which day they are in the loot pool lol? I got everything even a legendary shovel and bone club but drills? I don't think so and I never saw one before
---
Thx for info everyone but there's no crops and my camp is fine it's just there's lots of trees and far away super mutants
---
99% of the time when I die, it's at a event. The sheer volume of flux I've lost due to some soulless sack of shit vulture at the end of SBQ fights...As for free fast travel...what the fuck are you  talking about? Fast travel on death costs no less than fast travel without death.
---
Messenger gives 100 caps in the bog too. Ez money.
---
I like this idea.
---
Cripple the head, no laser.
---
Good to know
---
I didn’t realize Fireproof protects you from Scorch Beasts! (I was tempted to start a new character, but I’m just going to convert my Commando character that has similar stats to this more Rifleman/melee oriented build) basically I’m fed up with lack of ammo for my automatic weapons!! And I brought this build idea together in my annoyance. 
---
.... I was planning to use energy weapons with this build, primarily the Gauss Rifle, but I’ll use what I can for now. 
---
I was using Iron Fist today .. and Wow.. omg.. the damage I was getting with just 15% boost! Compared to using my automatic .45 combat rifle. 
---
I’m excited to finally have some fun again! Just need to level up some more to get those perk cards.....
---
I have a 10mm auto silenced anti mutant legendary that I use for low level areas and for Nuke Zones where I just want to tag glowing ones.  It’s also great for sneaking.
---
LoL!!!
---
You mean

---
I haven't had a problem yet with anyone, but does this mean my Electrically Charged mutation could trigger PvP?
---
Yeah I need to find the T-45 pieces now, I also made her on Fallout 4 gave her Maxson's Battlecoat and made her Elder after destroying the Brotherhood
---
Do you mean you have 15 perception, or are level 15?
---
You don't really need vats for snipers, but at level 15 it is easier to just roll a new character.
---
The only problem is more people will show up at events and not participate, enemies that scale with the amount of players in the area will become uncompletable. That will piss the players trying/starting the event. I don’t think there is a win win situation for everyone here. There will always be assholes but not everyone is. 
---
It’s not possible with everyone at an event but send team invites to people at events (nuked whitesprings, uranium fever and a few others). I do this all the time just In case oneshotting, crashing, big mobs. That way everyone gets loot. Not everyone accepts the invite but at least you tried. 
---
I think how it is is the best. Shitty sometimes but I’d rather that then events that become to easy by not scaling or events that are impossible, because if a new looting system is done during one event it will be done to all.
---
After watching a YouTube vid of a guy decimating whitesprings ghouls with and upgraded lvl 20 drill I’m starting to think they may be underrated lol 😂
---
Correction: Char level 14 and perception level 12
---
&gt; You don't really need vats for snipers 
---
So i thought but arent you much stronger with vats ?
---
I did arktos yesterday without problems. Today it freezes when its loading in the elevator
---
You should be to intersect stuff if you want. Junk walls on fallout 4 had to have huge gaps in. 😩🙄🙄
---
different communities and even f76 devs are baffled by the f76 community. no one anticipated/planned this. The best part is that YOU ARE ALL PLAYING IT WRONG. the game was already broken and you guys turned the post apocalypse into a social gathering. i quit the game after the patch that disabled camps destruction
---
I bet you do xddd
---
Extra damage from vats isn't much honestly and situational. Gun Fu can get your damage up but only after a couple kills in vats so unless youre in a situation with multiple enemies it won't help. You could easily play sniper without vats, I would only recommend vats if you wanna do a crit build with it cuz crits actually make a significant difference to your damage.
---
Stealth is good enough for most content. Vats crits are very good but aren't mandatory.
---
A sniper without vats will deal more damage than heavy weapons every time.
---
A problem i have is when a player fast travels to my camp to look at my vendors, they sometimes get spawn in foundations and get stuck. Fast travel mats would prevent this. Guess i will rebuild my camp without lifetd up foundations so my customers have a better shopping experience.
---
The possum badge challenges are bugged and show nonsense, like "sighted accuracy" or other weapon workbench related stuff. Maybe a problem with the translation.
---
Some enemies are sometimes named wrong, like "TEMPLATE: short barrel" Guess same problem as before: translation.
---
The glass cavern scorchbeast can fly again, flying trough a wall and then gets teleported back to her fissure spawn just to fly trough the wall again. This loops.
---
There is a small patch of ground right outside of the pioneer camp where you can glitch under the map. I have the small 1+1 workbench camp of my low level char there, and when i fast travel to it, im sometimes get stuck under the map.

In that case don’t worry about it. Use whatever perks you want in the perception tree for now, start loading up the strength tree if you want, or whatever other perk trees you might want, and just plan it out. Once you’re level 50, that’s when you should decide what perk points you want to move.
---
THIS! I spent 3 days trying to build a camp after moving because i had to keep tearing it down about a dozen times, and trying to redesign it because of exactly the same issue. Pieces would *click* and go green, but come up with your same problem or "intersects with another object" when you go to lock it in. Worse, was that the only object near was the stairs themselves,and it was the stair/platform build i was trying to use as an interior foundation.
---
Only works with the 'nothing selected' issue.
---
PS4 but thank you anyway.
---
You can load up on damage with vats combining perception and luck. Not sure what perk cards are  available but to maximize rifle damage you are going to want a high perception whether you use vats or not.
---
Seeing that they have had a strong focus on 'rebalancing' and 'patching out nice things' it would be nice to see a drive to 'patch out nasty things' - some of them in the game since beta - instead in the next couple of weeks.
---
Any feed back be great thanks guys :)
---
Has anyone else seen the "Formula Q rejuvenates the friendly animals" message?
---
Online to do it now?
---
I don't think so
---
Technically it is a actually exactly a quarterstaff, but with a pointy end.
---
Was doing the weekly. Got to 7/10 animals in the ash heap. Found a death claw... woot. Killed it, hot key yo get the camera out... deathclaw falls through the ground...
---
"FUCK THIS FUCKING SHIT! AN HOUR OF THIS!"
---
Also now my loading screens are filled with a bunch of dead creatures.
---
If you are referring to the Free range event you gotta keep in mind the more Brahman you keep alive the better chance you get a better reward. At least keeping two alive will give a high chance of that. If you find that even keeping all alive doesn't help then I am not sure what to say. I have reliably been getting several good plans from that event by keeping at least two alive.
---
Aaaaaaannnndrooooiiiiid!!!
---
Please..?
---
Only have had 2 buys so far since vendors came out: mutton meat pie recipe and pool table plans each for under 50 caps. Though I suspect this has more to do with the fact that I have a mansion on top of Seneca rocks and most players plummet to their death upon fast traveling to my CAMP if they aren't wearing power armor and are too pissed to buy anything from me.
---
I feel like the F4 engine cant pull off a ponytail hairstyle... maybe it's just me but I always found it weird
---
whitesprings bunker would be my guess, there is a radio station between the mire and cranberry bog that could also be an option
---
No im talking about the new dungeon event prob should have specified that.
---
Oh yeah, I know this, for the take pictures of creatures in the mire, I just took a pic of a Yao Guai corpse outside That waste disposal cave with the deathclaws. I’ve even used rhe camera to find the Imposter sheepsquatch corpse when it died invisible XD
---
Oh. Then a similar thing applies. The more animals alive the more/better rewards you get. Try to get at least two animals past rank 2. Makes them easier to defend.
---
Like seriously... what is this fucking runescape 3? Get your whining ass outta here
---
Okay makes since i may have just had bad luck and they died both times i tried or something for a while was thinking it may have been a bug, thanks for the info :-)
---
Then you lose half of the benefit of the perk.
---
I once met a bugged molerar horde event and there was literally about 90 of them in a single location. The only fun times I had with molerats. I believe shitloads of evil things is they way to go.
---
Do you have a shortcut of the game? If you do - try launching the game from there. Launchers sometimes fail to detect game files.
---
If there isn't a shortcut - go to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76 and if it doesn't exist it's probably gone.
---
This was an issue way back in B.E.T.A.
---
I have had the same issue u/ladynoodles except on PC (that issue being that my vendor unlists all of my items and no longer has the "cap" ring around it on the map despite having power). I don't know if this is related, but I recall it happening after I moved my mule's base to nearby Berkley TS. The mule character is on the same account as my main character.
---
I have not tested thus further unfortunately, as I didn't think to at the time and I really don't want to relist everything again if that is the trigger.
---
Not everyone is so nice. I pretend to be while visiting for shopping, but I am basically going around and shitting in everyone's beds (i.e - leaving a bag of one raw fertilizer, one toilet paper). Don't matter if the door is locked, I find a way in, do the deed then hit the come here emote. Hilarious how extreme people's reactions can be.
---
I love stumbling across posts like this, I got the game around launch but barely played, not because I wasn't enjoying it, more I'd actually recently just got back into fallout 4. However, picked it back up and I've barely just hit lvl 10 so I've avoided all players where possible for fear of what would happen to me as a solo player.
---
This gives me hope that when I do stumble across another player it won't be an encounter that puts me off the game.
---
Must of been a bug. A non ts same level did half the damage. Like exactly half.
---
Yeah earlier lag got so bad my handmade was shooting slower than a lever action but only in certain parts of the map
---
Now that purveyor can drop them as legendaries, you should be able to find a nice one in-game/ on trade.
---
No such thing as a bloodied tse
---
Bloody dupers haha kidding
---
🤷‍♀️
---
The building mechanic is one of my favourite parts of the fallout series, like in fallout 4 and 76 but it's so much worse in 76. Theres loads more assets and stuff but the budget and stash limit make it so limited, I've filled my stash and ots baisically all just filled with scrap for when I unlock more buildable stuff and it just sucks. Why is scrap kept in the stash anyway, why not in like the camp similar to how u could keep it in the workshop in 4
---
There was a glitch where if u put a ton of stuff in a artillery and scrapped it it d go in ur stash
---
All I know is the dude was an ass a d was single handedly the most toxic experience I've had in this game
---
Great work! Any plans on adding additional mutations to this? I was trying to check out my melee damage and noticed you had adrenal reaction but not twisted muscles.
---
The terror has been doubled!
---
Should have saved your self 40 caps. I got my camera by making my way to the parking lot of Wavy Willards Water Park and just server hopping there until the tourist appeared in the lot.
---
*The Poleaxe wants to know your location*
---
Rifle Gaming launched 3. 1 at each nuke silo and the server remained stable. Impressive.
---
It'd be neat to display stuff you have for sale on a weapon/armour rack
---
This is amazing. I came across someone's camp one day while hopping camp vendors, someone had this same thing posted but in neon letters. I took a picture doing the thumbs up pose lmao
---
I do play them solo then said people swoop in, if you could read beyond kindergarten you would have figured that out.
---
Dang i had a completely different experience  
---
Was in survival mode doing some missions (Needed the xp), and to my surprise i made it to the top 3 in the leaderboards, was pretty happy and stuff and completely forgot that the top 3 will be shown on the map.  
---
Was walking around killing scorched and then to my surprise i was showered with plasma/lazer grenades all over, I thought it was some weird high level scorched but nope, were 3 players, lowest lvl'd one was level 120, and I'm only level 28 (just like you I got it 30 MINUTES before launch and stayed away cause of the negativity), respawned and ran away as far as possible, few minutes later 2 of said players came back and killed me. It's not like I'm super high leveld and have all these valuable junk and whatnot, nope, just the opposite. But I guess some people like to pick on low level'd players.
---
The Porn 'stache and sunnies really set the theme of the photo shoot. Lol.
---
Isnt that normal? I'm always taking radiation in a nuke zone. Even with power armor and radx. 
---
But if you think it's more than normal, maybe you have rad worms. Check under effects in pipboy.
---
That's the positive point when a game is not mass popular. Mostly real fans play the game
---
Everyone takes rad damage in a nuke zone with power armour on. That sounds about right too, the amount you’re taking. It’ll take a while to die from that too. Just use radaway.
---
Not only back, but also hips when it comes to handguns and fist weapons/small knifes
---
I'm really looking forward to it.I bought tickets for your Appalachia tour in Morgantown. Soooooo hyped :)
---
The prophet blesses me with divine knowledge.
---
Fuck, I shouldn't have moved that stair because NOW INTERSECTS WITH AN EXISTING OBJECT.
---
Electric fence could be a shockingly fun idea.
---
You've not got rad worms and not noticed? Although like others have said you don't remain rad free in a nuke zone, you can just reduce tit a bit
---
 I hope no one took m too serious, I was being somewhat sarcastic
---
I agree with [**u/nordcore1**](https://www.reddit.com/user/nordcore1/) \- the community is awesome.  
---
and with  [**u/kingpiasa**](https://www.reddit.com/user/kingpiasa/) in that so few give Beth credit for working hard to minimize griefing
---
It's abusable. I can imagine people trying to jump in the way of players gun shots so that they get the first hit. 
---
However i suppose bethesda could enable a survival passive mode where you won't be able to initiate combat. 
---
There are probably other ways it could be abused (team up with player, attack someone so that they're red etc...) but all in all I think it has potential
---
Doesn’t the Excavator armor status say it provides more ore when used to mine? I’ve never noticed any extra, just one per node like with any armor
---
That is a pretty good idea- I have always worried that they would get destroyed since i rarely do the defense
---
They didn’t leave it out just because they didn’t think it was important. With the way weapon mods work in Fallout 4 and 76, weapons can have pretty drastically different models which would all run the risk of clipping into the player model. It would be unrealistic to account for every combination of mods on every weapon to make sure it didn’t clip, so the feature simply wasn’t included.
---
#Save The Froggies
---
I’m wondering too because I use action boy lone wanderer and nerd rage that’s like 80% Ap regen is there a cap ?
---
Only legendary robots explode if you kill it. But thare whas an bug that every robot did that but it got pached. If this is infact your problem ppeace do report it to betehsda on bethesda.net. ^-^
---
But wouldn't you have to take those items out then put them back in to sell in the vendor? It wouldn't let you put them back in your stash/vendor if it's above 800 correct?
---
yeah lets hope this happens, I'm really looking forward to seeing this in the next updates
---
Step 1: Sell all junk until you have 100-150 of each left. Same for gunpowder.
---
Step 2: Drop all ammo that you don't use, especially missiles and mini nukes. It takes 10 minutes to make 5k ammo of any type from scratch, incase you change weapons.
---
Step 3: Sell legendaries for scrip. No point in hoarding 1* nocturnal miniguns.
---
Step 4: Add the ultra light mod to all stored armor, and remove all mods from stored weapons.
---
Step 5: You have now freed up 300-400 lbs
---
Step 6: Enjoy
---
Spent hours today claiming a bunch of workshops just hoping Graham will shows up at some point.
---
ended up those hours of grinding was wasted :"(
---
can I get a F ?
---
btw good luck for finding him !
---
Okay thanks does a hazmat suit prevent it?
---
Thanks. That note was so small and textured to blend into the background, I didn't see it.
---
Can we get the main team at Bethesda to do bug fixes? Stop working on your other games for a month and repair this one before you lose all your player base like Anthem. I know someone from Bethesda reads this. Get it together guys.
---
Great points, I agree totally. It seems empty not because of the lack of npcs, but the lack of maximum players on a server. If the servers could handle 50+ people, it would be so much more fun and feel realistic, so many team ups, trading hubs, nukes.
---
And if only more than CAMP could be shown at a time, so you could build settlements with people, instead you have to walk out of draw distance of someone else’s CAMP to build your own.
---
Sounds like a question for Bethesda...
---
Probably not yet, I haven't heard any news about them unbanning players. 
---
If I was you I'll just buy another copy of the game since it's heavily discounted right now.
---
There was a patch today for PC to fix lighting as they had used the wrong lighting file.
---
lol I spent 2-3h building my camp, if I have to place it again and rebuild everything again I won't do that challenge.
---
If there in ur stash, they don't move out of ur stash
---
Luckily I'm on console so I can just swap accs
---
And spawn into a death-room? No thanks lol
---
CAMP traps need a rework before fast travel mats are added imo
---
The knife is pretty good, Swing Speed (SS) is rather wanted on market, Vampire also but less than a Bloodied weapon. I see an Bloodied Swing Speed Deathclaw gauntlet go for 30k Yesterday! :)
---
When putting an item in to your vendor, you first need to take it out of your stash is what I'm saying. You can't sell directly from the stash or at least I can't from experience.
---
Not entirely IIRC, but I think you take less than being in a PA

20 atoms be damned heh, I've jumped between nearly all the world's workshops for a little over 3 hours now (I just did the Encryptid for the second time on the same world so that's how I know the duration heh), I'm officially giving up! :P But I tried atleast :) Thank you once again though for helping with the other challenge earlier today. See you around!
---
Right on. I just left myself. Thank you for the update.
---
I can promise you from experience that it was never truly fixed
---
Asking reddit if you’re still banned 😂😂 people never cease to amaze me!
---
I know i just saw you say something about bloody builds and a lot of people still seem to have the misconception that bloodied is still the best in PVP and that misconception could lead to a nerf.
---
They're all great rolls to the right play style. Honestly, the deathclaw gauntlet might be the "worst" of them all, because anti-armor on melee is pretty redundant. You already get extremely high damage per hit + 75% penetration with incisor.
---
I'm asking if I'm unbanned even though I didn't so anything wrong I didn't dupe I wasn't toxic I was always kind to new players and gave them alot of stuff I just want to be unbanned

One thing I've noticed about big camps is that they rarely have much decoration in each room, even basic decor such as lights. So while the camps seem huge and maybe above the build limit, most of it is actually just the structure itself and the bare necessities. If you're like me and you prefer to have lots of detailing, keep your camp smaller.
---
Doesn't exist outside the dev room, if you're on PC you might be able to cop one off a player vendor because scrapping it teaches you to craft them
---
Something like that
---
Fusion cores are 3 haha
---
Fair point. I know that WWP is also involved in family support, but CoFP is more appropriate.
---
That is my point. No-one is on the PVP servers because the people who want to PVP do not want to fight other people with overpowered gear, they want to troll PVE players so they use PVE mode and use the workshop systems to force PVE players into PVP or make them waste huge amounts of resources switching servers.
---
You say it should stay the way it is, and then describe all the voluntary ways to PVP. My post is about the ability to force PVP on PVE players via workshops.
---
It will unless you enable passive mode, also stops you accidentally instigating pvp with other players with your explosive weapons.
---
Tesla rifle damage bug is back in patch 9.5 specially the automatic mod. It will make you deal 0 damage until you relog. The only way to do damage is via melee damage ( example : wanna finish SBQ fight or any events and then relog to fix the issue)
---
You can assign stuff for sale directly from your stash without removing them. On Xbox is the X button don't know about other platforms
---
OP.
---
"If you don't want to PVP don't"
---
My post is about using workshops to force PVP on PVE players who are just trying to mind their own business and do not want to PVP.
---
Yes you can assign items to sell from the stash without having to take them out
---
I see it as away off having players login more often. Only way to make money is having us login everyday and play and hope for us to spend some atoms.
---
It's all part of ur stash, all you do is assign it to ur vendor if it's on ur stash. If it's on you then it goes to ur stash unless it's full
---
YES PLEASE!
---
Again, someone talking about voluntary Why are there ways for PVP to be forced on players who have no interest in it, when it costs them real time in wasted resources and the players who use the workshops to force PVP are traveling around doing it because they have god-tier gear and know that most PVE players who are actually doing missions probably don't. These are people who are in PVE because they want to troll and everyone else in PVP are people who actually want to PVP which is not fun to troll.
---
9mm rounds? Are there 9mm guns in this game?
---
Sorry, still quite new and haven't seen anything like that.
---
Ohhh why did I never notice that... Its the exact same as the fermenting station obviously... Thanks for the clarification :)
---
Sounds like we found ourselves a douper.
---
What utter nonsense.
---
Anything that involves taking a photo of a player in X outfit, I just don't bother anymore.  
---
Will go to the area and spend half an hour looking for a player, but assuming I find someone in the area, they either won't, don't understand what I'm asking, or have world voice-chat off. 
---
Waste of time for what amounts to cents of virtual currency.
---
I don’t really worry about what they do with this game. I take the game as more of an experimental avenue to enhance their single player games. I do understand that lore is important, but if it makes FO5 and beyond better, then so be it. An online game can always be changed and tweaked in a short amount of time but a single player cannot change based on feedback without implementing dlc and destroying the theme in my opinion.
---
Yeah I could come online! I added you on psn! If still possible?
---
i had the same thing happen. nothing but the handle left. put it in my stash just for a keepsake.
---
Literally every base is now floating off a 1X1 staircase because of this, and i’m too lazy for that so i’ve been stuck south of sunnytop for a while now
---
Many of us are as well. And the ones I served with were (mostly) gamers too. 
---
Actually, I just realized that Menkhus was the guy that introduced me to Fallout back in 29 Palms in ‘98. He would have loved this game. 
---
Damn it.
---
Until you come across the dudetank that ignores your well-aimed shots and just comes running into you at mach 4 swinging a sledgehammer at your head like its a toy.
---
I said I think there are three main needs and only PvP gang survival players received what they wanted. PvP on adventure is mostly disliked, and consequence of removing PvP from adventure entirely would be that whoever wanted to PvP could only go to survival to do so, meeting only consenting individuals. There's also third need for a more punishing experiece thats completely out of touch with current adventure, and since this need is valid too, I support the concept of hardcore survival servers as separate gamemode with hardcore-locked characters.
---
You don't really need Vats, you can also use sneak and deal a high amount of damage
---
That would be handy
---
Free market. Its called capitalism. Do you have a problem with capitalism...YOU COMMIE SCUM!
---
Yes I have lots of decorations and fancy lights. My camp has a flat roof that just doesn’t look right on my building and wanted to change it but out of camp budget. Wasn’t sure if there was tricks to using less budget. I do have 2 foundations in the water next to my house that I can’t move.
---
What you have written is generally what I personally felt about the lack of NPCs and my overall feelings of the game. However, you have written it far better than I could. I am actually enjoying the feeling of isolation and have worked that feeling into my character's story.
---
Seeing the world grow and change over time would be great too, if it is done well.
---
Y’all want to much
---
I didn't say it was a bad ending, I said it didn't end properly. No where did I say bad?
---
Swinging a sword looks cool
---
Half swording it and smashing some rube in the face with the hilt while he is smirking that your touching the sharp it normally works better though :P
---
100k? The cap limit is 25k. How does one learn this power?
---
From wiki :
---
The plans can be found at Harpers Ferry.
---
The individual components of the armor can be purchased by the various vendortrons around Appalachia, or found on high level enemies such as scorchbeasts.
---
Nope. It was meant to come ages ago. Got delayed. And there hasn't been any news on it since.
---
Awww ok thanks
---
That sucks
---
I'd love ways of upgrading power armor. The ultracite and excavator are really nice additions, but the ultracite has very little purpose in the game. I hope they make the inferno more like the excavator, giving it a very clear purpose and plenty of love in the skin department
---
Oh okay thanks
---
Why aren’t they on console?
---
Yeah sorry. I feel the pain. I've been collecting interesting and clean junk items for quite some time.
---
Swiping to stab morph on spears is the easiest and most effective morph to use against anyone, no one expects you to even swing in the first place and then panic, I managed to swing morph to stab and then feint and stab some dude and I felt so dirty.
---
dev room was never accessible on console, or those who managed to do it kept it quiet. It required some level of third party cheats to get in, so while not impossible on consoles, it was much easier on PC
---
I see you have a problem with that but have not offered a solution. Workshops provide a lot of valuable mats and are meant to be a sought after thing. I thought I saw somewhere that they fixed it to where you had to be physically at the build area of the workshop for them to PvP you while contesting it so I'm not sure what it is you want more than that. We can't have people just taking the shop without any way for anyone else to have it.
---
I wish i could make it in different colors
---
They actually invented and built the Raider Armor and the Raider PA - so it makes totally sense to add the plans to the vendors.
---
I mean, take a look at this stuff, do you really think that it was produced pre-war - it looks like made of scrap, because it is made of scrap.
---
Looool that cracked me up.
---
No the marine helmet howcome not on console
---
Hi There! If you have not done so already, make sure to actually 'read' your Plans and Recipes so they can be crafted. :)
---
Just keep doing Free Range. It's not a seasonal event.
---
Less turrets, less foundations more empty rooms.
---
Honk Honk
---
Nice, lol :)
---
And if you where on pc you could actually send real nude, hahaha
---
Ah i see what you mean now, yeah agreed.
---
I've just noticed this myself tonight. I was checking my suit at my armour stand to confirm how much violet flux I still needed to craft another calibrated shock mod when I noticed there was the option to apply Targeting Hud. This was weird because I have yet to see the mod at the vendor and haven't yet bought the plan \[I had just bought the shocks plan\]. I've also tried crafting it and also nothing happens. I've tried at my camp and at a whitesprings armour stand but no dice.
---
EU guy here, am confused. Why should this be a special weekend ?
---
If we had bigger stashes we wouldnt have to price to move our items. My priority is offloading my ammo, scrap and legendaries. I sell 3*s at 500 caps. Even if bloodied, anti armor or two shot. I bulk junk just to sell it cheaper. I dont want it weighing me down and if it doesnt go ill throw it out. Might as well get some caps for them. My camp is a constant clearance sale. Everything must go! If you want to buy cheap visit phoe4 CAMP. Thats phoe4 on the ps4! Ill beat anybodies prices guaranteed!
---
Had the same thing last night I reset my camp about three times then it stopped
---
Lmao
---
Hi There, the latest news that we have on this is that they are working on it, and that it's coming, but delayed until the mechanics work properly. :)
---
I not sure if I ever did free range I'll look it up
---
FYI. lights will kill your budget almost as much as turrets. Light Smarter not Harder.
---
That one is even funnier! Lol!
---
Nah, enjoy the weekend with your family and friends!
---
I had this yesterday. I can only play if I select join session from the main PlayStation menu. So I can only play if one of my friends is online. I’m due to go on soon, feel free to add me just so you can try that. PSN is wasteland_rox
---
Thank you :)
---
Hi There! I'm not sure if it's been mentioned but I believe Camp Budget also increases with the Player's level.
---
I have a base on the road right south of Grafton Steel and Graham shows up there sometimes.
---
You're welcome :) May I also recommend that you read the "Inside the Vault" posts? Those are super informative and will keep you updated. :)
---
I have more lights than anything. That’s what makes it look so nice, maybe I need to rebuild and not have so many glitter balls 😢
---
It was a dev room only and you can't get into it on console
---
Couldn't have put it better. The lack of NPCs work very well into the story. Don't forget-all the factions were there,the survivors of the war and few in numbers ,The Responders,Brotherhood and Raider, but it was the Scorched Plague on top of everything that took what was left out. It makes sense the area would be deserted. It then is up to the 76's to take up the mantle and find out what happened and go on from there. Myself? If i see someone in trouble, or a newbie needing supplies that i can spare, then I'm a Responder. Gives almost a sense of pride of putting on the uniform and even hearing the vendor bots addressing everyone else as "citizen",but you as "Responder". Sometimes they sound puzzled as it's been so long since they have seen one. Others are taking up The Brotherhood of Steel, the Knights, Scribes and Paladins. Others, just humble settlers and Explorers. It's our game.
---
Does it, didn’t know that. I’m 120 so it will keep increasing every time I level up?
---
ooooo
---
There's a few spots on the map where that quest spawns. Some are harder than others.
---
i remember that n.n
---
hey i dont know what time it is for you but hope you can respond soon
---
Only have 2 turrets and that’s why I want more budget to fill even more useless stuff everywhere.
---
Lol at step one “150 screws”. Ye be a madman I say.
---
I did read them and all the patch notes but a few days ago and I binge-read them. That's why I was doubting since I know I read something about it but wasn't sure haha
---
That’s stupid wish I could find it in game
---
You used a rad away didn't you?
---
Hi there! 
---
I can usually find Grahm if I take a nice long stroll on the main road going North past the Whitespring and up the Savage Divide. I find him when I don't Fast Travel.
---
Some people really really want that so idk what to tell you. I'm just going by what I've seen folks specifically seeking out, or what they get excited by.
---
No not the marine wetsuit helmet, the marine armor helmet, it goes with the rest of the armor pieces and looks like a fire breather gasmask but with a black combat armor helmet instead. It was in the fallout 4 far harbor DLC along with the rest of the marine stuff we find in game.
---
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but how do you define where you spawn in a workshop?
---
Yes I do damn agree I built a maze trap house working on the 3rd floor and was just putting in a outside wall..nope sorry floating..had to rebuild that floor 4 times before I finally got it to click..so stupid
---
We should be able to leave comments. Like a literal mailbox or chalkboard. I must tell these people how fuck ugly their camps are. Like 1 outta 100 camps are good. I get low levels would have ugly camps but ive seen lvl 200s and up with ugly bases. Take some damn time to a build proper base.
---
Ahhh yes someone didn’t have their genes starched enough
---
Have you tried moving your c.a.m.p. devise? it's location changes the spawn point. or so im told.
---
Nope. And even if I did that wouldn't explain how I lost my plan as well
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_armor_%28Fallout_76%29
---
i agree with you on that one, the deathclaw is however the ultime roll for a non melee player who wants a backup.
---
( So long as he does not use power armour:)
---
Um what? 
---
This is not my experience. I am able to mark all items I want to sell from my Stash, at the Vending machine, not from my character's inventory.
---
Then it should only be available in adventure mode.
---
Yes, I'm 240 and can assure you it does increase. :)
---
That's why I don't play survival.  😉
---
I don't get how so many people state there's "No NPCs".
---
There's no *living human NPCs*, but there's robot NPCs. They have dialogue, they have personalities, so they fit the criteria for being NPCs. Do robots just not count or something?
---
I like that. So maybe I will just try levelling up for a bit then I be able to get my fancy roof.
---
As a retail worker/father/husband I miss most of every double xp event
---
U can hop onto a game with me if I’m ever on. I hop on a lot and I luckily tend too keep many team perks. Even tho I never have a team...
---
‘DiamondSlime64’ on PC.
---
Yeah the new arktos Pharma event is fun
---
Do you have Atom Shop paints on them? If so, you’ll have to remove those first. That’s all I can think of.
---
You can find the plans for the wetsuit, wetsuit helmet, and all the marine limbs and chest at harpers ferry but you can't get the marine armor helmet there, it's dev only
---
I’m assuming my 10mm pistol stopped showing up on the trade menus because I added the tricentennial paint to it which is non tradable. Everything else shows fine. So did you paint any of the pieces?
---
I do agree, the ‘this floor will not be accessible’ is annoying and totally pointless, and very restricting sometimes.
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
Did you read the plan?
---
 Using any radaway or decontamination arch will remove your mutation unless you have starched genes perk.
---
 If none of that happened, I'm sorry for your loss.
---
If you're on XBox I camp at Twin Lakes, stop by and you'll get a better idea of how much leveling does for your budget. :)
---
Today I ended up on a server with ZERO workshops claimed, so I take the ammunition plant because 5.56 isn't going to magic itself into my inventory. I go on to do the power plant daily so I  don't need to power the plant myself, gears are pretty precious. 
---
After about 4 hours playing, only one other workshop was claimed, the farm near the nuka cola plant. Seemed weird, normally I see at least a few of the workshops claimed - especially the ammunition plant.
---
I feel ya. but yea they take up a lot of budget.
---
i bought that from a player vendor last night, don't even know what is is or does, is it a mod for the club ? :)
---
Hazmat suit is so much better to reduced how many rads you soak up. Still need radaway though since it can still add up.
---
i kinda love you
---
I’m Ps4 but thank you. I love looking at other people’s camps and it makes sense now, how some people have so much stuff. I’m going to try some fast levelling up instead of just wandering around.  Thanks for the help.
---
A full set of unyielding armor works well with these,it's the gustys you need to worry about got mugged by 5 of them at watoga station.
---
I haven’t
---
We need traps like in fo4. If the game can handle brahmin in our camp why not other mobs?
---
it's a trap!
---
Hmm maybe i posted too early. I maybe re-post it later because I couldn't find an answer :)
---
That's a good question too, wheterethere is a cap orn ot.
---
that's fair comment.
---
Not laggy but weird, as I died with nothing near me and a low lvl scorch killed me in one shot while I was standing still,I run a bloodied build about 50% health and a full set of unyielding armor
---
Not even 4* exist
---
In fallout 76 beathesda skins you.
---
bump, i'm heavy gunner and if i'm not using steel to make bullets, i'm using steel  to repair weapons
---
PA/Hazmat massively reduces the rads you get, but they don't prevent you from getting rads completely. Rad damage will still add up and require uses of Radaway, but it will take a lot longer than if you tried running into a nuke zone naked.
---
Yh they do add scorched killer receiver to add a *
---
The thing is, you can see walls collide with each other and with the floor, it's annoying.
---
I had to rebuild my camp around five times because roofs  were floating even tho it was snapped to the wall
---
Only thing you can place at the moment is the new "frog in a jar", but it's kind of fun :D
---
I built a second character to use pistol's but I soon noticed it was not worth the effert.
---
It depend on your build unless you are asking for the best build and gear then probably 4x unyielding 1x chameleon, all heavy combat with upgraded to bos torso with dense mod, cavalier for third star, weapon bloodied handmade with explosive or fire rate. Perks and special for bloodied commando.
---
I do all this, lol, got junk down to 60. step 3 stand in front of scrip machine sell by weight first max out the tiny 150 limit still have a heap of crappie 3 star junk I got from her the day before play for a few hours till I am full. Today I dropped  four 3 star items out side a station cant sell them as am maximum on caps
---
Nope since patch 9 they removed that. I don't know how it is with the receiver but on the sacrifice mod on machete it is removed its only a 3* now
---
Aaaaahhh the returning player question is here yet again...
---
Ahhhhhh that may explain it, I have same problem as OP
---
I said this to my partner last night!
---
Flatwoods Monster counts as an alien.
---
Though the "Good luck" applies to finding it. Over level 200 and I've only seen it spawn twice.
---
Honestly though, if that's what someone wants to do, who cares?
---
Depends on the build. As a bloodied stealth sniper my priority is chameleon, cloaking, harder to detect while sneaking and bolstering. A tank might say vanguard and sentinel. Whats your build?
---
Thank you for just starting up the game and not ask everything on here!thumbs up!
---
I have one and have no idea where or how I got it and after 900 hrs never seen another so I have been holding on to it. you say if I scrap it i can craft it? we are talking the helmet and not the sky mask hood thing with the silver eyes.
---
Glad you've had positive experiences. I recently had one guy rob my acid extractor with two friends sitting nearby stealthed. I come to investigate my base and he starts trying to fight me and his friends jumped me as well. Thankfully with pacifist on they couldn't gank me and destroy my base, but it was damned annoying.
---
I'm on pc but you could try the top of the lighthouse I got mine there.
---
With proper sniper build you one shot mobs, they didn't change much but hunting rifle with .50cal receiver was buffed
---
Oh damn the decontamination arch counts as well? Hold up, I'm going back to game and see if my plan is still there
---
The mat would be nice or something that works the same way as I have fast traveled to vender camps been stuck under floors or inside someone's LOCKED camp and unable to get to vending machines. So fast travel out then run back so annoying.
---
Marine combat helmet, the one that looks sort of like a combat helmet with a gas mask attached to it. It works the same way as the combat helmet and metal helmet, you learn plans for making the helmet by scrapping it
---
I can sell any of them for 150 caps
---
You got it there now?
---
The people that go around griefing on workshops are people who tried survival but can't compete with players who actually have builds optimized for PvP. You often can't one shot kill somebody with full sentinel assassin's armor.
---
Guerilla-stealth is very powerful. Check out Captain Noob's videos on it in YouTube.
---
Everything is well balanced. Anti armor, two shot and explosive rifles are still good. 
---
Bloodied builds with adrenal reaction are the new meta
---
There are still guns that destroy shit in the game, you just have to buy them from player vendors or get the drop from the purveyor or three star
---
I kinda feel bad but also kinda luv a frog in a bottle in my camp,so i got me 3 of them:)
---
I don't know about boy band. You look like you're into Heavy Metal.
---
Did you happen to notice if one or more of the “jumps” or sudden changes of view or direction was not something you did (not directed by you) ?
---
Interesting, I was just thinking to myself yesterday about how the PA in 76 doesn’t have levels like 4 does. I’ll wait to see what the stats are before I get excited about using it
---
ok i'm scarping it.... nervously thanks
---
I don't even know how to capture a frog so I guess my hands are clean lol.
---
People from a neighbouring region could start turning up just wandering around, looking for /us/. Why did they come looking? Cause who TF keeps launching all the nukes in Appalachia.
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me too. Ruined my entire camp.
---
My favourite is the upside down scorched, but their hitbox is still normal so you shoot thin air and see blood spray out
---
No but it's a spot that should have the camera there.
---
&gt;falsely banned
---
&gt; I stole a cheaters loot 
---
If you decided to go vigilante and take it upon yourself to get rid of duped items by picking them up, then I'm guessing this wasn't a false ban.  You had possession of duped items, there is no way for them to know the intentions of a player. 
---
It's akin to trying to tell police when they find you with a ton of meth in your car: "I only have it because I was going to get rid of it"
---
We'll see what they do. But I doubt they'll disregard the lore considering they know that Vault Lore one of the biggest interest in the fandom.
---
I feel your pain so hard, man. A few days a Mongrel spawned *in* my base (this begins with Bethesda's bullshit and so it will also end with it) and started wrecking my water purifiers. He didn't *destroy* the one he was currently biting at but damn near did (like 1/10 of the hit points left). So what do I do? Well, I didn't feel like looking at that sliver of health every time I go to grab water, so I go into build mode and pick the purifier up... This was my first mistake, but it wouldn't be my last, oh no, not by a long shot. So I go to put the purifier back down in the exact same spot it was in, outline is green, hit left mouse button to place, little busy icon shows up annnnnddddd "intersects with an existing object". "No, it doesn't, it's fucking green, place my shit!" Game says "nah". I figure maybe it's the foundation behind it, or the other water purifier next to it, so I pick those up too... You can probably see where this is going... 
---
So 45 minutes later, I've completely disassembled my entire CAMP trying to get these 3 water purifiers to sit next to each other; they all worked fine several months ago when I initially built my base, buuuuut now they don't, and I've just come to accept that the 3rd purifier (the one I initially picked up to replace) will just always be be unflush with the other two and look wonky as shit because of it. But!!! *ONLY* because I have no fucking choice in the matter because some fucked up update screwed with build mechanics so my initial base that I've had since near launch no longer works! Upon rebuilding my base I also was greeted with the fact that I can no longer place a campfire under the rotating spits cooking station (so I guess it cooks things with my hopes and dreams now?), because it "needs support" which I can only assume means "emotional support" because there's a FUCKING CONCRETE FOUNDATION underneath of the two objects, but I am just a simple man, I do not possess a degree in engineering, so these complexities elude my simple mind... Oh wait, yes I do! WTF?!
---
So, after reading my rant, you may ask yourself, if I, CrimsonFrost learned anything from this fantastical ordeal? Why, yes! I have! And that lesson is: if you *like* the layout of your CAMP, don't pick up ANYTHING you placed months ago to try and place it back down to refresh its hitpoints. Just take out your Supersledge and beat the shit out of it and eat the material repair costs to completely fix it.
---
Thanks for the information share :)
---
Yesterday I saw that somebody said that he can see this spoilers but will not say anything.
---
Your spoilers are just perfect my taste :)
---
I was worried about the same thing for the Arktos Labs, but luckily you can just go in and explore and not start the event. Hopefully vaults will be the same way
---
I agree with op, very well put.
---
The human npcs drive me nuts in the other games.  FO76 is more dynamic, but a chat system would be even better. (PC)
---
in about 25 minutes my CAMP is still loading......OMG this game
---
I havent been able to activate it for quite some time now. I gave up on it
---
That would fix the grinding tbh
---
I do understand where your coming from but Would you ban someone for doing the right thing
---
confirmed..... thank you
---
CAN have the camera there. There's literally like 20-30 possible spots.
---
Server stability. Do you not think things through?
---
Hahahaha cloud of shit
---
Thanks I’ll try this out next time!
---
if it comes down to letting everyone "tag" the legendary or end an event, for the love of all that is fallout end the fucking event. i would rather get event rewards than some shitty legendary item i could get any fucking place in the game.
---
again, fuck everyone and end the goddamn event.
---
thank you quick-kill-players.
---
I have these for sale at my camp for 300 caps but only ONE a week
---
Not really a bug (unless it's unintended I guess), but the shoes on Roadtripper Blouse and Capris are clown-feet sized.  
---
The part which should enclose around the toes starts past the foot.
---
They are truly hideous and personally makes the outfit unwearable.
---
Ps4?
---
They're equally as annoying as the "Level up while..." quests. Level up at night while wearing swimwear and a clown hat whilst in a group completing a quest under the influence of alcohol and diseased by killing a stunted glowing deathclaw with a commie whacker; GTFO
---
Hold up.  Which bed is that?  Sheet and pillows??
---
What’s your tactic? I’m obviously approaching this the wrong way lol
---
I will testify that they are all here on xbox... lame cowards who blame Bethesda for allowing them to be a bell end...
---
I agree.  
---
 \&amp;nbsp; 
---
I just bought the game.  With all the outside contention and venom some folks have for the game (not in this sub, but elsewhere), I figured the playerbase would be just as toxic and venomous.
---
I was shocked to be showered by encouragement, information and gifts in a matter of minutes after leaving the vault, with some of my benefactors even appropriately dressed as Santa.
---
Thank you, post-apocalyptic loot pinatas!  I couldn't have dreamed of a better welcome party!
---
I seem to sell mostly ammo and plans.
---
What are you using? I struggle 🥵
---
Some people were temporarily suspended, wasn't aware of any bans. 
---
The suspensions were very brief.
---
i've used a spear for a large chunk of my playthrough up until i got my deathclaw gauntlet, it stabs AND swipes, i've seen it stab more often than it swipes though. also i can confirm from all of my experience, the stabbing can happen at any time, not when it hits something...
---
Sorry I completely messed the post up haha! I was talking about when you hover over the camp on the map
---
I have this happening to me as well, with a quad auto tesla rifle. It seems to be the Telsa rifle that is used when this happens the most. Although, I also had this happen a week ago with my 50cal. Making my tesla rifle to a semi-auto seems to have helped a little, but man is it annoying having to keep clicking.
---
Damn that was satisfying to watch!
---
but there is raider armor in the game...
---
Yes because storing 30 extra rows of data with the following fields: (id, name, description, stats, quantity) should greatly affect SERVER stability.
---
Lol, that would probably never happen, there needs to be certain perks for PA users, it’s like asking for legendary pieces.
---
So the people are still suspended
---
How do you get a scorched killer receiver? Craftable or a loot item?
---
You can’t even make floating bases right now without running into problems. It’s so infuriating.
---
Yes there's a couple of bugs on that event. Sometimes the lure doesn't work, sometimes the scorchbeast decides not to show. Sometimes it does work as intended.
---
How do you get a scorched killer receiver? Craftable or loot item?
---
Event plans sell well. Top dollar for stimpack diffuser plans. I still have success selling biv recipes and sheep sqatch weapon plans.
---
It's happening on all platforms no idea what's causing it.
---
The issue is that there is no way to verify that you had intentions of doing the right thing, or that the outcome even was the right thing.  All the system knows is that you had one number of an item and then suddenly had a suspicious amounts of an item. 
---
You have to remember, game data to the system is likely just going to be the equivalent of database lines like the below: 
---
* 12:00 pm - Nuka Cola = 3
---
* 12:05 pm - Nuka Cola = 909903
---
* 12:10 pm - Nuka Cola = 3 
---
In the above example, something was suspicious. The only way to have that number of items is if you had duped them or got them from a duper.  Just because there was no one else picking them up again after 12:10 doesn't mean that there wasn't an attempt to dupe, it simply can mean that the attempt to transfer the items failed.  I'm sure not long after there was another attempt at moving things over by the cheater after more duping. 
---
What feels like the "right thing" isn't always the "legal thing" (legal in this case falling within the ToS)
---
A txt chat system is sorely needed.
---
Ah, so you're just making this up or are insane
---
OK shit it's there sitting in my inventory. I think it just takes a while for it to load in my inventory. Sorry for wasting your time
---
I've sold a lot of the following items:
---
* Modded and painted PA parts.
---
* Plans
---
* Ammo: Shotgun shells, .45, 5.56 and 5mm.
---
* Challenge related items like alcoholic beverages.
---
* Magazines and bobble heads when sold cheap
---
* Cheap legendary weapons with average effects
---
* Fashnacht items that were still in my stash.
---
Yeah I know still kinda annoying cause it was my main
---
One of the regular vault tec beds they've sold at whitesprings all along.
---
Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam!?
---
Not over powered at all I die more playing a bloodied melee/rifle build then I do playing a normal build..sure bloodied gets strong but then the enemy looks at you and you die..so no not over powered at all..
---
I'd love to be able to delete where I extended the floor. Camp looks like a 5 year was let loose on my game
---
Ammo, harder to find plans/recipes/clothes, novelty junk items (colored bears ect), magazines, stimpaks and disease cures. I tend to offer things I think are interesting and I would want to buy. I keep prices fairly reasonable, have a range of different prices, lable my machines well and have a themed shop. I can usually sell at least 5k per night I play without having to try too hard.
---
Been trying to put a doorway over my staircase for ages now... And please let floor foundations snap to upper floors without needing stairs!
---
Thanks for the camp tour vid.   Anyone know which bed that is?  I’m drawn to the sheets and pillows like a moth to a flame.  Not sure why.  Probably too many months in the wastelands
---
LOL.... No PC
---
PS4 and Xbox One players can't acces the dev room and pc players risk getting banned for it.
---
Feeling that pain pretty keenly myself.
---
There's a new thing now too where I'll place a foundation and then a stair and suddenly every single part of the whole structure becomes load bearing and I can't remove a damn thing.
---
I need to ADD foundations to random parts of the structure in order to trick it into letting me remove the other parts.
---
I sell a lot of armor/event plans. In my experience, location is almost just as important. I can have a stash full of unknown plans for sale, but if I put my base in the Toxic Valley, customers stopping by drop by 50%. 
---
I have never sold any meds. I sell Stimpaks for 4 caps a piece, and have not sold one. 
---
Mutation serums reasonably priced goes quickly. Junk will not sell well in my experience, as people would rather collect it themselves, even lead and acid. 
---
I have sold a small amount of scripfodder (useless legendaries) when my stash and character was full for 100 caps a piece, they sold pretty well.
---
Grahm is an Npc!
---
Well honestly i feel ok with it, because you put yourself vulnerable by having low health all the time. There has been to much nerfing done. I could deal with the first nerf of TSE shotguns. But then the changed something again and now the weapon is pretty shitty tbh. If we gonna nerf bloodied then lets nerf all the other perks. So non legendaries will be equal as legendaries XD
---
And no i dont have a bloodied build.
---
[deleted]
---
Doh!  TIL.
---
Moving it changes your spawn point. Visitors spawn where your originally set it down.
---
And your ign otherwise no one will be able to join you
---
Exactly....you destroy everything untill a supermutant hits you from behind one time.
---
Thanks. Good to know.
---
Biggest mistake I made was moving from where I was lol. Had everything set up perfectly before. Bare in mind that this is a small building that I managed to fit everything on, and now I can only put in a tinkers work bench, footlocker, stove and banjo and they have to be tethered with rubber mats. 
---
I used to love that I had this pre existing and self contained 'home' to go back to whenever my travels took me there, and now I hate it. Call that my ocd or whatever, but things don't feel 'right' anymore. 
---
Thinking of slapping down a tent somewhere and going hillbilly, but they don't keep out the rain and that's another pet hate.
---
First world problems really haha.
---
No NPC's is boring. I love open world RPG games such as the Fallout series and Skyrim series because I enjoy killing random NPCS
---
Thanks, worked!
---
This, but since it's often a random different foundation they get stuck under, you would need to place a chair on EVERY foundation block!
---
someone already snagged the first one need to wait till next Saturday now
---
I get it, and I'm not saying that it's fair, just I can see how from a data analysis standpoint - an act you performed made you an outlier when they did their ban wave, and they have no way to verify why you came up as an outlier. 
---
Multiply this times all the outliers and it comes out the only "fair" way to handle this is to treat all the outliers the same.
---
That campfire thing bugs the EVERLOVING shit out of me. The big, central cooking spit over the fire has always been the centre of my many camps!
---
I'm wondering if it has something to do with people using the fires as dirt to plant crops... but even if they were doing that, why the hell stop them? People want flaming corn? Let them, who the hell cares??
---
I use the fire barrel now _almost_ under the cooking spit but it's just not the same and the pure, cool, white light the FIRE barrel radiates makes me grit my teeth every time I see it :/
---
You still need to find the tourist to get repair option for camera, otherwise it's just junk item. I honestly hate how everything they implement is about server hoping it's why i don't have camera 😅
---
Yeah I understand why I am I just want to play  this game again
---
My camp is in the west, on the river next to Ohio River Adventures. I see him every once a week at least.  When I had my camp closer to Sunshine Meadows, I saw him there too.  I think he travels that road a lot.
---
Bloodied melee builds are kinda balanced by the fact that you're up close and personal with your enemies, usually resulting in a quick death or spamming stims and running away. Not to mention melee builds are having issues right now connecting hits to enemies; 1000+ damage isn't that impressive when you're swinging 3-4 times to kill enemies. Bloodied rifles with proper VATS builds are annoying because you can't get anywhere near the damage these guys are putting out DPS-wise and they're usually far away from you with perfect 100% VATS accuracy. Both are a bit over powered but the rifles are just impenetrable in pvp
---
Florida man... Just stop
---
Every weapon which doesnt have a B in front of it's name is worthless. So its overpowered. The reason why its overpowered isn't the insane bonus you get when you're almost dead, its the bonus you get for beeing healthy. 
---
When you have almost full HP, bloodied boosts your weapon still stronger than any other perk (save Instigating of course, but I is a PvE only thing.).
---
So to make bloodied fair, it should kick in when you're below 40% health. If the player has more than 40% HP, it should do nothing. And on the bonus should be capped to 50% + Adrenal (not including Adrenal).
---
i did add you just a day late lol sorry, i'm on uk time and i usually am on at late night /late eve
---
You can do a lot of damage, but die so easily. Melee and armour were nerfed recently (unintended increased damage/resistance from over repair), so it's even worse. I've lost about 100 damage and energy resistance from this with my bolstering set, and I get killed by one hit from Max level ghouls now. 
---
I've also notices that I seem to do less damage, but this is purely anecdotal.
---
Non PA melee. I use alot of Vanguard's so far and usually have around 600 DR and ER
---
You get the plans by reading a terminal in the Responder’s Fire station. Near the Ash Heap, as part of the main quest, Join the Fire Breathers it something like that.
---
how weird is this turning me on ?
---
These constant alerts about how we’re building our camps “wrong” are really frustrating.  Camps should not take this long or be this hard to build.
---
im up for that too
---
Think that got patched
---
Happened to me. Stopped trying to use it.
---
Ask the Institute or Brotherhood of Steel.
---
I have my camp on the junk node right beside the BoS HQ. I figured that would be close enough to a spot where everyone is going to end up, but at the same time it probably excludes a LOT of low level players. Hard call.
---
What's a good price for a serum?
---
What would you recommend if I don't like having low HP?
---
You can see 'under attack' notification on this video it's meant he's not in pacifist. I can't understand why people prefer to complain instead of using pacifist.
---
The Appalachian radio is awesome.
---
This is why.
---
Where do you get the Biv and Sheepsquatch plans?
---
IIRC, you can build a fast travel target mat in workshops.
---
I sell mine cheap, for 300 caps a piece. I take down the queen daily and have a lot of spare flux as a result, so I basically consider making and selling them, free caps. But I have also seen people price them at 1000 caps a piece, and still sell well, since its still only like 25% of the vendors price.
---
Yeah, splitting the servers from vanilla to adventure and survival definitely helped ease the tentions. There's no excuse for griefing in the name of "well its a PvP-enabled game so I play fair and by the rules" now, and people who wanted fair fight  now have it in survival.
---
Died after a failed event and when I went back to loot everything from the event, it was all gone and replaced with robots.
---
I take it the plans sell mostly because it's a way to get them cheaper than the vendorbots...?
---
I’ll second that - building inside existing world objects is now incredibly broken. 
---
There’s a 99% chance anything not on the “floor” will teleport either onto or into the ceiling. 
---
The only way around this as the ^OP said is to use welcome mats or rugs.  Not always ideal and tends to glitch out in its own right.
---
For pvp anti armour weapon then, or you can try junkie's build its really fun since they fixed disappearing addictions (capped at 50% bonus dmg), for armour vanguard is for people that like 0rads and full hp, obviously one chameleon piece for pvp.
---
What? OP? So what if my gauss rifle does over 1k damage and 1 shots everything...
---
Biv daily’s and sheepsquatch events (free range and cryptid event)
---
Or a new super rare backpack
---
I got an 556 Instigating legendary rifle I have modded with scope, etc that I absolutely love.   Modded with focus on damage balanced with range since I am stealth sniper.   I one shot lower level things, and not as afraid of the glowing gouls, Yao Gai, etc.   i ran a .45 lever action for a while, still keep it for use when I am in lower leveled areas and don’t need to be stealthy.  Damn it’s loud.  Blam! Blam!  Lol I love it.
---
Who ever tought super mutants to be sneaky is an ass hole.
---
Cool makes sense. Junkies, never thought of that
---
pictures? :D
---
Besides fusion cores and shotgun ammo I can't sell any other ammo because no one buys it for 1 cap each.
---
I don’t mind this one as much, as it’s specific and not the damn “so, what’s changed” lazy type, lol.
---
I get four ore per
---
I never understood caviler vs sentinel.  As a melee class I'm never really sprinting while attacking stuff, and I'm also not standing still. I usually move around or strafe around as I'm attacking
---
My Faschnact stuff sells well.
---
That because it was recently fixed, there was a lot of people that wanted to do it when fo76 was released but as addictions were broken people gave up and get rid of junkies weapons
---
Actually...an instigating gauss has way more damage than a bloody one in that one first shot.
---
For real they dumb as shit yet can get the jump on yah when you aren’t looking
---
I’ve played fallout 4 with a script that enabled it and frankly while I understand it in part -  I don’t buy that excuse. 
---
There’s so much clipping in game already related to underarmour and armour and weapons that it seems more careless to leave out.
---
I’ve never had that happen but now the roof it is lol
---
You can sort your Vendors to display All, Vendor only or Vendor + Stash.
---
Then you just mark what you want to sell from your stash while using the vendor.
---
So a mod for a backpack. 
---
I'm sure I've done that camp Adams event more than 100 times and I've only got 1 mod for my backpack so far. Just 1 more possum token for the second.
---
Didn’t watch to the end, but thanks for the laugh. 👍😁
---
Cavalier in PvP is mostly to survive when you need to move, most of the time you want to just sit hidden as at least at this moment who shot first is the winner (obviously only if both have pvp build and gear)
---
Nah. High Risk High Reward game play style
---
Oh really?? I'm on PC, are you?
---
not to mention that a ghoul doesn't even have attack you. If one gets within ten feet of me the rads alone drop my health dangerously low quickly.  Bloodied is 100 percent risk/reward.
---
That would be great too
---
Idea:
---
There should be one back slot for all medium to large weapons. 
---
Anything in the small wep, pistol or knife class goes on to your leg. 
---
Bonus points if when throwables are equipped you have an ammo pouch on your other leg
---
Adrenal Reaction works like bloodied to boost damage at low health, could be what they meant by Mutations and Rads.
---
Bethesda made a top 10 list actually. 
---
It goes like This:
---
1. Fusion cores
---
2. Shotgun shells
---
3. Stimpaks
---
4. 5.56
---
5. .45 
---
6. Marsupial serum
---
7. .308
---
8. Recipe: mutton meat pie
---
9. Disease cure
---
10. Loose screws
---
I feel the fusion cores a lot
---
What are you talking about?
---
I agree that the community is awesome now! When the game first launched after beta on Xbox, it was a semi poisonous environment. A coin toss really, 50/50. Now it’s more like a surprise if someone is a jerk.
---
Thanks! That's kind of what I want but it seems out of date. It didn't have the modifiers for the first two weapons I tried.
---
I know right?! That was something I wanted from the beginning.
---
Ouch, but there’s some truth there.
---
GOD I hate building in this game. After building in even vanilla Fallout 4 and then with mods... in this game it is total bullhockey. A mess. Frustrating as HELL. I can place lights in mid air and floating bases but I can't place this concrete foundation in water even though it's only like 3 inches of water. it makes no sense.
---
sounds like a blast! If only you were on PS4.....
---
I’m not sure I’m there yet, but over time I may be!
---
I feel like this is the beginning of the most epic love song.  Or murder mystery. Not sure yet 😂
---
LOVE IT
---
I’m really glad they did that!
---
I’d bet the investigators cabin story would lead to an NPC arrival.
---
Letting low level players do all the work just slows down your progression
---
I fully intend on continuing to "send nudes," as I haven't even received a response message yet. I think he's playing hard to get ;D
---
Part of me wishes I didn't click that second link, but it startled a laugh out of me, so not all bad.
---
I have the same problem, but I've had others tell me they sell boatloads of 45 and 308.  I thought I could unload a horde of plasma cores for twenty caps a piece but they sat for two weeks and ended up in a brown paper bag so I could retake some stash space. Fusion cores do indeed sell though.
---
just put the vending machines there, problem solved
---
It's literally my favorite screenshot. Every time it comes up as a loading screen I laugh like an idiot.
---
I feel like so many people on PSN should send him nudes. 😂
---
Please keep us updated!
---
Piss off.
---
For me its server disconnects since the last update on Xbox.
---
Harold has that effect on people.
---
Eh, not sure if people are ready for the "Full Harold."
---
As a sniper, instigating is way better than bloodied with high damage weapons. Instigating is double damage compared to bloodied's 60%. An instigating gauss from stealth at night can almost do 3k. And easily more  if its explosive too. Granted its that one first shot but its all i need. One to the head and dead.
---
I'm trying to respec from melee into rifles. So I don't care if no one else gets exp I'm going to 1 shot everything. If others show up I will let them tag legendary enemies but other than that I'm only there for exp.
---
That's the beauty of Bethesda games you never know what and how is working or if it's working at all 😂
---
I took one sans glasses, but it just didn't feel right, ya know?
---
Location is defitely key. A buddy of mine was griping that he didn't know why no one was buying his stuff and I told him to move to a more central location. He passed for about a week because he had a really nice spot but grew frustrated about the lack of foot traffic and finally took my advice. He's now a member of the cap mule club because they come in faster than he can spend them.
---
I hope I start a trend.
---
Care to accompany the Lone Wanderer to the wasteland, if you know what I mean?
---
I’m not home right now but I’d love to help when I get home tonight maybe around 8 or 9 (I live in Sweden)

We grew up/stayed in the same vault for 25 years man, of course we will be friendly

JFC not moving my camp on my main. Took too long to line up right.

I've told this story on another thread, but it seems relevant here. I was roaming around the Ash Heap (I can't remember if I was doing a quest for just exploring) and I come across a bag on the ground. Vending wasn't a thing then so I figure someone left some scrap or ammo they didn't need and proceed to check it out. The bag was full of Stimpaks, RadAway, and other meds. I'm not talking one or two, I mean it looked like someone found the dev room and raided it. Before I can take any, I see another bag. This one was full of ammo. Then I see another. Then another. It's like a trail of bags. I'm following the trail like "Oooh! Piece of candy!" and then I come to a small camp. The camp consists of a few workbenches, a fire, and a player in a clown mask. I was only a level 30 or so at the time and this player was at a much, much, higher level (I don't remember how high exactly). I don't remember if the player had a weapon or not, but after about a minute long stand-off, I decide I don't want to be apart of whatever this dude has planning so I run away without grabbing any of the loot. I wander back a little later and the camp (along with it's treasures) are gone. I have no idea what that player was planning. Maybe kill me or just see how curious I could be before killing me.
---
OP, and anyone else in the comments: please check my CAMP glitch guide as you may find a solution to some of your problems.

I tried Cannibal this week and decided to go with Good Doggy. Faster, plenty of dog food around, and doesn’t have that annoying animation.
---
Thanks. I’m UK so not too far out time zone wise. I’m hoping to get it done before then on encryptid  events etc but If not I’ll drop you a message thank you :)
---
All this shit is just another brick in the wall of why this game sucks and I'm almost done playing it. Almost
---
Yes, I sell my plans at 10%-25% of the vendor bot prices. Only event specific plans sell for more based on my experience.
---
That is exactly what I'm talking about.
---
I use them as sidearms.
---
My rifle breaks, pull out my pistol.
---
Means carrying twice as much ammo, but that's better than 2 rifles weight-wise.
---
You can revive me. My character’s build is such that I don’t die (polar opposite of Bloodied build, instead of low health, my health never goes below 70%), so actually dying seems like a fun change of pace. 
---
I can be on in like 10-15 min. Gamertag PRL867. I’m on home screen now on smoke break. I can join your game if you tell me your GT or you can join mine in like 10-15 min.
---
This whole game is the prisoners dilemma writ large. 
---
Combined with the Spoon River Anthology.
---
This happens quite often to me at the Lakeside Cabins. Granted, one of the easiest workshops to claim, but it's near my camp and it has lead, so whatever. I'm setting up defenses when some higher leveled guy comes up. I give him a friendly wave, as you do, and he blasts my face off with a shot gun. He then starts to claim my workshop. I know I can't compete with this guy so I just respawn at my camp and go somewhere else. I look at the map and see the workshop is still under my name and the guy is roaming around Summerville. I don't know what he expected from me, but I sure as hell wasn't going to compete with a guy so high leveled over some crappy workshop by a dry river bed.
---
Worst part is that it was fixed at some point and the last updates seem to have messed it up again.
---
Abbzlizzy is my GT 👍🏻 thanks that would be awesome.
---
A lot of high levels will make sure low levels get a chance to gain some shots rather than one shotting. This way the xp is shared
---
[I'll see you on the "Strip"](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/a/a5/Yes_Man.jpg)

How's it work now and do addictions stack?
---
PVP is mostly ganking.
---
Factions I think could help.
---
Whaaaaat omg I wanna try that now!
---
Dont know much about melee tanks. Youre my total opposite lol the flimsy low health low armor sniper with a long range high damage gun.
---
Lol. 800 is amazing! 
---
200... now that sucked

More build is a bit more extreme: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1e168b&amp;d=sg2ir2l71s72eu0eh2sb2sq2s32sr2pe0ek0es2e31ee2cu0ip2a04lt2ls2l32&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=28cef1
---
But I share your love to heavy guns, i tried every possible build and this one is giving me most fun (maybe apart from collecting lead)
---
That's true to an extent, I think. I suffer a lot less griefers now than when I started playing at launch. I think they just got bored and realized they wasted 60 bucks on a game they know nothing about just to join the "I HATE FALLOUT 76" bandwagon.
---
You go to the legendary vending machine where you just churn your legendaries into scrip, you find them in any train station available and should reset every 22(?) hours
---
Wait, you thought I was serious? Sorry, I thought you were playing along...
---
yes for PvE Instigating is just beautyful, but in PvP its worthless.
---
I think it would be awesome if they added a complete automatron dlc. Find plans and build your own robot to use either to guard your base or as a companion. Would add an entirely new dynamic to combat for both pve and pvp.
---
I almost had the revive badge while battling the Sheepsquach with a few other players. I ran over to revive my fallen comrade and then the Sheepsquach kills me before I can. I feel robbed.
---
I see, your into robots. Tell you what you grease Yes Man’s gears and I’ll introduce you to a good friend of mine. His name’s Fisto.  Here’s his nudes:

Man if they lock content behind something as low-hanging as having to move your C.A.M.P. They are slapping any long-term C.A.M.P. Builders in the face.
---
I really hope new Power Armor isn’t locked behind a new achievement that would force me to destroy my base I’ve spent 6 months making.
---
On patch days I sometimes go work on my Starlight Drive-In city build. I revel in the joy of being able to place stairs (full or half height!) on the SIDE of a floor piece, or place railings AND posts along the edge of my covered porch... Then I go back to 76 when the servers are back up and die a little inside.
---
You will get 10% dmg per addiction but maximum is 50% even if you have more then 5 addictions, addictions come with minor debuffs and are permanent (unless you use addictol), if you use chem that you are addicted to, it will temporarily remove debuff but you will keep bonus dmg from junkies effect.
---
Wait til you read the stimpak super mats, then you'll be really bummed.
---
Yes this exactly. With how broken Blueprints and placing is C.A.M.P.s are this forcing us to rebuild our entire C.A.M.P. Just for some new content is just mean spirited. Let’s hope they hear our cries. Lol.

Only to discover you've gotta fast travel again because it spawned you inside the foundations

But by then someone else has usually cleared it and left ash/goo piles everywhere. Or built a Rocket base
---
Does anyone know how long a silo remains primed for launch after a clear? I have been tempted to clear 3 silos and then launch one after the other solo, just not sure if it is viable.
---
I've had that happen quite a few times, I know there's a glitch with I think the Gatling plasma flaming mod that can make people invincible. If my vats start acting like that on someone I leave, and I'm normally the guy staying till everyone else gives up. Not worth it
---
Is the pay that bad?  I have friends who are COs and they seem like they are making pretty darn good money.  Maybe not yacht money, but boat money at least.
---
Then you should just lose it, without any chance of getting it back.
---
You calling them a tard is worse than them playing the game. Real beta move lol
---
Name calling how grown of you
---
God bless the Queen!
---
In eso dungeon have lore and adventure. I think in Fallout 76 will be same.
---
PC? It was an announced update for PC only.
---
50+ players would ruin the servers.  Every farming run that happens would be done already and itd be incredibly difficult to tag bosses when there are 25 people at an event.
---
I had a bounty on me once and a guy came up and shanked me in the back for 10 caps. I got the last laugh when I respawned and blasted him with my shotgun.
---
The fact you can place a camp means people will just use the invincible concrete box camp glitch at the center of the map to never lose
---
Pvp is worthless in this game to begin with. Its basically who shoots who first. They should really mitigate how much damage players can do to each other. Cut damage by half and firefights might last longer than a second.
---
Like ya know when you open a game for the first time on like ps4 and you have to install it after you open it
---
I sure hope so tired of this all robot shit
---
What did he really expect? You're ten levels higher than him on Survival. The stakes are higher there.
---
And because they weigh 0.25 &amp; can be slot stacked.
---
The backpack challenges are annoying enough, and don’t get me started on “take a picture with a player in their underwear spanking a ghoul using a death tambo in a radstorm while standing in water while another player emotes in the background with an alien” challenges. 
---
Someone a while back mentioned something that this sometimes feels like a mobile game. Those are what make it feel like “logon for the day” quest.
---
yes, I've stopped playing PvP too, but its just a beta, it can grow into something good.
---
It isn't a pc exclusive, but a result of getting into the dev room that should be punished with bans.
---
Cool do you know the % bloodied can give?
---
You are doing less damage now, repairing a weapon over 100% no longer increases its damage
---
He means instead of a legendary item, a legendary creature will drop those instead. They take the spot of the legendary item in your drop.
---
You can’t make buildings out of Foundation blocks. That was patched out many patches ago.
---
Or even custom picture frames. Anything would be cool.
---
What is considered a tank in this game? Any melee class? I figured it's be melee with PA
---
If i will go for qol improvement, it will be herbivore and razor grain soup paired with good with salt.
---
Here's why: you can assign it on the quick wheel and this way under one button you have food+water+healing. It's very easy to made just boiled water and razor grain that you can plant in your camp. Low rads. There's probably more reasons that i forgot.
---
bring it to pc
---
My best advice is to pop out and back into build mode. Works for me 90% of the time.
---
Sure, psn Linzsays, getting on in a little while
---
Well we either one shot everything or we let you fight and get called lazy. Which is it? I feel like a dick if i just press L1 and R2 repeatedly and watch everything die. Should i bring a paddle ball?
---
Ah! OK sorry my mistake.
---
100% at 0hp
---
This fucker followed me all around Charleston Fire Station asking for me to wait, just so he could lay down a sweet burn.
---
Come on Todd tis isn't "immersive"
---
You took the mobs there. Only fair you should clear them up. My camp is my home, I can have locked doors if I like.
---
I did not know that. Thank you!
---
Like the personal jetpack mod in 4
---
20hrs, but yes
---
Some of us are bugged and it never triggers ever.  I fear you may be part of our exclusive club.
---
If you need a hand, PSN: Yukon-96
---
(This was before 1st Vending Patch) I found this happening after I hit the Build button on a floor tile, the floor tile turned invisible but nothing would snap to it. i couldn't delete it, couldn't stand on it, but my friends could see it, stand on it, and build onto it. I have a video clip of it I keep meaning to add to a glitch montage for this game.
---
I never realized how many recipes and plans I knew until going on shopping trips to CAMPs with plans for sale and finding nothing I don't already know.
---
Perhaps BIV could voice the commercials? I hand you to BIV for these important messages...
---
Not from someone’s generator
---
Fusion cores do not spawn in player owned generators. Only in the ones in the world.
---
I dont help period. Lol. If your base cant defend itself it deserves being destroyed. Build better bases.
---
I'm having the same problem.
---
I think the only thing that really bothers me is that there are exactly ZERO alive human npcs, I can bend my imagination so far but I can't imagine that there wouldn't be one or two or ten ppl alive in a cave or bunker somewhere in a game world this large, we have vault 96 and 94 but they are most likely going to be full of more hostiles.
---
I actually don't mind 76 without npcs, but I think what the OP said at the end made sense to me near the start, while everyone was complaining about what the game lacked I just kinda assumed they were going to flesh it out and add content over time. they even said as much with the games as a service thing.
---
I could see this happening once Legendary Power Armor is added. 
---
If you’ve played Fallout 4 you may remember that standalone Jetpack mods were some of the most popular mods downloaded and used in that game. 
---
The community definitely wants the freedom of flying a jetpack accompanied by the fear of flying to high and splatting on the ground. I for one would embrace my inner Rocketeer and always don a jetpack if they came out.
---
I also have an issue when I try to relocate my home and get told I can't place (even though its green) that I can't place a floating object, nothing is floating!!!
---
Preface: Brevity is not my strong point, and I’m feeling rather expressive this fine morning. 
---
Let me be crystal clear: I’m quite possibly the laziest of lazy high level player you’ll ever come across, and quite frankly I don’t care what anyone thinks about the way I choose to enjoy my time in this game. 
---
Having said that, one must define what they consider to be “lazy” in this game. By your post, your definition of lazy is in regards to events that attract groups of players, with the built in assertion that the players would work in tandem to beat a common enemy, and to which the “high level players”’simply attend and reap the rewards without actually participating in said fight. Please correct me if I’m wrong in redefining your opinion with a bit more clarity for those (including myself) that may have misunderstood. 
---
Now, I would like to address this from a few different levels. Of course, this is strictly my subjective opinion, and I certainly could be wrong. 
---
First let’s address “lazy high level players”. 
---
I am an extremely lazy player, and have achieved what most would consider to be a “high level” (currently Level 292 with 852 hours in game). Using the dictionary definition of lazy, I try to avoid “work” in the game whenever possible and instead prefer to simply purchase the rewards that one earns from completing various events from players that dutifully earned said rewards. I often massively overpay for things that are easily gotten by simply transversing the map and picking one up (I.e. an Arktos Pharma coat that anyone can get by simply going to the new area, but I simply am not interested in going there, and instead bought the coat for 1000 caps actual value is somewhere around 50 caps). 
---
I never completed Faschnat yet I own all plans, masks (except super rare ones like Old Man Winter), and even recipes. Never completed Laying Lowe yet I own every Sheepsquatch outfit and mask that exist in Game. Never completed main quest. Didn’t join enclave until Level 185. Still haven’t discovered the big Red Rocket truck stop or about 1/4 of the map. Too lazy to explore over there. Maybe one day. 
---
Yet, every single low level player that chooses to team invite me gets a goodie bag with some free serums, maybe a bobble or two, and a nuclear key card if I have extra. 
---
Anyone less than level 100 that buys from my vending machines (when I’m there) gets a free gift (usually a Marsupial Serum). If they already have it, it’s basically like giving them 500 free caps as they can sell it to any robot vendor for that. 
---
The point I’m making here is that just because a high level player is the King Ralph of Laziness (like myself) doesn’t mean we bully or take advantage of low levels. Maybe some do. But most don’t. 
---
Secondly, and perhaps the stronger of my two points is that even if there are “lazy high level players” that sit back while low levels do “all the work” in the Encryptid event, my retort would be well, consider it payback for the hundred times I and my fellow “lazy high level players” caused 98.7% of the damage to the Scorchbeast Queen while 15 players ranging on levels from 5-85 hid in the bunker waiting for her to almost die so they could get a single shot in with their pipe pistol and collect their Decontaminated Arch plans from her corpse. 
---
Simple Summary: This ain’t Overwatch nor is it the Pacific Standard Heist in GTA. It’s Fallout. And people can play it anyway they damn well please. Including you. And including me. 
---
:)
---
Tell us that again, after you've been one-shotted repeatedly by gulpers, assaultrons, ghouls, mutants,   scorchbeasts, mr gutsys, sentrybots, or cave crickets. Tell us again after you die from rad damage from nuke zones or ghoul hordes, or when you die from falling 10 feet, or when some no-skill jackass spams tesla bolts at the ground and you die instantly.
---
Until then, and this is just my opinion, stop with the nerf requests, which is exactly what saying "so and so build is sooooo overpowered", is.
---
...but then they sell the "Skull Mask" in the Atomic Shop - which clips through a ton of hats / headgear.
---
That doesn't seem to bother them at all.
---
The Mire in one of the electrical towers you have water and enemies except ones with guns can’t hurt your camp
---
What’s up your bum you little shit?
---
Known issue that's been around for a bit; it's funny none the less :)
---
Lol why should I work as a raider it’s against my code now get back to work and earn me my loot!
---
It’s purely cosmetic in player generators
---
Do they actually exist? I found the ammo but never found the paddle.
---
Sorry! Got distracted writing an obscenely long reply to someone cursing at “lazy high level players” and since I resemble that remark, I felt obligated to defend. Joining in a min.
---
Convince the main Fallout Reddit that 76 is fun.  -10 atoms
---
No worries still online!
---
Yes exactly
---
We sure do
---
We already have fancy options... *LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE*
---
YOU'RE FUCKING WELCOME, VIC

Ya that’s not very nice. You caused them to spawn you should defend it

Why can’t anything with a gun hurt your camp in an electrical tower?

Alone no more
---
I literally learned about this three days ago, it’s left on the dpad lets you swap to the weapon you where using before.
---
I had a random running up to me and I couldn't understand him. I didn't have my mic plugged in when I was playing so I quickly plug it in to say I can't understand him and then all I hear is alluah ackbar as he throws grenades at his feet and blows himself up... I didn't know how to react but I do love the game and community for the randomness it can provide
---
Oh man, that's not how bloodied works at all. At 60% health, it adds 0 to anything. To even get to 25%, to make it equivalent to TS weapons, you have to be at 35% health. You only get the full bonus at &lt;20%.
---
Yes. The heavy perks won’t be available until later with stabilized being 3 in agility and bloody mess in luck as the exceptions. I run a sneak attack crit / heavy weapon build and I had to use melee until I’d built up enough levels
---
If you get killed while on fire and res pawn fastly your invincible
---
The 7600 has to be either a joke or a way to keep track of hours played.  It would take 317 full 24 hour days of playing to hit that one.
---
Which I guarantee someone is going to complete on day 318. (Have to subtract time for when they shut down for maintenance.)
---
Sorry, but thats not true. Check the stats (the bloodied bonus is shown only when you equip the weapon, if unequipped, you dont see the effect in the stats display). At 60% Health its stronger than anything else (save Instigating).
---
Downvoted cause I don’t want to read a damn book to understand your point
---
Did you just miss the sarcasm or are you offended by a joke
---
Camden park gotta buy it with the mr. Fuzzy tokens that those dailies give you.
---
It really just depends on who stops by I guess. I have people I play with that know I always have tons of 5.56 and buy a bunch along with randoms buying 5.56 and .45.
---
Thank you! I walked away from that quest a little disappointed with a 10mm anti scorched pistol 😂 🔫
---
Lazy low level player. ;)
---
My favorite location to build in so far has been directly west of the crashed space station, on the cliff overlooking it. If you place your camp in just the right spot, you can have access to the toxic water below to place some purifiers. It’s a great scenic spot. If you get lower level visitors you can bring them to the space station and put in the code 111418 at the only locked door there to get them a cool looking space suit they may or may not appreciate. I camped here for a long time and loved it. Only reason I don’t return is cause my shop does better in a high foot traffic area. But for a nice scenic spot, this was the spot of my dreams
---
This thing is lucky I'm not armed
---
Glad to be a member sir
---
Works about 50/50. One of the most buggy quests.
---
Ur mom
---
Less than PA but you’ll die to almost anything else. Scorchedbeasts will destroy you.
---
Lol no
---
....what he said.
---
There are a few ponds up river from alpha silo that are really nice. Although ones probably to close to a fissure site, the other two are pretty serene.
---
Getting sonic blasts or hearing mole rats are enough for me to get involved. I’d prefer to shop in peace. I like listening to the vending music. 
---
Now, if the prices are really bad, I may consider letting the SB go to town.
---
Im all in favor of friendly players but the amount of people on this sub bragging about literally combat logging is astounding. Sure some people may not like pvp and it sucks when you get into an unwanted fight but just because you dont want pvp at all doesn't give you the right to do what is considered a bannable offense in many multiplayer games.
---
Oh man that's so nice! Unfortunately I'm on PC
---
I really have no idea, what I have to do for the challenges... 🤷‍♂️ (German player here) Guess Google is my friend..
---
Ahh everything is making sense now
---
I’m the same way. I actually removed my doors and all my water and such stay unlocked for other players. 
---
Except my resource collector. That shits mine 😉
---
Haha, do what you want. For me, if I find a locked camp, I will find a way inside. [I have my ways and just enjoy the challenge](https://youtu.be/nCP-tc1TK-k). Also, if you have a switch to disable your vending machines and you sell things at shitty prices, I will turn off your machines to not waste other players time.
---
I know, right?
---
I'm just glad I can get free Atoms to buy neat sale items or the things I absolutely need for a particular theme build.  I sat up last night and finished the weekly and most of the daily challenges and now I'm ready if something neat goes on sale.  I didnt bother getting the camera for a month so I missed out on a lot of challenges.
---
They can't give you easily obtainable Atoms without cutting into the revenue needed to continue developing this game.
---
Eh lazy high level character
---
No way to change it. My spawn location is inside a mountain but it changes if someone is at my camp
---
Youll eventually get so many perk cards eventually so dont sweat it. Focus more on your special. A heavy gunner tank? Focus strength, endurance and some intelligence.
---
Added
---
Dude these New and Old build bugs are having me consider taking a break too. I have 3 separate turrets that are taking up my Build budget that disappeared after a Scorchbeast destroyed them and I attempted to “repair all”. 
---
All I have a wires running to invisible turrets I no longer have the budget to replace. And they want us to spend months building a base? Not with these bugs!
---
If you look at the thread below yours regarding the new Power Armor set in Nuclear Winter you can see they may requiring us to build brand new bases just to unlock said reward. They just don’t want us to have nice things for very long. Haha.
---
Thanks!!! Nice base btw!
---
Thanks. I’m going for a heavy gunner in power armour and I’m looking to follow this build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f117f89&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82s22ic3ip2ih2id2a72a04l22lp2ls2c72cu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Heavy%20Gunner&amp;m=
---
Yep. We need auto-closing doors.
---
Thanks 👍🏻
---
I say it's 100% worth it, especially if you have class freak
---
I know. It was just a joke to coincide with the OP’s assertion.
---
Thanks for the info, logging and reporting.    
---
Question/Suggestion.  
---
Next time this happens, if you don't already still have it set up this way, configure a direct power run (nothing inbetween) from a generator.    
---
I see you mentioned a separate generator, not sure if you left it on them
---
PC Load letter?! What the fuck does that mean?
---
Yeah, I think you're missing the point. Stuff that maxes out at level 45 is never going to have a level 50 variant.
---
On the other hand, they only came to the camp because they were invited by a powered vending machine. If one doesn’t want people at their camp, they shouldn’t invite them there in the first place.
---
This did to me with the tile and a roof in the same spot 🙄
---
Thanks! Sorry it took me a while. I had to take out all my perk cards because I have lots of backup fail safes to make sure I normally don’t die. Using my Explosive Shotgun, I kept regenerating my health because I forgot it was Vampire. Oops.
---
Their are two spawns for Free Range, one is in the far eastern part of the map about 400m's from Berkley Station at the Southern Belle Motel
---
The other is east of Whitesprings a good bit and that location is Big Fred's BBQ Shack
---
They do not spawn simultaneously and will sometimes rotate with one another, I have my camp pretty close to Southern Belle Motel so every 30-40 minutes I'll check and see if the event will pop when I go near the location, if it doesn't I'll run west a ways before fast traveling (to save on caps) to Big Fred's.
---
The event Free Range doesn't seem to pop up very often on the map on its own, and I would encourage anyone who reads this to periodically investigate both areas if your interested in hunting Legendary Sheepsquatch's down.
---
😂😂 hey no worries thanks for doing me a favour!
---
I see this complaint on here a lot. It’s never happened to me and I keep my machines stocked constantly. But it sounds super frustrating and I hope a solution is out there
---
Yep, you're [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhvz9d/guide_indepth_weapon_legendary_effect_mechanics/). In 200 hours as a bloodied build, I have never looked at it.
---
Although, if you look at the link, nocturnal seems to give a 50%-100 bonus at all times, and I don't see anyone complaining about it being overpowered.
---
I have no control over food drink or chem weights. I'm using rank 1 thru hiker, but still overweight from waaaaay too much aid. Probably~150
---
Whitesprings. A lot of foot traffic for your vending machines and alot of vendors for you too. Alot of nukes too tho.
---
I’ve got some ridiculously over priced outfits to sell you
---
Said except those with guns only they can hurt it
---
Is there really any harm in letting us build items that intersect?
---
There's a third up in the extreme Northwest corner of the map next to Groves Family Cabin, as well.
---
Going to have to remember that, thanks ;D
---
I moved my camp and couldn't replant my corn because of this bug. Really irritating.
---
No worries at all. If I ever decide to do that quest, mission, challenge or whatever it is, I may ask to do the same to you. But I’ll probably forget and never do it anyway. Lol. I’m old.
---
Oops. Illiterate am I. :)
---
If you log to menu and log back in it will fix this glitch and the floating glitch too. 
---
Well for a time. But logging consistently worked and I fixed my base. Hope it helps!
---
No problemo just drop me a message ever. Yeah I don’t even know why I want this backpack, just doing the quest for something to do 😂
---
You can move the CAMP device itself while in build mode, and it will change your spawn point. Put it somewhere dry, and test out where you spawn afterwards.
---
4 machines per camp, 24 players, you're talking more like 3000 items. which I can tell you the game really doesn't like that kind of thing.
---
Oh how I miss FO4 “Place Anywhere” mod.
---
It was never 200.
---
How much food do you carry? I carry at most 25 waters and dog food. 25 weight.
---
I have rank one thru-hiker and rank three of the chem carry perk. it keeps my food/aid down to about 120... I could easily halve that, but i'm a compulsive hoarder and can never leave a food/aid item without picking it up!
---
I was just going to link this. I do think assorted plans sell as well (my best items). There’s just so many different plans no single one shows up on the list with the exception of the unique event ones.
---
The physical disc won't contain any updates from after it was created. So, you have to download those, regardless of system.
---
If you can’t fix it, duct it.
---
I will take the mininukes lol
---
If youre hurting just get carnivore mutation and eat as you go. Meat is everywhere.
---
Somebody did this to me once, had some shitting and farting noises playing over their mic. I gave a thumbs up and put a toilet on the bed in response. I added a please wash your hands sign too, but sadly I had to remove them both to free up space.
---
Yep, location makes a huge difference. Proximity to other vendors helps too. I usually tend to switch servers if no other vendors are nearby. Usually no one wants to drops 30 caps to fast travel to an area for just one shop.
---
Vault-Tec...? Remind me again?
---
I spawned into someone’s locked house the other night. They had no escapable windows either. It was almost immediately attacked by Super Mutants. I waited patiently for them to smash the walls and let me out, snuck past and watched from a distance while they wrecked the place. 
---
I have no issue with having a locked safe room or something, but if you’re gonna lock up the whole place, don’t invite people over.
---
Really? I spawn outside of my camp boundaries. In all my past camps too.
---
I just found this post to look for Royal Jelly - I have a neck ache now 😂 That place is nuts!
---
It’s good idea with dog food 
---
1 perk and it’s 3 times better
---
Is it hard to get that food?
---
Server stability. Yes, its come lightyears but still...
---
Bit of a double-edged sword I'm afraid.
---
If you delay content for fixes, people will get bored and burn out, especially if bugs aren't a major issue for them personally.
---
On the other hand, pushing out broken content will put off people who would rather wait for the fixes.
---
There needs to be balance (and some actual QA/Playtesting).
---
Guy should diffidently be over limit. I don't know if you can sell items out of your inventory, which would easily explain why he is carrying so much shit, as you could reduce the weight of explosives, Energy weapon ammo and junk by 90% which would bring that 1200 pounds stuff down to like 180 pounds.(minus the Nuke Cards) so his inventory would then weigh something like 227 pounds.
---
That would explain why the broken camera I bought at White Springs initially couldn't be repaired, lol. Oh well.
---
Except if you are in a nuke silo.
---
They messed up lighting or something, and so needed to reupload part of the patch for PC players.
---
Think glass cannon. High damage but fragile. Does that sound good for a heavy gunner PA character?
---
I agree totally. When we emerged from vault 76 to a world without npc's it fit the theme of having to start the world over. We had to discover a new mutated world. Learn new skills and figure out the best strategies for taking down scorched beasts. 
---
I have never been an online gamer. I really struggle with talking to people at times but Fo76 is a happy medium for me. It has brought me out of my shell a little and now I enjoy meeting random players. I have met some weird but wonderful characters around Appalachia, with interactions that an npc couldn't ever match. I think at times I evolved with my Avatar. Emerging from the vault I was wary of any player interactions. As time went on my avatar and I have discovered the territories and gained a trust and admiration for other players. From players building awesome CAMPs to Players who could one shot kill most things but don't so others can enjoy the spoils. I now regularly team up with others which at the start I didn't even see as a possibility.
---
This game has had its problems and it wouldn't be a Bethesda game without bugs but I feel the major problems are behind us and what's left isn't game breaking but a minor annoyance. 
---
This game now has so many directions it could take and with each DLC it's starting to feel more alive and populated.
---
What do you consider cheap? As in legendary 2* weapons for 10 caps cheap?
---
Yeah I spawn at the edge of my CAMP boundary, if I don't move the device after initial placement. If I move it, I'll still spawn some distance from the device, but it's kind of unpredictable as to where.
---
I wish they would give us back the spawn point floormats from beta..... Those were awesome.
---
Would it conflict with health regen? Feels like he might not want that for a bloodied build.
---
The Burrow's kind of sucks, Feral Ghouls don't seem to drop anything beyond garbage tier 1\* Armor now, so I don't really ever bother going their.
---
2 Best methods I've found are doing the Free Range even with multiple high level players (I've experienced up to 3 3\* Legendary Sheepsquatch spawn during that event, and doing the Project Paradise event at Arktos Labs. (not so much for the reward or Alpha kill, rather the many MANY respawning robots who will sometimes be legendary, as well as Feral Ghouls and all sorts of wildlife depending on the area your in)
---
There are three Bumblebears in the beekeeper house in Helvetia!
---
So true
---
I have combat but pump is the best
---
He can just use radiation to keep his health low
---
Take sunshine industrial farm, farm about 20 Salisbury steak. (30% food I think?) If you completely power up Poseidon it provides 100 power to sunshine.
---
Stick those in your stash for emergencies, and most of the time you'll just pick up enough food in your travels, without carrying too much. Most of my food goes bad before I need to eat it, and that's with speed demon.
---
When it comes to water you should be fine carrying just 10/12 purified water, and restock each time you go to camp.
---
Also if you have a farm at your camp corn soup is great for emergencies since it's super cheap and fills both food and thirst.
---
Didn’t God Howard say that the Fo76 team is huge, some hundred people? I fee like they could easily divide the workload for both bugfixes and content.
---
Legendary quad-double barrel, even a one-star, because it's hilarious. It makes no sense, and it's inaccurate beyond a yard, but it dumps damage like crazy. So much fun.
---
Sent you messages how ?
---
I have this problem too so I will exit out of build mode and then go back in and sometimes that does help. Not always, but sometimes.
---
My thoughts exactly. I'm cool with a locked personal room, but if I get to your house and there's no stash box, no crafting table to break down junk, and particularly if I spawn in and get trapped inside and have to FT away, I'm not going to be impressed!
---
Not anymore, sadly. They removed sloths from the tame list a few patches ago. :(
---
Arkos Pharma is full of legendary enemies even when the event isn’t active. I found a TSE 50 cal and I almost never find good legendary weapons/armors. It is by far the best place to farm for legendaries.
---
That is the biggest divide between old and new school gaming:  difficulty and handholding.  Old school was a lot more rewarding, but could get frustrating.  (Don't get me started on point and click adventure games with their pixel wide hotspots and instance item use logic.) Frustration is not a feature new school deals with since there are so many non frustrating options out there.
---
76 tries to deliver both:  you could see it when Laying Lowe came out.  A lot of people on here really complained that some of the quest line was hard to figure out.
---
If I fast travel there they are natural spawns.
---
If you fill your hp bar with rads then you have a certain amount of hp that you can have, and if you get hurt in a fight then your hp will regeneration to that limit so if anything it just helps, I'm a maxed out bloodied build and healing factor is great, and I dish out upto 5.2k a hit still. Healing Factor is a great mutation all around
---
More like 6 years old. Just block &amp; continue enjoying the game.
---
I stand corrected... 400.
---
Felt like 200!
---
Pretty good actually. There’s this mod in F4, adds the Lyons Pride to the game as permanent allies, did you base it off that?
---
Yall right that there will always be those who try to exploit a weapon/armor package deal and I'm all for it bcuz if someone buys something resold at a crazy price then it'll be a good lesson to always shop around.
---
I don't know if Beth'll ever let us sell ammo individually but doing sale packs would be the same except instead of 500 shotgun shells it'll be more like 2000 with the included weapons sold in kits just to sweeten the deals.
---
Ppl using gatling weapons would be perfect for this because how quickly ammo evaporates when using them. Similar grenade packs would draw people too
---
I’m in the savage divide east of top of the world. 
---
My trading post does crap for business likely because of location. But looking at free fast travel jump spots, you can save caps by picking a spot here. There is a lot of hidden water and scenery surrounding site alpha.
---
try  putting up fences 
---
 🙄 
---
and attacks and enemy spawns need to turned off 
---
while in camp mode
---
And why shouldn't the servers be able to handle 3000 items? 3000 items computationally is nothing. You can throw multiple spreadsheets or databases with tens of thousands of rows at a $300 home PC without blinking an eye but somehow we're supposed to accept that this purpose built software on dedicated compute resources is expected to choke on and amount of data that can be queried, processed, and sent back in milliseconds. Databases and data structures are not new. These are not problems that are unsolved in other software and even other games. We really should be able to expect them to do better than this.
---
Scorchbeast, specially the one in the bog, loves to land in the nearby place at the railroad so you have to go there, kill everyone and then kite the beast to the lure.
---
I spent a good hour building defences throughout the bullet factory, fought off 3 waves of attackers, then a high level asshole came and took it. Won’t be making that mistake again
---
I can get past the bugs mostly by just restarting the game, but I can't get past same way with missing endgame.
---
They have the pressure plate doors
---
I'm pretty sure you can go right back in the silo. I know the turrets won't respawn, though I'm not sure how long it takes for the missile to respawn
---
That happened to me too, so I just set down a fusion generator and connected it to the processor.
---
Did you plug it into the wall socket? You can't run them things without power.
---
This should only happen if they do legendary power armor. Which they also should not do.
---
That brahman killing scenario would have been a great reason to murder someone while they cook. Some ppl are extra bold with adventure's invincibility
---
I know, but my point is the vendor should, its already giving armor that never dropped as legendary before.
---
All I can picture is whitesprings
---
I have no idea.
---
I'm sort of an Agnostic when it comes to Bethesda, I don't believe their omnipotent, just really good at pretending to be.
---
My pistol build lasted 88 levels before I threw in the towel.
---
Pistol cards need to be moved out of Agility and into Perception. That would help a ton. You cannot pick up everything you need with only 15 perk points. Regular and Auto pistols need to be combined into just one set of perk cards.
---
The Western Revolver has comparable sheet damage to a Hunting Rifle, but nowhere near the mods. No Armor Pen, no silencer, very little receiver choices. 44 is in the same boat.
---
I honestly do not get the Single Action Revolver AT ALL. Crappy DPS, crappy reload, no mods (outside of ivory grip). The only thing it has going for it is the slightly higher ROF over a Western.  Seriously... someone convince me the gun is not complete garbage.
---
10mm is certainly the most versatile pistol out there, it just doesn't do enough damage to take on the higher end content. Ammo is easy and cheap to make though.
---
The pipe weapons used to pull from both pistol and rifle perk cards for damage, but now you have 9 perk points invested into a gun just to have it still do less dps because their base damage is so low. And I imagine at some point, Bethesda will decide it is a bug and patch it out.
---
Laser Pistols are just a complete waste. Less dps than their ballistic brothers, and 90% of the content out there has higher Energy Resistance than it does Ballistic Resistance.
---
Low damage, high ROF weapons in general do not do well in the end game content. The damage mitigation formula in this game heavily punishes those types of weapons. Why do you think they tweaked the heavy guns like they did? Drop the ROF, but increase the damage per shot so more of it goes through all the armor, etc.
---
If you want to run around and farm WS and any other non-armored targets, pistols do well enough. You can make yourself marginally useful on the SBQ fight by being on add control, at least until the Fog Crawlers and Yao-Guis, etc. show up and laugh maniacally as your rounds just kinda bounce off them.
---
I had (still have) a huge selection of pistols to work with; I tried every combination I could think of to make it work.
---
He sits in retirement until they ever become viable.
---
Well munchity crunchity eat their bolts and screws. I eat a bowl of nails for breakfast...without any milk.
---
this 
---
 walking  camp full of these dammed 
---
things is not fun 
---
nor are the practical jokers who 
---
put their camp on the edge of a cliff
---
Does that work on regular front doors which require no power?
---
Want to instantly make thousands of caps? Go to grafton station, spend about 300 caps total getting the 3 BoS combat armor plans for arms, legs, and chest. Server hop to buy as many of these as possible. Now put them all in your vending machine (or one set at a time) for about 500c for arm and leg plans each, about 750-1000c for the chest plan. You’ll get people buying these almost immediately. Last night when I first got on, I made 2k caps before my camp even loaded in all the way. Throughout the night I made another additional 12k caps for those same plans and other stuff.
---
Seriously, out of everything this is one of the stupidest changes they made.
---
Check top of the world. There are 5 potential plan spawns there (plus 2 camp plan spawns).
---
Nope. They are their own doors. But you can use laser triggers to open and close them as well.
---
Its pretty common. I never run out and i have speed demon.
---
Did you try doing the campfire first and then the spit over it? I was able to place it like that earlier this week
---
would like Special increased to 60 as well 
---
too many perks not enough points
---
Do you know John Lennon?  He said, I’m an artist.  Give a a fucking tuba and I’ll get something out of it.
---
Even though it's not lore friendly I'd open my wallet up for the ranger outfit and helmet from NV
---
Check your quests in your Pip-Boy and see if you already have the quest. Make sure to flip through every tab of it, I think there’s like three or four different quest tabs now
---
Likely on Console, using the Xbox or Playstation messaging systems.
---
I would like to see some bug fixes.. yes...
---
Ricochet perk is great against these guys. I run silos religiously and by far the best thing to use against them. That or a full set of bolstering armor with 700+ energy resist they are a joke.
---
The alpha is not that difficult to kill, as long as you’ve got high damage weapons. Although he does do a lot of damage
---
Yes, but I like my aesthetically pleasing fancy door or diner door. They should just make it so it closes after a few seconds. Easy. :)
---
It’s like if I put my pocket knife on top of my toilet bowl does that make it something else.
---
If the plant is not repaired, the power from the plant on the wall is only putting out 10 power. With it repaired it puts out 100. Which the the processor requires 100 so you would have to build a fusion generator or a lot of the normal ones for it to produce cores
---
No, this is wrong. You most definitely can and it's even easier to do now because you dont need to use campfires in between layers. I have my bunker built this way.
---
Tbh I have traps that can be hopped over as constantly enemies that spawn go straight for the generator I have for where my vendors are set.
---
Those can be easily made into lore friendly versions by adding the riot version instead or by removing NCR tags. It would even be nice if it would get factions themes. I have a mod in F04 that added riot and ranger armor with different decal options. Loved the raider decals.
---
I did check but it’s apparently not there. And if it was, the dialogue from talking to the robot would make the quest progress but he just says hi and random stuff.
---
I've taken to running away until my ap bar is empty as soon as I load in, then wait for it to regen, turn around and run back. Still annoying, but a lot less annoying than getting stuck in a floor.
---
Trapper helm please and now thank you!!
---
Also unlock your CAMP, due to the current spawning at other people CAMP I find myself more than once locked inside their building and have to fast travel out.
---
I spawned in under someone’s floor and asked him if he knew that people spawning into his camp were getting stuck in a 1x1 foundation block. He said he didn’t care. Makes you wonder why he even bothers selling things in the first place anyway. Makes sense though since he had like 6800 of everything lol
---
Yes. I have experienced this.  I made a water farm with like a million in-water purifiers. I reduced the number to 10 and they started producing.  I have had more success with the on-dirt smaller ones. Not sure if there is a trick to it like how base building can be finicky, or whether it’s a bug.  Maybe it’s both!  Good luck. 😊
---
If Vault and raids aint gonna be about teamplay and rewards based on that, then this game future is gonna be "Great example, how not to build online game". Take the Burrows- 0 teamworks, 0 rewards = No One Cares. Take that Arktos Pharma- bit better than Burrows, but still = No One Cares. SBQ = Just some dull shooting, basically same... no one cares. If you want to appeal to F4 players who love story and lore, why do you even build an Online game? Want to appeal to players who play online game? Then build what online players want.
---
There is something to showing up with multiple high level players. Sometimes my group will leave team in game, join a PSN party so we can still talk, and run through some of the higher level events as five or six different teams, which seems to trigger some upscaling. While I do think being in a team with high levels seems to have some impact, it doesnt seem to compare to everyone showing up separately. Maybe there is some sort of aggregate calculation taking place for team levels. But this method works at West Tek, AWOL, Path to Enlightenment, One Violent Night, Heart of the Swamp, Free Range, Encrypted and even Scorched Earth, with the trash waves appearing to spawn larger volumes of enemies and therefore more legendary foes.
---
I have one door and double stairs to get in my base, nothing comes up those stairs.  So my door is unlocked (often opened when I get home grrrr) and half my water is unlocked for my customers.
---
Me and my girl have said this since beta, but I think a great thing would be the ability to customize outfits you have.
---
Like change the colors, add symbols or faction logos etc. Allow everyone to be wearing the same outfits but be a little more personal with them.
---
Also, make your machines relatively easy to locate. Don’t store them somewhere deep within the cryptic labyrinth you call a fort.
---
Nah, once you have the quest he only ever says hi and stuff. Keep looking, it seems like you’re missing something
---
At 0.1 lbs each, screws are the FIRST junk you should get rid of
---
That's the lobster cage helmet, right?
---
holy non sequitur, batman.
---
This is fantastic
---
You don’t have to be a full bloodied build to take advantage of Adrenal Reaction or other low-health perked items. They’re incremental as your health decreases, so even a 20% reduction gives a boost. 
---
I run Adrenal with the mindset that if my health gets low, the extra damage will help me end the fight quickly and get to safety. Then healing factor will kick in and bring me back up.
---
Alright, so I guess I never need to craft any weapon or make any attachments then. *shrugs*
---
I am looking for plans.  That's why I visit vendors.  But I only sell a few.
---
I sell tons of plans and it’s the main thing I check for at camps. I’ve dropped all my mole mine gauntlet and buzz blade plans but I consistently sell everything else. 
---
I do wish apparel had a separate category from armor though.
---
Bloodied combat. Great dps plus mods for this are nice
---
Doing battle against a friend who was using a quad explosive double barrel with  scattershot and enforcer... that’s my bet. Broke my legs on the first shot.
---
Ye i saw that 😕
---
It would be nice to be able to sell these to the game vendors, but yeah, I’ve visited so many camps with 3/4 machines full of junk plans, selling for 50+ caps each.
---
Ty.Will farm em
---
Note that with the way armor works in the game, a dps calculator could end up misleading.  
---
1 attack per second / 100 damage.  
---
10 attacks per second / 10 damage. 
---
Sounds equal, but the first one effectively deals twice the damage to health, when armor is considered.
---
Look up the FO4 armor formula. It supposedly hasn't changed.
---
Even just being able to type a short description for your map marker would be nice. People could use it however they like.
---
I don't want plans!! 
---
There fixed the title :p
---
Mine did exactly the same thing when I changed to the default
---
"It just works!"
---
-Todd
---
I should be able to poison the meat somehow, so eating it kills them, and logs them off the game, and restarts their computer
---
I went looking for very common plans yesterday that, while I was building, I realized my character didn’t know. So, you never know which plan will come in handy for someone.
---
I found a vengeful mothman outside of site alpha when I was in the middle of fighting a yao guai. But again I think that's all rng
---
They really do need to make the camps far more lenient for placement.  99% of the time, I can not place my camp anywhere in any terrain even it looks wide open.  The only work around I've found is I need to keep the foundation footprint as tiny as possible just so it will place down.  This means I can't make anything remotely sprawling or interesting.  It's been quite frustrating, and it takes a lot of fun out of a key part of the game.
---
Find tick blood
---
Will unlock automatically
---
I found one. Quad, dmg while aiming, armor while aiming. It's a super fun weapon ... You can hammer out 8 shells so damn fast. Expensive in ammo, though.
---
Same, what I don’t get is, if your level 100 you still get shredded by them, but the mole miners are level 28 an I use a missile launcher it does nothing
---
I've sold thousands of 5mm. But yeah, shotgun shells are definitely the second one.
---
Server hop Watoga. Check the diner, transit hub, and the rooftops.
---
Takes two tick blood per, but using chemist it becomes a two for two.
---
The server cares.
---
I’m level 74 with good armor AND with rank two barbarian. An arktos farma Assaultron can two hit me with melee. Am I doing something wrong? I like being out of power armor sometimes, but at arktos the only thing stopping me are the Assaultrons.
---
Adrenal reaction makes every weapon better. Even if you don't do the bloodied thing, you're gonna be fighting things and loosing health.
---
Thanks!! I’ll check it out!
---
Or you place an item and it attaches to the damn roof instead of the floor! Arghhhh!!
---
Maybe you should just make a game then champ.  Show those ass clowns how its done!
---
I've got a 3* quad explosive 15% faster reloading db shotgun, it does crazy damage with the right perks
---
&gt; People want flaming corn? Let them, who the hell cares??
---
Because it somehow "breaks" the "in-game economy" (read: somehow fucks with the Atom store) in their minds.
---
Thank you! You are a hero!!!!
---
I've done hundreds of events waiting for a recipe: blackberry honey crisp. Then there it was. In a player vendor for 50 caps. God bless the plans and recipes vendors.
---
Which platform? Just curious, wasnt me lol am only lvl52 😋
---
970930 it stays the same.
---
What kind of LA are you using in the video? I ask because its missing A LOT. You can tell its missing because your crit meter isnt filling with any of those shots. Is it a two shot by any chance?
---
Idk what you're talking about, people come buy my plans pretty regularly. Also if you hover over thier marker on the map you'll get told what they got, look no surprise.
---
Someone stalk an shoot this
---
Currently experiencing a bug where the friendly tick teleports in the arktos challenge, and then I died, and it's not letting me respawn. This is the first time I've played in a couple weeks. Fucking ridiculous that there's still so many bugs in this game.
---
If no blood on the corpse use butchers bounty perk
---
Ha
---
You say this, but they all sell in my vending machines.
---
Just got a quad faster fire rate less vats cost double barrel and it is hilarious. Not as effective as a bloodied explosive obviously but very fun to use
---
Ok, thank you! I really appreciate it!
---
I wouldn’t mind being proven wrong. What’s your method for stacking foundation blocks directly on top of one another?
---
Are you just placing foundation blocks in strategic spots and then carefully snapping more blocks to the side of each one? If that’s the case it doesn’t sound like it would be even or uniform.
---
Yea I'm glad Bethesda didn't waste their time on Human NPC's! The game is perfect the way it is! F76 Doesn't need to add anything else tbh, and if they do decide to add Human NPC"s I'm quitting the game. Tired of Human NPC"s and their one dialog annoyingness
---
come buy some from me on PC, 1 cap a piece!  seriously though scrap any weapons you come across with the scrapper perk.  you will be sitting at hundreds/thousands after killing supermutants over and over.
---
Adventure mode, unlock every door. Survival mode, lock everydoor except vendor.
---
I have 6 purifiers going and i leave my base to farm come back and they are full.
---
Thank you! I can’t buy off you because I’m a console peasant lol
---
I replaced a wall because somehow a mongrel spawned in between the walls. So when I tried to put it back it says intersecting with objects, meanwhile the wall had a domino effects with the rest of the ones attached to it and now I had to rebuild my whole base. At least there are no spots under my base where enemies can spawn anymore lol
---
Attachments take no more than 10 screws, exactly how many weapons are you modding? Those weapons belong in the scrip machine anyway
---
And unlock your doors lol. I'm tired of having to climb through your windows into my PA
---
Go find some packs of low level Scorched or Super Mutants—Morgantown Airport, Grafton, Point Pleasant—take all their guns. Then equip the scrapper perk and scrap them all. You’ll get tons of steel.
---
The only reason I can think of why they wouldn't is the backpacks are now a thing, I know there's some mods that do this for FO4 but I'd imagine they'd need a lot of slots or else they''d clip into outfits very easily considering none of them have the same shape.
---
go play minecraft
---
Lvl 200 on Xbox,  playing sice a few months after  release. Griefing definitly has gone way way down, was really bad b4 survival tho. And nursing dmg reduction gear seemed to smoke out the majority of the rest. Now the community is alot nicer and for most part the biggest scumbag you run into is someone who demands u join a team so they can buy your wares at discount.
---
Huh, then what would you say the best one shot sort of weapon would be then? As in Blackpowder Rifle with Explosive, etc.
---
What platform you on?
---
I shall give it a go, thank you for your support!
---
So sick of people crying about stash space, back in my day we only had 400 space, just get rid of all that crap you clearly don't need and you'll have enough space...
---
the event timer is for everyone.  You expect the timer to stop each time another player fast travels in?
---
Sorry maybe I should have said human npcs
---
If people are still complaining about a caps sink they're not using player vendors enough lol
---
Very worth it. Lowers max hp by 12 for me with class freak 3 and I do a lot of damage with it, especially when combined with bloodied prefix weapons
---
Depends on the build I guess. I love the fridge just so I can save a few points in my build. But when I finally transition over to a rifle build with only 2 points in strength I will be going for the large carry weight backpack mod.
---
Go to West tek collect all the guns then use the scrapper perk to get loads of steel and plastic
---
Exactly! Even if BGS decided to increase stash limits up to 2000 lbs, people would still complain. Hoarders gonna hoard
---
No problem. I know there are a couple spawns at sons of Dane, tanagra town, and the antique shop as well.
---
Scrap weapons. While using the scrapper perk.
---
The thing is... and this is just my experience.... The majority of damage being put out isn't coming from the bloodied effect. It's the combination of nerd rage, adrenal reaction, adrenaline, ect.. 
---
I never hit 1000 damage with my bloodied pole hook till I put on radicool and a set of unyeilding armor.
---
Bloodied builds are crazy powerful, but it's because of all the other perks and mutations and legendary effects that are included.
---
I found one of them already! Side question: would you know where to get robot armor plans? Or the plasma grenade plan?
---
I don't have mine yet but high cap and fridge are both 8 and every other good one is 5 tokens. But I bought a high capacity off of a player vendor so going to buy Fridge when I do get my backpack. I've been spending a lot of time lately farming for food mats and this will help a lot
---
I run through the black water mine. There’s steel in there for the event and LOTS of mole miners with shotguns you can scrap.
---
Go to Wade airport and kill the super mutants there. Go around and pick up all the weapons and assorted junk. Claim the workshop and scrap everything. About half the time the immediate defend quest has something that will get you more scrap, so stick around for that. Then server hop and do it again.
---
Toss on the perk card and just walk around.
---
There are 3 spawns in the whitesprings golf club and a few more around whitesprings.
---
I love spawning in to a fully locked up house but inside the locked room is an unlocked extractor that they think no one will be able to access
---
How much extra carry weight is the high capacity?
---
That's not how it works buddy
---
Thanks for the heads up on the diffuser Kerr, we did it yesterday. Duo's we can keep them all alive. We were the only ones there on one, somehow the level 0 in B stayed alive and I solo'd the sheep in A. Of course, my friend received the diffuser and it was Formula P for me both times.
---
The way we did it, don't shutdown the experiment. The robots come in the end but attacked the crippled sheep. My friend was in C doing kelp and I was in A. The sheep happened to spawn in A. I know, he said no one will believe this.. I thought the wolf in A or the 0 in B would die for sure but we pulled it off =\]
---
Now if we can get one more diffuser
---
At the munitions factory i got this with turrets when I would put them in spots they used to fit in. They would also place, but then glitch into the ceiling 🙄
---
Probably anything with high alpha bloodied explosive with perk cards.
---
I was trying to  connect a wire but it would only let me jump instead. Placed down another generator and it was doing the same thing.
---
Plasma grenades is stopping me from finsishing chemist too, far as I can tell the plan is a rare drop for quest/jobs in the ash heap.
---
I wont ever understand why they went this route in 4. I really do miss it as it seems like such a normal thing for so many games that has gear.
---
You want someone to stalk you? Isn't this your post?
---
Grafton steel workshop and put the extractors down on the steel deposits
---
Yerp
---
Yes, I've noticed severe graphics issues. Now waiting for download to finish to see if it was fixed.
---
I'm only silent because... I'M AFRAID OF AMERICANS! I'M AFRAID OF THE WORLD! AND I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP IT!
---
I want ALL the plans so that's mostly what I buy except 3 star weapons for my weapons shop. I buy their plans, they come check out my two full vendors of 3 star max lvl weapons. I guess I do buy up alcohols and Nuka colas but just those three things really
---
Just FYI I’ve heard faster reload and speed demon do not stack. You could time your reload time to confirm/deny
---
I hate to wanna even imply but it just feels like they were lazy with it.
---
Flux. 100 caps per and it will sell all day long.
---
Food. Gimme that dogfood and all your corn soup.
---
Got cryo cells?
---
I don’t recall where I found them, unfortunately. As for the plasma grenade, I’ve heard it’s super rare. I’m not even sure if it’s actually in the game currently.
---
I run fridge,armor and high cap. I keep theses on me and use them when the need arises. Examples. Farming junk- hi cap , food/plant mats - fridge and when at events - armor. Two only add 30 but it depends on the situation. Can’t run hi-cap during SBQ without taking negative effects.
---
Similar to an idea I had. Asylum nurse's uniform, going around giving people Chems.
---
How about they give us a fast travel mat or give us some sort of indicator where fast travel users get spawned (apparently it's not even the same place as where you get placed)
---
Place your bottom layer, place a foundation staircase on top, snap a foundation to it and remove concrete steps.  Foundations can now be snapped to each other even if they are floating so setting them directly above other foundations is very achievable in a ton of different way. If you are on xbox I can show you my base.
---
Ah.. Yeah I'm on pc. Only really use 2 weapons which is 1 and 2 but being able to bind a key for switching would have been nice.
---
The three notes are around in each habitat, give you the code. There's a holotape too that explains the 8 bodies down there.
---
Guess you're the one who shit on him then, huh?
---
You could buy all of the PA mods plans.
---
Seriously, a guy had both punji boards and a confusing maze to the vending machines, only to sell non legendary armor and common clothing lol
---
Food and water*
---
Same here. Want to scrap it but I really love my bridge home near Morgantown... And it was a pain to build. 
---
Hopefully the bug gets fixed.
---
60, it's +120 total with level 50 backpack
---
I don’t think so, didn’t find anyone selling them. Didn’t find them myself too. I’m guessing no.
---
And they only weigh 1!
---
Serums recipes, PA plans ate up a lot of my caps.
---
I usually overprice easily obtainable cosmetic pieces that people want (spacesuit, black cowboy hat, clown suit, etc.), in the hopes that someone with caps who hasn't learned how easy they are to get stops by. I recently sold a cowboy hat for 250 caps.
---
Also PS4. the griefers I run to are always kids or obnoxious man children that think they're RPing as a raider, when they're just giving an Oscar-winning performance of XA55h0l3XR0ck3tX69X420X
---
People want npcs that arnt boring . Its what they mean when they say that.
---
iF THEY DIDNT WANT US TO GRIEF THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PVP ENABLED mom said it's my turn on the xbox
---
COs here in Cali can make 100k a year no overtime.  Some counties in Cali that’s double the average, some counties it’s way below the average pay.
---
lol layaway...
---
Yes please!! I think EVERYONE wants these..
---
Agree with all these comments...seems that fast travel vendor traps is the new thing for the sociopathic "Raider" trolls.  Really wish I could destroy their friggen work.
---
When I'm struggling with steel, especially for ammo making, I equip the scrapper perk in Intelligence, run Westek and loot all of their weapons. They have a lot of assault rifles, scrap for 30 steel each. They also drop a lot of laser rifles which gives you a bunch of plastic. 
---
One Run through Westek usually gives me about 800 steel. They have a tinkers bench in the vat room so I just craft my ammo there.
---
Go to dolly sods and do stings and tings. It should let you talk to the scout in the pioneer camp after that. I had the same thing happen on my alt.
---
I buy inventory for my camp. I love selling and interacting with people. So when i get around 20k i start to vendor hop looking for inventory. Ill usually find something thats cool and ill have to sell to build my caps back up.
---
It’s still really hard to not grab everything in site. Then you sort it out later. I’ve got a hoarding problem.
---
Sometimes people really don’t get lucky. I haven’t found a single “good” legendary with myself being level 70, so I’m constantly having to switch weapons and add attachments to them.
---
Atom shop.
---
Ash heap events.
---
When you pick up their weapons, do you not run out of carry weight?
---
I could but I'm pretty happy with my Medic and would never use Jetpack or Stealth, got my Calibrated Shocks and would never use the other leg mods etc.  So its back to "... spending caps to buy things you don't really need or want".
---
Now if Bethesda allows us to sell full sets of PA, that would be pretty cool and I could see collecting many PA plans.  But that business would eventually dry up/slow down as the majority of folks will eventually have their primary go-to PA (+ Excavator of course).
---
Repaired it should put out 400.
---
What we really need, is a 50lb storage container, seperate from the standard one, that is shared across all characters. I have tried multiple times to makes new chars, but I want all the goodies my main has/can make for me, otherwise I just get bored.
---
Was it a limited time item? Because its not in the atom shop for me.
---
Of course the atom shop -_-
---
Yes, but they have a ton of benches in the Westek so it's easy to scrap them on site.
---
And the irony is, if Bethesda was trying to nanny us into making proper pretty buildings, then they failed miserably cuz I've seen some of the ugliest shit ever in this game built by people that worked within these needlessly restrictive rules.
---
PC.  Don't really need a TSE though, I was using that as an example
---
It's been over 20 years in the game since the the nukes went off...we all leave the vault to a world we don't recognize. I think you would do anything you could to feel normal. That aside. This comment doesn't make sense considering all of the other weird random stuff we have. Like... I can have a bush cut into the shape of a deathclaw, balloons, Christmas lights, and a a mannequin blowing through a damn horn, but God forbit I want a bit of paneling lol
---
1* for less than 75
---
radaway and stimpaks for 20
---
stuff like that
---
The opportunities might be endless if we could actually *do something* about reviving society. As it is we're all a bunch of lone wolves as likely to share a sandwich as shoot a man (practically, obviously everybody has their own playstyle).
---
Damn, was going to give you one for free, I have like 5
---
Yes that too
---
can confirm this is very common and always try this first if you get that message.
---
Might wanna reply to the OP, idk if he gets notified of replies to other people’s comments
---
Imagine the repair costs on a higher tier of armor!
---
Whenever somebody say "No NPCs" about Fallout 76, I assume they're either xenophobic, haven't played the game beyond Vault 76 character creation, or are just looking for something to whine about.
---
and also if you want a frog jar for 10 caps
---
Yeah, caps are pretty arbitrary to begin with. The reason they added the 10% tax to player vendors was to provide more value to caps. Taxes and fast travel are the primary uses for in game caps. So the alternative would be to Max em out lol
---
For the "replacing the camp" part, just do it on another char (unless it's a quest not a challenge).
---
For sure, haven't done it in a while but that makes sense. Thanks
---
Ya but it’s common curtesy to kill some mole rats attacking a base
---
Did you just miss the joke or are you offended by a sarcasm
---
I admit that i don't know much about how a game studio works but if it is anything like an average company than they probably have separate people work on separate things and while you can swap a few people from the "new content" to help the "bug fixing department" than it is probably everything they can do.  
---
They can hire more people, but then you have to get in the project first etc. etc.
---
I believe that the people at Bethesda look at some really hard months working their asses off and i woudn't assume that they sit idle at the moment so probably they will do what they can.
---
IMHO Patience is key here but then again i can say it lightly as a filthy casual so i understand the frustration if one plays the game every day for hours.  :-)
---
I made it my mission a long time ago to buy all available plans. Since then I’ve opened a shop months ago and sell a ton of inventory daily. I’ve learned to make a ton by spending very little and use almost every bit of it on new plans. Just one character, no mules, always buying plans and selling things at my shop. Needless to say, I still don’t have them all. Not even close when you count all the expensive PA mods available now. So there’s always something to spend caps on, even though you might not ever use those things.
---
The only time I think I've ever wished I used iPhone, Aaaagh... Android is gonna be rad whenever it is done though, consider me hella interested.
---
Yeah I lost 8k caps yesterday because of the limit... if I reach max I start buying crap and taking my best stuff out of my vending machines
---
I've never played a game with so many simple glitches it's astonishing we put up with it for so long.
---
Whenever I try to attach a wire and my character jumps instead I think... "Oh you want me to jump you SOB??!!"  *Jumps out window IRL
---
Been wanting a lock for s long time now.
---
Yeah definitely grafton steel. Go to the workshop and just kill any super mutants in that area and take their loot. You can scrap their weapons for tons of steel
---
I always thought FO4's build mechanics were needlessly restrictive and even sent feedback a few times on simple ways to help it out (like a native snap toggle a la place-in-red). Waiting for 76 I was sure it would improve on things but all around the C.A.M.P. system is a terrible step backwards in many regards. I understand some restrictions are needed in an MMO setting but most of it is without apparent reason.
---
?
---
If you’ve used a spear, most of them would likely snap or bounce off if you actually swiped at a human. Meeting the resistance of a person, let alone any armor they may be wearing. You can really only stab considering the way the blade is shaped and positioned. Otherwise you would have to make sure that literally ONLY the tip would swipe them, which is near impossible
---
Chem weights are what get me. Always have 3 in travel pharmacy. Food sells good in the vendor, usually sell that off everyday. The high cap backpack is nice with barbarian and/or junk shield with blocker. I guess you could use iron clad but I don't have the end to use it. Trick is having some points in str and that will let you offset points in others.
---
Anyone who uses punji boards in the first place is just a dick. They don't do any appreciable damage, they're just annoying.
---
I disagree to an extent. It's all about HOW you use the NPCs. By introducing them you can successfully create an even more sense of danger and isolation in the wasteland. When you play FO3, FO;NV and FO4 you are met with pockets of civilization. It's small communities that are huddled together in fear of the world outside the gates. When visiting these hubs you feel a sense of safety and community. Once you step outside of town you're quickly reminded as to why they rely on you to venture out on their behalf. Hell, it's so brutal that in previous FO games it would kill NPCs. I think Human NPCs must be introduced in order to breathe life into this game. There needs to be some sort of purpose for players to even log on besides grinding. Don't scatter NPCs all over the wasteland but create hubs and small pockets of civilization that can allow quests and side tasks to be given. Maybe separate each hub by faction that unlock goods depending on your current stance with them.
---
Like I mention before. It's all about how you use NPCs that can either make or break the game.
---
I clearly offered a solution, and titled that paragraph The solution:
---
Nope
---
I don't bottle them up.  I just scrap them for bone, which I almost always end up dropping anyway.
---
Yeah
---
My camp has a front entrance but the sides amd the back are protected by punji boards because it often gets attacked.
---
A timer for vendor resets would be nice I currently set a timer on my phone for 20hrs .... take an upvote
---
I agree.
---
Also, allow us to set waypoints/paths, etc.
---
detailed apples and blocky oranges
---
Why are you complaining, the Atom store is so beautiful, why even bother logging into the actual game. The princess bed is on offer still. How can you not get all hot and bothered over that?
---
I have all three "play music at X PLACE" ones bugged, but I was able to do all the others. Which ones are bugged for you? I'm on PS4
---
Instead of a maxed out slugger card, use a 2* slugger and a 1* expert slugger. They take the same perk points (3) but gives you an extra 5% damage increase.
---
So they should allow the subset of players who want to PVP to ruin the game for players that don't IN the PVE mode? How is it our fault that the PVP mode sucks? Why would I keep playing if the game is prioritizing PVP over PVE in a primarily PVE game?
---
PS4
---
But what if I max out all slugger cards ?
---
I dont know nothing about 3day weekend... here is normal 2 day....
---
Hah, buying more stuff to refresh your inventory like the reality show "American Pickers".  
---
You have a good point, my serums sell pretty good and also some plans.  I "scrip" the low-value 1-Star weapons &amp; armor and put the others in my vending machine.  I'm doing okay keeping my weapons in stock but the good armor is more problematic.
---
Harold's always down for some Atomic Wrangling.
---
*Assume the position.*
---
Mr Fuzzy
---
Another thing to add is to please make your shit accessible. I went to a user shop for ammo, only to find the only accessible door locked. Good news is, I got the ammo I needed. Bad news, someone is gonna kill me for 10 caps eventually.
---
I used to run this slightly suicidal unstable isotope/adrenal build bloodied that was hilariouslly fun but meant a lot of incoming dmg and combine that with first aid and the rads your ap and hp regen was super quick if you use cola-freak and Nuka's it was easy to maintain
---
All 6 of the “play instruments” (at locations and otherwise) don’t register for me.
---
what if my friends are on fallout 76 lol
---
Yeah I've been on a quest myself to aquire all Serum Recipes. It's a easy way to make caps and keep my caps below 10K
---
hunter's long coat
---
Then you’d have people using them as extra storage and setting g their prices to something ridiculous like 99999 caps.
---
Run at them. They switch to melee when you close to gap.
---
I've just been buying PA mod plans.  Thankfully they added the x01 ones recently so that was another what, 60k+ worth of plans to buy.  Even if I never use any of them, I'd like to be able to build anything and everything. I hear you on never wanting them though.   If only they'd added a cap based legendary affix reroll like other games have. That would have been great. increasing cost per individual item to reroll a property.
---
The most frustrating was getting getting that message for a wall pass through conductor. It’s SUPPOSE to intersect with an existing object!
---
One caveat about leveling and budget - its weird.. So you dont actually get MORE budget, the items you build take up LESS of your budget as you level. This sounds like it would effectively be the same thing right? But it's not quite, as you actually need to tear down and rebuild to see that increase and that means deleting stores items too. So if you haven't rebuilt your camp in 50 or so levels, you will need to move your camp, scrap your blueprinted structures, scrap the components for those blueprinted structures and slap on Contractor and get building to see your increase. I do this with everything except my rad shower as I do not want to burn those materials again on each rebuild. 
---
I now have the capacity to build pretty sprawling CAMPS with tons of clutter and a healthy amount of lighting (albeit no turrets) at level 250+.
---
Whaaat! Game changer. Does this also work on the ones using gauntlets?
---
Where's that Place anywere mod then you need it???
---
Scuba goggles, Manta Man needs scuba goggles.
---
xD Get a dense mod on your chest.
---
the building is kinda whack right now
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Are the white powder and Whitesprings jumpsuits any good?
---
You can give one to me, for caps ofc. Im looking for TSE shootgun since i start playing in january 🤣
---
Same on Xbox
---
Added you.
---
Negative
---
Well Bethesda has this problem with the fallout 76 community at the mo, mainly because of all the people leaving.
---
Ya see when people get these bugs it’s annoying yes. But many don’t actually leave and as a matter of fact I don’t often experience these bugs as long as I’m using the right internet. But all the level 200s out there asking for endgame content and not being able too bully lower levels anymore. Are leaving because they don’t have enough “endgame content” for their insta kill 3 star legendaries (which Ik have recently been nerfed) but Bethesda is trying too stop their player base from leaving because they all grinding too fast and wasting too much of their god damn time on the game. So this one I don’t really see as a problem Bethesda has much control over, at least until they get more workers or the player base decides too take a massive chill pill and slow down. Find their own things too do at level 194 and not ask Bethesda too waste a bajilion god damn hours making more stuff too do.
---
I’m Xbox though
---
I've seen people offering 10k for those
---
Ok thank you
---
Yes they are least 7k for them
---
I found a bunch at fort defiance.
---
still not able to attach it :(
---
I agree. One marker isn’t enough.
---
East coast riot gear
---
I want a missile launcher instead wath over oil at ammo factory. no you cannot!
---
Radicool for +5 str under endurance. Honestly I haven't had any issues with carry weight early game with melee build. Only when I switched to heavy guns and started collecting heavy guns and ammo did I run out of space. But the radicool adds a hefty dmg buff to melee. Downside: you're at 50% rads. But you're really a one hot wonder. 
---
Alternatively, I used born survivor at rank 1 to proc a stimmy when my health dropped so I didn't have to discontinue dps, especially with queen fights.
---
That name!
---
I said "lmao" because it is so ridiculous to see this that I find it funny. I also think that the best punishment for these players (if a permanent ban isn't an option) is to have all their progress wiped and have the start from the bottom
---
Ok thanks!
---
You're welcome! Happy to help!
---
I made it up, but I promise you I've seen similar. ^w^
---
That's it. I tried selecting on agility first and it gave me a point. Thank you for solving my confusion!
---
And a side note, heafty games like this one need a lot of work, as it needs too constantly run on many servers. Even with massive amounts of workers trying too fix these things it will take a while too get where they heading. And they also don’t have as much motivation with the community blasting them. Just don’t see this as a complaint, I even upvoted ur post, this is just stuff I’ve learnt and what I think of it. Not saying anyone in particular is at fault here.
---
Western outfit and western outfit and chaps, leather coat and leather traveling coat. Hunters long coat and longshoremen
---
That also works with super mutants.
---
Adrenaline in agility pumps damage too. A quick hit weapon for mobs control like a Mr handy buzzy will reduce ghouls and majority of random mobs spawn. This allows you to hit fast, especially with flying creatures that like to evade super sledges
---
What kind of weapons do you prefer? And what platform do you play on?
---
just spend a point later on and get the card again with just 1 point. i have many cards like that.
---
Big clunking power armor sucks donkey balls, I hate it, a jet pack for standard armor would be awesome.
---
LOL yes!
---
Agreed
---
Sure it would be great, but it would be also great for legendary PA Pieces but that isn’t going to happen.
---
Essentially, what would you pay for?  Lots of people buy quest rewards such as plans and apparel for quite a bit, presumably to skip having to do the quest itself.  Necessary components and aid items for quests and challenges are also popular.  I've been selling all my spare Pemmican like a mofo because I remember that I would have paid to save some time when I was completing the Backpacker Possum badge.  Also various alcohols that don't spawn naturally like Rad Ant Lager that are randomly required to complete Biv's dailies.
---
Aside from those, just rare stuff.  You can pick up a lot of small sales by completing all your dailies and repeatables when they're available and sell off all the extras, but the big ticket sales are in rare legendaries with optimal effects(Bloodied, TSE, AAE, Sentinel's, Cavalier's, Weight Reduction).  Occassionally, rare junk spawns can also be sold for a lot, so keep an eye out for junk items that you haven't seen before.  I saw a Deathclaw Hide on sale for thousands of caps and I sold a Trumpet for 100 caps for some reason(I think some people save uncommon junk in their stash in case Bethesda adds displays).
---
Ahhh too bad, im on pc. But thanks anyway 😉
---
That would be perfect, but the entitled player base will whaaaa so it doesn't happen.
---
By now I twice said I think PvP should be removed from adventure, what else you would want me to say
---
Are you offering or asking? I have 3 in my vending. Only recipe that consistently sells.
---
*Sorry about repetition, but many are still there and even worse. All encountered on PC on various machines.*
---
**Graphics**: Frame skipping in interiors got worse and is pretty annoying on my decent machine (i7 8700, GTX 1060, latest drivers). Not sure if it is due to motion blur bug, temporal aliasing, VSync anomaly or what. [Video](https://youtu.be/7NmVueCtba0). *(Ticket submitted 05/22)*
---
**Graphics:** semi distant objects "bleed" their lighting effects on a decent machine with High settings; it looks something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/payaSim), but on objects 75+ meters away.
---
**Performance:** Camps with player wending and possibly lots of light sources tanks my framerate on a decent machine (i7 8700, GTX 1060, 32 GB RAM).
---
**Performance:** *(not new)*, The top floor of the Watoga EMS building tanks the framerate if I look towards the blocked-off section from the top of the stairs on a minimum-spec machine. Looking at the floor or into the opposite direction, the framerate returns to an acceptable 15-20 on this machine. Could be related to lack of optimization or too many light sources.
---
**Performance:** still 2-5 seconds of freezes when the game tries to play some audio not recently played. The total CPU utilization goes to 100% (all cores) and there is some SSD activity, but I doubt finding and decompressing a 1 second audio effect would take that long. Happens a lot when other players with various equipment are around as the game has to load random audio all the time. This happens on my medium machine (i7 4770K, GTX 1060, 16GB RAM). In addition, the game's working set is 22 GB according to process monitoring tools so any memory-mapped IO could suffer in general due to excessive paging. Also the 100% CPU usage during the hiccup indicates many thread end up wating on a spin lock.
---
**Performance:** *(not new, perhaps worse)* the camp loads in pretty slowly most of the time after logging in 10-60 second passes. Other players happily walk up and down on my screen indicating the server is responsive.
---
**Performance:** *(not new)* doing the nuke silo with someone else not in a team slows down the registering of subtasks: repairing the pipes registers slow or too late or replacing the damaged cores does nothing for minutes. The other players happily walk around on my screen indicating the server is relaying their actions.
---
**Crafting**: crafting some level 1 Leather Armor now results in a 1 DR + 2 ER armor, it used to be 2 DR + 2 ER after Patch 9. Not sure if it is a rounding error of an overall -1 DR because of the fix to the headwear DR bug. Also I have max level Leather armor which is now listed as 21 DR and I remember seeing it as 22 DR but I'm not 100% sure.
---
**Crafting**: crafting a certain item and scrapping it will result in 1 free steel (using the Scrapper perk); that is, you get back all the resources you put in and get 1 extra steel out. If one uses Super Duper on top of this, crafting 100 items will result in 130 free steel in under 1-2 minutes on PC. In other terms, you don't need to clear out West Tek for the weapons of the muties but just stay home, craft and scrap indefinitely. *(Ticket submitted months ago)*
---
**Consuming**: consuming food or drink hangs the client and the process needs to be killed. Not sure if related, but happens in PA or on foot with the slick Pip-boy overlay. *(Ticket submitted months ago)*
---
**Curve tables**: the lvl 100 Sheepsquatch is missing curve table entries for its DR/ER/RR. The files have data up to lvl 80. Haven't looked at the other new enemies.
---
**Weapons:** after logging in and being able to move, the current weapon has to be reloaded twice as the first reload leaves its magazine empty. Doesn't seem to be an issue if I fast travel first.
---
**Selling**: selling legendary items to a regular vendor plays the slot machine audio cue; not sure if this is intended but it annoys me.
---
**Challenges: Roboticist** plans for robot armor plans seem to be pretty rare in world and none of the vendors sell it.
---
**Challenges: Collector**. Buying magazines don't count towards the challenge.
---
**Challenges: Grognak the Barbarian**. The summary lists 8/10 but the detailed list show 9 out of 10 magazines. [Video](https://youtu.be/ovMfkgY5v_w)
---
**Graphics**: can't make a screenshot with Print-Screen while looking at the map/challenges list. The UI hangs and if I press ESC, the screenshot is made on the normal 3D view. That's why I had to make a video for the Grognak bug above.
---
**Quests: Tipsy-tasty** from Biv gives out duplicate plans. I still don't have the Nuka Dark plan for example and been doing this for several weeks now.
---
**Challenges: Chemist** \- craft plasma grenades. I haven't encountered the plans in over 1000 hours on two characters. They supposedly drop from Ash-heap events but appear to be script-awarded, or perhaps they are not in the game at all.
---
**Challenges: Chemist** \- shoot some animals with the syringer doesn't register.
---
**Challenges: Chemist** \- craft any serum: my design concern: plans are really expensive.
---
**Cosmetic:** "Take a picture of **a Grahm** in a Workshop".
---
**Inventory**: phantom duplicate items show up in the inventory again. These items have no images and can't be dropped. Relog clears them.
---
**Inventory:** I picked up some legendary armor in WS and when I later scrapped my drops, that armor was missing from my inventory. I though I must have not actually picked it up. Fast traveled to West Tek and in the control room, I decided to drop some junk from the junk tab. The paper bag suddenly contained that specific armor from before.
---
**Legendary scrapping:** Probably related to the duplicate inventory, the Scrip machine did not list a legendary item I had in my inventory/in hand equipped that had also a phantom duplicate. Relog fixed this as well.
---
**QoL**: Add separate category for Tadpole/possum challenges.
---
**QoL**: Indicate somehow that a never before seen magazine has been picked up without the need to track all those magazine challenges.
---
**QoL**: the tadpole/possum subchallenges are quite varying and it is somewhat inconvenient to check them over and over which are missing. I understand that listing them all, even one, on the challenges tracker will likely run out of space pretty quickly.
---
**Legendary Enemies:** high chance I just saw it wrong, but fought a 2\* non-diseased Yao Guai in front of the Blackwater Mine entrance and looted a 3\* item off it before the body despawned in 5 seconds.
---
**Enemies not having legendary loot**, nor syringe/drill. I fought a legendary 3\* Glowing One near the Willard Corporate Housing while the region was nuked and it did not drop any legendary loot or the syringe/drill. I fought a starless Legendary lvl 16 Super Mutant at the Grafton Steel (normal) and it did not have legendary loot/syringe/drill. In both cases, the enemies were already turned into legendaries before my first shot.
---
**Collision**: a staircase in Whitespring at the houses has no proper collision and enemies dying there fall below, under the inaccessible part of the porch.
---
**QoL**: ability to craft Acid in some way, for example, when turning spoiled food into fertilizer. Ore and Black powder requires a lot of Acid to craft and is the biggest limit on crafting ammo for me atm.
---
**QoL**: notification about when shops reset, including the Scrip machines. (If we can have verdant season notification and the SBQ/Encryptid announced, this shouldn't be that hard.)
---
**UI**: the Junk/Component view doesn't show Wood. The last line is Ultracite and you have to use the cursor down on the keyboard to go the invisible Wood line.
---
**Overencumbered:** If I'm slightly overencumbered due to extra mines/grenades, throwing them so that the total weight goes below the limit allows me to sprint again but the game won't let me fast travel quoting being overencumbered. Fixes itself after a minute or two.
---
**Server desync**: shooting at enemies while stealthed sooner or later will make their health bar recover the stealth damage boost while the client still keeps says Caution.
---
**Design of challenges**: revive an ally, revive in water are difficult to achieve without some form of ingame communication. Also the Stim Diffuser is the highest level reward in a pretty difficult and hit-or-miss event impossible to solo.
---
**Design of new content:** often, as a long time player, I don't know how I'd discover new content without reading through reddit PSAs. Also many challenges (such as the pioneer scouts') involve collecting/doing things one has done organically weeks or months before. Maybe they are organically discovered and achieved by a fresh character but a memory stretch for long time players I'd think.
---
**QoL**: ability to tag ammo for search.
---
**Odd audio:** *(not new)* sometimes when I walk around, I hear something like a "big" rocket launch in the distance but there is no Nuke being launched.
---
**Silo state announced in the wrong silo.** *(not new)* When another silo is recovering from a launch, the current, ready silo will announce that there is still X time for the silo to be ready.
---
**Graphics:** lighting bugs on terrain is [still happening](https://imgur.com/a/k8rfaG8).
---
**Events**: occasionally, notification about entering or leaving an event on the other side of the map is still shown (I guess only when leaving an interior).
---
**QoL**: finding Treasure location over and over is somewhat inconvenient, especially in high grassy locations or non-distinct terrain. It would be great that after the first time, subsequent maps of the same location could be "used" and would place an in-game location marker on the mound.
---
Oh I think I get the concept. I’ll have to give it it a shot later. Thanks for the information. I’ll have to edit my post.
---
It's worth it. I mean what else you going to do with those caps? Used to be you could only get them off the queen. Wish I could get pychotats recipe. Missing dense combat and marine chest mods too, they were available in Watoga early on.
---
Maybe consider adrenal reaction, lower your health the more damage. If you're rocking a sneak build you can use Unyielding +1 str builds for another +20 str.
---
I’ve not payed in a few weeks is this going to be a thing?
---
Those builde are basically glass canons that die really easy.
---
Excuse me that's my bad I misread and got mixed up with another comment.
---
Oh yeah that might also be a good idea! Thanks!
---
Playing players caps is not a cap sink. If they put stuff in there that was worth buying. Why pay 1k to a player for a 1* mele weapon lol. I would rather pay the train station for plans or the enclave for serum recipes.
---
I still not found camera so...
---
There is just so much more to do now with burrows, backpacks, pioneer scouts, etc. that nukes have become obsolete
---
Happens and no problem. There three main valid needs and they all deserve to be satisfied. Coop, gang pvp, and lone wanderer pvp. Lets unite our voices to get what we really need.
---
sorry i was done for the night, ign is ottaviana
---
they nerfed the frequent legendary spawns at WS so that could be  one of the reasons..whenever I think of blast zones the only thing I care about is SBQ
---
Consoles also use Bethesda.net accounts but  the PSN/Xbox Live account is used for the display name.
---
I've owned and sold most of the rare outfits..the hunters longcoat always seems to flyyyyy
---
got lucky found him [https://i.imgur.com/yjHkQrU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yjHkQrU.jpg)
---
Okay.
---
Do the "breach and clear" event. It spawns in the asheap region and provides plenty of material.
---
What do you play on? I have a max level tse shotgun if you want one, a combat and a pump
---
Haha true that
---
Problems with the fast travel mat:
---
* CAMPS are not static in the game, so when you fast travel to a camp it still has to load all the assets.  You will still fall from wherever the mat is, which means you'll still likely fall down and end up in their foundation...or worse.  
---
* As mentioned above with the "or worse", fast travel mats could be used to troll people.  Find a high location and place your travel mat on a floor that is over a cliff, and people will fast travel to you and simply fall to their death if they don't have protection from falling damage.  You could also set it so people spawn in a death room.
---
The best solution, then, is probably to have players spawn somewhere on the outer perimeter of the CAMP on solid ground (basically anywhere just outside the build area.  This prevents people from being stuck inside a CAMP or in the foundation, as well as preventing people from building deathtraps.  There are still some risks with some of the locations, but overall I think it's safer. 
---
At first I thought a good option would be to suggest the mat HAS to be placed on regular dirt, but that doesn't prevent the death trap rooms.
---
In terms of what we don’t already have in the game, I’d like to see the Cage Armor variants and the Raider Armor from Nuka World make a return.
---
Add forest camo jumpsuit..I have that and the whitespring..I just added the responder fireman outfit to my collection..I don't really like the helmet tho
---
I find myself putting my rarest weapons on my favorites wheel out of fear of accidentally dropping them even when I’m out of there ammo. Totally behind this idea. 
---
I would love to be able to lock items to a safe storage. Maybe they could facilitate the feature through the stash box so they have less menu and UI to figure it in implementing it.
---
I dont mind the plans for my ALT but I wont touch it when they sell at face value. While the face value is less than robot vendors if you want to move them chop the price a bit. Maybe 25% price cut from face value, everyone knows what is in the shop is a duplicate for the owner.
---
Awesome, thanks SO MUCH!!
---
That's too bad, because that's pretty clever...
---
Are you joking? He's joking right ? Please tell me he's joking its everywhere.
---
The actual building I built a while ago but the insides are all pretty newish. I might try scrapping some of the building and start it again. Thanks
---
But they do stab.  They stab AND swipe, as long as you're not in Power Armor.  If you're in PA they only swing.
---
All plans in my before at 1c. I'm sure people buy them and relist but I don't care. All my unused ammo is 0c as well. I think of it as a glorified brown paper bag.
---
Addiction is not a joke. Get some help.
---
If I had a head laser I would use it all the time and nobody can tell me different. Dodgy dodgy and sidestepping is prescribed.
---
Other things have better rewards for much less effort and messing around with codes that despawn over time methinks.
---
Damn that stinks. I was able to use the ones at my camp for the general playing
---
That's still a thing? Might have to sit down and play through her whole questline, then it sticks. I remember making explosive bait 2 times.
---

---
The weird aspect to our community is so great.
---
YES PLEASE 10/10 WOULD SHOWER YOU WITH LOVE
---
Live the dream raider brother and or sister
---
The best finds I've had in player vending has been from cliff camps. It's like some of them want to reward you for making it.
---
Having seen one in two weeks
---
Same here.
---
Workshops work a bit different.  
---
You have to claim a workshop and then build the location.  This means that from that point on, you have "cached" the load of the workshop.  So the fast travel mats location is ok at that point since it already knows where you need to spawn since it's already in memory. 
---
It doesn't work this way with CAMPs, even your own, as the first time you are traveling to it is when it has to render and load the CAMP.  
---
They probably could change the game load process to load all assets of a CAMP before placing the character, but that type of code change is more than something that can be pushed out in a short time. 
---
It also doesn't help the "death rooms" some people build.
---
Fuck the camera challenges.   Too many require teammates, luck,  and stupid outfits.
---
No u
---
If you're on PS4 come check out Floopwoods! It's a small town right outside of Flatwoods. We have our local bar "the soda saloon", a Slocum's Joe franchise, and even a smithy shop full of 3 star legendary max level weapons guaranteed to be worth all the thousands of caps they're posted at lol
---
Indeed
---
You can just server hope at Arkos for a 3 star legendary. Makes nuking the SBQ pointless unless you need prime plans or violet flux.
---
Remember when we all just couldn't wait for the player vendors lmao. Now you only see maybe 5 at most on a server and all they sell is junk. The novelty has definitely worn off
---
I play alone of PC, too! Occasionally I pick up a random to play with, but my husband and brother in law both got bored of it and moved on. So I play this game that I only got to play with my husband and make him happy, alone. But everyone is so excellent that I love it!
---
Geese I'd never heard or seen of her before, but it does sound very similar and your point makes sense. It's a shame, I thought the gurgling sounds were kinda cool but now idk
---
No.  I got great deals, some would even say they are a steal, but you got to get to them first.
---
It can get somewhat convoluted due to there being light/sturdy/heavy in a few of the armors as well as differebt levels, but I'm pretty sure the top three for somewhat even DR/ER is Heavy BoS Combat, Polymer Scout Armor, and Buttressed Marine Armor. Some of the other armors have much higher DR and much lower ER and vice versa.
---
I may be a little off on this though, someone who knows more will be able to tell you more and explain better.
---
This actually makes alot of sense. Players should spawn outside the build area but at the entrance of a door and the owner of the camp can spawn where the fast travel mat is at.
---
I keep on hearing about death traps and that does scare me at times.
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
Server stability? This is Bethesda’s attempt to pass the blame for their poor gaming engine and poor coding. At the beginning yes duping was causing server instability but now 2 people buying from the vendor has no effect on servers. People will always exploit to make it easier to acquire the best things, in real life and in a gaming. Its on the company for putting out a piss poor game (in the sense of have a ton of problems)
---
This is the answer, west tek is one of the best farming spots for a lot of things.
---
Xbox sorry.
---
I have a punji board in my generator shed/Mothman shrine, partly to stop people from messing with my terminal but mostly decorative, but it's nowhere near the vending machine.
---
I hate those boards makes me wish we could damage camps again (or at least just them). I don't use them in my camp Laser turrets work well enough and I can fix any damage they can't handle.
---
It's a bit strange that those aren't available because some of the dead raiders seem to wear them.
---
Notes would be nice too.  It looks like a paper map, I should be able to write "farm aluminum here", "PA spawn" etc.
---
Yeah I’m still pretty low level and can’t make one yet.
---
Can someone explain how to actually shut them down? I’ve put in the code on the keypad and explored the area inside, but couldn’t find a terminal to override them. Seen a video on it a few days ago but can’t find that video now.
---
It is the sole survivor.  It is only missing the guy I think is bugged.  If you look at when I shoot other players than him I hit and my meter fills.
---
Definitely giving off that SS officer vibe who's about to dish out some punishment.
---
Yeah it said it produces 400 on the power box next to it. Spent 45 minutes repairing and turning on the power plant. Tried to activate the power box and nothing.
---
this is a thing?! i'm currently running with the flaming chainsaw...you're saying i can slap a bayonet on the thing, too?!
---
This needs to be fixed if that is what this guy did because it was really frustrating.
---
I collect outfits so people here have covered all the good ones...although I still find it strange that people want hunter and longshoremAn as those are available from the bot and used to be duped to hell...
---
Is there any way to kill someone who is taking advantage of it?
---
Maybe the vendor is there to lure you onto their Punji boards?
---
What a charming individual
---
Yeah you were getting hit sounds as well
---
sooooo.....either they bring back the "OP damage", or......or they increase the level cap, add legendary varients, make it a drop, and make it covered by perks?  
---
i can see no downside. MAKE IT SO!!
---
I don't think it's self centered at all to point out a game that's playable for the majority of people isn't unplayable. I mentioned Skyrim for switch, plenty of people play in handheld mode with no FOV sliders and no issues. Not having compatibility for someone with a disability doesn't make a game unplayable any more than a car requiring good vision and reflexes undrivable.
---
Go to grafton station and buy the BoS combat Armor plans and resell those. They sell for under 100 caps each for arms, legs, and chest. You can easily and quickly sell them in your vending machines for 500+c each. I sell arms and legs for 500c and chest for 750c. Yesterday they sold before my camp even loaded in completely.
---
U can fix some aid problems with the travelling pharmacy, level 3 will give u 90% reduced weight for all Chems including stimpacks and rad aways. Strength perk.
---
From my experience no, not til it wears off
---
throwing support behind "please fix the chainsaw"! please, Bethesda! let me run around Appalachia as the gleeful psycho i was born to be!
---
Does the HUD plan specifically say it’s for that suit? If it doesn’t say the suit it’s for then it’s for the excavator armor. But maybe I don’t actually know the plan either and that’s why I can’t make it. Very weird that it’d show up for crafting though.
---
Thank you, currently I have all marine armor 3* and i want the max protection so i was looking to upgrade/tradeout pieces to get there.  I also dont care about the unyeilding stuff but I know people are looking for it which i have.  As a sneak high health build I'm better with chameleon vanguards stuff i believe.
---
Yes, the group united and set off to find a new place of residence as “us army deserters”, but when they actually came to call themselves the “brotherhood of steel” and got their ideology was unknown to us, because you don’t just transition into that overnight. And the tapes form maxson actually address this with everyone kind of looking at him likes he was crazy but ultimately going with it because like he says “people need something to believe in”. So yes while we know how the group was formed, we didn’t know when the actual faction came to be until 76
---
I saw blood too, but my experience with two shots in VATS is similar, which is why I asked. If it's a single shot weapon, 95% is 95%. He should have been taking SOME damage even if a healthy chunk was being mitigated somehow.
---
Can't be serendipity because his health is too high. Could be dodgy I suppose if he's in a full powered set of armor.
---
Between 20 and 40 scrip.
---
There is always someone looking for specific stuff. If you are lucky you may find them.
---
That's awesome, I've yet to encounter this bot. Where does it spawn?
---
I have the same problem; just hoarding tons of high value items...I just go around buying any plan I don’t know even if it’s a pipe revolver long NV scope..and of course more stuff to sell in my machines :)
---
If we ever get an appreciable budget increase i'll definitely be putting them back ASAP.
---
Sounds like a circlejerk
---
Will try
---
Unfortunately I’m not.
---
I prefer raspberry tbh
---
Knife on a toilet wouldnt be something else. But with a quarterstaff with a tip would be.
---
There is only 1 locked room in my camp and it’s impossible to spawn in (second floor).
---
I buy Flux for cheap from vending machines and make a ton of serums, then sell for 450 each. People buy these so often!
---
Yup.  They fixed that it's not applied to everyone, which helps server stability.  Local app stability is still an issue, according to folks I play with this.  (It is for me too, but not with berry mentats/targeting.)
---
Lol unfortunately for him he was lvl 5...
---
Because you can’t sell to her.
---
I'm in favor of them never bringing back the glitched out over repaired damage. The drop off was too severe and too rapid, even if you perked to counteract it.
---
You'll still see the health falsely moving a lot of the time before going back up. When this glitch is being used it doesn't seem to move their health.
---
Wow, that actually looks really nice...
---
Yeah I got that too. It's out of control I tell ya
---
Link?
---
Offering.
---
Harold? The ghoul turned tree? He wants my nudes?
---
Yes! This! My friends and I were really excited when the game was announced because we hoped we'd be able to team up, build a settlement together, and each of us could take on different roles in the game to maintain our little settlement. As it is, CAMPs can't be built close enough together to make it feel like a little town, and being able to build in your team mate's CAMP needs some work (ie: being able to edit an item in a team mate's CAMP).   
---
I also really want some "rebuild" quests/events, similar to the Powering Up events, but that include cleaning up debris, repairing walls/roofs, and some decorating. We could start in Flatwoods and slowly add the other towns in to "rebuild Appalachia". Heck, they could make a whole expansion out of it where we slowly rebuild everything into more livable locations. Could even make it so the town stays all nice and pretty but if someone decides to nuke it, you have to rebuild it all over again.  
---
The game definitely has so much potential with huge story line opportunities. I hope to see Bethesda take advantage of this.
---
Rip, not much else I can tell ya. Actually with the backpack and all deep pocketed armor along with 11/12is strength I have 325 carry weight without even wearing excavator. But I also carry a crap ton and just use tons of perks too help me out.
---
Eh, i've never killed any other player, and I usually run on pacifist mode.....but I felt like making an exception for him.
---
Where are you finding all these frogs?
---
Did you by chance figure out the invisible barrier... had it on 6 servers so far, cant get my key either....
---
Don't you dare compare that trash AC to the witcher
---
Is this roughly what you are looking for?
---

---
Stealth + Vats + Rifle is overpowered.
---
Bloody is overpowered.  
---
Combine the 2 and you get the most silly OP thing in the game.
---
This happened to my friend. The fix was to take the beams from the stairs collection and put them in the wall for "support" even tho the wall was the support.. it was weird
---
Not trying to knock your opinion it would be nice.
---
However since they're challenges it only seems fair that you need to meet the criteria on your own. None of the challenges are necessary to do to progress in the game, unlike some quests (enclave for example). 
---
You do get a nice bonus from challenges but I don't think it should be on Bethesda to mark every little thing on the map for you. IMO
---
Haduken!
---
It’s such a dick move.  No different than people locking all their entrances and locking you in the basement. 
---
Rad showers in the entrance aren’t much better.
---
PS4 here.  I am assuming that my experience is not indicative of every player but my gun safe has swelled beyond my wildest dreams (no really, its night and day from 2 weeks ago) and I'm making money hand over fist.  I couldn't be happier with player vending.
---
Other posters are correct though, it's super hit or miss some days.  This isnt a Bethesda issue though it's a player one.
---
Most players have absolutely no idea what anything is worth or what will actually sell. Some players jam their machine with drek hoping it will attract buyers for that one good thing they think they have.  It rarely is.  Worse is when it is good but its 10k over what anyone should ever think about asking for it and they have no mic. I will pay a little bit over value as a finders fee but theres a limit.
---
Some servers I will spend 10k on.  Other times I hop for hours just trying to find something, anything of value cause I'm almost at cap limit and I had to unplug my vending machines.
---
Location is very important when selling.  Most people wont go out to the Mire or Cranberry bog for 1 vendor unless they have 20 guns or 20 armor or 100 plans.  Stick to the forest or around whitespring for the best traffic.  Currently around arktos is a gold mine but space is limited and you get a lot of real tools too.
---
If you are buying this isnt always true.  4 of my best guns (2 God rolls) came from vendors in the sticks.  Just not enough traffic to find those gems I guess.
---
I sell plans, shielded underarmors, ammo, radshield, stimpacks, rare outfits, in demand junk like plastic lead acid adhesive etc, and any legendaries I find of value (key here is they have to be good for at least one spec and vs enemy type doesnt sell) ..  They sell in that order.  Plans sell off the shelf provided you price them right.  Ammo sells well as well but again you cant charge more than like 1 cap a bullet.  I actually would go cheaper if it would let me.
---
I dont get greedy and I have caps just roll in a little at a time.  Im having a blast selling and actually spend quite a bit of time hunting down good items to flip for cash or trades instead of killing stuff hoping for drops.  Been a refreshing change of pace.  And I'm not even kidding when I say some nights it sounds like I am jackhammering a cash register with a Warren Buffet doll.
---
Oh,no I get it! The glasses just add that little touch of je ne sais quoi.
---
Half of us have marsupial anyways. Who needs stairs when we can just SPROING to the second floor? :P
---
Interesting.. I have 1k shotgun shells and they never sell. But 5-10 cap stims fly off the shelf i. Batches of 20 or 30. Fusion cores go pretty fast and so does dog food lol. Rest is just plans and 1 star items that may sit a few days but eventually all sell. i price low for noobs in the forest so maybe thats why.
---
Also nuka colas. I added regular and cherry and they both sold out same day before i could get more from looting lol.
---
Your weapons lose damage points if they aren't 100% repaired, which only repair kits can do now. Happy?
---
Yeah agreed i have a tse laser but i never use because i need to repair so often
---
I haven’t had that experience. Most worlds I’m in have ~8-12 shops. I got an AAE minigun for 500 caps yesterday and an instigating SS super sledge for 800. Vendors are great because people who don’t understand the value of items (or just don’t care) are happy to take less than the people you would meet on reddit, you just have to be willing to search around.
---
Attacked by what?  In PVE mode (adventure) there very little risk of anything bad happening to it.  That’s what turrets are for. 
---
It’s almost like “don’t anyone or anything touch my precious camp” drives me crazy.  There should be a anti wanted feature.  I get hit by your punji boards and I can now attack you or your camp.
---
Use it to store your legendary weapons in, as a way to gain more storage space...
---
Now I feel like an idiot for saying that because I just went through my captures and I deleted it. I fast traveled near an area where there's a burnt house near a cliff off a winding road with a mailbox in some woods that goes down to one of the raider train stations with a trailer and a dead raider in it. 
---
 :..(
---
*YOU FEEL THIS*
---
My current camp is a huge mess and I can't edit OR remove much anything I'd want that is connected to another object. I'd like to make a new camp but the same problems would be present in the new camp also so what's the point? At least I've got everything I need now. Hope it ever gets fixed
---
Pistols are just very bad version of Rifles. They need a complete overhaul as do their perks.
---
I got a 3 star medic explosive combat shotgun at the Burrows. It's not at all THAT terrible. Especially while nuked
---
Yes thank you, so if I'm correctly reading this Combat BOS is the highest DR rated not Marine
---
There are definitely some ugly ass builds out there. Saw one that was like a dozen small water purifiers, all wired to a central generator, a couple of turrets up on those staired platforms, and then all the crafting benches just peppered around in the free spaces. No floors, no house, just purifiers and crops everywhere with wires criss crossing this way and that. It was the biggest mess I have ever seen.
---
Hey get out of here Helly!
---
I have two doors
---
|A|__________[B]
---
Vending/Private
---
DONE
---
I've only launched 3 nukes this week. I've found Chem wise that is counter productive for me to nuke stuff while power leveling.
---
For me to nuke a spot (which is still great for exp) the Tim wit take a to gather the required chems to actually go 1 or 2 hours straight in that spot actually takes more time than just farming that spot for exp when it's not nuked. Sounds crazy but I actually save about 20 minutes tohalf an hour per level up when I don't nuke a place.
---
Saw one at a camp sitting on top of a cooking stove. Which actually makes a ton of sense
---
**Vats(crit) + Sneak + Rifle is the best setup.** 
---
Low HP Bloody/Adrenal/NerdRage to go with it.
---
And some people with their overpriced shit.  I bought a nice 2 star sniper rifle for about 1200 caps but I am not paying 10K for your AAE or 3-5K for an ordinary legendary.  Most high level players already have several decent weapons so price the stuff to sell.
---
I moved camps after being where I was for a very long time, and I had my Tinkerers Workbench setup under my stairs in a little corner next to my Armor and Weapons station.
---
After moving I can no longer place it under the stairs, even though it clearly doesn’t intersect with the stairs. This really needs to be fixed.
---
I set up my CAMP on a cliff. Tho it's not like a vertical cliff, more like a series of steps down a valley. And I settled there month before there were vendors even hinted in game.
---
So nah, sorry, I won't move out of that spot, it's nice, I like the view, that's one side I do'nt have to watch for most ennemies, and anyway, the game is a bit unpreditible on where it's gonna drop even me. and on a side note, I settled there early one because it's central to the map (approximatively between Cliff's watch and the New Appalachia Trainyard) so I save a bit of caps when travelling from one side of the map to the other :U
---
Sometime I pop on the "right" side, sometime I'm steps down and have to climb up. Sometime it lods me in the foundations :U as someoen suggested, a travel mat (maybe even one for guests and one for the CAMP owner - that's a call for trap trolls tho) would make things much more simple.
---
This is ridiculous! Of all the challenges thus far this requires the most extreme patience and STOPS you from playing the game. You just put yourself at risk (in survival mode) for hours on end, waiting for a totally random, and rare event, over which you have no control. BAD CHALLENGE!!!
---
No?  
---
They will divide the workloads like normal studios. It's never going to be one or the other.
---
Why no rad shower?
---
Until they give us the ability to rejoin a server, there are SO MANY other ways to farm legendaries that don't get ruined if you get DC'd or crash. 
---
The only nukes I've seen in two weeks were all at the SBQ.
---
This. I don't miss (human) Npcs, but the interactions between players Are gold. I had just started the game and my husband was on his way over from his CAMP. And random level 100+ strolled up. I didn't even know how to emote yet and didn't have a headset. He very patiently explained the paper bag trade system and we swapped plans. I gave him the ones I already knew and took some from his paper bag. He took the rest back and we parted ways. This sort of thing meant way more to me that another trade with a vendor bot or NPC. So now I emote at people all the time, and I often wear the headset I got just for this. You guys all rock!
---
This!
---
lucky for me i stashed all my mags cuz someone i knew was collecting them (not for the challenge, as traded/given mags don't count)  but i never saw him on so when possum events dropped I had them all in my stash.
---
Haha. The rad showers I think were suppose to be a service. I was doing that totally not thinking about adrenal reaction or Bloodied builds. Sorry y’all. 😀
---
If you want an OP build, there's a bloodied build, a sneak build and a VATS/critical build. Don't know the specifics (which weapons/armor/perks to use), you'll have to look it up.
---
I use a 2-handed melee/heavy weapons build, and I swap out perk cards depending on which weapon I'm using. For melee there are 3 Slugger cards plus the Incisor and Martial Artist cards, and for heavy weapons (non-explosive) there are 3 Heavy Gunner cards plus the Stabilizer card. To maximize damage I also use Lone Wanderer, Adrenaline, Action Boy, Glow Sight, Solar Powered and Bloody Mess cards. For defense I use the Blocker, First Aid and Born Survivor cards. I also have all the mutations and use the Class Freak perk card to reduce the negative effects, as well as Starched Genes to prevent mutation loss. I also have a lot of quality-of-life cards for weight reduction (Traveling Pharmacy, Bandolier, Sturdy Frame, Pack Rat, Batteries Included, Thru-Hiker), scrounging (Butcher's Bounty, Green Thumb, Pharma Farma), food/water (Dromedary, Slow Metabolizer, Good with Salt). If I'm facing a scorchbeast I use the Fireproof card which greatly reduces the damage from the sonic attack. Finally, I equip some cards to improve weapon life (Gunsmith, Science Master, Makeshift Warrior).
---
Absolutely
---
You know what I hate about this "build" shit (and I'm not just talking about structures, but weapons, armor - you name it).
---
The amazing LACK OF CLARITY, and even INFORMATION on how to do stuff.
---
They mess it up with obscure steps; questions you can't answer - and this stuff just BLOCKS you from proceeding in the game and making your experience orderly, and enjoyable.
---
I mean, its enjoyable to fix your armor, or your structure, or whatever, so that it works right.
---
It is NOT ENJOYABLE and a WASTE OF TIME to have to spend game time figuring stuff out because you don't have the information on the steps and get blocked by MINUTIA.
---
ENTER THE ATOM STORE, where you can BUY stuff (like repair kits) that means you don't have to go through all the scavenging for every BS LITTLE PART, can get your work done, and move on.
---
Am I the only one that thinks they PURPOSELY DID IT THIS WAY so they can make more money on aggravated and annoyed peeps like me?
---
That’s too sexy to even handle.
---
Thanks for the lovely write up! It sounds exciting from your point of view, I admit. Earlier, I hastily set up my own vendor and put up some Misc and ammo things. I think I underpriced them but I can't even  sell them to the vendor so it's all profit anyway.
---
Why? Once you get the xp what do you do with it? Some big superboss you gonna beat or something?
---
No amount of exiting and reopening has helped me figure out my staircase related woes. I hope this will be fixed sooner rather than later.
---
I really think location is key here. People in toxic valley doesn't need that many stimpaks as its a low level area (next to Grafton). 
---
I don't sell/buy fusion cores, I just take down the sentry bots at Whitesprings (hint: take down a sentry bot, loot it BEFORE it explodes, let it blow, and it usually have a full inventory of loot, including fusion cores, again.)
---
Dog food is obvious, its canned so it lasts forever, and there is even a perk card for it, meaning you only need 2 cans to fill your hunger meter completely. 
---
I tried selling Vintage drinks yesterday, so people could complete the daily challenge easily, but no takers. The one time I sold my surplus of Quantum, they went pretty quickly. 
---
I keep my Cherry's as they function almost as well as a stimpak. They heal you quite a bit, give you caps for using them, and also fill out your thirst meter, its a win-win. No wondering they are selling well, since they also weigh the same as a stimpak without perk cards involved. 
---
To sum up, I think I need to move my camp, to sell more stuff. I just have found a really good location with 2 resource extractor spots, and since the last patch, camp building have been unstable, so I'm kind of hesitant. Location REALLY is key, when it comes to selling stuff.
---
Welding helmet (different piece than goggles)
---
I sell modded marine wetsuits for 150.
---
Yeah I have about 450 in Unyielding, it's out of control I tell ya.
---
Ok into my vending machine it goes. Any price suggestions??
---
Used to be worse.  I carry three and switch out as needed.
---
Uranium fever. Loot every body and scrap everything when the event ends
---
I launched a nuke at Whitespring last Saturday and I don't know if someone killed all the ghouls before I launched it but when I went there I found like 10 bloated ones, that was it so I won't be nuking WS again.
---
Very insightful thank you
---
This gets suggested at least once a week. (I'm for it.) However, I ask, again.... if we can easily switch between different perk card setups, then why even prevent us from arming all perks at once? 
---
If I can run into a battle with glass cannon rifle perks and then, after seeing what my enemy has to offer, switch to a tanky heavy weapons build with just 2 or 3 button clicks, then what's the difference between that and just having the perks always on. I guess maybe some sort of 'skill' involved with quick swapping faster than the next guy, but damn, that seems really Fortnight-ey. (comparing it to building.)
---
I want the outfit from Fallout vegas with trench coat and gas mask/helmet variation. Wasteland ranger maybe.
---
I play since two days with laser rifles course I never notice how good they are, but yeah I repaired my 3 laser rifles since yesterday 7 times lol
---
When one can of worms is closed another is opened :)
---
Anything but pistol and shotgun.
---
I have a rad shower in my CAMP.....hooked up to a switch so people can choose to use it not. 
---
Also if you do use a switch-powered rad shower in someone’s CAMP be a good neighbor and turn it back off when you leave.
---
Bloodied and radicool builds
---
If you have more caps than stuff you want, maybe play your own version of "Brewster's Millions." 
---
Find newer players with vending machines and buy legendaries you don't want and scrip them. 
---
You: get scrip and good karma
---
They: get caps early game
---
World: gets healthier economy
---
I hate this so much, like what is the point of locking all your doors? It's not like we can steal anything.
---
The Berserker might get 5-8 k to the right person but not much Berserkers out there
---
Probably just the server. When I see this I just server hop and the next server is normal with legendaries.
---
I have healing factor so I just run back and forth and break them all
---
Oof I need to fix that
---
they just need to make weapons like chainsaw and ripper go up to max level, and all weapons should have legendary effects.
---
A lot more busty babes I bet...
---
I do when I pay to fast travel to their camp to look at their stuff and they're just using it as a separate stash because they suck at managing their inventory weight.
---
I put my directly next to the purveyor. On Xbox, The Open Wound is selling you all the conviences of the wasteland while bleedin' them caps dry.
---
What glitch? At this point we have a video showing someone's health not going down, but what glitch are you claiming we are seeing?
---
What I used to do for the sheepsquatch event was literally invite everyone on the server to my team that I could. Even if people didn’t accept the invite, a few would always show up. They said things like “I got the invite and checked the map to see where you were and decided to join the event.” So maybe try that. I wish it was like the imposter Sheepsquatch quest and sent a notification to everyone, would make it much easier.
---
Lol what. Main thing I check for atm are plans. I sell a lot of them too thinking some people find it handy. I think it’s highly individual. I don’t want one star weapons and armor, as you can easily farm for that at WS yet players are selling them in abundance usually right next to the WS train station. If I don’t want it, I don’t buy it.. simple as that?
---
I’m afraid I’ll glitch at the loading screen and I’m still working on my back pack
---
Didn't see a place to submit Audio bugs... every time I start my app for the first time (after being fully closed out or powered down) my 'CHAT' audio slider in the settings gets re-set to zero. 
---
Easy to fix, but very annoying when I've been playing for two hours wondering why no ones talking despite seeing the audio icon in the corner.
---
Send random team invites, you’ll probably get some hits quicker that way
---
Crashed anyway :/
---
Was the whole reason I'm in here. I like seeing all my goofy pictures, but not enough to ask for longer loading screens. I can understand now, though...
---
Although... why does this stuff never happen to me? I have been looking for the snakey bois for as long as I've known about them, but never seen even one.
---
Mongrels, ghouls and others mobs that are fast enough to basically dodge the turrets that are already bad at detecting enemies. I can't let them destroy my generator every time, so just use the front entrance.
---
You sell to the vending machine outside of her shop. You only buy from her
---
Well, next time!
---
Look on my comment to the OP
---
It's a pretty known glitch in the PvP community lately. It's been around for a while but is just now catching traction, may not be what's going on here but it seems exactly the same. I do a lot of PvP and this isn't normal, it's not that just his health isn't going down, op is landing shots and it's not even registering on the crit bar.
---
I think Bethesda or somone just released an info graphic, can't remember where I saw it... but some of the top 5 things sold were Fusion Cores and Marsupial Serum.
---
So many rusty stairs as foundation...
---
The front door may be locked but jumping off my patio won't kill you if you land on one of my out-buildings
---
Honestly I don’t know. I’ve had him approach me a few times and it felt like the middle of nowhere.
---
It's really just random, mixed with bad luck. I have the same experience as you many times when doing legendary farming runs. Then I switch server, go to another location, and its filled with legendary enemies. I know it sometimes doesn't seem like it, but it's really just RNG.
---
Happy cake day 👍👍
---
But... there are npc's...
---
That's why mine are outside and I have some streamers and balloons and shit around them. :)
---
Some of the bug fixes would actually add missing content back to the game.  Looking at you Mire Dailies!
---
Mine's on a cliff but I've never spawned anywhere but safely since there's a lot of space around, so far nobody else seems to have issues... I think... Hopefully...
---
That is great news if it’s true. Do you have a link for the Beth forums?
---
I have had the same experience. People simply don't want to join if they don't see enough people down there. I have had trouble finding servers lately with enough high level people on it as well. The best thing to do in my opinion is try to find another server.
---
 If you are on survival expect to be killed even if you are level 5, that's what survival is for...to pvp.
---
I use it as a heavy gunner but I don't treat it as a bloodied build. I use radaway when I'm at 50% life and the bonus damage until then is a great trade-off for the -12 hp it provides with class freak 3
---
Oh okay, so it's probably more like a random encounter, like the bandit bot or prize bot. I was thinking there was a specific location that he hangs out. That's still really cool, I'm glad they've been adding new encounters too
---
I feel like I’m doing something wrong if I’m not constantly infected with some kind of worms.
---
&gt; But I don’t want those things so badly that I’ll catch another case of bone worms. Pick up your punji boards before you invite guests over.
---
Do you not have anti punji board boots?
---
They absolutely need to do something about how the body and heads scale together. As of now if you try and make a character that is anything over half way on the body size slider the body doesn't fit the head. It looks like a person in a fat suit. Even if they moved the neck from the 'head' zone to the 'body' zone, it might help out.
---
The thing about RNG is that it's clumpy and not evenly distributed. 
---
It's expected that occasionally you will get none or a bunch.
---
He’s climbin’ in your windows, he’s snatchin’ your people up
---
I only have the punji boards there so I can have what I call a "knockback wall". Basically, if I need to fight in my shop, "Murdoch's Merchants and Foodstuffs", to defend myself, I can knock em into that wall and they hit the punji boards. 
---
This is the first I'm hearing of anyone making a vendor trap. I'm quite frankly disgusted by the idea.
---
Ah, ok, is it bad that im a little disappointed? Im just bored with whitesprings, i think i need to start nuking the burrows or something
---
What kind of generator? Can you put it on the second floor in an enclosed space?
---
Did you know you can lock terminals like you can lock doors?
---
I mean the only people i find kill me in one hit...
---
I find a lot of games have issues with the neck not matching the body. Maybe a simple "neck width" option can remedy this problem
---
I’ll take one if you’re offering. I’ve never even seen an explosive mod weapon
---
How often is that mod used? I don't know many people that use mods besides data miners. I'd like to give it a shot myself
---
Haha yeah I don’t either unless they are yelling in the mic like that and then it’s bloodied explosive to the head
---
The one from Mario 3 you could hop around in?
---
I goofed the first time. I threw one too many grenades at my feet. I downed myself then the extra grenade finished me off.
---
Y'all always leave my goddamn doors open and I come home to a bunch of molerats fucking in my living room.
---
I just sell them for 10 to 25 caps each and people buy them all then relist them at their camp at its original value. LOL
---
Hahah +1
---
I noticed that players punji boards do damage, can they take damage from other players? If not this seems like something that could be abused for a death trap on Adventure.
---
The door to my generator is locked since its in a shed outside. If i leave it unlocked, someone leaves it open, and when your camp gets attacked by AI they all make a beeline for the generator
---
I'm more interested in Plans and Recipes than anything else. And I sell most of my duplicates for 10 to 25 caps; only the real expensive ones go higher than that and honestly even a new player could probably scrape together the caps for them.
---
I nuked the burrows and there were tons of bloated ones but not one single legendary. There is a lot of violet flux in Harpers Ferry though.
---
Yassss. Something.
---
There are more lazy low level players who can’t be bothered to make 1400 caps per day, yet complain about weapon prices being to high. 
---
What you describe is not a common occurrence.
---
Because of the materials? The plans are fairly readily available. I don’t think it requires any special perk.
---
I always think about just picking the lock but then I'd be wanted and that's just annoying
---
Yeah tough to get critical mass; almost all of the time I do it only 1 animal survives for many reasons and the rewards are crap for that :(
---
Probably cause you can't spell dumpster and they want to annoy you as much as you annoy them.
---
Just set the power line to a switch then to the shower so people can use it if they need to, then you can leave it at your entrance. :)
---
The OP is a prime example of difficult for the sake of being difficult lol
---
Bethesda - ‘No, you can have 30% of the settlement pieces from FO4 and be happy for it.’
---
They bounce mole rats away and prevent them from destroying things.
---
Think more.
---
Never really thought of it that way.  I am one of those that shot at paper bags I dropped for lower level folks to get their attention (e.g. serums, stimpacks, lower level Legendaries ... all before the gift emote) and like to think I got some karma that way.
---
This situation is why some griefer-types liked not being to able to be killed/camp razed to the ground in payback. I have to count on someone picking my lvl 3 locks so that I murder the guy jumping on my bed.
---
Who wanna bet that there will be discussion about inferno vs hellfire after she is released?
---
Like at vendors? Haven’t seen any yet. Haven’t found them either any known spawns?
---
Oh no, it is way worse without NPCs
---
How am i annoying them? I just want to play a game that isn't bugged like hell is that really too much to ask for?
---
They have mule accounts.
---
Hahahaha :)
---
Dude, get the joke. r/wooosh
---
This I understand, it's the rest of the camp I dont get.
---
Turrets automatically shoot anyone who opens the vendor, though.
---
I love that phrase. I don't think Harold could even say it... He's not really a words type person. His phrase of choice is, "Worst Idea is Best Idea."
---
Yeah i know but considering its a medic build the welding mask doesnt fit it.
---
That's weird, I have 1 machine gun turret that is always destroyed when I get back to my camp, but nothing else is damaged.
---
No, no, this Harold is different than Tree Harold. Also different from my Fallout 4 Harold. And he doesn't want nudes, the camp I went to requested them, so Harold obliged with a few of his own.
---
Fusion generator which won't fit in my house/store and also looks ugly indoors.
---
The tidal wave of people who are completely out-of-their-minds delusional about pricing is astounding.
---
I’m not vomiting in front of your vendor because I had some bad mirelurk meat. I’m doing it to express what I think of your greedy, fantasy-world prices.
---
Dude I can cal them a tard if I want you're the one overthinking it lol
---
You can defend cooperatively, get some teammates. This is a survival game, the workshop pvp is fine as it is. There should be a risk to owning workshops, they are really powerful resources.
---
No, you cannot destroy them. I was in a server earlier where literally every vendor was trapping people. The vending machines were outside, flanked by turrets. Spawn in, activate machine, die. They grinded for first place using that trick. What's the purpose, though?
---
For fuck's sake, you people are way too soft and serious.
---
If you’ve not ever done Free Range you’re missing a ton of plans. There’s the shards which are poisoned throwing knives basically. There’s plans for a Sheppard’s crook, Sheepsquatch club, and Sheepsquatch Staff. The crook has these mods you can get: glass covered, horned, toothed, spiked, and electrified. The club and staff have these mods you can get: heavy, burning, barbed, burning barbed, poisoned, and electrified. So 21 plans I believe. I remember seeing there are 22 somewhere but not sure which I’m missing.
---
Terminal is on the bottom level  in a room with water on the floor. Once you get the code you need to go to the terminal where you initialize the event. You can only shut down the robots when the event is active, cannot be done otherwise.
---
White Springs / Vault 76 / Legendary Vendor
---
Remember that other players don't spawn where you do. I'm on a cliff but luckily it always spawns my guests inside my house...in the living room no less. Unfortunately sometimes it's in the foundation. Strategically I have placed an instrument close by so there is an interactive to pull you out of the floor. :)
---
Do you have the capacity to build a generator shed?
---
Gotcha, I’ll try that. Thanks!
---
I'm trying to put a drop ceiling in my camp , so I can have a proper attic for my immersion sake. I think it will look better , but the last pieces just won't go , keeps saying item is floating, it's a ceiling piece connecting to several other ceiling pieces . I've built one like it before , but here recently I can barely build anything. What's up Bethesda?
---
Grow up salt boi
---
I tried to stack two half walls and it says "object is floating". It didn't do this in the first couple months after release. I would stack half walls two high with other designs to make interesting windows and such but now it won't let me
---
Say no more! No clipping is all I needed to hear, much appreciated!
---
I’m like you in that my camp is fairly away from the main zones like white springs (I’m near watago) I still get a good amount of visits but if you’re wanting the most possible visitors I’d say camp around the white springs, that’s where most camps are and if people skim the map they’re likely not to miss you
---
So the instigating effect is conflicting with the 250 DR while reloading? Mine has that too. I hope bethesda can fix this up.
---
Don't put vending machines in a room with doors with locks on them, although you might leave door open. other people might just close them.
---
You're salty about me calling someone a tard though
---
I agree - haven’t seen one in dayyyss
---
I find that vendor row around whitesprings is the best location.  This extends from the golf club to the west to the bee in the east and north and mountainside bnb in the south.  It’s all a small cap cost to fast travel or you can run.  You’ll get a good mix of high and low leveled (25+) traffic.  If you’re trying to appeal to new players, you could goto the overseers camp, but early cap grind sucks in this game so they might not have enough to buy your wares.
---
Because you sound stupid asf because someone is picking your locks
---
The server im in has machines on the road by the overseers camp, but we do cheap sales for new players and such, so the location is for early player traffic, and so higher players can free travel to 76, and walk to the shops, or travel.
---
I've never seen 8 on a single server lol except for launch day. I server hop at least 10 times per session depending on events I'm trying to do. Always visit every vendor and have never seen any explosive weapons for sale. Let alone an AAE minigun for 500 caps. Unless you have video proof I don't believe it.
---
Did you even get the point? The machine won't relock.
---
Bethesda games don’t have bugs. They’re features.
---
I built my camp in the forest region for lower level players, only thing is to keep prices low as most new players have very little caps. I get a fair amount of sales.
---
The agony and the ecstasy.
---
Exactly the same for me which is annoying as it’s the one that powers my vending machines
---
I can’t remember which train station vendors sell them. I know they sell them in the enclave bunker, but maybe you haven’t progressed that far into the story yet. Then there’s always the 76 market on reddit.
---
I'll help ya. PSN is mysterymac1393
---
I am a lv180 and still not been to the event, and probably never will.
---
From all i have read about this event you need to be 6-9 high level players that all works together correctly to be able to complete all of it.
---
To me that seems almost not possible, i am a solo player, but do have a mic and i do team up from time to time, but to get 9 players that all do the correct things seems to be toooo hard :)
---
&gt; ...spending caps to buy things that you could really grind for...
---
This is my solution to the problem. I just don’t grind anymore, unless it’s making me a lot of caps. Basically all I do is hop around the map going to events.
---
Making my hats
---
I hope you left a bag of shit on at his door or on his bed.  That’s what I do.
---
Or recreate the massive lads from the power armor glitch
---
Survival servers are nearly empty at the moment.
---
My camp is floating so no issue with mole rats
---
Some features really suck then
---
I look to shop at  camps near Whitespring (I’m probably headed there anyways) and near Vault76 (free travel) first. Three or more Camps clumped near each other are cool too - since then I only I have to pay to travel once. 
---
Then - I look for outliers. If you’re on the edge of the map, in a zone where I probably always wear my PA, you’re probably high enough level to have awesome stuff I wanna buy.
---
I want to make that chick from total recall. ( You know the one)
---
It crashes for 60% of us so that’s why. (Maybe that’s overexaggerated) but I’ve joined that event 15 times now. 5 failures because no one knows what they’re doing &amp; 9 crashes.. I completed it ONCE &amp; got the lovely special p recipe or whatever stupid drug it is that I’m not going to use in my entire 76 career so cheers to me
---
Oh I’m sure 😅
---
Damn, forgot to mention PS4 :) thanks tho
---
 \&gt; **every person you encounter is a real person** 
---
I'm not gonna lie, this sounded like an awesome concept at first... just think about it: we emerge from the Vault into a world totally devoid of humans. We're the only ones left alive. It all up to us and the odds against us are overwhelming. That's scary! There's no one to talk to and no one who talks to us - besides other human players. This could have worked wonderfully! 
---
But, unfortunately, Bethesda messed it up. Here's why: nearly every robot in the game has a distinct, human-like personality! Even the most generic bots act like humans - and they're everywhere! Rose talks like a human, the Grafton major talks like a human, vendors crack jokes, Biff acts like he's perpetually drunk, robots greet and acknowledge us as we approach them, they insult us, they show signs of contempt, pity or remorse. When exploring Appalachia, there's constant chatter... either from robots or from prerecorded messages which just happen to trigger at the perfect moment when we're passing by! Just close your eyes when Rose is talking - and you wouldn't know whether she is an actual human NPC or not. 
---
And that's the nail in the coffin of the "every person is a real person" concept. A really neat idea, but misdirected. In the end, it amounts to nothing. A huge potential just flat-out wasted.
---
\&gt;  **CAMPS**
---
According to Bethesda, they initially hadn't planned to include player CAMPs at all. Workshops used to be the only build-able areas in earlier drafts of the game. So the whole CAMP concept was basically shoehorned into the game. This explains why it appears so lackluster, why so many obvious features and objects are missing, why placing stuff is so unnecessarily complicated and why it's so "basic" overall. 
---
How could you design a game with the tagline "Rebuilding America" or "Reclaiming America" and not make base-building a CORE gameplay mechanic? This just blows my mind. More on this further down. 
---
 \&gt;  Because the game is always online that means **the opportunities are endless for change**. 
---
Name one current (or confirmed upcoming) feature which "requires" online-online for it to work. Name one nuance of the game which is truly enhanced and enriched by it. Again, the idea would've been totally awesome - if done correctly... but Bethesda messed it up, once again. It's shallow and superficial. "Wild Appalachia" hasn't changed the world. It just added more stuff to do... more or less. In terms of gameplay, there's no reason whatsoever why Wild Appalachia had to be drip fed over the course of months. The legendary vendor, the burrows, the paradise event, the camera, the sheepsquatch questline and the scout challenges could've been included at launch. They don't add any kind of progression. It's like buying a new car but the manufacturer deliberately omits the proper steering wheel, the comfy seats, the safety belts, the radio, the navigation system and half of the transmission - just to slowly add or fix these in the following weeks and months. What's the point? To keep you interested in the car?
---
 \&gt; **Opportunities are ENDLESS!!** 
---
I agree! The idea that we, the players, change the face of Appalachia forever would've been the best thing ever! And that's exactly what I had pictured the moment I learned that 76 would be about "reclaiming America". This could've been an active and ever-changing world. Finally! As far as I know, no major game has ever done this. Imagine players permanently refurnishing houses and entire towns, removing rubble, debris and car wrecks, restoring roads, burying the dead, establishing large-scale farms and water supplies, building communities. THIS would've been the closest to what mankind would do after a global catastrophe. There could've been huge server-wide projects, requiring hundreds of people to contribute in different ways over the course of weeks or months - depending on what they'd like to do... fighting, building, trading, exploring. Fixing a nuclear power plant could've been such an event. Some people would have to gather loads of resources, others defend the site or conquer new areas, others do the actual construction,... 
---
Opportunities would've been endless indeed - but Bethesda messed it up. The nail in THIS coffin: streamlining! The thought that every player needs to have close to the same experience, regardless of when they start playing or on which system. The potential wasted by this is, again, enormous. 
---
Conclusion: To me, it's quite clear that Bethesda didn't want to tell a great story with 76 or create a compelling world or introduce groundbreaking and engaging features - they wanted to make a minimum viable online-only "games as a service" kind of game in order to create perpetual revenue and thus market it to the biggest audience possible. And it shows. Almost every feature of 76 is like a lowest common denominator. Satisfy base-builders (but don't make it too complex) - check. Include PVP (but don't make it mandatory) - check. Claim there are no human NPCs (but have quirky talking robots as questgivers) - check. Add survival elements (but don't make them too punishing) - check. The list goes on and on. 
---
I honestly applaud Bethesda for trying new ideas and deviate from their usual formula. Change is good and necessary. But it just breaks my heart to think about what an epic game this could've been...
---
West Tek and sell the assault rifles. With some grape mentats and hard bargain it only takes 1-2 runs to sell for the day.
---
Sad that you have to do that. In Fallout 4 I got a modded out Laser Rifle it was my baby, F3 I had my Wazer Wifle :-/ I miss the old uniques
---
Loads of people use it. I wouldn't play the game at all if it wasn't for the chatmod and PerkLoadout mods.
---
toot toot motherfucker
---
I visited this guy and spawned inside his little box of a camp with locked doors and the vendor on the outside.  Then I looked at the map and realized his gamer tag was Schrodinger(something).  I had a good laugh.
---
they acknowledged there were more bugs with scout tasks but they said that they couldn't get them done in time for 9.5 patch so they should be on the next game patch.
---
I'll gladly contest that workshop if I see a level 100+ there. 50-100 I just wont go. Anything under level 50 and I'll go just to scare them and give them stuff
---
When r u on
---
I have multiple accounts and the when i fast travel to my mule's base the base is ok but in my main i'm missing walls etc. I try remaking them and gives me the same error.
---
I run a Blodied build and have BE in all 3 for PVE I would say double,.. sbq I use pump for range and my combat for some reason is less damage but if you don’t want to reload as much it’s handy for multi add fights so basically. Not one is better than the other but rather they are situational
---
I'm on right now.
---
Just shot them after they go wanted to collect the bounty.
---
I suspect that Mey be due to the PvP in this game being a joke where the only viable tactic is one shot vats builds
---
ROTFLMFAO
---
Turrets in my opinion is not meant to be used in your camp, they are meant for defending workshops. It saves A LOT of budget of you leave them out of your camp. 
---
I also build lights, but build lights that light up a big area. (I think they are called Tracking Lights)
---
Try to keep your wiring to a minimum. They do take up budget, and having a lot of wires will quickly add up. 
---
Only build food items you need. I have a small adhesive farm that gives 10-12 adhesive each time I farm it, which is enough to repair 1-2 weapons. Plants take up a lot of budget. 
---
Some people report having more budget space as they level up, until level 50. If you have built your camp at level 25, and were to rebuild it at level 50, it should supposedly take less budget, even though the exact same things were put down in camp.
---
I can direct you to the guy I bought it from. I added him and asked him first if it was an accident. I also got a bloodied/SS/strength pool cue from the same vendor for the same price. I didn’t save a video because I didn’t expect to have to validate my purchase to a random redditor and I find great deals all the time. If you haven’t found any deals but you server hop and visit 80+ vendors a day then I don’t know what to tell you, that’s super unfortunate.
---
Hmm I sell common plans all the time for 50-100 caps. I sell a ton of ammo/weapons/armor as well but people do buy the plans, even the more common ones.
---
Where does it say that they will *always* drop loot?
---
The machine opens up and they grab everything before the game even says theyre wanted. What are yall not understanding?
---
Only thing people care about is the SBQ since legendary nerfs at WS &amp; there’s a solid 20% chance you’ll get a bunch of low levels or high levels with shitty guns so you can’t even get the SBQ. The other day I beat it with this depressing squad I joined off of LFG with 1 minute remaining... first time beating her at 50 I had 20 min left still hahaha. Sad times these are
---
Maybe it's a bug. It's really annoying me cause my shops keep going down.
---
Junk and chems. Mostly junk
---
That’s so funny.  I seldom see people get very creative with signage other than juvenile profanity.
---
Lol. What’s the game equivalent to bag of shit? Burnt text book? Wood armor? One star junkie gamma gun?
---
Lock feature ? Come on. We need a COMPARE feature. How has this been overlooked since day 1??
---
What exactly are they stealing?? Unless you like to leave paper bags of loot on the floor in your house, they can't actually take anything.
---
LOLOL
---
Yeah my vending machine and junk extractor keep stopping. I tried putting it on the roof and have it heavily protected and still gets destroyed some how.
---
I did that on my first character, except it took an hour, whereas what I did with my second took 15 minutes
---
That would be most excellent. :)
---
Bag of fertilizer.
---
While it would be nice, it would also be hilariously non-canon.
---
That’s shit alright 😂
---
It looks like they’re winning. 
---
You’re complaining about people in a video game that takes place at the end of the world after all.
---
This game isn’t “Care bears, hug it out”
---
They're picking all my locks making me re lock them, they're taking ammo out of my machine. Why on earth are you even fighting me about this very simple concept of when they start picking the lock they are already attempting a crime?
---
Collect all the things, sell all the things.
---
Yeah that must be irritating, at least mine is only a turret. Have you tried scrapping the generator and rebuilding it? That might fix it......🤔
---
 I saw a post yesterday like this, where a ghouls or scorched kept destroy this guy’s generator. Put a turret next to it and see if it helps
---
I have had the exact same thing happen to me multiple times in the last couple of months. I have found that they are more prone to spawn a legendary item if you let the legendary enemies recharge their health completely, and then kill them. I know it doesn't solve the issue, but it has definitely made a difference in my legendary farm runs.
---
Armor (10/3) weapons (7/4) second number being legendaries would be awesome. Or even just Armor (10)* indicating some are legendary would be great
---
The only lock I have is a 0 lock on my Fusion Generator. Keeps my Scorched neighbours out.
---
That would be great, but it’s a glitch and I don’t wanna lose everything!
---
I very much doubt it would go anywhere near that
---
2 things... 
---
1. Legendary enemies disappearing (along with other regular ones)
---
2. Legendary enemies that say 3* then drop a 2* or 1* or like you said not at all.
---
Selling serums in my vending machine
---
I'm kind of hoping to see an expansion of the player vendor system whereby we can browse inventory remotely -- maybe via map or personal console. I know it's a long shot because they're relying on the fast travel aspect to create a much-needed cap sink, but we can hope.
---
Yeah, but jerks kept unlocking it.
---
Besides, like I said, it's more for decoration than anything else. Kinda wish we had non-damaging versions.
---
Add me I'll be on later today
---
Or just interact with your little CAMP machine and hit repair all damaged structures. But your way works too, I guess?
---
I put 4 turrets next to it and locked it on the third floor and still, only the generator. Several doors to get to it were locked.
---
Duper? Or OCD hoarder with lots of time on hands? Lol
---
Yeah, it is annoying when it's green yet it still says you can't place it
---
Just did. Gonna be busy until this evening. I'll be on then.
---
Build a cage around it so they can't get into it and have a single door that they must also picklock. Once they open the door you shoot them. Problem solved.
---
To be honest 10 caps for a butt load of ammo is worth it. If they don't care about caps.
---
Im selling one on ps4 for 1250c but you can find them in Fort Defiance
---
I ran into a guy the other day dressed as Santa - he gave me a ton of legendaries for free, and was generally awesome. His C.A.M.P. had a big sign on it saying "Santa's Gloryhole," however. It was hard to be mad at him, though.
---
Great suggestion !
---
I'll take your caps but I'll be damned if I let you use my workbenches. /s
---
But the 3 fusion cores they steal are worth more than the 50 caps we get
---
Keep in mind we still have 4\* and 5\* legendary enemies/equipment to look forward to. I expect that will come with increased challenge levels.
---
I'm even gonna pay about 1000 caps for it. (I've spent more caps while fast-traveled to players stores all the time incase someone sell it).
---
LOL
---
Before player vending came out I just sold radaway mostly and other chems to bot vendors and when I ran out of caps to get from them it was killing super mutants.
---
Yeah, happened to me today as well. Three star legendary dropped zilch.
---
nah, we need a Asultatron butler in our camps to do things like this for us :)
---
I've heard some people had success by running Scan &amp; Fix, other reportedly by clearing the friends list requests, something along those lines.
---
I tried both of those two nights ago, then the PC patch yesterday, seemed to fix up a lot of stuff for my setup
---
It's 5 caps, and i'm not building some dinky makeshift cage around every single machine. I'm asking for something very simple that actually makes sense, why is everyone giving me workarounds that i'm aware of already lol
---
So maybe.. like a Fallout Shelter overseer type game within 76? That’d be interesting. 
---
And complicated lol
---
Yeah idk why people do that. I’m just shopping not trying to get tetanus from those rusty ass punji boards lol
---
I want fast travel Matt’s as much as the next guy, but I feel like they would be a trap waiting to happen if Bethesda does not put limitations on where they can put them. I can see myself now... thinking I’m going to go buy legendary loot from a player who doesn’t want his old pieces anymore. Just to be trapped in a locked room lol
---
Doesn't work with Power Armor. Some people's builds have them living in their PA, and I use mine when shopping because some of you guys enjoy building your CAMPs on the peak of Mount Son-of-a-Bitch and logging out at the most inappropriate times.
---
Really? I’m in defiance all the time trying to farm uniforms and haven’t come across any. Are they a static spawn?
---
Close to whitesprings station.
---
How are you selling ammo for cheaper than other players? Minimum pricing is 1cap per bullet. Which won't sell for most ammo types.
---
Yup that's what I heard - that Bloodied Melee is the way to go, but it required a very specific balance of gear and such (which needs to be farmed). I'll do some research into this - thanks a ton for the recommendation!
---
I did an sbq last night and I got nothing
---
Just wait a little while. Those damned machines spew out so many fusion cores so quickly that nobody can reasonably go through them all after even a couple hours of farming, regardless of whether it's locked or not.
---
I’m on board with that. Absolutely. :)
---
You just said it yourself, 7.62 is .308.  Which one is the game referring to?  It's Fallout, they don't say unless it's F1 or F2 where all the guns are real.
---
Another option is to buy large quantities of ammo from an enterprising individual...such as myself... :)
---
My best customers are high volume sellers who need the cap space and they usually buy anywhere between 5,000 to 10,000 rounds of 5.56 etc. at 1c a round.
---
I was getting close to max caps the other day so when I found someone selling .308 for 1c I bought a bunch even though I make ammo “for a living”.
---
The inconvenience is that a lot of people don't have just unlimited monthly bandwidth.  Why can't your Development and QA teams just a little better job rolling these patches into a single, weekly patch?
---
Lets hope, be ready for some more 1\* wood apparel, lol. 
---
But a lvl range for events is something that could come in really handy.
---
I’m definitely sinking caps on the player vending. It would be a nice qol improvement imho to have the option to see if it’s personally worth it to travel to a camp or not.
---
Are you talking about workshops or resources? You need to be clear. You are giving off the impression that they are breaking into your camp or something.
---
What's the point of putting Punji Boards anyway, I swear it only tickles the enemies.
---
And this is the internet. Where you can state your opinion and still be wrong.
---
Too much investment for too little return. Also had to delete my local cache after my first run in order to load the game back up, losing all my camera pics in the process -- the wife and I had a lot of memories there that are gone, now, and there's nothing the event can give me that is of equal value. 
---
It's off my radar unless/until they fix it.
---
I don't know if this is true but i usually don't kill them too fast. I let them get their health back and then slowly kill them. Because for some reason it takes time for the legendary weapons /armor to spawn on the body. Sometimes when you kill it will take up to 10 seconds or so
---
Yea I'm doing the same
---
Oh I agree that is not accurate to real life... but if you ask anyone with any knowledge about guns what .308 is they are going to tell you 7.62 x 51 not 7.62 x 39
---
They're radioactive when you walk past them - impossible.  The leftover fuel from a broken fusion reactor is water.
---
Does it really matter what locks im talking about? This isnt single player fallout im not an npc that waits for the lock to get picked to get mad. But yes i'm talking about workshops and all my extractors. Figured that was obvious.
---
Common sense is hard. Happy to see so many here who seem to have some.
---
Happened to me last night, super disappointing
---
You dont even get 50 caps you get 5
---
No one ever talks about this. What good is ONE marker??? If you came out of a vault, and started trekking across the landscape, you would immediately start marking spots of interest on a map.
---
Yeah! What is that all about? It can't be that EVERYONE is spec'd wrong.
---
I bought the refrigerator mod after the high capacity. I'm not convinced I'll ever use it beyond equipping it to gather materials for a specific item I intend to craft as soon as possible. 
---
Aside from the grade 2 Good with Salt bug, it isn't intended to stack. With that in mind, would I prefer to drop Bloody Mess and equip Good with Salt and retain the 120 carry capacity, or keep that extra 15% damage (not particularly useful for collecting plants) and equip the fridge mod instead, consequently losing 90lbs? 
---
The fridge is a hard sell for me, hoarding is in my blood. I play with Bloodied weapons and often die anyway so I'm not bothered by the negative DR the high capacity mod incurs.
---
Thats sold for at least 5 scrip man! Dont just throw that away
---
Constant crashing. I have not got into it yet.
---
I’m so sick of spawning inside of someone’s locked camp or stuck in some part I’m not supposed to be in.
---
I'm on vacation and would fly home early if this happened 😂 I love the dbl XP weekends, Beth can you wait until I get home, thx! 🤠🤘
---
Exaclty....
---
What make you think L3 will always drop a L3 item?
---
Its a “chance” to drop.....
---
Down you can downvote this to hell also....
---
But its the truth
---
We're talking about a company that had pre-exisiting bugs from fallout 4 that were present in Fallout 76.
---
As optimistic as I want to be; and as pessimistic I dont want to be, we also have to be realistic.
---
That those are pvp designated areas. . If they are within their right to contest you to what’s in those machines. IT WARNS YOU!!!!!! WHEN YOU TAKE A WORKSHOP !!!!
---
Trap rooms seems to be the topic and players who take advantage of a good thing and use it the wrong way. I wish that wasn't the case.
---
Only idea is to have the player spawn outside of the camp area but near the entrance to the building.
---
Yeah my turrets don’t seem to ever kill anything so maybe it’s time to get rid of them.  I have lots of wiring as I have lots of those pictures that light up. I’ve got about 6 glitter balls(maybe more) and 6 chandeliers. It just seems so dark without lots of lights and I like the girlie lights. I think I’m going to scrap it all and start again and see how I get on. This is only my 3rd camp as only had the basics in the first 2, didn’t see any point of a nice camp as didn’t have the plans I have now. Cheers for the advice.
---
That explains why I can't hit anything even when it's there it's not there 😕
---
I'm referring to the .22 caliber round itself not the powder cartridge.  5.56, .223, and 22LR are all the exact same .224 caliber round.  None are a high power rifle caliber, LR is tiny and the other two are slightly larger intermediate rounds.
---
My adrenal reaction thanks you
---
Dude, are you kidding me. I WISH THEY WOULD CONTEST IT, THEY DON'T THEY JUST PICK THE LOCK. Don't come at me with your nonsense it's annoying. Do you even take workshops? I'm going to guess not.
---
it didnt drop anything legendary. thats the issue.
---
Half-broken pipe weapons.
---
Hey I'm a sucker for those lights as well, but you can achieve the same effect by getting some fachsnacht decorations and placing them infront of tracking lights. Lots of fancy colors without budget costs, and you still get light where it matters.
---
Even in open world?
---
He's not nearly as pretty without his sunglasses. :(
---
I guess that means I can stop looking for these things now than.
---
Ask them for their home address.
---
I haven’t come across the bandit bot!
---
That’s what mute is for 😉
---
I have a look at them. Did just buy some of the snowflake fachsnacht decorations for the ridiculous price of 2000 caps, just because I really wanted them.
---
Your just mad because the mechanics aren’t in your favor.
---
I'm selling my excess ammo for 1 cap each.  Last night a player bought all my 10mm, about 1000 rounds.  I went to his vender site a few minutes later to find he was reselling it for 2 caps each!!!  And I usually find people asking 2 caps each (or more) for .45 or 5.56.  I will gladly pay 1 cap each for 5.56, but can't find it at that price.
---
This. My dad's a programmer/ software dev/all around computer wizard, and he taught me to never, ever, ever do this unless your computer is doing some Whacked Out Shit. He trained me by telling me the computer would explode if I did it too many times. Still more effective than Resetti from Animal Crossing. [I was like five and would believe stuff like that then, but it still gives me pause two decades later.]
---
This. Also, just sell stuff. It is sporadic but I'm 2k richer than I was 10 minutes ago without doing anything else differently.
---
Jesus Christ people, just because he calls them "quests" doesn't mean they're ACTUAL quests that you're going to have to pass to proceed through the content, these are clearly new mode specific challenges.
---
And anyway if this really is a new MODE then there's no telling if you'll even have access to your Adventure camps.
---
10/10 agree. Preventing loss of favourite items was a great step - but it shouldn't be the function of the favourite wheel. It's a quick-access toolbar, not a lockbox.
---
Yeah, but it's more fun to mess with them first. lol
---
Sold a Berserkers Explosive Gatling for 6k last week ,.. it’s a very situational market , patience literally pays off
---
I'm a shotgun build and getting plastic is always a pain (lead less so).  Although that is something I grind for, I do find myself buying 1c shells (I won't touch 2c) for the convenience like after spending 500+ shells (and TS 50 cal) in a SBQ fight.
---
Because I try to max our my shotgun perks (mostly in Strength), I don't have the luxury of Bandolier so can't be carrying too much.
---
Wtf? No i'm mad because you just said something completely mediocre. And my point is the mechanic SHOULD BE that I can shoot them while theyre picking my lock right in front of my face!
---
There needs to be both, like they have been doing, if they don't add anything new, people will quit because they have done everything, if they dont fix anything, people will quit if there's too many bugs.  
---
  
---
I personally havent really had much in the way of bugs, certainly none that make me want to stop playing, but what does make me not want to play is when I sit here and think, "I should play fallout, but what exactly will I do today other than wonder around the same places ive spent 500+ hours wondering around so far"  
---
&gt;Soon enough there will be too many bugs and you will become overwhelmed. Tackle them while you still can.  
---
And this just maeks me think you didnt play the game at launch, there is (by far and large) drastically fewer bugs now there there has been at any point in this games current lifespan, + bug fixes that have come out with every update theyve done so far.  
---
And on a final note, the reason they were adding in so much content so regularly and not just bug fixes was because we were in Wild Appalachia (which literally just ended with the last patch) so they had been releasing content in waves for that
---
This just reminds me of the scene from the beginning of Deadpool where he's threatening the one guy and then admits he just shit in the guy's house somewhere.
---
Yeah, they are pricey now, simply because you can't get them anymore. In my opinion, they are still worth it because if done right, they look really pretty when combined with the right lights and stuff.
---
I agree with you, but in the meantime it's a good idea to check where the spawn point is and build based on that
---
That's a weird way to go about it, but glad you two figured it out.
---
same thing is happening to me
---
I’m not expecting a three star legendary to always drop a three star item. That rarely happens to me, to the point that I don’t really care about the amount of stars a legendary has. However, they should drop something out of the ordinary otherwise what’s even the dang point with the legendary system?
---
I think the mats would just help people with their death traps and prison camps
---
No, currently using the full budget.
---
My old base locked the main doors but I had a 3rd story door I left unlocked and open, so if you spawned inside you could at least go up there and leave that way.  Still didn't stop one person from blowing my door open who couldn't be fucked to climb the stairs.    
---
New base I just got rid of locking the doors and just locked the junk extractor inside.  Easy enough.
---
considering ESO has the lock feature, this should've been a no-brainer
---
[laughs in retail confusion right along with you]
---
“should be”? It isn’t like that now isn’t it. So cry me a river. Love your salty tears
---
Bethesda forgot hot to do it after Fallout 3.
---
It was the first time I saw someone selling them so glad I got them as I’ve never seen anymore.I’m at the stage where I have to keep buying stuff just not to max out my caps.
---
It's memorial day weekend here in the US.
---
It's comical, I won't spoil it 😀
---
If it were dodgy when I crit him later in the video he should have taken damage because criticals bypass everything.
---
Just double checked and the quest is definitely not in my PipBoy. Will try what thehippoz said tonight. Hope it works cause these bugs are so damn annoying.
---
Oh whaaaaat, that's cool. Four for you and four for the Queen.
---
Will try that tonight! Thanks man, hope it works!
---
Moron. 1v1 me lol
---
I used to make houses out of assets like those too.  It just made sense that people would use such things to build their home in a post-apocalyptic world.  I would love to be able to do that again.  Just imagine a CAMP with shipping containers strewn up in a Power Line.  Crazy stuff like that is more fun to build.
---
Mean, but made me laugh anyway. Take my upvote.
---
I don't have a backpack because I have no clue what to do.  The missions shows on screen are vague and pointless "(Show scout values 3/4)" with no marker.
---
Not the insult bot tho
---
Its BE combat, QE DB, and QV50 DB
---
Supposedly only obtainable by completing a certain weekly challenge.
---
yep
---
I solved that problem by having my rad shower in my utility room and hooked up to a switch.  You have to look a little for it but it's there.
---
I love Harold already. He reminds me of my secondary character, Gavin. His favorite outfit is the swimsuit.
---
 it’s easy to provoke you huh? Sit there and fester in your incompetence.
---
I do the around the top of the world train station. Dont always get traffic but get enough to net roughly 1k per hour of game play selling loads of ammo and plans plus some other novelty items.
---
I hear a little stuff about 5* and 4* might tie in with the nuclear winter update. Again this is not a guarantee, just what I heard a little about
---
Well thought out friend. Hopefully Bethesda gets wind of it.
---
Sometimes I get none, sometimes I'll get five just in the clubhouse
---
It's not "unrealistic" if the all of the models already exist and it's just  time consuming.
---
Have a photo of a guy in his baaaad billy costume underneath the neon sign on his house that says BUTTSTUFF?
---
The latest update fixed the rain issue. But placing items inside a tent is broken again. You'll have to place them outside and then drag and drop into the  tent. Otherwise placed items go on the roof
---
I thought I was having the same problem, then I decided to buy serum recipes and sell serums dirt-cheap. I was just unlucky that I had just moved my camp to an unpopular location (toxic valley), so now I'm kind of struggling caps-wise.
---
 I just really don't want to move from where I am, as it has 2 resource spots, close to 2 vendors (Grafton), filled with low level enemies that I can use for steel from their weapons, and my camp looks really awesome atm imo.
---
Ah. Woops. Off to install a switch.
---
Fallout 76 has NPCs.
---
This post gets an upvote from me just for asking so politely.
---
I really hope so
---
You're literally an idiot, go away.
---
Is there any way to know where you originally set it down? I can't remember at this point beyond a small general area, and the choices are basically "perfect spawn point" and "absolute worst spawn point" with nothing in between.  I've never seen anyone spawn in so I don't know.
---
Happy cake day! 🍰
---
I was not prepared for the cackle that just left my body at high speed!
---
Doesn't this seem like an insane amount if work? Wanting something that is iconic of the fallout franchise to stay in the fallout franchise doesnt seem like "too much" to me, especially when it doesnt require any use mechanics, physics, calculation, ect. It's literally just soen triggered voice lines, basically asking for the equivalent of 1 npc in the game.
---
It's only for completely destroyed items. He wanted to refresh the items health bar by cheesing it
---
Spawning under the floor or in locked rooms is always fun :D
---
I think you overestimate the power of the creation engine. I don’t think this stuff is possible tbh. Very good ideas though
---
I do this too, except I jump and then start moving. I had it once where I started running and got stuck on something that didn't load in fully.
---
Launch one yourself
---
The fact I ( a total stranger) can get you worked up over the internet has made my day. Hope you stay mad bro.
---
*BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY, BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL BILL, BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY*
---
Nah, I play the "how far can I walk once I can see everything before it rubber bands me back to the doors"
---
I honestly think it was another player, and this was back when slap damage was still a think. So you're probably safe now, I just have the habit to hide on the roof.
---
I don't understand why we can't plant all of the flora we find around the wasteland. If you can harvest it, you should be able to then go back to your CAMP and plant it.
---
Ya I get what your saying. In adventure mode you should get wanted for even attempting to pick a lock that’s another players. It’s really weird that you have to complete the lock picking first.
---
Sigh
---
1K an hour is loads more than me over in the Mire.  I would be thrilled with that.
---
Oh god. People will complain about anything these days
---
Lol, "It's poop Ted, don't squish it with your boot!"
---
???
---
My team and I ran into that last evening, the neat thing though was that every 3 out of 4 ghouls we killed dropped legendary weapons. Just in an hour or two last night I think I came away with 30 individual legendary weapons and armors that I can scrap for scrip, and head to Purveyor! Was a fun time, and for once a pleasing glitch
---
Haha no I getcha I was just making a meme reference about that Antoine Dodson thing
---
https://youtu.be/fl9vouECjgs
---
I bought some serum recipes and was ok but seem to struggle now to get the high radiation fluids to make the flux. I’m opposite Pleasant valley station and don’t really want to move from there. It’s right near south cutthroat camp and go there every hour or so as a 3 star legendary spawns there all the time. Only place I ever seem to get 3 star items from.
---
Move your C.A.M.P platform around and test fast travels best way to figure it out for me personally
---
Yeah happening with me two I’m on ps4 if u want in on the action
---
Well, there’s another cap sink for ya...score some top tier ammo weight reduction armor from the marketplace. :)
---
What level are u?
---
Its more of a fact than opinion IMO. Any gun will get a significant kick if played on lowhp synergies.
---
"That those are pvp designated areas. . If they are within their right to contest you to what’s in those machines. IT WARNS YOU!!!!!! WHEN YOU TAKE A WORKSHOP !!!! You do see the message don’t you? Or do you just spam the next button."
---
You seemed pretty mad here yourself. Next time you say something stupid don't take the cowards way out pretending you were trolling the entire time. I can be a triggered asshat all I want but you're a back peddling coward.
---
Every time I spawn into a camp a run like a bat out of hell to get away before it solidifies. 9/10 times that works.
---
wow i built my camp in there justa few days ago but after i painstakingly got some flooring in there i had too many placement issues and moved again
---
*Brings fat man for a revisit*
---
And a toilet paper!
---
Been playing for a handful of hours (Xbone) and it seems that most of the players I encounter want to help level me up or give me gifts, a guy today gave me a bunch of legendaries to trade for tickets. He did this after running me through high-lvl enemies where I just tapped them and he’d blast them in the face for me, I could not have had more fun!
---
Not entirely true - I spawned in at overseers camp but the persons camp lagged and then scorched spawned inside their camp because it wasn’t technically there yet and I had to go kill them D:
---
PC here, but thanks for the offer. If it is still going on, but hop on and farm some more legendaries. Scrap and sale, I could be rich!
---
No Barbed is for the Drill lol
---
Which they are already doing anyway. If you get in a "trap" you just pull out, and shove a nuke on their camp.
---
Ok. At least you read it and now understand where you went wrong
---
That is my go to for steel
---
Yea it's all from 5mm and 5.56, u think being center enough makes it an easy jump to go to the top of the world station so people will just stop by my place after. Also it's near where free range fires up regularly.
---
Being time consuming is enough to make something not worth the development time. They would have to take every possible permutation of each weapon and check it against every armor set and outfit in the game, then adjust positioning for whichever combinations clipped too much.
---
So many building games have little issues like this. The sims has always been an eternal headache for placing some objects.
---
I only have met two greifers in my wanders around Appalachia , both fairly soon after the game came out. I was level 60-ish they were both well over 100. Unfortunately for them, by that time I had an optimized build for my X-01 Power Armor and non-legendary Gauss Rifle. Which resulted in me one shotting the both of them(neither had legendaries that could one shot players who didn't yet shoot back). 
---
The closest I've come to being griefed since(very recently) was someone following me around shooting a pipe pistol at me. It took me a second to notice he was wanted with a very low bounty and what he wanted was for me to kill him. So I did and left his sizable junk pile, he returned, collected his junk, gave me the thumbs up, left some 2MM EC ammo and ran off.
---
That's funny, my old camp was placed on the junk node there opposite of Pleasant Valley Station. The top of the world location + the cabins behind it, is one of my steel farming locations. It also helps that its also a decent place to get magazines and bobbleheads.
---
Wtf? What does that even mean? Idiot I swear, have a nice day.
---
Exactly! The entire rest of my camp is wide open! 2 of the 4 walls are open garage doors. The bottom level external doors are locked because way more times than I can count I come home to my generator being attacked.
---
Finally someone else thinks this lol. I hate constantly having to check those challenges to keep track of all the random stuff I need to complete. I just wish you had the exact option you have for tracking the other missions. I know it could clutter the screen quick but it’d still be beneficial in my opinion.
---
To get the back pack - there's 2 mini missions, which should be marked on the map. One involves getting bug parts and one has you picking up sludge.
---
You also need to revive someone. Cant really mark this on the map as you need to revive a player.
---
Last part involves completing 3 badges. Go to map, challenges, world challenges. Scroll down and you'll find Tadpole badges. You need to complete any 3 of these.
---
Since it doesnt know which of them you're trying, and each one has multiple parts it wont mark them on the map. Especially as some like "kill 50 creatures with x-bow" dont require an area.
---
Also this might sound odd, but I quite enjoy them not being on the map. Anyone can run to a marker. Its quite enjoyable to work out how Im going to get a picture of a cat.
---
Thanks for actual feedback instead of antagonizing me
---
Reread if you don’t understand.  There are also lost of youtube videos explaining that workshops are pvp.
---
One of my saddest moments was a Free Range event with a whole bunch of folks, two Legendary Sheepsquatches and both of them had no legendary items for me, not even a rolling pin to scrap. Hell, no drill or syringer either.
---
I was on that spot but after I started running out of stash space I moved it just down to where the lake is. There’s always lots of plans too in the cabins and even now I get the odd one I’ve not got. Yeah don’t think I’m in any rush to leave my spot. Only thing is I think a lot of people have the same idea as takes a while to find a world that’s free.
---
Oh yeah totally, I've not seen any friends or randos spawn anywhere but my front yard yet though, so I THINK I'm ok so far. 
---
Not that it doesn't mean BGS won't change something and break it all...
---
I always took it as a rating of the strength of an enemy, not an indication of the loot they would drop.
---
All armor sets are within enclose enough size that they wouldn't need to do that.
---
They'll just throw the word prototype in there, or make some BS lore change stating the U.S. Gov't was actually the original creators of the power armor...
---
*jazz music stops*
---
I forgot about the swimsuit! I'll have to find a half-empty pool to have Harold lounge next to.
---
Ah, I thought burrows was normally ok for nuked legendaires, just bad luck? Im curious about if anyone had nuked wet-tek, does it effect inside?  Ive heard something about beckley too (the town in lower left corner) not sure about that though
---
Careful...your Red is showing
---
Same. Went once and was all alone. Seemed impossible to do alone. Haven't been back since. When it does start up I'll check to see if anyone goes and 99% of the time I don't see anyone there.
---
This and also when they have a decontamination shower in front of the doorway to their machines with it running and no switch to turn it off. Thank you for getting rid of rads but lots of us want to keep them for bloodied builds
---
WORKSHOPS ARE PVP YES, I AM WELL AWARE. I'm 100% OK with someone contesting my workshop because then I can kill them BEFORE they do anything. This isn't about contesting workshops it's about PICKING MY LOCK WITHOUT HAVING TO ENTER PVP UNTIL IT'S STOLEN. Oh my god I think i'm actually arguing with a 12 year old and now im ashamed.
---
Can’t take those.  
---
But check their vending machines - many players (shameless plug: myself included) sell them.  
---
Personally, I’m asking 1 cap per percent of charge.
---
Of course, they can be farmed from a number of locations, too.
---
Beautiful!!
---
&gt;What did he really expect?
---
I'm honestly not sure. Granted, my level 1 rifle with a 50 cal receiver (thanks vendor guy near the vault!) isn't exactly powerful, but it probably put out 3x the dps of the pipe pistol he was using.
---
Random side note: survival is awesome at low levels. I played for several hours, ended up on the top of the leader board, and none of the high level players fucked with me until I claimed a workshop.
---
That's just the in-game economy right now. 6000 is a low price, most charge significantly more than that, usually around 15000-20000 is what I see. The reason everything costs so much is because now dupers are gone, thus supply is low, demand is high, as a result the prices go up.
---
I hate the prices just as much as the next guy but quite frankly that's just how it is, and it won't change unless dupers come around again and supply goes through the roof.
---
I've done the sludge one a half dozen times, it triggers every time I'm near that lake.  But the bug parts one isn't on my map so maybe I glitched.  Oh well.
---
In that case, you just need to pick up everything you can find and scrap it weapons gear pots and pans just everything and when you are full up you travel back to your camp and break it down and store it or move the base to you if getting back to where you are would be hard.
---
Steel is about the most common resource in the game its in so so much you really shouldn't be running low on it unless you are being super picky about what you pick up.
---
Agreed. Also, somewhat off topic, but for the love of everything that is holy color code the markers for when you’re on a team. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gunned it in the wrong direction to someone else’s marker on the map.
---
I have never crafted a recipe except mutation serums.
---
Your right, I do need to dial it back a notch. Thanks for keeping me in check.
---
I'm glad you are enjoying the game and more importantly your first encounters with other players have been positive. I use the emotes a lot to get players attention (they seem friendlier than shouting into the mic) and have made it a personal mission to help low level players whenever I can. 
---
Like the OP said we are essentially the npc's of this world and we can make it a great place to hang out and fill all the roles of former npc's without all the repetitive dialogue.
---
I want to further this suggestion by saying this: When running around in power armor, I'd like to be able to holster my suppressed Gauss Rifle on my hip. Purely because you could do that in a 7 foot tall suit of power armor, and it would look awesome.
---
6k is cheap for that piece
---
I just can't see charging over 500 caps for any single item, but I guess I don't hold the worth on them as some people tend to.
---
I... May inadvertently have done that. Except my house was kind of... Outside the cliff?
---
I moved it.
---
I want to make a brick house, low intelligence man as a stealth build. YOU DO NOT SEE GREG. HE ONLY WANT TO SMELL YOUR FLOWERS.
---
6000 is fair for that weapon. AAE Anything is valuable.
---
 Even though it's not worth that much to you, somebody will pay that much for that weapon. 
---
 PS you kind of sound like a D bag.  You have absolutely no right to tell anybody how much they should or shouldn't sell anything for.
---
Two staircase heights up, the angle they would be firing at makes it very difficult to hit you 
---
unless you are standing on the edge of your platform.  
---
They can, however, damage water purifiers and other stuff you may have at ground level,
---
Yup, that is was helped me make the decision to move as well. Sometimes I had to switch servers 10 times before I could put my camp down. I feel like a feature where the game prioritizes a server where your camp could be put down, is strongly needed.
---
Primarily PA user unfortunately
---
Lol. Anthem javavilins
---
Your perception of the market and his are different.  If you frequented the trade subReddits you’d know that “the Market” values an AAE railway for far more than 500....or 5000.   You could charge more yourself to recognize this inflation.
---
Only weird thing I see happening is people mass planting stuff like Fever Bloom or Ginseng.... Which I mean. Isn't really a problem
---
i just removed my doors so no one shuts my bedroom door and gets stuck
---
Just that fact you are arguing over a game and getting flustered is what you should be ashamed of. In all seriousness,  Im out to fly to  my daughters graduation. So say whatever you like, block me or make multiple accounts and downvote everything I do. Learn to play with the current mechanics and quit bitching about what isn’t in the game yet.
---
This usually happens if whitesprings was previously nuked.  If you try to pick the flora you still get flux.
---
I was surprised too when I first started trading, but you learn pretty quick that its apparently normal and reasonable to expect everyone to have that kind of caps on them.
---
The part about "Making your Vending Machines easily accessible." I wana scream on the top of roofs throughout Appalachia. I figured that part would be total common sense but it's so common to find people who make accessing the damn Vendors difficult.
---
51
---
I would scrip those.
---
Yeah, I keep walking when I see prices like that. I know the economy is fucked, likely permanently, but I'm not going to participate in keeping it that way. 
---
That said, don't be afraid to message somebody and ask for a lower price. I'm generally willing to cut my prices in half when people ask because I'm honestly more interested in moving product than making a profit.
---
I’m on PS4 if you still need it. Want to do it for my second character as well. PSN: EdwardElrich420
---
Honestly, he (or anyone)  can sell anything for any amount they want. You have no right to tell them otherwise. 6k for a high value 3 star weapon (depending on the stats) is not unreasonable and may even be on the low end. Also had you not immediately started your message to him being rude he may have been more willing to work with you. The only thing your long woe is me message was miss was the classic "get off my lawn!" So moral of the story, learn how a free economy works, and being nice to people usually has benefits.
---
Lol at 8k caps being considered "a large amount"
---
Ohhh cool I have flux already still don’t know what I should do with it
---
It's less of an issue with the form the NPCs take and more about how there is no dialogue trees or choice at all. You just click on them. Hear what they have to say and go on to the next automated checkpoint. It doesnt matter if it's a human, or a  robot, or a terminal, or some other interact able object. It's still just clicking through. There isnt a ton of choice or impact and I think that's what people mean when they say no NPCs
---
Was going to mess with you about misspelling losing but after reading your post I decided not to. That sucks man.
---
Leave Britney alone!! 
---
Wait...wrong Spears?
---
Some of the most wanted items and rare god roll weapons can go for crazy caps, 6k is considerably cheap, I've seen some weapons go for 60k+
---
You would think that’s how it works, just skip that world until it finds a free world. Who wants to be in the world without their camp.
---
Oh I just tried I got some fluorescent flux
---
Those are anglers not gulpers, trust me i live in the mire
---
Trading subReddits have your answer.
---
Put it on a foundation and build a doorless shed around it. Build the shed after you run the wires.
---
Why? Are you in a rush or something? And how complicated can a camp be? They are usually pretty small. And if you have to go to a cryptic labyrinth, then maybe that was the purpose of the camp owner. Not to make it too easy for you.
---
I've checked a couple threads on these, I think "guaranteed" is the wrong question because it doesn't seem like there's any guaranteed spawns.  It seems they spawn in the mire interchangeably at places where Gulpers spawn, so it takes a bit of server hopping.  There's a low water spot next to the road between Dyer chemical and Crevasse Dam that is a spawn point, I server hopped 3 times and got gulpers every time.  My second time checking the Treehouse village I got Fog Crawlers.
---
ok my bad,it is what sheik482 has written
---
are you sure about that i havn't tried myself so i'm not arguing but all those patch notes said were "pacify" was removed  not once did it say anything about taming
---
The ghouls no longer drop hardened mass or radiation fluids after the radiation clears. So i usually just sell it.  I try to save some to go inert since they weigh less than water and fills 25% thirst.
---
thank you for knocking that idiot down a peg.
---
Stabilized is in intelligence
---
Forgot to mention that they also sometimes just spontaneously die randomly for no reason even if you haven't fast traveled into the area
---
Did you make it stable?the flux i mean
---
Nah I just got it
---
Oh ok Algs
---
You are correct as I have to shift demolition expert to enable it. My mistake.
---
Does anyone know of a complete list for plan rewards from Biv? I have a ton but not sure if it's all of them yet.
---
From what I've heard, the default spawn point for other players is wherever your camp unit was originally set up. That means no matter where you move the unit or your vending machines, players will always spawn in or around the same location. Only fix appears to be moving your camp and building it in such a way that the original unit placement is where you want people to spawn.
---
Think about the fact that you can get 1400 caps a day no matter what.  Can you find good item drops every day, no matter what? Saying very few items are worth 500 elevates caps far beyond their actual value. 
---
When I read the title I figured someone is finally mentioning how ridiculous it is to charge 150-300 per stable flux.
---
Ok but you know u gotta make it stable?otherwise it changes to inert flux
---
I get this often
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/8l3218T
---
Oh cool what’s that?
---
They should give two new items in camp. A door mat for spawn location of other people, and a door mat for your personal spawn location. Hey people could build traps easier, but that is part of the game.
---
i removed my doors. life is much easier now
---
Thanks, i will give it a try
---
I feel the exact same way, I love this game, it’s tons of fun, but the bugs are real!!!! The most annoying thing is when I play with someone who streams, I have the game on one monitor, and the stream on another, and i see myself in power armor and it’s all distorted or stretched. Drives me crazy!
---
Also I don't buy from people who only have their vending machines accesible but hide all the working benchs inside behind a lock or password. As a new, low level player, I may need to use that stuff and if you're not going to share it I won't buy from your selfish ass.
---
I left my rad arch off to the side. Its always on, but its out of the way by the fusion generator.  If people can't avoid it, then they'll probably have a bad time. . . Ope
---
Which is fine. Give players a choice, not limit them.
---
Same, along with chitzy "Buy buy buy!" signs, deathclaw easter eggs, and a Deathclaw shrub. Got a few turrets up high to so my shoppers have an early warning while they buy ammo or healing items.
---
Possible drops from the event (depends on the creatures that survived)
---
You are saying specific rewards come from the survival of specific creatures?
---
@chemistry bench go to nuka flora or something,there you make 10 raw flux,what u got,to 1 stable flux.if u dont it turns into inert flux like spoiled meat dous,its useles exept for water use
---
Oh ok cool
---
Oh god wow, no idea how you survive but good man helping others!
---
Yep, the turrets will open fire as if the player is a 'threat'
---
I'm sorry, but that's just not how markets work. You managed to scrape up 1200 caps in a couple of minutes - clearly, 1200 caps is not a lot of money. For something that is very rare and very desirable, people will be able and willing to pay far more than 1200 caps. 12000 sounds closer to ballpark. Plenty of us high level players are running around with 20000+ in our pockets and many valuable items in our vending machines, begging to find something fun to buy. People like that will happily blow 15k on something good that their character wants. As long as caps are so easy to come by, and good items are so difficult to come by, prices will never even come close to as low as you're expecting them to be
---
I think if they do add real NPCS they should be isolated so those who dont want to deal with them done have too
---
"Workbench and WC for paying customers only!"
---
Roleplay. Unlocked doors are for visitors. Locked doors are for private use!
---
They also patched the silo glitch so now you have to actually *do* the silo to launch. I would guess that contributes significantly. I know my group that used to launch on SBQ constantly has died out since that patch.
---
Exactly. I'm currently building a maze with vendors scattered throughout. And no worries, I promise to have more than throwing knives 🤣
---
I love builds like this, i just wish living near setpieces wouldnt attract the spawns to your base. Another nice spot is the support beams under the bridge just south of harpers ferry, thats wherr my alt stays anyways. In terms of pain in the ass, i think the most annoying build ive done is my main, i live between the gap on the sennacca rocks. The view is worth it though. Keep up the cool builds!
---
To make you go grinding. It's the only valid answer i can think of.
---
The green thumb suggestion would be good imo. Even it's just restricted by area - like tarberrys/cranberrys in the bog, fern in savage divide etc.
---
The quest is super easy. Stockpile the bloatfly glands, bloodbug proboscises, stingwing board, and tick blood sacks in your stash. Take one of each out when you do the quest. Fast travel to dolly sods, inside there is a level 2 locked door with a radroach. Kill it and get meat, or use butchers bounty and hope you get lucky. Quest done without travelling all over the mire.
---
Pretty much go tp the pool at whitesprings, and look for a frog, then chase after it and grab it with your interact button.
---
Boom, you got a frog. 
---
They are also classified as junk, so you will drop it if you die.
---
Ive been spending ages looking for the neon lights plans.
---
I'm really thinking about installing the park load out mod. How's it working for you?
---
Yup! Always the wood floors...lol
---
i can never have enough light blubs, or typewriters, or oven mitts, or... oh no i'm a hoarder.
---
I've played every map instrument to well tuned to see if they were labled wrong. Nope nothing works.
---
Will try asap. Thanks buddy.
---
I went away for 20 or 30 mins and came back to check loot I left.  Loot was still there and event re-triggered.
---
Yes to both of u
---
You need 10 flux of the same kind along with high radiation fluids, hardened mass, glowing mass. Go to a chemistry workbench to craft it.  Its going to be listed as junk so stash it incase you die.  You need stable flux to craft certain items.  If you have the super duper perk, make sure you use it as you could get 2.
---
You can come along with my group?
---
It's not even necessarily that. There are plenty of good items out there. Maybe the absolute top tier bloodied explosive weightless god rolls are harder to come by, but it's mostly the fact that plenty of players are rolling around in caps with nothing to spend them on. Player vending is a good long-term cap sink, but until it reaches a point where people don't have mules with 25k caps due to having nothing to buy, prices will always be as high as they are. Caps are close to worthless, so it takes a large amount of them to get something that's valuable
---
You are the true LordOfApalachia lolz
---
Hopefully we'll get something like automated nuke launches in the future. Maybe MODUS goes (further) nuts and starts launching them on a schedule?
---
Do you remember what friendly mobs were up and how many of them survived when you got that?
---
Of course it looks ugly.  But there are other ways to protect it without impacting player visits
---
Fannnntastico. Thanks!
---
Clearly you and me are not playing the same game cause I have experienced far more negative interaction than positive to the point I don't do anything that involves other people.
---
They then also have to justify why the scorched virus didnt kill or turn them
---
Everyday i hear about a new bug
---
I didn’t realize that using the player vending machine made you a threat. Seems counterintuitive.
---
Thanks, yes this is what I'm thinking, what dmg buff does it give at about 50% health ?
---
I have 1-3* BOS armor all under 600caps, I have a 3* prime lever action for 2500, serums for 300 but always seem to get on a server with hardly anyone buying...
---
I just started trying out the vendor stuff.  To me, it made sense to have the workbenches right next to the vendor machine. Just in case you buy/have a mod you want to attach to a weapon/amour you just bought.  Placed a Stash Box there too.
---
Thank you...
---
have your upvote just because star trek
---
It is. Ive been killed by it tons of times, and it makes pretty easy traps. High level turrets will wipe players before they can even exit the trading stand. 
---
Which is why I delete mine first.
---
BREAKING NEWS !!
---
Deaths by falling damage rise 200%
---
try some right guard...
---
I don’t steal anything but wood floors suck for spawning in and a lock door means I’m spending caps to leave and chances are high I won’t come back to see what you have if you’re not near another discovered point I can fast travel to.
---
you cannot be stuck under the foundations of there is no foundations
---
Dang. Thanks for sharing. I have some turrets to move.. 😬
---
Yesterday I got stuck behind someone’s Nuka cola machine they had in a corner all I wanted was useless junk
---
Right I make that just by afking at my base for a hour  from people buying plans from my machines.
---
&gt;WC for paying customers only!"
---
WC means bathroom
---
Nuke silos have plenty of level 2/3 terminals. Level 0s are honestly some of the most difficult to find. I remember two of them being in vault-tec university - one in the higher floors, one in the vault power room.
---
I think they will fix it on next patch... and they will break something new 😂
---
You can make 9,800 caps per week/per character just at the vendor bots. 
---
I've paid 15k, 20k, and 25k for single pieces of gear. A serum recipe at Modus is 17,500.
---
I have 10-20k per piece gear I haven't even listed yet.
---
You would have more caps if you charged more caps... seriously a 3\* for 500? I can sell 1 serum for 500 caps.
---
But caps are easy to get. I'm always at the 25K limit with nothing useful to buy
---
Running cap statshes and selling serums
---
Well its not a rating of strength, but an indicator of what type of loot it can drop.
---
Up Vote to that!
---
If fridges are in the atomic shop eventually I'm gonna be so pissed it's a great idea but I hope you just need to use plans to get it
---
I don't know. Part of these games is learning the map and remembering the layout and location of things. I think part of that will be lost if we can start adding lots of icons. 
---
Although you could say this game is already so different that it doesn't matter, and that the map is much bigger now so it's harder to learn. I'm fine without it but I see why people want it.
---
In the patch notes, where Bethesda said they fixed the BUG that legendaries dont drop a legendary.
---
My current CAMP bug favourite is the "Nothing is selected" message every 3rd or 4th object I try and place.
---
There's no bath.
---
Haha. Small hell. I’ve been in some camps built around bridges and overpasses, that are like 5 levels with stairs and doorways that lead absolutely nowhere. It’s kind of like the Winchester House in San Jose. 🤣
---
On PC. Don't know about it her but my group is pretty much constantly dropping nukes on the sbq it in flux farming areas.
---
Since Wensday, I've personally dropped over 15 nukes on sbq alone. I don't farm flux I farm the sbq, yesterday was 6 sbq launches 7 fights ( didn't launch the frist one) 5 kills ( 1 glitch 1 crash).
---
For those looking for nuke launches. My suggestion is to post platform, times and either sbq ir flux. And set up discord for it if on PC or voice comms on console.
---
A little but of prep will net you more launches, than a complaint on the lack of launches
---
the more creature survive the better reward you get
---
I know and WC can mean like a public bathroom or a bathroom in your house with shower and stuff
---
I hope this post gets to a bethesda's worker so this thing can get featured in the game.
---
You know what I’m down to try this with a group of people of anyone else is. Are you on PC?
---
I had three survive and got bear claw.  So that is not 100% accurate.
---
I hope you reported him. Getting him banned would be sweet, sweet justice.
---
Ah I follow your meaning now. I wouldn't know what to pair it with, always kind of thought engineers uniform looked dirty (not really medical) but if you find something that goes well please post pictures (always like seeing costumes people come up with)
---
That's why I have an auto closing door with a keypad entry. The code is right above it if you want in so the AI stays out
---
That's true. There are some weird and useless constructions sometimes. I still like them more than the standard cubes or open air platforms that I see so often.
---
Generation Zero has something similar. Shouldn't be too difficult to add.
---
Totally on board with this. I spent an hour making a wooden house. Not even furniture or decorating. Just floors, walls and roofs.
---
Couldn't put the fence on the side of the porch because of the steps going up next to it. But I found I could take the steps out, put in the fence and put the steps back in.
---
The foundations went down fine. Well actually no, I had to move them once because there was a telephone pole I thought was a tree and therefore wouldn't be bulldozed. But ok apart from that.
---
Walls downstairs went in. Ok good that was easy. Upstairs walls too. That went well, even though it was a mix of full height and half height walls (making a real attic feel). Stairs going up and the floor upstairs good too. My luck has turned!
---
Roofs? Appalachia we have a problem. All the roofs and extra wall pieces went in to make an attic... except 1 roof piece. Wouldn't snap in. Well, it would snap and go green. But it was floating. Which is wasn't.
---
Removed some stuff and put it back slightly different. Ok not floating but No Item Selected. What? The roof is selected. It bloody is! Swapped servers because that sometimes fixes. No Item Selected. Fine. I'll make my shop front and come back. I did that. Let's put the roof in. Something is in the way? Erm no. I spent 10 minutes taking out all the walls and other roofs in combination to work out what was getting in the way. Nope. It just doesn't like it.
---
I stood still looking at the staircase until I thought objectively and realised... it's the damn stairs. They are causing some kind of an issue where they add space above them as a bit box or something. So I fixed it... by taking out all the floor upstairs and the stairs. Then the roof went in fine. So the *stairs* have some kind of extended square hit box above them?! And interfere with the damn ceiling. I added the roof in before the stairs and upstairs floor. Which ended up looking better than I planned anyway.
---
Damn you Bethesda.
---
I've run into this. Someone with almost 1000 caps wouldn't die even when brought down to  0 health multiple times. There was a group of like 15 of us who were all shooting at em at the same time, and they just wouldn't go down
---
are you too close to a map marker location?
---
yeah that's the good reward like what did you expect there are 3-4 plans you can get,if 3 survives it's more likely to get the plans
---
Maybe but I been there for a week why NOW
---
Could be you picked a very popular spot?
---
Outstanding. I was considering creating a Top Ten Camp Vending things to Avoid, but you guys pretty much covered it. 
---
I’ve gotten accustomed to immediately moving away from spawn point once I fast travel (before the camp fully renders) so I don’t get trapped in the foundation or in some weird area. 
---
The absolute worst one that I experienced was a guy that managed to isolate his one vending machine to the player spawn location and walked it in tightly. So the visiting player spawns into 4 solid walls facing a vending machine. The other walls are only the width of the machine. The player must fast travel in and out and if another player fast travel there, I don’t know what happens. 
---
I know my camp has multiple player spawn points if others are there but I think his was on a mountain cliff. 
---
I thought it was rude. Didn’t buy anything and immediately fat traveled out.
---
&gt;I messaged him on psn over and over saying I want his gun and accept my friend request. I told him he had unreasonable prices, but I was willing to pay because that's my dream gun. He didn't respond for THIRTY MINUTES.
---
&gt;He had the nerve to tell me I was being difficult and had no right to tell him his prices, I told him what his mother and I partook in last night. He then told me he would sell it for 20000. Haha are you fucking kidding me right?!?! Twenty thousand?! Go sit on a corn cob, I told him.
---
This seems so ridiculous, I have a hard time believing you're serious about any of this. If you are, and you're 63 years old as you say, I'd suggest utilizing some of those retirement benefits on seeing a professional.
---
I'm hoping this is just a troll shitpost though.
---
The new content really doesn't matter much unless things work properly. Take the purveyor for example - wood armor losing its two effects is just ridiculous, and has been brought to attention over a week ago. This is something that deserves an immediate hotfix, yet here we are. I'm simply not willing to risk rolling for armor with it in its current state, so that's 1/3 of the purveyor content completely ignored due to a bug. The assaultron heads are an issue too, but not as significant as 5 pieces of wood armor, so I'm willing to take the risk and scrap it if need be. I don't use melee weapons, so that's another 1/3 I will never use, meaning that effectively 1/2 of the new content is completely blocked off to me. Fixing that bug would be much better than adding another new broken piece of content
---
I think they will need to add in some characters eventually, these games are most notable for the likeable and hateable characters that you come across. there probably doesn't need to be as many as there were in previous games but I think they'll need to introduce characters at some point if they want to progress the story and have it feel like progress is being made. to me it seems like they have a new foundation for story telling and i don't think its out of the realm of possibility that we'll see characters that you can like or dislike in the game eventually.
---
hell i'd love to see the game get some sort of faction system, its missing multi faction interaction. whether npcs come from a vault or migrate in from outside there are opportunities for it to happen.
---
6k for an AAE Railway? Its very cheap. One thing its selling a 1* Stalkers Walking Cane for 5k, im agree, but that god roll in that weapon its a nice offer
---
I've had this one bugged for me as well. I have only been able to complete some of the location and types of instruments only on a single character I have. I can not for the life of me figure out how.
---
r/market76
---
I had a legendary blood bug today that at first glance had nothing legendary, but when I came back a minute later had a legendary drop. Maybe check the corpse again after giving the server time to catch up, if you can?
---
Clearly marked showers using pressure plates is where it's at, it wont stay on longer than it needs to and people can choose to use it if they wish
---
MrFD &gt;... IDK if you can sell items out of your inventory...
---
I thought you could only sell from Stash, but when I select Sell at my machines, I do have the option to select an item I am carrying.  
---
I’ve never tried it, so IDK what happens if I select an item from on my person inventory to sell, then leave camp.   Auto-removed from my person and placed in the stash (what happens if stash is full?) 
---
Seems odd that would be allowed, in that if I am carrying an item listed for sale, and I am at say...WS, but my camp is near Bolton greens, would the item magically teleport from me to the buyer?
---
If your camp in anywhere near Watoga Station or Whitesprings/Whitesprings Station this will happen a lot.
---
The Enclave *is* the US government.
---
You broke the rules. Don't loot the corpse until the legendary item has spawned in
---
Anti-armor is best for weapons or weapon classes without good armor penetration. So it's not as good on rifles etc that can have perforating magazines, and definitely doesn't help on melee where you have the incisor perk. It's also a good alternative for when two-shot makes a weapon too difficult or inconsistent to use - for example, the .50 cal machine gun is just too inaccurate to use outside of point blank range with that additional spread. 
---
Berserker I believe caps at 50% bonus damage, bloodied goes up to 95% when you're an inch from death. But bloodied does you no harm at full health, while berserker's will lower your damage if you are heavily armored
---
Exactly, the buyers decide the market, and if the majority of us "regular" players without 1000000000 caps on their 25 mule characters, refuse to pay such ridiculous prices. Hopefully the sons of bitches will get the hint.
---
the more creature survive the better chance your have for a better reward would be correct?
---
It'd be nice if it just chose a server for you that your location wasn't occupied at
---
I play on PC, and my weapons swap between automatic rifles and heavy weapons as I haven’t found the “god tier” weapon for me yet. That and I messed up my early game perk card picks.
---
i got the plans for the backpack with 1 alive, BUT it was a Max rank one. the death claw with the venison collector
---
Cannot place item, intersects with an existing object.
---
Cannot place item, selected item is floating.
---
Cannot place item, nothing is selected.
---
:l
---
They were already dead.   You just didn’t know it yet.

Player controled in game factions would be better than npc ones itd be relient on strong positive interactions and super scummy dealings between players
---
Should have said "Water Closet" to make it clear.:-)
---
Ah, I understand.  The videos I saw about griefing on the consoles were from months ago, glad to see the info is outdated.
---
Or just a general timer that can be set manually within pipboy.. i like using Rose’s syringer that makes the enemy super strong for a minute and then supr weak for another minute.
---
+1 fork lock on junk that i would like to keep!
---
Center of your build circle.
---
I don't know what you are peddling, but my stock just dosen't usually sell.
---
Same with me, I would say lower that gun down to the 500 cap range, someone will thank you, and it wont be collecting dust.
---
Also 2 level 0s in the new Morgantown airport
---
I am one with everything said here. 76 is special because of the lack of humans. It truely takes the apocalyptic feeling and enhances it. The players are the NPCs and the interactions with the few you find when you are just roaming the wasteland are much more complex then an NPC with set dialogue and only certain responses and replies. We are the ones filling these roles that the NPCs in the other games were responsible for. We are changing the world around us as we go along and establish ourselves in the loose communities that do exist in the remains of what was America. This is the start of what is to come after the bombs dropped and everything was erased. I love everything they have done with the game and hopefully continue to do. The game has a lot of work to be done to it as does any new online multiplayer game. I understand the grievances that people have to a degree. However you are never going to please everyone and of course most people in general have plenty to complain about with anything regardless of how new or old the concepts are. Fallout 76 is working it's way toward greatness. I am for one incredibly pleased with how everything is thus far and am very excited for the future of Fallout 76 NPCs or not.
---
So TSE are bad, but being able to be invisible and one shot camp is ok?
---
&gt;. I will gladly pay 1 cap each for 5.56, but can't find it at that price.
---
 *waves ammosexually*
---
ign: ninjasrfake :)
---
The raider vendor in pleasent valley it should be called raider core or something will give u all of them
---
yes
---
Yeah, the problem is when you're server hopping, even leaving due to the "camp couldn't be placed" issue, it will often take you back to THE EXACT SAME SERVER. Otherwise, if you're hopping for an event, it will likely just take you between the same 3-4 servers. It really needs to be fixed - if you're leaving a server and rejoining one a few seconds later, it's obvious there is a reason you don't like that server; it should blacklist that server AT LEAST until you exit the game
---
I don’t know, man.   My level 24 alt sure had a lot of fun at a SBQ fight last night.
---
is that nuked you're talking about, because I've yet to find a single legendary there
---
I started by buying every single plan at Studio 58 so I could class up my house. AFter that, I've started buying serum recipes every time I break 18k. In the last couple weeks I've picked up Adrenal, MArsupial, Speed Demon, and Twisted Muscles, and I'm about 2k away from hitting that point and buying Grounded.
---
&gt; And it should bother the shit out of you too.
---
Nah I'm good.
---
Do it the custom way; exit and rejoin through the main menu.
---
The Automatic Server Swap is currently known to bug out where you choose to join another world but end up in the same one.
---
If it happens again, open up the world map, you'll see what I mean.
---
Corporal creek duh
---
Are you going to be going in an hour or so? I’ll join then if so.
---
Does everyone use marsupial in pvp? Not complaining just curious
---
I buy crap all the time so I can keep my caps under 25000. I’m happy to pay for a god roll legendary.
---
If the price is too high (looking at you, 2000 cap serums), most will re-price accordingly.
---
Capitalism, baby!
---
I recently made it a point to wait until the server decides if the mob is going to be a starred lego or not, tagging before hand was to blame to me receiving no loot.
---
I wasn't paying attention and got demutated :/ it's my own dang fault for swapping out starched genes, but I was in "craft ALL the mininukes with super duper" mode.
---
Is there a sorta chart somewhere of the general price for items and what sell more?
---
I try to sell things cheap (always put them under what the game tell me it's worth) but some thing doesn't move. I have about 30 missiles and fusion cores hogging my stash space. I sell junk because I hate wasting even digital stuff, so I prefer to sell my extra ammo and stuff even for 1 cap (franckly, someone bough me a huge lot of .308 ammo which was cool, but if the game allowed it, I'd sell it for 2 for a cap)
---
Cool! Thanks for the heads up
---
My camp always spawns people off a cliff edge. I built a wee platform to catch them, but I'm always tempted to delete it and start collecting junk from their corpses
---
It's not like anyone can damage your camp, what's the big deal? I love being able to see people's camps. It's one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
If I spawn under a house I'm fast traveling away and not buying anything, if I spawn in the middle of a corn farm I will be having maze soup for dinner.
---
I've been lookin for this info as well hopefully your right!!!
---
What’s a punji board?
---
It’s a holiday weekend. Lots of juvenile players and dumassery
---
I would totally add this perk.  I wanted to ring my CAMP with Rhodedendron's from the first time I saw one.
---
Yet here you are
---
Wouldn't that just be the Core Assembly for Raider PA?
---
I know there are a lot of mixed feelings about this, but a lot of complaints have risen about sponging and one-shotting.
---
I know it's a small thing, but it irritates me when people leave my damn door open.
---
- Vending machines out on a little deck of their own.
---
- Raised base so enemies don't easily get inside.
---
- Turrets to protect said base.
---
- Fire outside with camp stove for quick meal prep.
---
- All crafting inside unlocked base.
---
- Storage inside and outside.
---
- Open crops and brahmin.
---
- Only locked bedroom and water pumps.
---
All I ask is that people shut the door.
---
I rebuilt my camp, fired up the vendors and someone immediately spawned between my generator and wall. Had to rebuild again.
---
Moral of the story: WE NEED FAST TRAVEL MATS!
---
Wow, No wonder I sell out. I charge 10 for yellow and fluorescent, 25 / Cobalt and violet. You ain't getting my crimson though...
---
so my berkserkers explosive lever action is not a god roll? bloodied would be the better choice for it?
---
Thanks. A L3 right outside Grafton Fam not far from Morgantown Airport, so I’ll server hop those as well.
---
Now gotta find L1s.
---
Yeah I had a lvl 20 limb hurting one. Haven't seen a drill since then ofc
---
how about free delivery as well geezers
---
I am losing my shit. I cannot get into the event. I dashboard every time I go into the elevator
---
You have plague walker?
---
I sell scrip scrap 1* stuff for 50 Caps and it flys off the shelf.
---
ESO has many things 76 doesn't, yet should. I don't know how they had so much time to check out ESO features before releasing 76 and yet still have to implement many of the almost basic necessities to this day.
---
Only if you're willing to play bloodied and care about min-maxing damage. I personally find bloodied nerd rage adrenal builds to be far too boring, so I wouldn't see it as a god roll

---
Well thats a nice point you have mentioned. And for that there is a good solution, the perk preset option which could be activated both manually and using hotkeys, won't work when you are in combat and even for sometime after that.
---
go and play Morrowind, then complain about no map markers
---
I was planning to, but someone started the event and my game crashed. This patch is very crash happy for me.
---
I don't see how that's selfish they just want their workbenchs available to them all the time so in case of emergencies they can access it. I had three people use my armor workbench, weapon workbench, and chemistry station. And I needed to repair everything.
---
There's still the problem of trap rooms though. You could make it so that the player spawns in a cave for example and the only way out is through your camp. There is two solutions I think:  1. Let the player choose a spot to spawn.  2. player gets to choose if they are in a safe location after fast traveling.
---
Both would mean longer load times because the whole camp would need to be loaded completely before the character spawning (this would help already by preventing spawning inside structures). You could then cancel fast travel if you see you're about to spawn in trap room...
---
same, but in this instance i have no idea what went wrong. I guess i could've waited till it fully healed, but it did stop healing right before i killed it.
---
I second this
---
I just started 3 days ago. I'm silent because push to talk won't work :/
---
Agreed, I don't need your poop smeared spike in my feet. Dinks.
---
Yes, it's like the system tells itself you spot is occupied the same time it tells you? Shouldn't it already know that?
---
Railway rifles are the new meta and an AAE Id of bought that with only minor hesitation. People selling halloween costumes at 500 caps or 556 ammo at 4 caps a piece are the insane ones. Thousands on an explosive anything is expected.
---
This so cool.  I jsut shared the mod link with a buddy of mine who plays on PC.  This is very cool.  We really do have a great community.
---
As a melee build myself on one character, I would always go with +ss aside from those one off weapons in my inventory such as instigating. Instigating +ss is nice but can greatly benefit from +pa. I have an instigating grog with +pa &amp; I would sometimes start with a power attack, then fast swap to a bloodied +ss alternative to finish enemy off.
---
This is a good idea, however it'll causes alot of imbalances
---
Maybe bad luck. You can watch Rifle Gaming on youtube. He has nuked everything.
---
I'm just hoping that Bethesda fixes this issue soon. I hate when others take advantage of a good system.
---
I get'cha,  not that big a deal to me. But I personally close people's doors if I used them.
---
I have all mutations
---
We will be on around 2 hours from now roughly
---
So much yes!  I never understood why they opted for this change.  I also miss the backpacks certain Heavy Weapons had, like the Minigun and Gatling Laser.  It might be tough to do with Power Armor but they could probably make it work.
---
Not really running any build. I don't play that way.  I use automatic rifles though.
---
There were 8 of us yesterday in 2 groups doing a and b
---
I just starch, no one's taking this boys array of super powers! But I still make a point of subverting people's showers, for sport and on principal.
---
Oh I feel your pain. I use soooooo much steel and lead.
---
Jus fyi I think that the raider power armor core assembly not reg armor
---
Yeah I do watch his nuking experiments
---
videos.  Didnt see west-tek though
---
Nope.
---
It's not I bought it for the power armor and was pissed when I found out it was for the reg
---
Ugh I had someone send me a bunch of angry messages about my Camp because it’s in Bolton Greens and he thought it was too dangerous of a location for visitors. “I don’t have time to fight your enemies for you.” Dude, my turrets fight the Level 1 scorched for me. I’ve been there for months and am not moving because you were annoyed by my neighborhood. 
---
Right after I got all those angry messages my Camp was attacked by scorchbeasts, which is the only time I’ve ever seen them anywhere near there. I’ve always wondered if he did that somehow haha
---
Reminds me of primary school. There's always a bully somewhere looking to feel better by shitting on those weaker than him.
---
Genuine curiosity and I'm away from game today to check for myself. Is there an option to mute other players?
---
I just bought it 2 or 3 days ago. As soon as I ran out of the vault a lvl 25 came and emoted and took me on a tour, ending by leaving me at the overseers camp with a ranger outfit , a pipe pistol and a machete. First workshop I took a level 212 showed up, saw I had no idea what I was doing, defended the workshop for me then left me with a bunch of water and a heated pitchfork. Realized this game was different, and now I'm not afraid to just run up and emote at people. Lovin' it.
---
Allright thx man so i got for the build   ;)
---
This would be great the amount of times I travel to a camp and it’s someone selling hunting rifles and laser rifles such a waste of fast travel
---
I built a second room and labeled it store. Open doorways no traps or locks. Base is locked but shop always open!
---
I know right? - _- I feel you
---
Only thing that needs to be convenient for randoms is the vending machine. Ive been messaged with complaints by people who say my rad shower in the front door got rid of their rads and theyre a radiation build. And this was before vending machine, and usually when i got those messages id come back to a blown up camp.
---
I kind of agree with this as well. It's nice to have to get creative with it some times. It would also be nice though to have guidance when you're stuck so there's a balance
---
Im currently trying to rebuild to that kind of build. Im stashing points and tweaking but i think ill settle on a 
---
3-15-5-4-5-15-9 special when im done. Of course this new legacy system could derail all that. So im just stashing points til i get info on that. The main things are ap refresh and critical/sneak strikes.
---
All the people telling you that 6000 is a low price are full of shite. Don’t settle for that bs, there are some players out there who are selling good stuff at reasonable prices and you just have to be patient. Anyone selling anything at a ridiculous price will eventually learn when no one buys their crap.
---
I never had anything more dangerous than molerats and low leved scorched attack me. Beside, even if something bigger attacked, my vendor machine is set in a room with doors, the first floor of my house is not locked and has a door so, enough time for even a newbie to run and close the door then teleport away (could teleport to Cliff View, it's so close to my CAMP that it would only cost 1 cap). I did get attacked my mothman level 40 in my CAMP twice, but I feel like it's the game targeting me and not my camp since I also fough a mothman 3 more time away from my CAMP. (and it's probably a bug, I haven't heard of other people getting attacked that frequently by mothman... And still no one had a feather :/ )
---
Here’s a thought; learn to code and design your own game. No one, not even Bethesda cares what you think you’re entitled to. Have a nice day.
---
I think at one point in development there were hundreds, but at this stage only the Austin team is working on it. I know they had a bunch of open positions around January as well
---
verified.
---
It's a trap!
---
I found them up there, on the flat area above the entrance slightly to the right.  The original comment said 3 spawn, but I found 1 squirrel and 1 rabbit.  Berry Mentats helps because they highlight living creatures and the rabbits are quite small and able to blend in with the brush.
---
Lol oops
---
That would be around 4 PM EST. I can join in for around 2 hours before I would need to go. I would also be available tomorrow afternoon/night if you’ll be on then.
---
When you get on invite me:  JDBuckSavage.
---
The other day I got stuck in a floor and managed to jump out, but it crippled me. I had to use a stimpack!
---
some ass hole and his butt buddy sexually harassed my player because she was wearing just black bos under-armors, but looks can be deceiving they both died a dishonorable death from a girl no less, apparently they never heard of orbital strikes let alone 6 of them.
---
Heehee. But starching doesn’t help those folks that use radiation to keep there health really low for those Bloodied builds. But they could always remove their aqua man perk and get in the water, or French kiss a ghoul. :)
---
Hate to say it but if you dont play that way then how do expect to stand against people who do? Since the nerf of survival mode its more profitable to pvp in adventure than it is in survival. Im not trying to be a dick or anything by saying that. Its just i dont think you understand how invested people are in farming caps from players. People have very specific builds, to the point where a ghoul will 2 shot them but because of the weapons and complete armor sets they can put out ridiculous damage and be very well protected and hidden while doing it
---
You can move around your camp machine thingy to different parts inside your borders to test it out, I eventually found a spot that landed people in a decent area near my vending machines and not inside my floors lol
---
need two types, one for you, one for others
---
My understanding, although I'm way more lower level than you, is that rifle builds are generally support characters during the SBQ event. Support the heavy gunners and melee by taking out the adds. Get your shot in on the SBQ, but don't focus on her. If you're running a bloodied build, that may not apply, but it not, easily taking out the other enemies is just as useful.
---
if you build a trap camp and it does not kill me i'm gonna run around with home defense and disarm everything i can. and take down your bone chimes.
---
&gt;!sadly we cannot disarm punji boards!&lt;
---
Yeah its hard to guess, i go by the amount of items they have if its 30 plus prob outfits or junk wespons. Also I always find the player first see if they over 100 or super low, could be an alt. I agree but for the time being judge based on players lvl.
---
curious if you realize how many pips would show up on the map if this happened?
---
Additionally, there are certain things like cats that don't always spawn in a given point- it could be chickens, fireflies etc. (at least I don't know of any spots that always spawn cats)  
---
Last, just like the reaal Scouts, you don't have to do all of them to progress and they are "Challenges" which kind of implies that they are challenging
---
Chems with farma farmer and traveling pharmacy perks
---
That person could’ve easily traded it in for some scrip to get another go at their dream weapon, but instead they decided to put it up for sale so that someone who really wants it could buy it and game happily ever after. How sweet! There’s many different ways of looking at it. Yours, just a tad agressive. But if you’re just trolling, well done man. It was amusing to read!
---
For straight bloodied unarmed I would go with extra power attack. I'm running the same build and with the right cards, mutations, rads, chems, food and drink and a full set of bolstering sentinel I'm doing at least 1800 damage with my bloodied power fist before power attack is calculated in.
---
 I have yet to hit something not considered a boss (alpha's, imposter sheepsquatch, queen, etc) and it not die in one hit. Just make sure if whatever you're hitting doesn't die you don't move, and hope you don't get stunned.
---
He is not looking for power armor plans.
---
Or crapper, lol, make it extra clear. I'm just happy some people got it. &lt;3
---
I've got plenty of raider mods in my vending machine. Haven't sold any, even though I charge 10-20 per plan. :(.
---
True
---
Truth, what I did (PSA):
---
Replace your C.A.M.P. (same spot if desired) have a friend Fast Travel to your C.A.M.P. 3 - 5x, place a small potted plant (Floor Decor) in the two possible spawn points (there was only two possible spawn points for my friend.
---
Build accordingly.
---
Remove after you're done building.
---
I enjoy my new C.A.M.P. more than my previous  actually and with NO spawning issues :)
---
I hope this helps, everyone! I know it can be frustrating...
---
Shouldn't have any of that, scrap all the junk into components, weighs less
---
I’ve just got to say that I was super pleasantly surprised by your reply here tho! Everyone deserves a good rant IMO, but you got yours out and rather than escalating further you actually did a little self reflect and listening to others and dialed back rather than starting a massive salty comment war, which is so rare sometimes! I just wanted to give you a thumbs up on that, because it helps restore a wee bit of faith for me personally and I appreciate that! I hope the other player somehow gets to see this too. ✌️
---
Same here. Even fast travelling to the mine doesnt help
---
No I was looking for the PA plans and bought the plan set but I didn't know it was for the normal raider armor
---
Quickest breaking gun I have.
---
My customers are walking around on the pipes!
---
I literally just put crafting, vendor, and a few beds out, nothing more. No structures or anything more.
---
Yeah that’s true. But not only are you wasting caps fast traveling you’re also wasting time. These loading times man...
---
:|
---
Ss for one handed or unarmed. power attack for 2H to make use of the high single it dmg, also power attack for dagger to take advantage of the low ap cost. I personally don't use power attacks at all cuz run out of ap sprinting jumping and dodgey perk, but fighting SBQ or sheepsqach with 2H power armor is my alt set up.
---
It seems fairly common, both to evade melee and to permit close attacks with explosive weapons (at the top of the jump, you're far enough away from the ground to shoot it and not rofldie). Also, because it's fun to high jump around like Mario 😀
---
I'll add you and you can tag along whenever you can :) If you get more dupe plans, please sell them to me. Maybe at a discount 😂
---
And corn.
---
I one-manned the mission when nobody showed up and kept a radroach alive against a sheepsquatch, and when people do come around I usually find myself defending an entire habitat alone. As a support build who can *maybe* put out 300-400 dps for a few moments: It's not always about having the right number of players to carry your build, but rather how far can you haul everyone else's weight that matters in moments like these
---
&gt; I told him what his mother and I partook in last night.

Username checks out!
---
Hey you wouldn’t happen to be on Xbox would you? I’ve only got marsupial, but I’d love to try to get some others crafted for me or something since I sure can’t afford the actual recipes! I’d be willing to do caps or trade if you do!
---
Fast-travelled to a guy's base today looking for cheap stimpaks, but the spawn point was in the middle of a locked garden surrounded by walls two stories high.
---
I just replied to someone's post about knowing if they have Legendaries or not, i said i always look for the player to find their lvl. Thanks for suggesting the perfect fix lol
---
That’s a cool idea! I just tried to put my camp pretty far from the vault so I could at least cross the map somewhat cheaper, but this would help a ton!
---
Agree. I look for the player on the map now to find out their level. They should also have a legendary tab showing us how many legendaries theyre selling. Tired of seeing 30 weapons/armors and its no star pool cues and 10mm pistols or clown outfits.
---
What time is the daily resets?
---
except they are not "missions" or "quests"- they are challenges (and a fair amount overlap with daily challenges)- these won't ever be "updated" to show locations  
---
if you want the backpack, just do 3 of the easiest ones- swimming, athletics, archery and/or hunting
---
(just search on here on make them even less challenging)
---
Lol not sure I'd like that
---
Lol, fair enuff. I have Adrenal, but it's more of a failsafe than a tactic 4 me.
---
20hrs from your first vendor purchase or sale of the day
---
Why not just have a unified daily reset? Jesus christ this game.
---
Spawning into someone’s camp would give me all kinds of anxiety! It’s stupid I know but I feel weird going into someone else’s camp while they’re away, like some kind of snoop or something! Even knowing that people leave them unlocked for that purpose, I can’t help but feel weird about it.
---
Berserker kind of sucks since for a bloodied build youd need high damage resistance in order to survive with below 20% health in order for nerd rage to work. Usually berserker effect is seen as low tier
---
 Thanks! I have never used my team perks as of yet I'll see you in the wasteland!!
---
Me too. If I’m going down, I’m opening a can of whoopass on my way. 😀
---
The iron throne?
---
I agree with this, I've met some great friendly people in my 3 weeks of playing but ive come across some absolute idiots recently on xbox. 2 guys yesterday both level 190ish just started shooting everything they had at me, running upto me and hitting me with melee weapons, closing doors on me. Seriously complete pricks. I was in abbies bunker just doing the quest line lol. They must of wasted shit loads of ammo, I just don't get why lol do they really think I'd shoot back? I just completed what I was doing and logged out. 
---
If I was taking a workshop and I got killed then fair enough, it's happened to me loads of times by high level players one shotting me. But that's a pvp part of adventure mode so fair game I guess.
---
I'm not one of these guys though, I'll help people and enjoy the community.
---
By the way I am very supportive of the Two Shot effect nerf as it made weapons overwhelmingly overpowered and lessened the value of other legendary effects, but I feel the 1.25x dmg multiplier is not worth the accuracy debuff on weapons, and makes it useless in most scenarios.
---
What iron throne? There is no iron throne anymore.
---
I do the same i want over 75 or under lvl 10 vendors. Low lvls have a chance to be mules. Everyone between 10-74 is usually selling very common stuff. Its flawed logic as ive seen lvl 200+ selling nothing but junk but i stand by my method.
---
In Flatwoods, by the armour bench near the church, there's 2 plan spawns that have a chance to be Raider Armour/Mods.

You sound low level. Take over a workshop with aluminum ore and let it run a little while. You will have plenty.  Because trust me aluminum is not that rare.

Because adding new features isn't as easy as dragging and dropping programming in from one game to the other and Fallout 76 isn't trying to be ESO.
---
Awesome ! I'll add you , can't play now tho, family time with the kids :)
---
Except people do buy it. Hell, OP himself admitted to trying to buy something for that price.
---
I'm ok with no NPCs, what I really hate is all the "automated alerts" tied to all the events. it'd be far less silly to me if one of our missions was to repair a radio tower so instead of these ridiculous sentient "recordings" we'd actually be hearing somebody over a com system walking us through the events.
---
I find my self doing the same trying to hunt down the owner but it gets to be a pain after a while . I agree there should be a ledgendary catagory separate from the normal so we don't waist our time.
---
You only pay 500 for 3 star weapons? Good luck getting anything good man.  I sell most of my 3 stars in the 2-3k range (assuming they have good perks) and they sell at that price consistently.  You can earn 1400 caps a day easy without much effort so a few days of earning caps to get a dream weapon isn’t that big of a deal. 
---
You can go to your grocery store to buy orange juice and it’s $4.50, next door at CVS the exact same orange juice could be $2.50, that’s how a free market works. If you don’t like the prices, move on to the next vendor. Without a global market board to see what the avg selling price of an item is, it’s hard to place a value on a good item. Value is in the eye of the beholder.
---
Jokers? Where people chose to place their camp now makes them a dick is what im hearing.
---
Selling marine wetsuit helmets. I used to love using the Pharma Farmer perk to sell combat chems and to dilute/sell whatever else I can find, but just... 30 caps for a helmet, I can clear out a vendor with one trip to Watoga High for plastic and glass as long as I keep my rubber stock up
---
I had a fully decked out house that I made flush to the ground. Full access to everything and had my vendys inside as well as a trader's window where I could sell more specific items people sought out here. People began leaving my door open so often I would regularly come home to destroyed equipment (my f***ing decontamination shower waaay too many times!) So unfortunately, I have now made an item shop of my own that houses my vendys and have locked my doors to the public unless I'm currently home. Leave that door open, sucks for them. But no more flux hunting to fix my shower at least

Awesome thanks!!
---
HELL. YES. :D
---
I’ve got my generator on the roof with a wee roof over it and walls on 2 sides and it has remained fairly safe so far. The only time it needed repair was after a scorchbeast attack. Would something like that work at yours as well?
---
The having to wait for thing sucks. Did a whitespring run. Ghouls come at you fast. Found about 5 legendaries, none had any star rankings, all dropped 1 star. Also some 1 star stuff without the ghoul being called legendary at all. Also some would not"wake up" . Sat around 1 for a full minute, didn't get up, never registered a star, killed had an immediate 1 star drop.
---
Once I arrived unknowingly at the tail end of the campfire event. Within 15 seconds something hit me from behind. I immediately turned around and one swiped the wendingo. I truly did not plan that. A player came up and hit me and it dawned on me what happened. I grabbed the loot and ran away with my tail between my legs. Do people do this on purpose? I'm sure. Just not always.
---
No need to be animals about it, just send them a [Formal Complaint](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Formal_complaint). That's what I do.
---
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤮
---
You're welcome.  Clown gang gives, and clown gang taketh away.
---
I am on xbox. GT is the same as my user name, and I have all the ones I listed sitting in my vending machine for 250 each.
---
Be the change you want to see. Drop a nuke. Only takes like 15 minutes. I dropped a few nukes on the Toxic Valley this week for farming. Lots of cobalt flux and plenty of enemies, plus it's a nice change of pace from the constant WS/SBQ grind.
---
They do this to farm caps.
---
And I LOVE CORN SOUP.... and I am a halfway decent friend.... I think.
---
Fast travel mats should work for yourself but with limitations on placement to avoid exploits from the B.E.T.A. (like can only place on floor tiles or something).
---
Visitors should have their own "visitor spawn" that is always just outside the green/glowing ring of your camp boundaries. It should rotate with the boundary ring when you move your C.A.M.P. module, but not be placeable in water or off cliffs.
---
/just my $0.02
---
It's a lot more than just those 5 fields. You have to consider that it also has to track condition for every weapon, food, and armor.  For weapons and armor it has to track which mods apply to it.  It has to track who the owner is for the item, where the items current location is. 
---
I'm sure there's a lot of other fields that they feel are relevant.  Sure it might sound easy if you are thinking of just stackable items like junk, but once you start throwing all the other items in the game in there with all the stupid little details that need to be tracked, it gets more complex than 5 fields
---
6K is cheap for a dream weapon. That’s 4-5 days of earning caps for something that you probably have a 1/500 chance at getting it you rely on RNG.
---
Yeah i got like 2k
---
I have mine on a third floor in a fully covered and locked room.
---
Couldnt you put a pressure plate on that switch and put it to the side? I guess putting it to the side is the issue for most.
---
How do you know it's not?
---
you can reduce it in some weapons with accuracy bonuses, like Stabilized for the .50 cal, also Aiming down sights on many weapons reduces or nullifies the spread
---
We need a shitposting subreddit for these types of posts...
---
Damn maybe I should switch to console..
---
Some people are just the worst kind of pathetic. Oy.
---
Apparently if you reload while sneaking, or swap weapons back and forth, the primary effect works fine. It’s only after reloading. I don’t know if “natural” reload works, but I know manual reloading doesn’t.
---
That’s beautiful.
---
I think 1 cap per bullet is the standard, for normal rounds. For 5mm, 50cal and most energy weapons it's usually more. 
---
I usually still toss missiles, etc I pick up in suitcases near train stations. No one seems to take them even when I have them up for free.
---
In general what I've seen is about 300 caps for 1star legendaries, 600 to 1000 for 2 star, 1000 and up for 3 star. Just as far as guidelines go. 
---
If something at my place doesn't sell, I cut it's price by half after about a week, or sell it for scrip.
---
thank you SO much
---
That is good to know! I was debating hopping into survival but my character is only about a level 56. 
---
I have a decent 5.56 2 shot explosive and ultracite PA but that is really about it. Im nervous because I have never messed with mutations and I feel like I will get wrecked in PVP lol
---
the flatwoods monster is an alien, actual aliens are not in the game (yet, as far as i know)
---
Havent found this yet. Very odd, maybe they shouldve had a longer BETA?
---
What ones would you recommend for pvp?
---
Rapin everybody out here! Hide yo kids! Hide yo wife!
---
Yeah, missing Grafton Dam myself.
---
Tried on 5 alts to trigger it, and nothing.
---
I think it's been an issue since launch (since December, at least), and it's still not been fixed.
---
Hopefully, they'll get around to it.
---
yeah true, i still think the accuracy should be changed though because while that's true for two shot rifles (ADS nullifying spread), for heavy guns outside PA and shotguns the ads accuracy is still horrific. It is still pretty bad in PA when using say a two shot 50 cal.
---
I had the same problem. Put your camp on an iron ore node and be patient. Today I started selling bulk steel I've got so much.
---
It's the future .... Elon Musk can launch sattelites for space internet but we can't be friends cross platform... There is no god..
---
My generators and crops consistently get destroyed when I’m not at my camp for some odd reason. I’m in a low level area that doesn’t have a lot of enemies.
---
Oh but then why are they separate
---
Ah damn, someone beat me to it. Yup, Flatwoods monster is the only alien so far.
---
Red dress
---
Why are they separate
---
Cry me a river. Play the game. Enjoy it. Stop bellyaching about how life is not fair.
---
true, when i used to use a two shot .50 cal i normally fired when standing still, ADS and running Stabilized to make the accuracy as good as possible. switched to a vampire's explosive one due to more accuracy and heath steal
---
Would be nice I think there is like 100 atom that I can't get due to this bug.
---
I sexually Identify as an unoriginal joke. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of surfing reddit dropping shitposts and derailing actual conversation. People say to me that this has been really going on for far too long and and it trivialises gender identity but I don’t care, I'm a massive asshole. I’m having a plastic surgeon install a mountain dew dispenser, a catheter and and a poop shoot on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Logical Gamer” and respect my right to freeze peach. If you can’t accept me you’re a god damn tumblirina sjw cultural marxist liberal and you triggered lol?. Thank you for being so understanding.
---
Should we just collectively make Elon Musk the CEO of every major tech company? It would speed up advancement like 400 fold...by 2040 we could be living in 3030.
---
that's a bad habit i have, i tend to still move forward when firing auto weapons ADS, i gotta stop that cause i think that ruins my accuracy
---
Maybe a (once per day limited) option to buy a certain amount of scrip for, say, 20k caps?
---
Maybe 50 scrip for 20k?  
---
Then high-end players could potentially get 100 scrip per day?
---
Or is that not a good exchange rate?
---
yeah I think it was in Fallout 3, and he was the size of a small dog, but still as powerfull as a full grown deathclaw
---
Pipes?
---
wasn't talking about Bethesda was talking about other players.
---
My advice would be to check out full auto. I was semi auto and swapping to full auto like night and day. I can now visibility see the sbq health bar dropping when I unload on her.
---
My build if interested: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f574c8&amp;d=lt2l71ar2an2a04c72ek1ph2pp2pi2ck0cu0eh2pg2p02s01sg2ao0l12ic3&amp;w=a12li2a51&amp;n=Currently&amp;m=28cf

If you have a friend to play with you can both complete this challenge in a matter of minutes while at each other's camps. Go to your friend's camp and have him lock his personal terminal with a level 0 lock. Hack 3 times. Have him increase the lock level by one point and repeat as needed.
---
Now, go to your camp and do the same thing for him. BAM! Hacking challenge solved without having to travel all over Appalachia.

So I realize there are less Possum challenges (\~14 or so) than there are things you can buy from the Possum vending machine (&gt;50 badges required for one of each). Are there other reliable methods for obtaining Possum badges, or can you only get s subset of the items from the vending machine?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Just be prepared then that for some buyers that will turn them off and you might lose sales.
---
XD WTF
---
The more alive the better chances of better stuff. But only one is needed alive to get some chance. It's just like the Free Range event.
---
Well 4-8 hrs a day definitely is too much.
---
May just be needing better gear and weapons. Three top builds for most part some type of bloodied, with melee and rifle topping that, then stealth sniper, then heavy, usually the popular builds.. 
---
I have 3 characters i run.. 260 stealth rifle, 130 melee, and a 70 pistol. My stealth rifle can solo pretty much anything except for like the queen (imposter sq) due to adds and time. Most stuff she meets she 1 shots.. lvl 90 deathclaw or sheepsquatch takes a bit more ammo and high ground but easily solo'd, and flying scorchbeasts arent an issue.
---
It's lag.
---
The order things load when you go to a new area (not just fast travel, but any time you travel into a new 'block' of the world) is a bit...interesting.  There are static items and encounters, but some of them can be used/killed/taken before you get there.  The server first tells your game 'hey, there's always a spawn here', then later on in the load order the game determines if anyone has already taken/killed it.
---
So from your point of view, things load in, and then later things change the state that they're in - items show up, then disappear, or they spawn in and die.
---
Not much you can do about it except get a super fast (and low latency) internet connection and also get on a server that isn't overloaded.  Good luck with that :P
---
Is that why people like my 5mm?  I only charged a cap. And honestly for 5 mm it shouldn't be more, even the game vendors who charge ICHC more for most ammo only want 2 per for 5mm.
---
It happens. Kind of stupid when it does because they end up having jack shit and being low level
---
This was posted 30 mins ago, you still there?
---
Turn what off my lights? I don't even care that much about caps even I play the game to have fun. I just want to come back to my camp and relax.
---
Yes! Still on my server! Right out front on Whitesprings entrance
---
What do you mean by that? I've never been aware of any silo glitch, I've always just run through it.
---
Happened to me once near the lake near Pleasant Valley Train Station and the first time was at the billboard above 98 NAR Regional
---
STNG! Take my upvote.  Oh yeah. Nipple 😂
---
Tried that. Had one machine only running 1 wire from it to a 3 power generator
---
Wild Guess: Because they might (no proof) be adding different "Variants" of aliens in future content?
---
The Flatwoods Monster resembles a Zetan, but it's clearly different to the one(s) in FO3/FO4.
---
For what it's worth, the Flatwoods monster (still?) doesn't count for the Photo Challenge of an Alien, for Coding/Naming reasons.
---
I launch a couple every time I'm on.
---
Nixle clock? It was in the Atom shop for free a few months ago.
---
Atomic clock?  Find it in atom shop
---
That mutation makes it so hard to milk (or even be near) my brahmin.
---
Are you me?
---
Cool, I'll jump in.
---
Sweet.
---
How about completely fire proof so I can put it on and jump into the fissure site to retrieve my dropped junk
---
I feel it's the drawback for em, I got the beam splitter on my tse laser and I'd need at least 3 improved repair kits for a queen fight, and that's with 3 ranks of gunsmith equipped
---
Let us load holotapes into the Jukebox!
---
I want to play the meditation one while people shop!
---
If you ask me, then I guess not, cause bugs will be fixed over time by developers themselves, but not adding new content for a while, has the risk of player decrease.
---
Yeah just got the backpack with one alive !!!!:)
---
Yeah sometimes 200+ 300+ don't care about selling besides getting rid of junk and ammo. This just adds to the RNG lol finding good stores. Try to friend the good stores
---
What scout value do you have remaining? The criteria to finish this quests aren't exactly quests that will pop up with markers because Growth is tied to challenges, and it's up to you which challenges you take on first... If you won't try until they add markers you will be waiting forever
---
Maybe I guess. I've jumped into a lot of people camps in the last week and that was just a trend I noticed. At least on PC. 
---
I've just been looking for plasma cartridges, and 2mm for my gauss rifle. Very few people seem to have those.
---
I’ve taken a FO76 break to play days gone but this sounds hilarious to me. I wouldn’t be mad.
---
Was it really the King?
---
'Cause the way you're posing, it looks like you've, uh, got something "stuck" in the machine. 
---
Ouch.
---
Always swing speed - do more damage faster and if you power attack that gives your enemy extra seconds to hit you/interrupt the power attack
---
you should probably stay off the market subreddits if that upsets you.  anything with an explosive effect can sell for several thousand caps.  finding those effects on a handmade may be 50k caps, or unobtainable with caps and only up for trade with other top end items.
---
its too bad but its the way she goes.
---
How do you get the wire from the generator out to the rest of your CAMP if it's in a shed? I initially built a little shack around my junk extractor but had to scrap the idea when I couldn't find a way to get the power wire to go through a window.
---
I get the same crap trying to wall off my fusion generator at thunder mtn. Always breaks the seams on walls in 2 places
---
Same here, still gotta really test out Big Bertha, bought her off a player vendor for 1,500, she's a TS Fat Man with 90% reduced weight and +33% VATS hit chance accuracy.
---
the fireman variants.
---
Just leave without buying anything. If there's enough people that stop by their camp without buying anything, they'll likely realize that their prices are a bit too high for people and lower them.
---
Outside of that, maybe instead of insulting them, you could try haggling a bit. A lot of people are pretty reasonable and flexible with prices if you just ask if you can pay them 4k instead of 6k. If they won't budge, then just walk away. At the end of the day, it still belongs to them, they are well within their right to set prices how they want, and throwing what amounts to a hissyfit will ensure that they will never want to do business with you. Hence why the guy replied with an increased price of 20k.
---
What's really terrible is the jerkwads who go and kill all those frogs in the whitespring pool.. Why?  Just why?
---
Almost certain that it won't be able to be fixed without a patch, so keep an eye out on Tuesdays for that.
---
Dude!
---
I rename mine with a tilde (~) prefix to put them at the bottom of my inventory. I also have a lightweight item that's just all dashes that I use as a separator. This keeps valuable items safe as long as I'm sorted alphabetically.
---
Where is the best place to find him?
---
Is the level of the crafted armor relevant? Or can I just craft low lvl light combat arms without compromising the mod farm?
---
Same here!!
---
the reload while sneaking thing only works if ur completely hidden
---
Nice! Did you die?
---
I dealt with the water closet/bathroom issue. I have two Porta potties outside. Gotta go? There you go.
---
On the downside I don't have a bathroom in my house so they're also for my use. But at least I don't have you filthy animals dirtying up my house.
---
After the purveyor surfaced the drop rate of good legendaries took a nosedive. WS is your best bet.
---
I'll carry you through and give you step by step instructions via the mic if you haven't done it by 9-10pm EST c: 
---
PSN: CatPurrito
---
Ya just I really want some wwr. I only use lever actions and there is no weight reduction perks for rifles, everything else just not rifles. 😓
---
I've been saying this for years!! If apple, Google, and Tesla all worked together we'd have teleportation and warp speed by now.  Totally agree . Because of Elon I might actually get to travel to space in my lifetime.
---
I'm trying that now and it seems to be working. I'll keep you posted.
---
Great points. 
---
NO NPCs
---
Maybe I should clarify. When I say no NPCs i mean human NPCs yes the robots are very human like but in the end they're not. Idk about you but to me a robot just isn't compelling. I just can't bring myself to care about AI the same as I could for a human (Grahm is ok but still not human). I always thought the point of human NPCs was to show the player what it was like for the average person living in the wasteland. I can imagine what the struggle of the commonwealth was by seeing most humans living as poor farmers and a shanty town in an old baseball stadium being the pinnacle of society. I just can't get that from robots and most of the time seeing how "human" they act often turns me off from them. In FO4, FO3, FONV and so on you would rarely see a human NPC doing the things your character was doing because it honestly wasn't worth it. There were far more "safer" (relatively speaking) ways to survive. The way 76 is set up and when it takes place in the timeline just makes more sense that humans (AKA us) have to survive the way we are right now. And again I think they're going to bring in human NPCs eventually and I think that will just add to the game if they explain it properly. 
---
DLC and Endless opportunities 
---
This may be just a difference of opinion (and I respect yours) but I have mixed opinions on where you're coming from with Wild Appalachia. Ok bethesda released a game that could have used more time in development. We know that and acknowledge it but there is no going back there is no changing the past. So saying it should have been released at launch does nothing. We have it now and we have it for free. And I think the drip feed added soo much to the community aspect of the game. Sheepsquatch, for example was a huge topic in the community. Waiting for it to actually show. Random encounter hints that it was coming, a huge quest line that ended in us fighting something that was not the sheepsquatch to us one day randomly getting a new event that released it into the wild. I don't think you could have gotten that same experience offline. If they would have done dlc like this offline it would have been annoying (imagine only being able to play nuka world or old world blues in portions). It was the community aspect that made WA so fun. Waiting together, speculating together, it really felt like we were all in it together (that may just be me though). 
---
CAMPs
---
I think our camps are us rebuilding America. Sense player vending (yet another thing that was implemented that enhanced QOL) I have been able to see soo many different CAMPs I have seen farms, bars, clinics, gas stations, gun stores, so many things that players have created that makes every dive into Appalachia somewhat unique. Is it as in depth as permanently changing a portion of the map. No. And I would love to see them expand on this idea and they've shown that they can expand on CAMPs. Hopefully private servers do become a thing and then you'll be able to see that dream come to fruition. But until then you gotta deal with a constantly changing Appalachia. 
---
I see where you're coming from and as a longtime fan of Bethesda I know that they were capable of better. But look how far the game has come, it at least shows me they're trying. Are they fucking up every now and then along the way yeah (coughs repair kits) but i honestly think they're trying to turn the game around and succeeding at it. As far as the story goes I like it. Its not the best compared to other FO titles like NV or the original two , but its still what I think to be an interesting story.
---
Yeah we need CBE.
---
Mine worked no problem today. Try reloading the camera. I sometimes have issues with it, reloading usually fixes it
---
No they are both primary effects unfortunately
---
That's a lot of faith in your defense, teach me your secrets
---
What do you need coal for?
---
It’s prob the “other” mothman, not the friendly one.
---
If you decide which player has better stuff based on their level then I have to say you are wrong, once I saw a level 10 who had vendors with 3 star level+30 items. The better idea is to see a legendary item Mark on the vendor Mark on the map so that it will let you know whether if a player has a legendary item or not
---
Yeah I definitely tried that.  Can I ask which uniform and hat you were wearing?
---
Yep, that's what I was about to say. Fallout 76 is probably the first Bethesda Fallout/TES game where I WANT a follower. Because I would like to have someone that have more to say about the world than just a few repetitive sentances. I mean hell in general most robots in Fallout are more sassy than people, and that is fun.
---
Yeah, I'm missing that moment when you enter a place and someone comments "Is the cleaning robo broken?" or "Who lived here? Super Mutants?" and things like that.
---
Recently I was "ambushed" by the Mr Handy robber. I was amused by his politeness and how he was pleased when I dropped 5 prewar money at him. I'm THAT desperate for NPC that does more than giving you clues and missions and actually do and say something unexpected.
---
CBBE on here would be amazing lol
---
Queen of the Hunt(?) Daily has a chance to spawn any Cryptid at random.
---
I've found 1 by the overseers camp, in 600+ hours...
---
It's a random spawn, but apparently there are set locations for Cryptid Spawns (even if it's random what appears).
---
No faith. If something happens I travel back.
---
Sounds good, I'm 5 hours ahead tho (GMT) so we'll see hahah
---
Omg I love you.
---
What’s your GT?
---
So once you "break the effect" by reloading while standing the effect stops working. Reloading while sneaking will not "fix" it. Only swapping weapons will fix it. Reloading while sneaking will only keep the effect working.
---
95
---
Oh wow
---
the weathered versions worked for me last time. Not the white hat though.
---
I actually just gave it away to a person that came to my camp that built some armor for a lower level and heard them via open mic... both sounded pretty cool. 
---
He had the cowboy look and I asked if he had a lever action to go with his theme. He said he’s been watching out for one but all have been too pricey... I said hold one...
---
Canceled it out of the vendor and dropped it down with 500 ammo... said - here you go! 
---
Another player had the whole trapper deal going, pretty cool keeping up with the theme... he asked if I could deep pocket a few pieces of armor for him, I said yes and he dropped it too me. 
---
All non legendary... when I gave it back he had a 3* chest and arm 2* the rest... he’s like, I think you dropped the wrong stuff... I said nope, it’s an upgrade for ya, your old stuff is there to scrap.
---
The items weren’t selling so I just gave them away. 
---
Why? I’ve met a lot of great peeps out in the wasteland and I’ve seen many pay it forward making it a better game overall. 
---
If I don’t use it and it’s not selling, why not give it to someone who will?
---
Yea I was wondering if the pieces needed to match
---
The thing is, you probably use Power Attacks and you just don't know it.  If you are in the middle of sprinting when you start your attack, that counts as a Power Attack.
---
Its all down to money. They want to capitalize as much as they can on each small improvement, and that's where Elon  trumps them all. He just goes for it.  Apple is the worst of them all. Always pushing out 3 to 5 year old tech while charging a premium....  I mean they do it well, with great marketing. But come on by the time they implement tech its usually matured and stable so yeah of course it works well.
---
Be cool if the same music on the radio could play in the jukebox instead...
---
Punjistick is one with the punji boards
---
200% repair damage boost already fixed. drills are trash again
---
I went with high cap and lead lined, I have a bloodied build and need to control my rads when going toe to toe with ghouls so lead lined offers me a degree of protection which keeps me alive a lot more, I then swap to high cap when collecting junk.
---
we already have busty mods
---
Saddest thing is between all those companies money isn't an issue for any of them lol
---
So your whole point is that your way of running a vending business is better for you but you fully accept that its making your business fail?
---
Wow
---
That's the point. They can't be legendary, but Scorchbeast queen can drop it instead of legendary
---
That’s a shame :(
---
It was in the last three also.  I would always run into feral that would slide across the ground and wouldn't die
---
Generally, swing speed is better, but it kind of depends on how often you fight things that take more than a couple hits to kill, like the Scorchbeast Queen.  Simply sprinting toward an enemy as you begin your attack counts as a Power Attack and confers that big 40% damage bonus.
---
HE IS A HACKER
---
nah but I have found several in boxes there. I put the first one in my vendor at what I thought was a foolish price so I wouldn’t scrap it by mistake but someone bought it.  
---
I want to say I found most on the second floor.
---
Probably some shadow nerf of bloodied ranged weapons, which I have posted a couple of months ago. Just looked at my heavy weapons that I have both B and non-B versions, the damage output are the same, Gatling, LMG and 50 cal. this is when my health is around 30, at this point Bloodied should have significantly higher damage. Nope bloodied is no different than a non legendary unless it’s also explosive.
---
Player lvl should be on camp after name when you hover over it.
---
There are multiple Zetan enemy variants in the official fo76 guide book including their ranks such as "star admiral", I'd call that pretty damn confirmed. Not sure why people are acting like it's just a theory or possiblity when Bethesda has it in writing for us already.
---
fwiw, I've watched multiple mobs, even cockroaches climb stairs and open doors.
---
There's a build that was going around that once you got below a certain health, you wouldn't take damage. I've been a victim of a dude who even though I pegged him with 2 full mags of my explosive, two shot Handmade and once he got below a quarter health, he took no damage and one shorted me. Tried again with a TSE the Dragon and nothing.
---
Killed him yesterday while fighting the SBQ
---
Actually, in my mind, the whole of 76 is a GECK simulation we are trapped in, so cannon really doesn't matter. We don't really know what year we are officially in. It's just the easiest way for me to cope with the inconsistencies lol. That explains the lack of NPCs and the heavy robot population and the non connon monsters which show up, the cryptids and everything. We are all in the matrix.
---
I agree with the accuracy at long rang sucks, atedium and short u don't have an issue. I run the action hero and another generic 2 shot 50 cal. Only use them in queen fights. So maybe I missing something idk. But I find that the current way it is now works fine
---
I found out the dmg resets each time i reload and my Gatling has +250 dmg resistance while reloading. Some guy said it might have something to do with that
---
I think there’s a two week gap between the end of wild Appalachia and nuclear winter so I’m hoping that’s when they do the heavy bug fixes
---
Whats a tourist for?
---
I never said this, but ok.  
---
I'm saying they could've learned something from it over all this time span. And of course it's not trying to be ESO, since it's called Fallout 76. I mean that some things are pretty much mandatory in an online gather/craft game. Things 76 still doesn't have.
---
No fraternity that I know, though there are multiple Discord servers for players. One shotting build example. Bloodied weapon, Adrenal reaction mutation, Nerd Rage and max weapon damage perks + Bloody Mess perk. Then keep your health below 20%. Pop in chems and food and You will be doing 10-15 times Basic damage.
---
A hundred people isn't really a *huge* development team. That's less than the Overwatch team, and there are *still* certain bugs in that from launch.
---
Jokes on anyone trying to talk to me, I play without the sound on
---
i know i was trying to make a funny. lol
---
Stealth is the PvP Meta right now.
---
How much do yer charge for fusion cores? Also is there a good fallout 76 discord
---
Guys he's not a hacker he has a a full set of sentinal

Just talk3ed about this in another thread. I just throw it off that we are all in a GECK simulation, living in the matrix. No lore inconsistencies matter at that point. The lack of NPCs makes sense, cryptids make sense. Almost anything can make sense. It helps me accept the absurd and whatever else might come.
---
What is the new backpack?
---
"911, where's the problem?"
---
"There are voices under my floor....and they're giving me angry emotes!"
---
Reload as in reverting back to non-bloodied level?
---
Combat armor mods
---
Maybe mental problem?
---
Already swung by and got it.  Can we give karma on this reddit?
---
Different time zones; by being character based it allows everyone to essentially 'recap' when they're on, as opposed to waiting till midnight, noon, 6pm, 3am..... that would get very frustrating.
---
So people have been able to recreate this? Because I badly want to recreate this.
---
I got this 2 stories up in their air in an open field where there was literally nothing.
---
Ha ha! I didn’t see you! Awesome!!
---
"what? I DIDNT EAT ANY CORN!"
---
Oh damn I jus baught it a learned it but cannot see where to build at armor station I looked in all categories but didnt see. I'll check again when I'm home. I may start with power armor soon as of now i use reg armor with dif legendary fx.
---
I should make the world's tallest egg stack
---
Some kind of and advance party type storyline, maybe with a small new area would be amazing. Potential new high level (100+) content?
---
Each time i reload the dmg goes from 400-500 down to 200
---
The arktos backpack. It’s like teal with a wolf logo
---
What do you have? I have a TSE reduced weight double barrel that I'll trade you straight up for a TSE reduced weight combat shotty.
---
The camera in the game
---
Then when you start shooting will it jump back up?
---
1.) 99% The body or meatbag teleports back to where the mob spawned. You can find it if you look hard enough. Yes it needs to be fixed. 
---
2) Go back in 2 or 3 mins and look. A lot of times it just takes a while for the legendary to show. and Yes sometimes they still dont. Also needs to be fixed.
---
Now this is good stuff right here. I salute you sir!
---
No i need to unequip it first
---
Fastly.....define that? Lmao
---
Did you watch the video? I hit him with a full clip with a gamma gun.
---
Thanks that’s obviously a bug.
---
Thank you for that info omg
---
Just to co-opt this - is there any place that sells ROBOT armor plans?  I see the mods sporadically.
---
I suggested a long ass time ago that the land on the other side if the river on the left side of the map be used as an invasion from for Zetans. With Zetans and never before seen Zetan creatures but I got mixed reviews. Seems people would rather all that land go unused.
---
https://youtu.be/sL8H8xA8fNI
---
Hmm that sounds right, didnt realize it was an atom shop item. I go through there every few days and havent seen it so it must of been a limited time item
---
There are bugs in the game that date back to at least Oblivion, if not Morrowind. Which contrary to popular belief isn't an issue with the engine. It's the scripting that BGS uses for their games. It has the upside of being very simple to work with, but it generates bizarre behaviors in games. Where some bugs can be fringe cases of certain combinations of in game script updates that can be basically impossible to replicate. Which is why bugs dating back over a decade in Bethesda Game Studios games.
---
Must of missed it, thanks
---
only six tasks? try the oppossum challenges with other translations which Bethesda messed up in the recent patch, it's fun! :)
---
"stabilized long barrel", "reflex sight" or even "drum magazin"....I know exactly what to do!
---
Raider vendors should sell mods for robot armor, but robot armor plans? No idea sorry.
---
Yeah obviously. But how long do i need to wait until it's fixed. Since not many people seem to have this issue it'll probably never get fixed
---
Put the rad shower on a pressure plate, it can't be left on then!
---
Yeah id also like to know if theres a subreddit for character builds and such and im kinda hoping they would add more apparel to the game not the atom store, something that could be grindable to everybody without real money
---
There are bugs in other badges. On top of my head, in the Photograph badge; you're asked to take a photograph of a secondary station, but there is absolutely nothing to take in picture. I tried a few times and got nothing. From far away, stickning my camera on all machinery, nothing.Taking a picture of a scorchbeast didn't worked too. I snapped pics of a dead one, and a live one to be sure. Doesn't work.
---
I think it's on a different badge but taking a pic of a mirelurk queen didnt registered too.
---
Interestingly enough, the process of developing new content can lead to bug fixes.
---
On the other side of that coin... Fixing one bug in a lot of cases can cause far worse bugs to happen.
---
Had put fusion cores for 1/4th the price but no one has bought them yet.. Unique apparels sell the most for me...
---
I'm not sure but it's probably around 30%+ dmg
---
I did a steel farming run through the raider arena/vending area of ToTW earlier this afternoon,  Picked up several plans and mods for robot armor while I was at it.
---
Which bugs?
---
How do you do this? I’ve tried dropping things and also searching for them in the build menu and can’t seem to figure it out?
---
I would estimate his health at 67% the video is there.
---
As a camp lover, I'd still just go to their camp anyways. 75% of the time I don't buy anything, and 80% of the time I forget to put my barter perks and Travel Agent on.
---
A counter to TSE weapons, and a reason to use power armor in pvp...interesting
---
Well, there's other stuff to do for the last couple of months. Nukes used to be the only endgame available.
---
As far as lore goes the BoS is the only thing that I have issues swallowing. The cryptids were all mostly FEV experiments so im ok with that (though I hope next fo game we can give FEV a break) The no NPCs makes sense to me as humans were holding on by thread even before the scorched arrived. I'm also hoping an update will add NPCs who knows maybe free states members were able to escape into bunkers. Or maybe we'll run into people who fled Appalachia but returned because the other wastelands proved to hostile. I can suspend my belief a bit. I just hope the backlash that happened in regards to some of their retcons will have taught Bethesda to at least be careful when it comes to factions in the future.
---
I'm saving the 2mm for when I'll found a Gauss rifle. It's maybe the only heavy weapon I like (in FAllout 4). But so far I didn't got any luck finding it. Maybe they aren't in the wild?
---
This was probaly a great message but all I can remember is "fat traveled out.", in the last sentence.
---
I think new players are responsible for the fusion cores on that list tbh. 
---
I charge whatever the fusion core charges and they sell gooood as you need flux to make them. But ofc if you know the places to farm them it’s no prob
---
Will they spoil at all while in my stash?
---
Either he spam radaway or he has sentinal bos which has radiation resistance
---
Yea I noticed this a couple of months ago, just checked the numbers this morning and apparently it’s still not yet fixed. Many people use bloodied but simply don’t know. If I didn’t happen to have B and non B side by side, I would never have noticed.
---
Yes fix the seperate series of bugs for both modes please!!!
---
LOLZ. I’m usually pretty good about going back and proofreading typos but I literally wrote that one while walking the dog and got distracted. Thanks for the laugh.
---
Everyone hates loading screens but those lowbies feel they worked pretty hard for that hinting rifle they aren't high enough level to use or don't realize the (lack of) value of their hard won gains or just want people to come look at their cool camp...maybe run over next time, said e on fast travel fees, see part of the map you haven't been to in a while and we won't have to read twenty posts whining about others vending machines.
---
That's a very good point! Still SS plus martial arts is godly on unarmed and swords. I guess i would say i prioritize SS becuz its used more consistently used and power attack is situational. Both are good though very good point
---
Mine were  both weathered, buddies were pink or red hat and weathered outfit
---
That certainly would help to balance pvp better.
---
Yes....100% worth it
---
Watch the video 10:20 before you comment some bs there is no way he was doing either of those things.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Really? It's hard not to notice. First 5 min with this gun and i realized somethings wrong. Because i farm west tek a lot and 500 dmg per shot should kill the supermutants in max 2 shots but due to the bug it takes about 4 shots
---
If you’re on PS4 I could come place one for you?
---
i have rad ants problem, i'll not remove them from my stairs, otherwise they'll kill my turrets
---
Cus it's not in the game and some people aren't like u
---
Bloodied 1* automatic combat rifle should one-shot most mutants on proper build, and it does that much more frequently than black powder guns
---
Great idea but wouldn't fit in the little box I think. Typical forms of emphasis like bolding/asterisks/etc would work just as well as long as people knew what it represented.
---
But that's only like 50 cents! /s ;-)
---
I appreciate it, im on xbox though. Plus i dont think you can place atom shop items for people :/
---
This
---
That fact that you unlock the backpack with the tadpole skin and not a poasem skin, makes me think it unlocks too late!
---
&lt;3
---
Just challenges in general would be nice
---
 Hide the radio behind the jukebox
---
What do you mean "some people arent like me"? Informed?
---
You don't need any of that stuff not to be meat.
---
Got a pic or video ?
---
People leaving my door open also makes me unreasonably aggravated. Don't Know why. But I'm glad I'm not the only one.
---
I always thought subtle and non-subtle pokes @ the 4th wall were part of the Fallout "personality".
---
Shitty Vietnamese trap used against Americans during the war. 
---
They loved making spikes shit covered in feces and rust then planting it in ways people would fall  or step on.  
---
In a remote jungle setting it almost always gave serious infections and slow death. 
---
This ones just a large board with sharp spikes driven through that you flip over and secure where someone is likely to walk without looking. 
---
Probably has Brahman shit smeared on it with ghoul entrails.
---
Yeah the switch to commando is a definite upgrade but  the ammo control and conservation of a rifleman build is a premium to lower level
---
..I specced rifleman, got my agility and luck where I wanted them then switched to commando...then I didn't feel rushed the get commando and I can still max out weapons like a guass or dragon if I wanna give the old handmade a rest.
---
I see you are man of culture aswell
---
Oh yes for super mutants or glowing ghouls the difference should be pretty obvious. I only use heavy guns for sb/sbq/sheep etc so I don’t really count the shots.
---
Yup, same... especially if there are at least 3 players, as the enemy count scales. Bring a tesla rifle to ensure you get a hit in. I usually walk out of there with 500+ after scrapping all weapons (make sure scrapper perk equipped)
---
My dcg dmg is 1600-1700, its SS and one shots everything with normal attacks, i think 1k dmg is enough to 1 shot.
---
I noticed that several times only by buying junk.
---
No died and lost the ability
---
This bugs Been around since launch I'm missing one in every single challenge probably enough to buy a PA skin
---
&gt; Fucking ridiculous that there's still so many bugs in this game.
---
There are plenty of games, online ones, that tons of people play, that are far buggier. No game ever gets to the point of being "bug free" either. Although the way Bethesda likes to handle scripts in the scripting engine is less than ideal. It's probably what happened in your case. Where a bunch of script updates hit at the same time and something broke. Netsense, gamebryo, and the Creation engine are all the same base engine that Bethesda has been using forever. There's nothing inherently wrong, but they also keep using the same method of scripting... Which unfortunately causes errors like what you experienced. 
---
It's the root of a lot of Bethesda Game Studios' games bugs and some of these bugs have been around since like Morrowind. Unfortunately, the only real big fix for these kinds of errors and bugs is not a simple one. They'd have to pull out the current scripting engine(which is papyrus based I think) and replace it with an entirely new scripting engine... That they'd have to totally rewrite  all of the in game scripting for. At which point it'd be better to just develop an entirely new game. Since changing the scripts and script engine would probably break literally everything and huge portions of the game down to the base engine would have to be recoded almost from scratch.
---
What's your GT I might have been there?
---
The sight of a naked man following and heart-emoting a lvl2 player ona a "church camp" made me chuckle.
---
Keep making carnivore serum or pick up guns and armor drops
---
That's bad we really need this thread bumped up so Bethesda can see it and hopefully fix it.
---
TS are better when aiming but useless in vats
---
&gt;Hah, buying more stuff to refresh your inventory like the reality show "American Pickers".
---
That's more accurate than most folks realize. A good portion of my income comes from buying undervalued things at other camps and reselling. I buy every single map I find that priced at 15 or less and resell them for 20-40 depending on the region. Shit sells faster than I can restock it.
---
Sometimes i wonder what bugs there are which affect us daily but we haven't noticed them
---
Yeah I haven't seen that but apparently they can, heard it from others maybe even saw a video. But maybe it's just player constructed doors.
---
Up until a few patches ago there was a glitch that let you skip the silo quest. Straight off the elevator you could place your power armor in a certain way so when you entered it, you glitched through the ceiling and went straight to the final launch room.
---
You have to freefire aim with an automatic weapon. I’ve seen and beat this before. It makes you invincible to Vats Crits and all Vats attacks. Most basic attacks fail as well, but it’s a chance to do damage. Get a handmade and hip fire at him.
---
White spring bunker, but way cheaper at player vendors and on reddit
---
Problem solved.
---
My work here is done.
---
There was a glitch that allowed you to use power armor to get above the ceiling and run the walls to the end.
---
How did you get nothing? Like no leegendary, no reward at all...? 
---
Sometimes you've got to be patient and stick around that area for a while (obviously I don't know your circumstances, maybe you did)
---
Some speculation has existed that you had to do a decent amount of damage to her, depending on level. 
---
How much were you there for? If the whole fight, that sucks, and I feel for you. But there's never been a time for me that I just plain didn't get anything (unless I crashed out when she was near death and didn't get back in time.)
---
I dont think they get dropped, not positive though
---
There's an app with an interactive map for Android and iPhone users , even let's you see other people's markers they've made if you want
---
I saw a camp with his vending machine behind a rad shower. He was selling serums for 1500.
---
Heh. You think that's bad? I've encountered people who locked the vending machine behind a level 3 locked door with turrets around it
---
Does it?
---
That's hilarious, wish I could have seen it
---
Tig ol Bitties
---
This is post nerf and the guy def isn’t standing still.
---
&gt; and your guns be TSE
---
Not sure if blessing or a curse
---
yep!
---
Good point, probably a lot 🤮
---
Cleared beckley and Welch, picking up everything I went and sold it st the Welch station, scrapping junk, and made over 1200 caps in a couple hours.
---
When you live in a vault as long as we have you learn the importance of closing doors
---
Just an aside, its a bank holiday weekend in the UK which means a lot more people off work/ school are able to play today, took me a few hops to get my camp down today
---
Seems pretty embellished.
---
this is my build a vats sniper: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f36a99&amp;d=sb1s01p02pd2pp2pl2pk2eh2cm2cu2ic4ib4lt2l71lu2lv0a72an2a32&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=159cf](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f36a99&amp;d=sb1s01p02pd2pp2pl2pk2eh2cm2cu2ic4ib4lt2l71lu2lv0a72an2a32&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=159cf) 
---
i run 4 weapons, IE lever, AAE lever, TSE lever, and a TSE Handmade (why i have a 10 int for full gunsmith and demo exp) . If i didnt have explosives id drop INT to 8 (gunsmith and weaponsmith 3 for 200% repair) and put that in agility. have a friend who runs a similar build with 8 int and 6 luck to pump his agility to 15.   
---
like a west tek run i will main the IE lever and if something doesnt die first hit i switch to AAE, but like on a queen run i will main my AAE (no sense in maining the IE since not everything i am shooting at has full health), and then for queen or something running up on me i will switch to the TSE handmade, rifles in a queen fight are not going out dps near as well as a bloodied melee or an explosive heavy gunner but we can still push out a decent amount of dps on her, i can watch the health bar on her drop from my shots using the TSE handmade.   
---
best advice i can give ya for queen run, higher agility means less notice you are there and mobs will run past you, stay crouched, stay to sides or behind queen to stay in caution for the sneak attack bonuses. I can usually avoid interacting with any of the adds  unless i draw their attention because i shot them to get them off a heavy gunner.. Add in a chameleon piece to help stay hidden (escape artist is nice in queen fights too).  
---
far as armor and such goes, being a rifle/sniper build anything goes, if your being seen or getting hit your kinda doing your job wrong and unless in pvp DR doesnt really matter much, i usually have 1 chameleon, 1 auto stim, 1 life saving, the other two dont really matter, could go with dmg reduction for like scorched, super mutants, or ghouls (whatever ya farm) but try to have all my pieces add in lil weapon weight reduction, ammo, fdc or something and then hide better while sneaking, and prioritize +perception or +agility.  
---
sniper side of it, get a hard hitting rifle with instigating and go for headshot kills, get something as a secondary furious/executioners/suppressors to switch to if it survives first shot. and then a ts or tse fast fire rifle for the heavy hp things runnin at ya. for instance the lvl 90 deathclaw at the power station next to watoga, i can come in headshot him to roughly half health with the IE lever and if i am on ground ill switch to the tse handmade and finish him in 5-10 shots as hes running at me.   
---
if ya on ps4 you can add me and i can show you how i run in situations like that .
---
I would go to uranium fever and pick up all the mole miner weapons then sell at the vendor. Weapons and armor are your best bet just overencumbers you easily
---
Bet you got your daily scrip huh? Good on ya. Keep knocking them down. ( The robots at whitesprings usually occur after it been nuked. A round of protections and a round of diseased eyebots)
---
Or just unplug your machine
---
I wonder what is that reference to? Just some letter about randomly weird behaving robot doesn't seem worth to be in game.
---
I'm not sure which ones specifically date back to Fallout 3, Oblivion, and/or Morrowind. I really didn't pay that much attention last time I saw someone bring it up. Although it's a common engine in all of the games and they use pretty similar scripting. So bugs carrying over generation to generation in BGS games isn't exactly a surprise.
---
No... I was pissed...
---
Yeah that usually works.
---
I got a total of 25 scrip, so no, havent got my daily scrip
---
Not trying to thread Jack, but I wonder if it would be worth collecting these as I see them and selling them at my vendor. 
---
I spent a good amount of time trying to find one for my self and another with my wife, and now I find them at least once a day. (Pc)
---
I need one to go with my lab coat and white wolf hat.
---
There is no free speech when a TOS is involved...
---
LOVE THIS! guess i gotta carry a few now, just in case of douchebaggerie.
---
Anglers*
---
Had this happen to me months ago
---
I have seen it while in a workshop. as defense hit I was slapping a turret down, figured a closed door would keep me safe up stairs and watched the door get opened. and other times as well watched from a higher spot as they climbed and opened unlocked doors to kill my turrets -
---
Save the pictures and any other evidence, and send a report to Bethesda.  They'll take it seriously.
---
You likely won't hear about anything they do in response to the report (that's standard), but it's worth the time, they'll definitely look into it.
---
Thats a great idea, it would be perfect. I’d really like to see that idea gain some momentum.
---
That's actually disgusting. People like that should be banned without warning or another chance.
---
What type of rifle are you typically using on your stealth build?
---
Curse you RNGeesus..
---
Marsupial gives you a lot of mobility and an extra +20 Carry Weight at almost no cost (-4 INT, when INT's passive effects are negligible). There's no reason *not* to run Marsupial right now.
---
Got like 25 legendaries from WS yesterday...was weird from the diseased Deathclaw to the diseased Snallygasters...
---
Die and spam seek revenge
---
Only works for people that have lost the camera they got for doing the quest, and I'm not 100% sure of even that.
---
Report it to Bethesda
---
Sounds like poison to me.
---
After about 500 hours of play time I just found him for the first time. He spawned at the Thunder Mtn Powerplant
---
If you're on PC I'll help get you one. 
---
I've found legendary and non-legendary ones out in the wild. 
---
I found one earlier today at the top of Spruce Knob.
---
I’d be upset if I fast travelled and all the vendor had was chest and arm pieces. 🤨
---
Bulk junk and sell weapons
---
It's a video game man. If someone wants to make legitimate money good bless them.
---
Free speech does not apply on a platform with its own ToS. You can go out on the street and say what you want, but when you're playing a game you are agreeing to any consequences that are deemed fit by the owner of the platform
---
Log out while wearing excavator armor and you gain carry weight when you log back in.
---
Enemies are programmed to do that on purpose. Near my simple camp there’s a spawn spot, many times the super mutants and scorched spawned there just stood still and pew pew my generator from very far away. They just knew exactly what to shoot. Never underestimate the IQ of nuked minds.
---
Eh, I know that this has a ToS so they can ban people for what ever they want but technically "hate speech" is still protected as Free speech so long as it isnt insisting imminent violence. If you provided the pics through imgur then I could give a better response but currently I say just ignore them and enjoy your game, you arent forced to play with them.
---
I know I'll get hate for this but I believe in everyone's right to freedom of speech even if I dont agree with them.
---
Unfortunately
---
I haven’t done the event much, so I recall having only one friendly mob up. Additionally, it was a glowing deathclaw as far as I remember.
---
I'll make sure to grab them from now on. I keep forgetting loot is different player to player, so I'm not really leaving them for anyone.
---
Recipes. Water filter, mutations...
---
Hell yeah.
---
They used to drop from the scorchbeast queen, but that got removed. Currently the only way is buying from the enclave science bay or players who have them
---
awesome, thanks!
---
Honestly I just removed all my doors. I surprised me how much CAMP free space just removing 3 doors gave me.
---
Unfortunately this is true. The God given right of freedom of speech doesnt exist with a ToS involved.
---
I can help you, don't need any payment just want to help you out! Psn Sargeant_kane
---
Report it to xbox, they'll ban his account. ftw
---
No, it's an atom shop item, so only cosmetic.
---
I went out of my way to ensure it was well protected in a third floor room with 4 different level 3 locks to get to it. Nothing else was damaged at all. I just tried 4 walls with no door and so far so good.
---
Robots and liberators happen in the clubhouse after nuke dissipated.
---
They wont without pics
---
Op has got pics
---
I'd say bugs/stability first, then QoL improvements that don't take a lot of work (like log in onto the last server you were on if you DCd), and then new content.
---
You can do what ever you want with it. It will cost you a few caps though.
---
Thank you sooo much! Do you want the resources?
---
I’ve picked up nine in the last two days. They all seemed concentrated in locations:
---
Top of the World ski lodge area
---
Grafton Dam
---
The temple at the top of the savage divide
---
Sunnytop Ski Slopes top lodge and bottom
---
Hope this helps!

---
i tried my best to make it work in a way, to be fair you should scrap and store your junk as often as possible
---
Does he though? Or is this just a karma grab?
---
does it have to be bashing enemies? or can i just take to knocking shit around with it? (first time i've ever regretted over-repairing a weapon)
---
Every ten levels after 50 you should also get another special point until level 100 or so. I feel like with 5 more special points I wouldn't feel so restricted.
---
Nope, I can do it all for free no worries!
---
If you have beam splitter mod take that off. Tears through durability.
---
Jus going by what he's saying ask op to pm the pics to you
---
We all struggle with this. Builds are a compromise between damage, safety and quality of life. Remember that your build will still be developing for another 30 levels or so, use Nuke Dragons to plan.
---
I don't think I got a chainsaw yet, but I think the same about the drill. And seriously, the drill require you to have a PERK card to attach metal on it? And that just up it to 6 DMG?
---
The drill is an amazingly fun weapon. I understand that it will never do 100 DMG but come on, It should at least be able to take down a level 1 critter in one hit when you're level 40...
---
Do you have the plague walker mutation?
---
I'm on Xbox and if you wanted to get rid of that I could trade you whatever you're looking for. I'm a lever action and hunting rifle guy. That or give you 6k
---
lol that’s some serious protection. Mine is on 2nd floor with metal walls and roof enclosing it, those geniuses somehow knew exactly where to point their guns at. The metal walls usually get destroyed first, then goes the generator. Sometimes the vending machines too.
---
Only you can find the cameras in containers, yes. However, you also can't sell or drop them as they just auto scrap.
---
Will do. Thanks
---
Frankly what I'd actually want them to do is a separate segment for cosmetics.
---
New content isn't coming until second week of June at the earliest so a stability patch before nuclear winter is likely
---
Thanks I requested, my psn is rangerwh5
---
Weird stuff. Sorry it's gone now. 😕
---
I think there was a white tuxedo back during New Years that works well with the White Wolf hat, I saw someone rocking that look last night. I agree though would be nice to find or craft a outfit to go with it.
---
Not sure when I’ll be on today, but I’d be glad to help and pass the favor along that someone did for me as a tadpole. Add me when you get on (unless you find someone else) and I’ll come find you after I accept the friend request. PSN: ParzAttacks
---
Can't be sold.
---
Reccomend chemist to double your stimpack production and super duper to possibly get even more per crafting
---
I randomly lose chmist every now and then... usually come back when I log again.
---
OP, PM me pics? I'm curious about this.
---
So repair kits are cosmetic only?
---
Sorry. Couldn't help myself. It's 6am and I'm waiting for the next person to start there shift so I can go home.
---
Which languages?
---

Would people really be selling them for a load cheaper? You can no longer get these as drops.
---
I don't know man. Not sure I can trust the link.
---
Nice
---
I'm under the impression that on a first attack, it stabs, and if you want to hit right after, it will swipe. Might be something on my end but I could use the spear normally by stabbing, backing up so the weapon "cool down" and stab again. Or maybe it stabs more if you are moving and attacking.
---
It happened to me with lvl 50 eyebots once aswell, easiest xp i ever got
---
I just sell radaway. The amount of them.i get is ridiculous. Every second enemy at whitesprings drops one.
---
I have that one but the fedora has a furry texture on it and the white tux doesn't. ;c
---
The camp device does something. I used to have it right in the center, with my vending on the other edge of camp build area, where there is also a steep cliff. When I fast travelled to my camp, I always landed below the cliff, requiring me to do second fast travel, which luckily then got me to the camp.
---
I finally tried to move the camp device right next to the vending, thinkig it might effect other players, but not me. That caused me to always fast travel myself down below the cliff, even on second tries, so I had to go around it completely. I then obviously moved the camp device to the other side of whole area, far as possible from vending, and the cliff. Now I fast travel myself to about center of my camp, and no longer need a second fast travel.
---
I haven't yet had good oppoturnity to see where other players fast travel, but it seems fine. And my camp is very open and all so they could only have problems with few foundation parts I used as walls to protect some things a bit. I have no actual walls. And I've tried to have little bit of lights pointing towards the vending. The pipboy boards would be good sinns, but as my camp has quite limited land space, it's difficult to place anything like that, without making collecting crops a lot more difficult.
---
It seems your own fast travel is little bit north east of the camp device, maybe half the distance of camp build area diameter.
---
hi nazi
---
What do carnivore serums take to make?
---
NW = Nuclear Winter, not released yet.
---
That’s nice, eyebots have always been level 1 for me 🤮
---
Damn! That one I saw in passing must have been so quick I didn’t notice
---
BGS, across all three studios, has around four-hundred employees. Keep in mind that, according to the chief, Maryland is all-hands-on-deck for Starfield and TES6. Austin likely has around one hundred, maybe a little more, of employees (and not everyone is going to be capable of bugfixing, either). 
---
They're quite small, for a AAA team.
---
I haven’t seen many whitesprings nukes, but I have been seeing tons more fissure site prime nukes
---
I would love to sell my ammo in bulk. I would do ten bullets for a cap for .308
---
They need to be added back in as drops on some sort of rare legendary character.
---
 Wow, you could get literally hundreds of caps doing that.
---
Fo76 to the arkos pharma dungeon. I  the animal testing room in the storage bit is a button to open the shutter over the window. There is a metal rack to the left of the window which spawns one on the top shelf. If no one else picked it up that is one you can farm quite often.
---
Only had this happen once, and god(s) and devil(s) it sucked.  
---
Logging and reporting.
---
If you have to use more than one character to stash the caps, it’s too many caps.
---
Sorry already sold it a few days ago
---
Doom toots as he pleases!
---
I can put the broken one in my trade terminal. But fixed ones I can't.
---
I leave mine on all the time but it's way on the right well away from my entrance and my vending machines are on the left.
---
Not nuked
---
That's why I thought it was a bug lol
---
my stealth sniper i use 4 rifles on instigating explosive (IE) lever, anti armor explosive (AAE) lever, two shot explosive (TSE) lever, and for a fast firing shtf need alot of lead infront of me (or queen fight) i use a TSE handmade (i want to replace the tse handmade for a furious explosive handmade eventually). (i had just recently acquired the IE lever, before i full timed the AAE lever as my main sniper rifle.)  
---
since the instigating perk is the doubles damage on first shot its the holy grail type rifle for snipers (pve anyways.. pvp anti armor is way to go), with the first shot boost to a head shot you can 1 shot kill most any mob, then if it lives you swap out to another weapon either Anti armor, suppressors, executioners, or furious. if you are limited on funds or trade supplies go for a 1 star anti armor to start with in your preferred type of weapon, lever, combat rifle, handmade it would run ya somewhere round 500-1000 caps, then look for a back up and id suggest either furious or executioners.   
---
and here is perk set on it  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f36a99&amp;d=sb1s01p02pd2pp2pl2pk2eh2cm2cu2ic4ib4lt2l71lu2lv0a72an2a32&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=159cf](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f36a99&amp;d=sb1s01p02pd2pp2pl2pk2eh2cm2cu2ic4ib4lt2l71lu2lv0a72an2a32&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=159cf)   
---
my pistol build is vats crit based, i have an AAE, an IE, and a TSE 10mm, its fun and i like it, but its not a kill anything quick type of build dps is low on pistols so takes quite a bit of ammo to kill something.. but the speed and ease of movement ap regen, less ap costs.. is amazing at times. then add in the pistol runnin perks, some ap regen armor, i can run for days before im outta ap. so if youre wanting something to kill quick and feel like a god, dont go pistol builds, ya want something fun to play around with, its an amazingly fun build. shoots fast, moves fast, but blow through a TON of 10mm ammo lol   
---
for instance i think it takes me roughly 10 vats headshots on a lvl 68 super mutant to kill it.
---
I heard what I thought was a jumping in power armor sound, thought it was an audio glitch, until i left my work in progress camp turned around, then proceeded to shit myself. Level 150 is stuck underneath my floor frantically jumping and trying to run. It made my day. Had to dig him out.
---
Hero!
---
Dial a bomb
---
&gt; Visitors should have their own "visitor spawn" that is always just outside the green/glowing ring of your camp boundaries.
---
I'd be cool with that!
---
Freedom of speech protects a person from government interference in their protected speech. It does not protect someone who is utilizing a private service or in this case a video game from the creators or owners from taking action to not allow that person to continue to use that service.
---
My girlfriend was at a camp that had Trump's infamous line written on the wall.
---
Wasn't impressed.
---
Well till bethesda makes our camps 100% immune to pvp and pve attacks no one will lift defences
---
I tried bashing a wall and shooting dozens of bolts into the ground - neither seemed to do diddly-squat. So I ran through Flatwoods beating Brahmin about the heads like a crazy person. ;^)
---
Quick question. If your vending machine is out side can you lock your main house? So no one can get into it?
---
Yea enemies’ AI is getting out of hand lol
---
Nice xD
---
Why? Cause your pre-school level understanding of civil liberties trumps the rights of people that aren’t straight white people to feel be safe online?
---
You on PS4?
---
U may think it's funny now but just wait...
---
There should be two options for the jukebox, just like there is for the radio.  
---
Also, if you're on PC, this mod makes things a bit more palatable:  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/203](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/203)
---
damn i must be really unlucky then
---
I've seen at least two times 3 nukes getting dropped on the Prime in a row, in the same server, minutes after the other.
---
Wow that’s a snag. I’d love to upgrade my TS to get limb damage on it
---
It sells that much? Wow, I should put that in my vendor... I have the "Big Pharma" perk maxed so I keep finding chems that I never use (safe from Buffout to get more carrying capacity).
---
I literally pointed out that I understand that freedom of speech isnt protected in this case and that I simply wish that it was.
---
I close the doors too, but it in turn bugs the piss out of me when I go to leave and they have a lock on the damn door.
---
yea so i can resell 😈
---
Yeah, you can't place atom shop goodies in others camps :(
---
Exactly.
---
I had something like this happen with legandry eyebots in whitesprings like 30 of them and they do the mini nuke spolde thing when they get pissed off but i prevailed after a few deaths and came away with my winnings about 20 level 1 1 star legendary weapons -.- 
---
I expect it can happen with anything but whitesprings seems to be the place where it happens.
---
There is no rule that a vending machine must include lengendary items only.  In fact, it is probably better if it has a healthy mixture of items so inexperienced players can buy the items easier.  As far as the traps, yeah that's not cool.
---
With an accusation like that I hope you have a way of invalidating my understanding of people's rights. Go ahead, tell me how I'm wrong.
---
That would be good, I had two 1 star TS Fat Mans, ended up selling one for 1k in vendor, haven't sold the other yet. With Demo Expert and and making myself bloodied (just out of curiosity since I have Adrenal Reaction) I got the damage up to like 2,400 or something like that, I can't play bloodied with this build though when all my weapons are explosive.
---
Looks like you’re designed to sneak up on things and kill them with All Rise.
---
That seems like a no power armor approach, so I’d move points from intelligence into endurance, and look at adamantium skeleton, fireproof and sunkissed. Not sure why you’d take dromedary.
---
What system are you on.
---
The scout dailies/ campfire event has a chance to reward them. I've probably received 10 more badges that way.
---
You can only find them in containers after you've done the quest.
---
Xbox One! Sorry, just added it to the post
---
Y'know I abstain from commenting or even following this sub and this thread is and will become a shitshow. 
---
Thread is the right term for a series of comments right?
---
Yea I was thinking serums, recipies I guess would be reddit would be your best bet
---
Eyebots happened for me aswell once before, easiest xp i ever got
---
Send me your GT I’ll hop on for a bit
---
Yeah, I tried a lot of different combinations, but this was about 2 weeks ago now, maybe something has changed? I'll try it again.
---
Tos probs says no racism but all speech is free speech imo.
---
Sure. First, no one is guaranteed an audience, or platform upon which to speak.  Bethesda doesn't have to allow anyone to use the game for, well, any reason, regardless of agenda. Second, "free speech" doesn't give anyone the right to just say anything, anytime, about anyone. Lying is often unprotected, inciting panic or violence, etc. Finally, "free speech" is a largely secular idea. God has nothing to do with it.
---
i've had mongrels and wolves attack my doors, and walls! 
---
i put punji boards and turrets out front., pretty much says, GFY.
---
Yep everything the ghouls drop is worth some caps, especially the chems. Tons of them in firstaid boxes and lockers. A couple of WS run you can meet your daily scrip and cap quota easily.
---
My whole base is open. Switch on shower. Switch on garage door that opens to vendors and all work benches and stove while I'm home. No boards. Only turrets.
---
That explains the immortal flaming guy at WS station on ps4 the other night lol.
---
two shots on a sniper build especially long distance is more of a hinderance than a help the accuracy loss is way too much, only reason i carry a TSE lever, is i found it way back but at distance i can watch bullets land on each side of what i am shooting at.  
---
TSE handmade though works because im using it in close quarter situations, hell room in west tek, deathclaw running at me, crouched to the side or behind the scorchbeast queen.. or even when a scorchbeast lands infront of me from shooting at it in the air for a few minutes, it lands i switch out to the tse handmade.. for fast kill.
---
it's shit like this that make it so wonderful. honestly, the friendliness of the playerbase has really surprised me (and it's nice to see, since the beta was an absolute clusterfuck of annoying trolls). 
---
I've also had people run up to me and just deposit legendaries and entire suits of power armor (y'all just run around with some extras on you at all times or what??), jumping and waving and asking to trade plans. it's been great :)
---
"Freedom of speech" is a protection give to the people of the US (where this applies, as it does appear in other publications) granted by the first amendment to the US Constitution.  It states:
---
&gt;our people are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship.
---
It prevents the government from dictating what people can and can't express.
---
Last I looked, Bethesda wasn't an officially sanctioned government body, so it has very limited requirements to provide this freedom.
---
Unless you have a specific passage form the bible (or other religious text) that you're referring to, you're mistaken.
---
I don’t. If I was a business owner, I want to be able to ask someone with a Nazi flag on their shirt to leave my establishment. It’s as simple as that.
---
Thanks for the silver, whomever gave it to me!
---
i seriously considered killing those guys after getting my government ID..
---
What if it's a low level mule though
---
Lol, used to have a free vending machine with some legendaries and ammo hidden in my base to see if people could work out the maze for the prize at the end. Only had one person find it so having to make it a bit easier for others.
---
Well it's not like he said he wanted to pile on caps with it, no? I set up a vendor because I have extra recipes and ammo I don't use and I prefer to sell it for cheap (nothing is over 50 caps in my vendor, recipes are all 10 caps) than trashing it. but if it doesn't sell, then gone into the digital void it is. Now if you are the kind of people that just like to break in, leave the door open for molerats to come gwawing on the generator and switch all radios and light off, then yeah, you aren't welcome.
---
Report it, submit evidence, allow Bethesda to decide who uses their platform for what. Done.
---
Well the cable can go through a window. And after you get it to actually do that you can store the wall where the window is and replace it with a windowless wall and the wire still functions. Also if you put a garage door on the building you can connect the generator to the door. And then from there anything u connect your garage door to has power as well.
---
Yeah it happened to me too
---
Close out of the game and log back in is the only thing that fixed it for me
---
You think that, until Mole Rats spawn in there... Somehow.
---
I know my word doesn't mean much, but i promise you none of this was embellished. When it first happened I was actually pretty surprised, as I didn't expect someone to act so childish, trolling or otherwise.
---
Do you mean anyone who is wanted?
---
oh, that's just the nail board then? I looked at it, and I figured it was a trap like in Fallout 4, that I didn't unlocked yet.
---
Okay fair enough. I see that now
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
The Weeping Angels are a nice touch
---
Thank you so bloody much
---
I can finally finish the tadpole stuff and start making free atoms again.
---
That only works for completely destroyed structures. There's no way to repair partially damaged items other than picking them up and putting them back down.
---
So I literally said that free speech isnt protected here so your first point isnt a point because you are just rewording what I said, second free speech protects ALL speech except insighting eminent violence, public slander, or purgery and that's about it none if which are present here. "God given right" as in you were born with the right to do something would certainly extend to saying whatever you want. So you didnt make a single valid point what so ever, all you managed to do is repeat what I said with more words.
---
A video game is not a forum of speech, it’s an entertainment product. Even if you fail to understand that companies have no obligation to promote people’s racist drivel, this isn’t even a forum comparable to that. BGC is trying to create a product where the maximum number of people want to be and are comfortable and safe (while they get shot at by each other, and no thebtwo things are not comparable). That isn’t compatible with letting other players harass them.
---
First you have to "chip" your junk legendaries into the machine outside of Trainstations. Then you use that scrip to buy from the Purveyor. You can't sell to her.
---
find their stash box, drop some valuable junk directly ontop of it and hope they find it first
---
No, in survival, turrets will gun down any players in sight.
---
I'd love to. But I've never done it myself so I don't quite know what to do really. Also not sure I'm strong enough for all the robots. I've heard it's pretty tough
---
How about hostile players not becoming hostile and being able to damage you? Had that happen yesterday. Even after seeking revenge thier names all still appear in that neutral color. Then they hit me, I hit back and I do non combat damage while they kill me in 3 seconds all while thier tags still dont turn red.
---
Get rid of the weight limit on vending machines then and keep the item number limit. Just raising the stash limit is going to cause people to fill there stash up and then want another stash limit increase. I do agree it should be 1000 though.
---
That actually looks like him, well done
---
Completely quit the application and see if it's still there.  That's how it's been fixed in the past for me.
---
It happens (I believe) when you log off a server while someone is chatting (as in, you leave mid speech).
---
We need something implemented into the game
---
Jesus I literally said freedom of speech doesnt apply here. You just repeated what I said. How is that an explanation for dosagreement?
---
I see your point, certainly. On the flip, when players load in, they often bring mobs with them. Personally, I prefer overlapping fields of fire from two pairs of turrets, but a punji or two can help prevent mobs from tearing the curtains down.
---
I just finished it 3/3 with quercus. The two times we've done best was with him. I think it's still easier to complete with the heals between rounds even if the animals go Kamikaze.
---
For me anyway, it seems to drop weapons the game thinks people want, like Teslas and Gatling plasma/lasers. Which are still good weapons, but nothing I would ever use. Alot of robot armor for me as well, probably a good 1/2 of it so far. Followed by trapper and then combat. Maybe the higher level you are, the loot tables change to "maximize" your chance for s good weapon, even if it's not at all your style.
---
You can. You can refuse service to anyone at a private business, that has nothing to do with freedom if speech.
---
I have only had 1 3* leg drop since the purveyor.   Out of probably 60 3* leg enemies.
---
I thought you were asking for a fur suit
---
I am also on PC but for the first time ever I have to agree, Far less nukes being dropped. I have seen 2-3 only in the past 7 days. I am watching out for them because I need flux lol.
---
Oh no no no. I'm not a degenerate.
---
a donation's box would be nice for camps you can place anything you want in it, its limited to 50 pounds and when it is closed out you cannot take back anything you put inside of it, the camp's owner can open the box and take out the contents. if the camp owner leaves the server without taking the items out the items could either be deleted, or returned to the donater.
---
Maybe... he had tourettes? 🤔
---
I said myself that freedom of speech isnt protected in this case, I simply said I wish that it was. You didnt disagree with me in this response.
---
A filthy player suggested it and i agreed that is a nice touch. Although we don't need new monsters at Appalachia, especially one that is quantum locked and moves every time that you wont look at it...brrrrr.
---
Only if you will show me the Silver Rush, in all its glory. All those long, hard plasma casters throbbing with all that pent up energy.
---
 I mean , Atom bomb baby, nuclear fission in my soul, Fisto loves with electronic control. But sometimes you just need a million times hotter than TNT.
---
I was at a camp with a single foundation and he had punji boards at the bottom of the stairs with the vendors up top..left a bag of flaming fertilizer for him.
---
Do a spring clean of your stash. Marie Kondo that shit, ask “does it bring me joy” and be brutal. You’ll crate space and make caps. Nine times out of ten if you found it before you can find it again.
---
🤔
---
Sorry, Xbox. I probably wouldn't sell anyway. It's my favorite weapon. The name felt appropriate.
---
Used to drop from the SBQ but they removed it from the loot pool I think. Now people just dupe them alot and sell at their vendors or on here.
---
I'm expecting someone like a former responder realized people were accessing responder databases and such and is going to come looking.
---
I completed the Photog one... “secondary station”? Is that a translation? Might be a bad one. I’ll have to look it up when i get home.
---
I'll try and get you an intro into the group I run with. We are usually dropping nukes. Hit me up in game (same ign) and I'll see if we can get one going I normally do sbq but if ya need flux we can do that too
---
Yes it does though. Freedom of speech is what you wear, what you say to others it’s all encompassing. You are only protected from government interference though. There can be other consequences of that behavior from others though. The government just can’t prevent you from your speech. It’s under no obligation to enable it.
---
They have a chance to spawn in footlockers almost anywhere I believe. I think there’s another container too but I can’t remember which.
---
Do a run at Westek and keep all the weapons the mutants drop. Those assault rifles sell for a pretty penny. One run can usually sell out the vendor of caps.
---
Thankyou!
---
You must be fun at weddings. “Technically, if a hobo wants to come into the church and scream about how Nazis were right during the ceremony, I wish people wouldn’t infringe in his freedom of speech” I obviously don’t agree with him, any attempt to stop people saying anything ever is equivalent to the government infringing speech”
---
Ahh damn. You needed the one on the corpse so you could get the quest to repair it.
---
I'm notnseeong the disagreement here. I am saying that you are correct about the protections of freedom of speech BUT that I wish it extended into video games. What's the problem?
---
I think you can get them from vendors after you complete the quest. And they start spawning in containers so if you just keep looting you should get one
---
Good job
---
I hate people that have rad showers at their entrance, accidentally forgot to put starched genes back on and lost my mutation. I have mine on a switch away from vendors and away from spawn.
---
Lvl 50+? I found 2 broken deluxe in arktos farma tool boxes and stuff
---
the deluxe ones?
---
i’m level 34...
---
I did this was so bummed that I actually brought mods
---
I guess it's because you said "unfortunately".
---
I swear at the first reading, I though you wrote  "Unfortunately this isn't true " which explain the answer you got from PerilPartnership.
---
Using " "God given right" might have further implied that you were part of those fundies that yell for freedom of speech (for themselves) to express their bigotry.
---
THANK YOU! I ***just*** came back after being out of the game since about January or so, and this was the only thing I didn't try. I had just moved my camp near a friend's own camp, and had to rebuild entirely. This was annoying me because I had two gaping holes in my roof because I couldn't place the dang roofing pieces. Thank you a ton!
---
Lol. Sure. Except that weddings are closed private events and so uninvited attendees can legally be removed soooo...... try again?
---
ExiledBridge2
---
Yeah I have like 10 broken pro snaps on my character from loot you can find them around
---
are they deluxe tho?
---
Disarm can traps
---
Closed private events... like a privately owned gaming server? 🤷‍♀️
---
Yup. I find them all the time in random containers. They're broken but you can repair them like you did the original. I've probably found a good 25ish broken deluxe ones in random containers after I completed the quest. Sadly you can't drop them for your friends :(
---
Yeah deluxe spawn own in the world as soon as you do the quest
---
When I got only about 30mins to get the caps, I’ll just go to Harpers Ferry, do run from the south burrows  entrance, clockwise or anti, kill and loot everything, most of the time super mutants and drop it all at vendor. It’s quick, good xp and you don’t have to travel far to sell it.
---
You should attach it to the main building, like it's just up against a wall, so when they walk in, it's bigger on the inside :p
---
oh okay
---
Because you're claiming something that doesn't exist, and never has.  It's not a religious freedom, and hasn't applied to the anything online since the internet was conceived.  The ToS doesn't have anything to do with it.
---
I'll clarify:
---
&gt;freedom of speech is a God given right
---
Nope.  I haven't got the bible memorized (nor other religious texts), but it doesn't say that anywhere that I've ever seen.
---
&gt;but when a ToS is involved that all goes down the drain
---
The ToS doesn't apply to this.  Of course, they can restrict whatever speech they want (as you pointed out), but even if they said 'you can say anything, we don't care!', you'd still be able to run afoul of US and international laws by saying the wrong thing.
---
&gt;but I also wish everyone still had freedom of speech online
---
You never did.  You have the right to say most things without *the government of the US* stopping you, except where you infringe on certain other rights (you can't threaten people with harm, advertise or promote certain illegal activities, or divulge protected/classified information, for instance).  The government won't stop you from professing racist beliefs, but anyone along the internet pathways who own or run the bits you're talking through have always had the right to stop you.  And it's always been like that.
---
Keep in mind, I'm not attacking you or your opinions, I'm just pointing out the places where you're making assumptions that aren't true.
---
I seem to get a ton of robot and marine. Both toons are well over lvl 100. Definitely have received some amazing stuff, just would be nice to get some of it in leather
---
oh geez and why not that’s dumb?
---
"Usual methods for BA2's"
---
So how do I install?
---
If we're all looking at our phones.... who's keeping an eye on the weeping angels? Uh oh....
---
Whatever float your boat :p If Bethesda made "Public stashes" where people would put down the stuff they don't want I'd throw a lot of mess in there. Probably nothing useful in the grand scheme of things but heh.
---
The beta appears to still be going strong.
---
Ah thank you! I'm in UK time zone, so won't be back  until tomorrow now but will add you if that's still cool &amp; find you when I'm back on.
---
Maybe a bad translation indeed.
---
In French it would be the power substations that are scattered all around the Wasteland.
---
No man. Maybe I should have worded it differently. Let me be more clear. I believe that freedom of speech should extend to everyone as it is written under the law currently including all exceptions and on any and all platforms that involve communication. That said, harassment is already illegal so messaging someone non stop racial slurs would not be acceptable however having some ignorant bigoted BS in your personal C.A.M.P or minecraft server or whatever would be protected.
---
It'd be amazing if you could choose the level of your armor. There's no reason not to, and that way you could sell/give it to lower level players rather than just have another crappy lvl 50 Nocturnal Junkies wood leg. Does anyone know if the armor is scaled or not? All my toons are 50+ so all my purveyor items are lvl 50 as well.
---
So, a video game server and the environment itself is owned by a company. They can decline to serve people who express hate speech, just as I would decline to serve a Nazi in my business.
---
Back to square one I see. I already admitted that it wasnt  allowed here HOWEVER this game is not private its public. There are ONLY public servers.
---
I have really not much neither. Once I saw someone having lot of 2-3 stars for dirt cheap, of course then I was too heavy to buy them, to scrap later. I've managed to sometimes find 3 star weapons for 1k, they are lightweight or I have recycling allowance left, I buy them.
---
I had on my mule two explosive revolvers I used to level up my melee alt, until getting max level melee weapons. A level 15 western and level 35 .44. I had priced the western for about 2600 and it eventually sold, while the .44 was about 2000, mainly because it was also weightless. Oddly some high level came and brought the .44 first. Explosive always shows even if Im not near, and they were both fully modded and that is displayed on the name, so I thought it was bit odd as the Western did more damage.
---
I would not really vend any max level explosive. The others stars would have to be really bad, and even then, I would have to clear out caps to be able to in case someone buys one.
---
Wonderful work!  That actually corroborates a few sightings I've seen running around the less traveled parts of the map.
---
I have tried a couple times to dig into the data files to do a little of my own snooping into other subjects, but I'm afraid that it might be just a bit out of my abilities.  I love that people are using the data to come up with things like what you've done though!
---
Wait. Anywhere in fort defiance or West Virginia? ‘Cause that’s a lot of containers.
---
I don't like how often sitting disables the camera. Indoor photos are incredibly hard to take.
---
This is why I said when a ToS is involved there is no freedom of speech because users agree to give up that right. Again, back to square one.
---
i think i heard someone mentioning that these can only drop 1* items the more stars a legendary has the higher the likelyhood of him dropping a weapon with more than one star an enemy without a star can drop nothing but a one star as far as i know
---
Who knows. Whenever you try to drop it it says something about it being a quest item and it will be destroyed. I guess just to make our lives more difficult 🤷‍♂️
---
French at least, I can confirm :p and Italian too apparently.
---
 It also refers to Vault 51 stuff and maybe Nuclear Winter (I have a "Silver Trophy Nuclear Winter" marqued. Might be a rank for a Nuclear Winter event)

---
I do most of these, but I hadn't considered the punji boards. I only have them on my non- crafting side though.
---
I’ve done this before only difference is it wasn’t planned me and my friend and his friends were doing a nuke and little did we know the other guys who weren’t in our group but were my friends friends had also been running a silo at the same time and launched theirs right next to ours right after we did it
---
I get a obscene amount of trapper and leather, a good amount of marine and metal, and hardly any combat
---
I call these people griefing troll lizard face bums. I hope their mom gets herpes in the center of her asshole.
---
What does? I’m confused. I thought we were talking about possum badge tasks.
---
20 whole caps? How will you support your children now?
---
I think you've got it about right.  There's legendary (no regen, only drops 1 star), legendary +1 (regens, can drop 1 stars only) up to legendary +3 (that can drop 1-3 stars, something like 60-30-10% or so).
---
Hehe nice idea!
---
It's gotta suck for some of those who get stuck. I managed to get stuck in a locked room that had extractors left unlocked. I didn't want to touch them because it's their stuff.
---
bethesda at their finest😤
---
they should give options to use vs just add more music.
---
i personally love my classical camp. but there should be a button to switch the geanre.
---
There is also armor the prevents 15% damage when moving/ sprinting
---
Indeed it is 😂
---
Will help me do the ones I've missed. Thanks!!!
---
I have to say, I wish more people had crazy death labarynths. The punji board at the entrance sounds lazy and annoying but put together a real house of horrors and I'm definitely Going to enjoy that.
---
I would say my bloodied HW/PA build is my best overall build. I have a bloodied stealth VATS sniper that is suuuper efficient and fast clearing trash mobs, but has more issues with the big bosses like SBQ/Imposter/Arkatos boss (sheepsquatch can be a mixed result, if it doesn’t charge me I can easily beat it at range.)
---
I also have a lowlevel (~60) full health Unarmed build that does good damage, but just doesn’t feel as fun to me. Might just be my personality- I like being able to engage at range. It’s annoying dealing with enemies that I can’t reach.
---
My HW/PA dude just slaughters everything. No subtlety, just pure firepower and quite tough for how little health he has.
---
It's cheaper than all serums and it takes I think flouresent, fertilizer and something else
---
Ehhh... It's not that hard. If you can confidently take down Assaultrons, you'll be fine. The hardest part are the turrets, and if you've got three levels of Hacker you can shut those down. I've got the healing factor mutation, so I don't even use stimpaks when I'm down there. I'd recommend looking up a walkthrough on YouTube unless you want to go in blind, maybe bring a friend, make sure you have a nuclear key card, and bring power armor for protection.
---
😂
---
How much does it sell for?
---
The servers are not public. You cannot just rock up and play. You pay an entrance fee. If you’re in the PlayStation you’ve had to pay a yearly one too to a different company. You sign up to a contract. Contract’s have conditions, conditions that are legally binding. This is true online as it is offline. If you break the terms of a contract then action can be taken, this doesn’t mean that your speech isn’t free, it means that if you use your right unwisely you will be in breach of contract and open to remedial action. This is why I described your understand as that if a pre schooler. Free speech isn’t affected by contracts, because you don’t lose it, it’s just that free speech doesn’t sit in any universe where you are immune to the consequences of what you say.
---
The Doctor!
---
Shouldn't smoke in the first place eh?
---
In any footlocker in Appalachia afaik. They might be more level-limited, like no footlockers in the Forest, but certainly not just fort defiance. If you see a little green rectangular footlocker, check it out!
---
Never had that but I've had both Flatwood Aliens and Mothman visit my camp on a few occasions, even after moving it.
---
No, no one could afford those prices. Only the best ammo can be sold for 1c, rest have to be sold without vending. Cheap price for example to 5mm is about 0.25c. Someone could pay little more, I don't use heavy guns so I've not have to pay too much attention to that.
---
Since you mentioned being on PC, I could sell you some gauss at 1c. I might have 150-300 on total of two chars, all it takes is one player who is low and uses gauss, to clear most of it off.
---
I’ll look up the english translation when I get home. There is a “picture of a generator” one, but I believe that’s for the Electrician badge.
---
I love you guys who share this..
---
6k? lul that's a steal! sux you missed it
---
Personally Mothership Zeta was one of my all time favorite Fallout DLCs.
---
i feel like the pre "glitched" damage should have been the chainsaw/ripper/buzzblades base damage.
---
they were finally useful and honestly pretty fun! i miss it.
---
Also, don't put your vending machines over a cliff. numerous times I've been mid shop and poof, it disappears and I die. Like frak you. Put them on solid ground.
---
But is the first "tier" even intended then? I found another no-star legendary and again it didn't register for taking a picture of a legendary enemy. The game does not recognize it as legendary
---
Also mess with the audio settings in the menu and change that to see if it removes it after reloading the game
---
Which is why I already said that when a ToS is involved there so no freedom of speech. Again you are just confirming what i already said.
---
The fact that the translations of the possum badge tasks are botched and says "10 mm silencer" instead of "take a picture of a generator" doesn't affect the objectives, so you can still complete the objectives if you know what they are, by looking at an online guide.
---
440. Same as the rest, using lvl 3 Hard Bargain
---
The ash pile/goo puddle bug has been around since launch, has been acknowledged by Bethesda, and is still as bad as ever. For those who aren't aware, when a dead enemy transitions into one of those other forms, the loot can (maybe always does?) disappear. Basically don't kill legendaries with laser, plasma, tesla, or anything else that transforms the corpse.
---
But isn't that expected?
---
When hell freezes over lol
---
I have my okay stuff in the top front store, but all of the good legendaries are away from the main structure under my bridge...for those who actually adventure and look around as opposed to the people literally speeding through everything and fast traveling everywhere. I feel like they deserve it more,. Lol
---
HAHAHA People will find a way
---
Best they said was this fall
---
They can do it.  They put back the fast travel mats in workshops (*under the last tab of items*).
---
I hope that means they are coming back for CAMPs.
---
Having server chat would be nice. Something simple like Ark
---
I restated the points I agreed with, and then disagreed with you on this: falling out of our respective mommas guarantees us nothing. Additionally, hey. If you want to die on the "free speech" hill for some (admitted: allegedly) racist, abusive rando, have at.
---
There is freedom of speech. You can say whatever the hell you want. What there isn’t is freedom from consequences. Same as in real life. You want to drop the n bomb all day? Go hang out of 8 chan or whatever site edgelords use these days.
---
I can see why. However, I shouldn’t expect it to be anything other than a cosmetic item due to it only being obtainable through the atom shop.
---
TRUE THOUGH!
---
If your wearing unyielding then it's 500
---
Same, I've been server hoping that on death claw cave and didnt get any hide.
---
It's an item that can appear in containers.  I've only ever found it in the green footlockers.
---
Crosspost to r/fallout76settlements
---
Theres a billboard near Top of the World that has 3-4 cats guaranteed to spawn.
---
Word
---
So mildly irritating lol.
---
They have brought fast travel mats back to the workshop building.  They are under the last tab of items.
---
I hope that means that they are going to bring them to CAMPs.
---
The other side of the river is in Ohio, so idk if they'd use it, but it would be cool.
---
I'm I  the military so yes, I'm literally ready to die on the "Free Speech" hill for any and ALL US citizens regardless of if I agree with them or not. Anyway, good talk. I really do hope you have a good rest your day.
---
Not when im fast travelling to buy something, it isnt.
---
The game doesn't recognize a lot of things it should :P
---
Either the places where you're supposed to 'kill a legendary' don't have the right flag set, or (as you said) the 0-star legendaries are not supposed to be and shouldn't be dropping 1 star items.  Either is certainly possible, but I'd assume the former rather than the latter, just based on how many other places they've set flags incorrectly (and that is a long list).
---
Why are you assuming a homeless person would do this?  What’s wrong with you, you bigot?
---
I see and disagree. Tho I understand your point and in a world were people didn't feel the need to be so stupid it would probably work.
---
IMO, the law says that you CAN think and say whatever you want.
---
But the law doesn't say that it mean that people have to listen to your rambling and have it exposed before their eyes. Why would your opinion shall be displayed when no one want to see it? Why your right would be bigger than their own?
---
Being naked doesn't hurt anyone and if you don't do sexually explicit gesture, there is no harm done, yet it's not allowed in most places.
---
So, as it stand now, I think the law is fair enough : you can say what you want, but it's up to the platform you choose to allow you or not to express yourself.
---
(it's a general you, I'm not implying you are racist).
---
It adds up when you jump to 50 or more camps a day
---
Sell them everything you pick up.
---
Well I wouldnt be dripping N bombs as my Fiance is Black, not sure is you were personally accusing me. Anyway, you're right that there are consequences for all actions. Have a good rest of your day.
---
I found one in a metal (silver) container inside Whitespring, one time.  It's the only one I've seen anywhere since people started looking for them.
---
they are ! yesterday i was doing project paradise solo when the alpha showed up i rushed at him ( im using two handed melee build ) then my internet just lagged for a 3 second i wasnt at full health the alpha killed me because i rushed at him nobody was near me then i died i respawned they i forgot to put my junk in my stash when i went to the lab i saw someone saying that follow me i followed him and he stod for a minute then he dropped my junk at that moment i realized how nice of him taking my loot and make sure no one steal it because that happen to me once *im sorry if my grammer is not good english isnt my mother language*
---
Not me! I have a small camp with four vendors. All ammo is 1c! Rare recipes! Workshop/camp items for 50c! All the teddy bears! Spare inspect parts to speed up quests! Alien blasters! Screws at 3c each! Drugs! Serums! Rare outfits!
---
Just close the front door to my house, yinz guys and gals!
---
Really? Dang. Then why tf did they out it there? Just to make the map look bigger so they could lie about the size like teenage boy to his prom date?
---
I’m not accusing you of anything except a lousy understanding of how rights work. Laters, and hope the wedding goes well.
---
Lmao! Awesome job!
---
Berserker is bad because any damage resistance nerfs it. Which means you cant really wear armor to get full effect, so you lose out on all the armor legendary effects.
---
Bloodied is far and away the best IF you are running a full low health build (20%). Still very solid even if only running a partial low health build (~50%).
---
Anti-armor can be top-tier depending on your build and how much armor penetration you already have (perks, AP magazines.) 
---
Junkies is actually pretty damn good for full-health builds now if you run full addictions- the downsides are -1 or 2 points in a lot of specials, but for rifle builds, that’s not that bad. Junkies used to be bad because you lost all addictions on death, so maintaining addictions got really expensive.
---
Two-shot is still pretty solid, the accuracy and durability downsides are pretty well known, but it’s very solid damage. 
---
Instigating can be amazing or awful, depends on your weapon and build. If instigating gets you to being able to oneshot, well, that’s hard to beat. But against boss-level enemies, it’s virtually useless, so it’s a more situational effect. 
---
Furious is a little funny, it’s damage cap is quite high (~50% bonus) but it takes 10 shots to get there (5% stack per hit) and (supposedly) resets if you hit a different target.  So it’s good on fast-firing weapons, especially against bosses. Against trash mobs, it depends on your overall damage output.  If you’re killing enemies in 4-5 shots or les shots, furious isn’t going to give as much benefit as others. If you’re up against something taking 10+ bullets to kill, furious is very good for full health builds
---
And they are hilariously underpowered still.
---
I did that. I was amused and didn't mind since apparently with or withouth the blade, it does the same damage.
---
A reasonable response. Here's an upvote as it's all I can give.
---
That would probably end in people stocking x pieces of wood armor and 3 rolling pins to get you to visit - but maybe I'm a bit cynical :)
---
Hey, likewise on all counts! Be safe.
---
Run...take a look at the cool map bethesda created for us to explore...visit places you haven't been to in a while or ever. As a bonus we don't have to read these endless whining posts because what someone has in their vendor doesn't suit YOU...
---
'Make the wastes great again' ?
---
I probably mixed up those indeed. Still couldn't get that Scorchbeast and Mirelurk pics to count for achievements. Mirelurk one is for entomologist achievement if I recall right.
---
Be sure to check on your Notes Column within your Pip-Boy. Many of these plans have to be clicked on to open them then they should work.
---
Yeah, it's super lame, I hope they do something with it, but in the context of the game it wouldn't make sense (at least in the current main quest). Maybe when Wastelanders comes out it'll broaden the scope of the game.
---
I’ve found that if you rotate the camera to the side, sometimes it’ll eventually let you go to photo mode.
---
Using the sights makes a tse handmade or lever a lot more rangey than one would think.
---
Seems like the jukebox always turns itself on and the radio is always off whenever I restart the game
---
I have several locations that I discovered during the beta that I didn't get credit for. Been back to them a bunch of times since, nothing. I've started thinking that I need to start a second character to get credit.
---
Ah, ok? That’s a weird translation. Lol
---
Same with teammates no damage inflected.
---
However just recently I came back to my base to being attacked by ghouls out of no where. My base is in a safe location. had very rare occasions a liberator or two come to my base my turrets picks them off before I can even get outside.
---
My idea is that a horde event spawned near my base.
---
Once i killed the 6 lvl60ish ghouls i went to check on daisy unfortunately she dnt make it ...
---
Quickly hopped sever to see if i beat the checkpoint but it was too late the build space had decreased no hope..
---
This is my third deathclaw dieing since patch i think it's with ppl spawning by your base it allows the respawn of enemy's nearby. Without knowing it an enemy can be lead to someone's base for that players spawn point if not at or inside their base.
---
Also this is my second deathclaw i left passive the third i tamed agro. But i saw my first passive one under attack by one of the few spawn by my base and my deathclaw didn't even fight back where as my 2nd agro deathclaw fought any enemy that attacked my base (didn't attack random "good intention" players even those that attacked my base) there are still a type player they probably will attack Same for turrets..
---
Let's hope that it releases before 2020 so that the modding community can still thrive just like with Fallout 4.
---
I have been checking throughout almost 1000 hours of playtime.  😂
---
Well I dont do survival but I would except any contact with other players is likely a hostile one. So anyones camp would be more hostile as you'd not only fight the turrets but possibly the owner too.
---
Google it. 😂
---
Up vote for the ign...and " AMMOSEXUALLY"? 🤣 I bet you have a huge caliber... Lol.
---
Yeah the names are too far.
---
Haha. Me too
---
I hit him with a full clip of a gamma gun at 10:20 no VATS and there was no damage done to him.  I’m pretty sure a handmade hip fire wouldn’t have worked out for me.  I can’t go back and try again though.
---
while I can confirm the german language there also seem to be atleast french and italian affected [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsjssi/regarding\_update\_pc\_translation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsjssi/regarding_update_pc_translation/)
---
i dont think you can even play it without ps plus, i dont have it on playstation so cant confirm but that’s what i’ve heard :(
---
Well, here in Sweden it is 100% government work, so it is not great. Would probably be better if there was some private or state competition. However, I work nights so I get extra pay for night-work and we do 13 hours in a shift so I roughly only work 3 nights in a week. So the hours are good and the nightshift bonus makes up for some of the pay, but it is not great pay.
---
But it gives me a lot of free time to do other things.
---
Online only. No offline mode.
---
I’d also like to know how we get the plans? I’ve bought a few but can we find them somewhere
---
Well this idea of yours is actually nice. Have you tried to contact bethesda about it, or even making a statement in reddit? I mean what could five extra special point do? It would actually make things more balanced.
---
Ive had legendary corpses just disappear on me after killing them.  I calm down a bit after I realize it was probably just a 3* rolling pin or drill
---

Fallout 76 requires you to be online.
---
That's what I was thinking.
---
I would find it freaking fantastic if we could load our own tunes off the system we play on.  If possible
---
It’ll probably return eventually
---
The point of the post was 'Remove your punji boards', im adding to the discussion saying players need to keep turrets away from vendors, or its likely a deathtrap for other players.
---
The only times I had problems with other players only happened twice, and both people had TSE pump actions
---
Thanks for comment. I have Fallout 4 on the PS4 and it's limited to mods which is a shame as the Lyons' Pride would have suited my character build of her. I based it off her Fallout 3 appearance
---
Did it happen more than once? I ask because it may have just been a client bug unless they were able to kill you again with the same exploits.
---
You got lucky. Paper bag = free stuff up for grabs. The only thing I stash from my junk is screws and lead.
---
I bought the dense combat torso plan at watoga station last week. It's back.
---
I know it’s cavaliers armor. Thanks.
---
Use a bit of common sense. Think of a situation in which you would benefit from that combination of effects. The only things you would need to know are how far certain effects go:
---
Bloodied gives a bonus up to 95% at near death
---
Furious gives +5% or +10% per hit, in increments up to +50% total
---
Junkie's gives +10% per addiction, up to a max +50%
---
Nocturnal gives something like +50% at midnight and -35% damage at noon. There are multiple increments of damage bonus or loss, but it's set in chunks and not on a spectrum
---
Anti-armor effectively gives you a 28% damage boost on a weapon without any other armor piercing effects. Armor piercing stacks multiplicatively, not additively, so it becomes less effective if you are using perks or attachments for more penetration
---
Two-shot gives a severe increase to both recoil and spread. But it also goes well with explosive because both projectiles gain an explosion and damage boost. Also, the two shots are spread out, so at longer ranges you can deal LESS damage per shot due to only one of them hitting
---
Weightless only affects base weight, not any mods you add on top
---
Mutant's is not 10% per mutation, it's only 10% IF you have a mutation and 0% if you don't
---
Berserker's caps out at 50% without any armor, and has a negative effect if you are heavily armored. I believe it goes down to -50% or -35% damage.
---
Other than that, all of the effects are relatively self-explanatory.
---
Is there a way to keep the jukebox off by default like radios? Kind of obnoxious that every time I travel or load into my camp, the jukebox starts playing. Can only take so much of those couple tracks lol
---
Sorry, shitty joke.
---
Ghouls seem to drop broken pro cameras, and random containers, you just have to keep looting containers and enemies until you find one :o
---
I’ve had the jukebox so long that I’m used to the music. I love the way it lights up, so I deal with the crummy tunes.
---
Cool! Thanks for the reply! I actually just lucked into them at a player vendor a few minutes ago which is crazy since I had been looking for the longest time and then suddenly I get lucky! I appreciate the offer/info!
---
This would actually be awesome
---
You can change your switch to a pressure plate if you want it to turn back off when people are done. The plates are slow enough that it won't get someone wanting to keep rads.
---
Indeed. We discussed about that on the Discord Server. Basically from what I got from translators (not the FAllout 76 ones, but translators for other games) translations come in spreadsheet-likes documents.
---
It mean that unless the translator have notes about it, and/or can play the game, he mostly have to work by guessing.
---
One hilariously bad translation in Fallout 4 that was corrected in 76 is the "Industrial size shortening".
---
In French, to sell food you NEVER use something like "industrial". "family-size" at "economic/money-saving size" would be the most common, "Giant" might be another. But industrial? never. And shortening without context can be anything. I guess if the translator had seen "cooking fat" or "margarine" he would have guessed and translated "Industrial size shortening" as "Margarine format familial".
---
Instead he came up with a Google Translation... I can't obviously revert back to english but it's a total nonsense that sounds like "Shortened to industrial standards".
---
Yeah, I don't fast travel to CAMPs anymore unless I can easily verify the person's level it belongs too (usually that means they have to be at the CAMP so I can hover over their icon and see it)
---
Whatcha mean xD
---
The heads come from quests. You get several doing the "Missing Brother" questline, several from sidequests, and mounted bugs from doing the daily at Dolly Sods.
---
There is no offline mode
---
fallout 4 has some 76 not so much
---
Start feeding them if you want them to live bro, you can't protect a bloatfly from snallygasters
---
Would be nice to have a quick way to use instead of going in the map,menu and then photo mode :(
---
&gt; did you buy it?
---
&gt; yes
---
&gt; what did it cost?
---
&gt; ...10 caps
---
Urgh I always come back to my camp and the door is open. It bugs the living hell out of me. I’m going to put a sign up!
---
Industrial sewing machine processor creates 7 ballistic fiber/hr.
---
A fine taste in armor selection
---
It's been a while since I've done that part of a quest, like before it changed so I don't remember. Although I swore I got my land purifier from the Charleston DMV.
---
Are you available this evening?
---
So far some limited pa skins havent returned. Prob wont be anytime soon at all for the rider sets
---
I like how people are triggered over the idea of a country being great.
---
Ahhh yes harder to detect is the best lol
---
I thought I had a pretty perfect setup, but I'm starting to conclude that if it's behind a door, people are scared to open it.
---
I'm in the concrete extractor by the overseers camp. The extractor is on the right, behind that is a small barnwood (whatever the red wood is called) building with no windows or doors (but a ton of wires - it's my fusion generator.)
---
Then directly roadside, I have my vending store, it's the metal type, has open signs on it, and in neon letters the words Crafting Benches with the "J-shaped" arrow pointing to the left/behind the building.
---
Then my actual camp is three stories of that same red wood. It's directly behind the store, with two rows or crops between them. I have a patio/deck on the left side with all of my crafting benches (hence the neon letters and arrows) Everything is unlocked except the front door of my actual "home" (surprisingly nobody attempts to pick it) but the amount of times I've walked by to someone obviously contemplating the risks of opening the door are absurdly high. Every wall is the one that has the window, so it's obvious what it is. 
---
But it makes me laugh everytime. I do hella sales, but those few people are the greatest.
---
Literal translation can be a real problem lol
---
Do you wanna know why they are nice? Everyone else that is not "nice" is pushed into the black corner over there called negative karma place. In Negative Karma place you are not allowed to speak up or "do stuff" with other players.
---
Valid point, I didnt think of that, and really the mask wasnt really a gas mask anyways, was more just a hope lol
---
This game wont get it anytime soon
---
Both of them can be the kind that runs away.  I've run into ones that flee, and ones that want to mess you up.  It's random which ones you find (more or less).
---
Well it's literally impossible to sell it any cheaper unless you give them away for free. Again I'm just saying what I have seen.
---
Since November ive killed 3 mothman and 1 flatwoods monster because i sneak attacked it. They always run away for me.
---
for me earlier it was  "cannot place item, intersects with an existing object.**"** while I'm like "That's the $&amp;#$ing point" I wanted to attach my house to the top of a junk wooden tower that isn't a landmark or anything. Most of the time foliage and tree branches burst through my walls anyways so why not just let my walls and floors have some clipping I actually want if it's not an important structure?
---
I changed the skin colour to burned and I've just my  screenshot of her on Fallout 4 to see which looks more closer to the original
---
I'm level 270 something and I just killed the flatwoods monster this week for the first time. Only saw him once before, months ago, and he ran off like an itty bitty bug. This time he was inside a players house when I showed up to check out their vending machines.
---
Like... What!? Been looking for him forever and this player lives with him?
---
People set their prices to whatever they want, you dont have to buy anything their selling. If something is too much then keep looking/farming
---
Happens to all of us. You can hang out with the wise mothman at the end of the path of enlightenment. To take them out you have to be quick unless it’s the vengeful mothman, as he’s a dick and comes after you. I had him assault me in the far northeast of the map. 
---
The alien just has to be overpowered quick before he teleports away. Sneak attack or overwhelm
---
I think it depends on your level. At low levels he just creeps in you and take off when discovered. At higher levels he'll start attacking.

I spend most of my time building in this game. Not because I want to, even though I love building and crafting, but because I have to.  I'm not trying to make any weird floating base, or anything else that would be looked at as breaking game mechanics. I'm just trying to make a somewhat normal looking camp as if it was something you saw in the real world, but apparently the game doesn't want you to use logic when building.  So many errors of object is floating or needs to be placed directly in the ground, yet if I place it anymore in the ground you wouldn't be able to see the piece, it's annoying to say the least. Then there's all the snapping issues. I don't know why there's so many limitations when you're trying to do something that quite literally would look fine no matter who was looking at it, but the game is like no you can't do that.  Then there's all the times I'm trying to place a piece down that is outlined green and not throwing back an error, but the game won't place it or it will say nothing is selected. Probably the most aggravating thing is trying to attach a wire from one thing to the next and instead of it attaching the wire it just makes you jump and you have to exit the menu to fix it.  Many times that doesn't work for me. So I have to exit the menu and  take out a gun then enter the build menu and it will let me attach a wire. The next one I try to attach though,  I'm jumping again and I have to do it all over again. This happens every single time I build something and have to attach wires.
---
When the game release they said 'in about a year' - which is dev-speak for don't plan on it.
---
You can look online for the solution.
---
Despite the botched translation, objective will clear.
---
For example if you haven't completed the rail enthusiast badge liek I did, walking to the train stations still register.
---
There are still issue swith objective not working, but it ppaears to be unrelated to translation issues.
---
And some pics of the French botched translation I took recently :

Do orbital strikes damage camps? Some guy and his buddy were mad cause I didn't want to sell my VE railway and took some shots at me while at one of their camp/vendors. I checked a strike beacon and scooted before they could trigger pvp via my mutations. Didn't see the aftermath but they were running back and forth looking for me for a while.
---
Medic reviving ally in water hasnt worked for any of my friends this far
---
Uranium Fever. Pick up everything then hobble your overencumbered ass to the WS Station.
---
And it sounds like the ones who are in teams are just killing themselves and having someone revive them. How was that a challenge? Give me something to DO, even if it’s “find X number of rare item” or craft something or fix up the Scout Camp.
---
It feels like someone’s writing these quests as if everyone is doing super deep role-playing.
---
What about armor effects?
---
I think I got one from a gulper in the toxic waste
---
It happened to me as well a couple of weeks ago. Tagged and dealt some damage to the SBQ and she had 0 loot.
---
Id still go with armor, unless you have a full set of sentinel armor, then youre still in need there
---
It's not getting an offline mode jesus christ go back to fallout 4 if you don't want to play with people.
---
I recommend trying to complete the event with one animal getting everyone’s focus. When more people are familiar with the event, you’ll be able to help all 3 animals. I won the backpack last night with only one animal alive.
---
Mine have been selling to high lvls at 250
---
Yeah but then you're not always facing the direction you want to face.
---
My friend just started yesterday and one of his first moments of confusion and complaints was "why can't I put my waypoint down on a location?" I told him he had to place it nearby in an empty spot and he proceeded to mention how dumb that is, and was annoyed he could only set one.
---
who pissed in your cereal?  You do have the option of not saying anything if you don't agree with post content, you know this right?
---
Either three-star armor or weapons. You get more armor but it could pop out wood which will revert to one star when relogging.
---
Or you could do a little bit of both like I do.
---
Oh shit that would be crazy...
---
Buy it on PC and you won't have to pay the PS extortion fee to play the damn game.
---
Yeah I was thinking that getting some Sentinel Armor would be nice.
---
Yes there is a Sheepsquatch which can spawn randomly or from the event Free range.
---
This is 100% accurate, every time I log in or fast travel to my CAMP.
---
You'll have to buy another circuit board, almost all the vendors have them.
---
My wife said the same thing.  Get a couple weapons and the rest armor.  Then she told me nothing wrong with just holding on to the scrip.  Thats the obvious answer, but doesn't "solve" the issue.
---
Honestly the French translators are usually pulling a good work. Changing details so we understand the jokes, even changign the unfamous Fallout motto...
---
Yes "War never changes" only happened in Fallout 1. Fallout 2 went for "La guerre, toujours la guerre..." (war, always war) and since Fallout 3 it's "War never dies" (which IMO sounds better and more frightening but heh :p )
---
Or dialogs on radios being adapted, like Travis commenting a song by saying "I talk about a time that the less than 200 years old cannot know" (reference to the song "La bohème" by Charles Aznavour where he sings "I talk about a time that the less than 20 years old cannot know") so, I can let a bad translation slip here and there given the enormous good job they do usually.
---
I've been finding it in very weird places all over the place you have to check all the container's you come across as it could be in one,I found one in a sack today only 2 to go then find out its bugged.
---
I came here to say this.  Ive worked with software development teams using agile (a development methid that im 99% sure the FO76 devs are using) and I am almost certain that they probably have at least 3 teams - content, bugs, and QoL.  The content teams have probably had weeks or months to work on their ideas, but the bugs team wouldnt have any notice until the bugs show up, so its going to take what seems longer to address bugs.
---
lol removed
---
i do not think they do any longer but sure as hell scary for some1 inside
---
Valar morghulis!
---
No I checked last night. The bug exists.
---
I was renaming my pa sets and couldn't just collect it without getting into it and exiting it first.
---
Then, when I did that, it erased the name I gave them.
---
Burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him!
---
God help you if you put a staircase in the wrong spot... you literally have to move your entire camp
---
I got a Garage door opening up to two vendor machines and all crafting stations. Garage door can shut and open from both sides incase of base attack they don't need to be bothered or want to seek shelter. I keep a little room for myself locked in the back. Farming food and Brahmin including a water purifier.
---
That's how I know someone has been there. They left the door open. I always close my doors.
---
With the deluge of posts complaining about not liking what's in vending machines and "wasting" caps it seems a fair portion of Reddit pissed in my cereal. I do indeed have the option of not commenting but this is a sight designed for discussion so.... And I gave what I believed was advice to enhance the game experience.
---
That's odd, were they all kneeling in the water? They can't be revived while swimming, and they have to be in the downed state. I was able to get it to work by traveling to Gulper's Lagoon then having a gulper beat the shit out of my friend and then reviving him while he was downed in water. I'm on PS4 though, so I dunno if that makes any difference.
---
Get power armour go to whitesprings golf club, boom ez lvl
---
dont judge a book by its cover.... My level 15 alt has more god tier loot for sale than most level 300 dudes....
---
Puts my manually created one with 140 I posted a couple weeks ago to shame for sure.  Thanks for this, I'll be using it frequently!
---
I once had that glitch for like a week straight, then it fixed itself somehow. It's annoying but I'm sure it'll fix itself for you too eventually.
---
Atleast powerful automatic and tweaked
---
I usually sell them for 50 each, but I'm out now. I haven't been taking power plants to make them because I've been server hopping the new event.
---
tks.
---
Yeah, but there is a right and a wrong way to say something, even if that thing you want to say is correct.  Telling someone to stop whining about an issue that they clearly aren't the only ones feeling a certain way about is probably the wrong way.
---
Just check every toolbox etc you come across. I've found loads of the things.
---
someone who spent thousands of hours building in f04 w/ mods....the possibilities are endless , but the biggest problem being camp budget ...im already at the point where i have to delete ATOM shop items to buy/place ore ATOM shop items lol ...I dont even use turrets ... just a well decorated home ...
---
for what it's worth, the Encrypted event happens whenever someone triggers it, right? so, you wanna do it again, tell folk on here. i get a message saying "Encrypted event happening at this date and this time", i'll freakin' be there. in exchange, i'll tell you whenever i'm gonna trigger it. sound fair?
---
"It's coming right for us!" Lol. It won't t be legendary in a jar........or will it? Probably not.
---
Chemist, the syringer parts of it do not work (at least, they haven’t worked for me and I haven’t heard of anyone else getting them). Also Plasma grenade plans are suuuuuuper rare but apparently technically in game. Pulse grenade plans are somewhat rare. And to craft a serum, as a new player,  you need to buy plans for them from the Enclave, and the best price you can get from them is 17,500 caps. 
---
Musician, the “play instrument at location” ones don’t work. At least, I haven’t gotten them to and I’ve played every instrument at each location multiple times, long enough to get Well Tuned on each.
---
Apparently Collector. Hard to find the magazines in the first place, and I saw someone post that one of the Unstoppables magazines isn’t even in game, although I don’t know if that is true. I also still haven’t found a stuffed polar bear, but I haven’t really looked for it.
---
Hard but possible-
---
Medic was impossible , but as of the latest patch is technically possible (stimpack diffusers are a plan drop from the Arkatos quest added in the last patch.
---
Leatherworker is suuuper hard but possible (death claw hides are really rare; only place I can confirm I’ve seen them is in footlockers, supposedly they can drop in another container as well but I forget which).
---
Robotics can be hard, finding robot armor plans is pretty tough. Keep an eye on player vendors!
---
Entomologist is hard; getting a mothman wing fragment is super RNG.
---
Herpetologist was broken for the frog habitat, but apparently last patch fixed it. 
---
Cook is a pain in the ass to collect enough royal jelly (seriously, look it up) but possible.
---
I was curious if other non-English speaking countries got the fallout jokes. I mean, the game has a lot of jokes about AMERICAN consumerism, rampant technological advancements and lifestyle in the years following WW2.
---
They're pretty easy to pick up and sell. I find them quite often at the Camden Park vendor. 
---
Had 6 ready for vending, all sold for quite a mark up within a week
---
I think you have a hard cap of 1000 scrips. I'd go for 3* weapons for a chance at a godroll to sell.
---
Pretty common on super mutants
---
I placed several bone traps in my camp and disarmed them all.
---
😄😄😄
---
and the whole "perma attaching" thing where once you place a foundation connected to your original foundation ...gets permanently fused with the main foundation and becomes immovable and undeletable ....really sucks ....
---
I'm pretty sure there's at least two. I'm logging in now so I'll let you know in a moment.
---
naw, not enough to change my mind.
---
Well not through vendoring, but directly trading. For the last 5-6 months I've only crafted 5.56 and shotgun shells with any lead ect I get, and I brought all the rest, I use 10mm sub, radium(.45), little bit of western revolver, and then ultracite laser rifle. If for odd reasons I would not craft any ammo, 55.6 and shotgun shells have been commonly sold for 1c, now they are both going way under. Fair price for .45 have been about 0.5c, 10mm below that. As 5.56 and shotgun shells have dropped, weaker less in demand ammo should have dropped too. The caps for ammo I've got mainly from vending bots.
---
So were you intrested in the gauss ammo? I checked I had about 100 on my vending and 160 in inventory. Im playing now and will likely play for 1-2 hours, no idea if longer.
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago. I stopped pvping after that.
---
Rip them out of your arms
---
There’s a few in the wendigo cave.
---
Wind chimes at wendigo cave
---
It’s just a suggestion not a complaint man which Bethesda has asked us to do give feedback !
---
It’s because the game is extremely easy after all. There is no reason/incentive to be detrimental when you live in an infinitely resourceful world. I could give you all my precious materials and grind them back in like one week.
---
Another vote for never. 
---
I personally think they want us to forget about them. Their monetization would go into the garbage (yeah yeah, they're already there) when the unbridled creativity of the mod community is set loose. 
---
Unless of course they monetized mods. (I might be ok with this IF 90% goes to the creators. They're are some damn talented ones out there)
---
Maybe he was role playing as a suicidal Homophobic raider?
---
Doesn't work. I'm wearing a crumpled fedora and just tried 10 times
---
also they need to lighten up on building in existing locations , there are so many areas perfect for little camps you cant build in....I understand if the area is tied to a quest or something and you dont want player potentially blocking that content for others ... but I can think of a million little spots in this game that are tied to nothing but do not allow building ....
---
Wendigo, radroach, yao guaio, stingbarb, firefly, tick, bloodbug, wolf, I don't remember others but theirs more
---
Why not have it where you find holotapes to add to the jukebox
---
Mine didn't work with a crumpled one, I had to use a battered one.
---
FFXIV
---
If the thematic and practical mod pieces found their way to 76... I'm just saying I'd probably drop some dollars on atoms for it if I had to
---
I just looted them off super mutants. Femurs. Tibias. Skull plates. Ribs. Etc.
---
It’d be nice for unfavoritable items like power armor or unequipable items like junk. Especially quest items that get broken down when you auto scrap.
---
I don’t know how people don’t know about this but Braxton Medical right underneath Thunder Mountain has HUNDREDS of bones.  No joke.
---
No problem for me at the silos, but today, any time i tried the Arktos elevator, the game crashed. I tried it at least 6 times....different servers, restarted system...crash
---
Yeah, some diseased enemies don’t show if the are legendary or not.
---
I really think shutting down the experiment is a mistake.  It makes the animals run right to their deaths if the Alpha is around.
---
I'm on the ps4 and need a different fedora please. Crumpled doesn't work. Can somebody help me out please?
---
Also don’t be afraid to go through doors if they’re unlocked. They’re unlocked for a reason just close them on your way out
---
Sounds like it to me too.
---
They VERY clearly are not the only ones however just because a particular vendor doesn't have what your looking for doesn't mean they aren't just right for someone else. How bout just trucking down the road to the next guy instead of going to reddit and complaining about 15-20 caps? If I must abide it then counter-whining is my perogative.
---
The jukebox at Sons of Dane compound has some pretty decent tunes on it. Is that one of the CAMP options? 
---
I’ve been meaning to look, honestly just noticed the music was different from the radio a few nights ago while running One Wild Night.
---
I have my entire camp based far our of reach of any non-party/friended player and the vendor out in the open with a stash, water and 9 rocket turrets to try to deal with any annoyances. My condolences to others that struggle with the other kind of camps. 
---
But, it be nice if the vendor on the map would show a Star(+) to indicate any legendary or they should just give it its own category.
---
I suggest Cloudy01's Fallout 76 Mod Manager:

With the exception of one piece of Pioneer Scout armor, I think all of the armor I've received from the Purveyor has been leather actually.
---
Spawning 3-4 stories up or off the side of a cliff with no loaded floor is not how I want my shopping trips to go.
---
I had a liberator spawn in my generator shack and I didnt get to it in time and it destroyed it trapping me in my garage because I only have powered doors on it
---
any help with energy weapon enemies, robots dont seem to count...
---
I’ve gotten plans as a drop from One Violent night. sturdy raider arms. This was a long time ago (December?) and only happened once. I’d guess any savage divide quests have a chance, but IDK.
---
&gt; discussion saying players need to keep turrets away from vendors, or its likely a deathtrap for other players.
---
Yeah, but it took quite many comments before you mentioned it's on survival. Plus as your comment was made on a subthread branch thats currently sitting at -7 downvotes, this won't likely be seen by many.
---
The turrets do nothing to players on adventure, where most of us play. And since players try to use various "traps" to even kill players on adventure(mainly to fall damage), I would except more devious traps on survival.
---
Armor with hazmat suit would be OP so that's not going to be fixed
---
Tweaked, automatic, powerful automatic, speedy, hair-trigger, and vicious(?). Definately more than 1.
---
I can help with the pool! There's a nice one at the New River Gorge Resort cabins,just near the New River bridge on the main road over the bridge itself,Sutton side. If you go through the cabins, you have to deal with some ghouls, and there are a couple of bloatflies on the paths outside. At the pool itself,you might have to take out a couple of mirelurks. Somehow, I don't think any of this is going to bother Harold. Lol. Just don't forget to post here and keep us updated.
---
Does the wolf fedora not work?
---
People don’t even use my doors. They jump around my camp. My camp is on the summit of a mountain to give more perspective.
---
What's up with the stupid questions on reddit?
---
Have you had anyone help you yet, I’ll be on for the next like 20 minutes if you wanna do it really quick?  GT is BigBrownBear x
---
I want the fo3 and nv hazmat suit. Also want lorenzos suit from fo4
---
Why do you feel you have a right to tell other people what they should value things at? Hey, you should sell me your house for $1000, stop being unreasonable already!!
---
thought we all just put them in our pockets. 😂
---
You're the first reply, thanks so much! GT is Balyhane, I'll meet up with you?
---
Yeah sure!
---
I didn't try that one
---
Flux and regular junk too!
---
They're 2k caps, just so you know.
---
the trick or treated spawn is about 2 months old. I came across one back then with the plans to craft the skeleton suit and mask.
---
Define evening...I don't get home from work until 3:50 am eastern time. But il be free most of sunday Monday and Tuesday
---
You can still do the 'trash account' trick if it still work for the ps+
---
Video proof?
---
Yeah depending on category you open ticket, you just end up with the automated response for quest walk through..
---
You'll have to respond to ticket and wait for an actual person to respond.
---
Beyond that, i haven't seen that issue and sounds like a bug to me.
---
PC, many thanks for the offer though!
---
Ok. I'll be free most of those days as well
---
Test it and lmk what you find out. I'd recommend keeping the perk on and using a different melee weapon without swing speed. Because 40% ss is higher than the perk ss, it'll show a little easier.
---
Only radroach meat spoils.
---
How did you get the Tricentennial flair?
---
I wouldn't expect any news until E3.
---
Cool. I'll look for you online then
---
Sounds good
---
That’s what I was thinking but I can’t wait for news lol
---
I never felt the need to record the experience, although on xbox I can only record short videos, so I usually don't bother doing so. :/
---
Ikr it's like a maze trying to find the vending machine
---
You need to run wires from the power box to the processor. There’s usually existing wires but they’re almost always bugged. I’ve been able to move the power connectors and rerun the wires and gotten them to work.
---
Bones are fairly easy to find. 
---
Super mutants often drop them, as well as in the meat bags they have in thier locations.
---
Raider camps also can have a good supply. The one near Pleasant valley station for example has several bones.
---
Just down from mothman museum - behind the houses next to the river, on the table where the other eggs are there is a whole skeleton.
---
Wendigo cave also has some, including bone chimes.
---
Equip a weapon, position yourself the direction you want to be then holster then weapon and you can pan without your character moving.
---
Pretty sure people like you are the exact reason they're hidden. Level shouldn't be a deterrent when it's OPEN WORLD where anyone could fin anything.
---
Only thing that comes to mind is weight. If your'e overencumbered, you run out of AP just by walking. Once it runs out, you move like a slug until around 25% AP is restored and allows you to move again.
---
Maybe a use for legendary drills
---
Check the dumpsters by the Whitespring service entrance.
---
On mobile it’s in the thread options in the top right of your screen.
---
I gave up too soon then, thanks for the tips.
---
PSA:If I advertise vending machines, that doesn't mean I want you using my bathroom. Watch your step and read the no trespassing signs.
---
build all your camps in the same location
---
There’s a static spawn of a cat somewhere in the ash heap. I don’t remember exactly where, I’m sure it can be googled and find it easily. I was able to get my cat picture yesterday randomly at the lumber mill as I was farming for starlights for the seared venison cooking challenge. 
---
Still gotta get the cranberry grinder. Every scorchbeast I kill gives me brains and liver 😩
---
😅 where’s the fun in that?
---
No issue there. I am well under the weight limit.
---
Thanks for posting this.  I was about to buy this skin and thought to see if it worked on the dragon before I did.  Saved me some trouble.
---
Thanks, bud!  I have not played since I noticed my cooking recipes challenge was stuck at 2.  But I log in every once-in-a-while to see if it was fixed (not yet).
---
I would like this map for my camp, please! :)
---
you complain about remembering where your camp is, so its a simple solution
---
What exactly do you mean?
---
Do you have a link for the pictures?
---
Campfire tales and the two tadpole scout dailies all reward them.
---
Saw someone build right beside a train bridge, they even went so far as to build up and around the tracks for the "trains" of Appalachia to pass though. It would be nice to just section off a part of town to yourself.
---
Wow your camp must be in a really popular location. Mines in white springs and I manage to play instantly
---
Whoa, that's awesome!
---
Thats what I do too. If you server hop once you pick up everything it spawns you down the street from the station. It seems to be quicker then hobbling all the way haha.
---
You’ve played a thousand hours since pioneer scouts came out?
---
Let the Legendary re-heal up fully once you get it past half health. You killed the legendary to fast and the loot won't drop. Sometimes this helps with the drop.
---
what are you talking about? it just works. it's 2019, fallout 4 made over a half billion in pre-orders over 5 years ago. What do you want? oh, that's weird. a game that works. and watch this get me banned. yeah I do highly of myself. and that was bait but honestly I am with you. I have been playing since who cares and how many hours since 1997. The game works you are wrong and reddit will back them up. They dont even have instance figured out. What is the actual hell to all of us who have worked for a living since 1993, and paid money to who EVER. fuck us. You can't complain about your money spent you just have to take it.
---
It increases speed.  I have the perk and 2 power fists.  The one with increased swing speed is much faster.  Idk if it's additive, but it's definitely faster.
---
I've been wondering for a long time now where all the random tameable creatures are at. Just from playing I noticed certain random events would always be the spots to go for pets, but I've been assuming only certain ones spawned in certain areas? I only saw sloths in the mire for instance, but that spawn point would also have deathclaws, yao guai, and mirelurks. I never saw anything else there so I figured to get a basic dog or cat you'd need to stick to the forest spawns. I'm not sure anymore, but now I can find out.
---
I've been saying/hearing such nice shit in my playtime I forget people like this exist.
---
Absolutely REPULSIVE OP. REPULSIVE. You sick, greedy patriarchal demons should rot in HELL. If you're in the top 10% and your money isn't 100% funneled back into the economy for low level players, you're a racist piece of shit. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
---
Not really. For someone who likes to move their camps around a lot. Going on all 5 characters and moving my camp would be ridiculous every single time. Don’t think I’m complaining. Just stating it how it is. 🤷🏽‍♀️
---
Just save up for metal walls from vendor.  I think you are almost there.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
im getting 2-3 nukes a day on PC.
---
The gaming world's entitlement has officially come full circle.
---
No. It only affects derived stats. The ezception is sharing perks,in terms of charisma.
---
This^ It’s a gold mine for bones!
---
I'm good right now, just made a bunch. That and I'm not at home to trade.
---
Its gotta be something else...maybe something running in the background...something updating.  Before i was running my 2070 i hade the 970 in and had no problems at all.  Or someone is dupping.  Internet might be glitchy as well
---
I am level 195 or so and I only have things like the level 30 fixer and meteoric sword. If I'd had all great gear to use myself, sure I could dump any medium to better legendaries on vending I would get, but I dont so I can't, I got to keep them in hopes of being able to trade them for something better. It's also highly restrictive to list anything over few thounsands on your vending , as then you need to have the empty room in your "purse". And then if you would see a great legendary that really would work for you, on someones vending, but at 20k, you might not be able to get it.
---
I've also had the beer hat and clown suit on sale in case someone needs them for those silly challenges sometimes, although I think I took them off to use the slots for useless camp plans instead.
---
And then players can have huge piles of even decent legendaries on low level mules.
---
I do understand the idea is to use the level as approximation how useful or good the stuff the player might have, but really, would it work? I see high levels having decent legendaries but which are way overpriced. 
---
Just go trough different players a bit, take them as mystery boxes. You don't know what you get until you open up their vending machine.
---
Thank you for your quick response!
---
So is there any benefit to me switching from my current pa to unyielding armour? I tend to run a heavy weapons build although I do have a 3* bloodied spear for when things get up close and personal.
---
This makes me sad. I'll give you that it's a bug and needs fixed. My issue is that people expect loot 100% of the time and a harder enemy should give you that loot 100% of the time.
---
Gather round the fire while I tell you a story of ye olden days of EverQuest.
---
Long were the nights of killing the same enemies over and over to get a certain monster to spawn. But you didn't care cause you were with your friends or even a group of people you'd never played with just having a good time. Then the moment would come, the mob would spawn. You'd try your damndest to kill it as named monsters were significantly harder than everything else you had fought. Often requiring one or two party members to die and run all the way across Norrath to gather their things. The beast is slain. You right click the monster and it dropped all mundane gear. The item you sought was a 2% drop and often had more than 1 sought after item on it. 
---
Another tale of time.
---
72 people slammed into raids that lasted 6 hours or better 3 nights out of the week. (Yes to complete one raid) the money and xp from the monsters were shit. No gear drops until a boss was destroyed. You kill a boss after the 4th or 5th wipe about 1 death away from de leveling. One piece of raid gear drops.. and it's for your class... Now you have to beat out 5 other people for that one piece of gear.
---
All I'm saying is... If you want the best stuff. You should have to work a lot harder to get the best stuff. That's what makes it the best. Call it placebo difficulty add or whatever you'd like. It made the games fun because you along with so many others had to work so hard to get good stuff.
---
But my god it felt great when you did.
---
We've noticed if you crash in an elevator load the game again and fast travel near the target elevator but not at location then run to the location and it should be ok... Don't run too fast tho
---
What platform are you on?
---
OK.
---
No just adds damage from str, ap from agility etc.. but with full unyielding and a backpack I’m sure you’ll have more carry weight than excavator. I can get 500 carry weight with the high capacity backpack mod
---
Thats kind of my thinking too.  even at 600, I can only get 6 3\*'s and with my luck, I'd get nothing but pipe pistols.
---
Whitesprings usually has all of the wall plans
---
Again, just figure out what works for you. I believe all of the armor effects are properly explained just by the game. Weight reduction stuff caps at 90%, and all of them stack additively with the corresponding perk card (except for weapons, which stacks multiplicatively)
---
It does increase carry weight pretty good though!
---
Yeah, I know. But gosh dang people, calm down. (not you) 3 lvl 120+ big boys ganging up on a smol lvl 25/26.
---
Yeah, from my experience, it does seem that certain tameable animals/creatures only spawn in certain regions, but I haven't been able to find what determines that in the game files.
---
I once tamed a house cat at the location next to the fissure site that's southeast of The Whitespring, north of Uncanny Caverns.

Look up some performance fixes. There's lots of stuff you can do on PC in the config files to reduce unnecessary memory usage.
---
so basically you're making a declaration without any facts to back it up?
---
I have mine at 5 caps ( creating perceived value I guess) and they move but I remember 6 months ago just giving them away...or when everyone left them in the metal box outside the tattoo parlor. It feels like a million years ago lol.

Correct. Apologies. As long as I only reload while sneaking, Instigating does not break, if I reload without sneaking, I have to swap weapons to fix it.
---
Found some nice peeps to play with. They always offer help in doing my quests and what not. We added eachother on discord so we could have a "team" of 8+ players, so life is good. But ig it'd be really good and fun to finally convince one of my frendos to do that. Haven't had good luck so far.
---
(By do that I mean get the game)
---
No problem, It's an added bonus if there's another event waiting for you when you log back in.
---
Are you able to sell modded backpacks? Like high capacity backpack, lead lined backpacks, etc?
---
I am 100% freedom of speech, but you're wrong here. The player is using Bethesda's software, on Bethesda's server, and agreed to Bethesda's TOS. That player has no right to say that Bethesda can't stop them from saying whatever they want.
---
This games getting on my last fucking nerve
---
No. Since the fallout 76 came out. I’m just assuming death claw pelts have been there since launch. I’ve just never found one. Or maybe I just don’t remember.
---
Damn maybe go outside or something? Three days a long, long time to spend trying to overcome a glitch that isn't going to change, despite 3 days of attempts.

Could we stop padding our numbers with pipe rifles and hooded rags too?

I'm working on finding the possible locations for the Vendor Bot Responder, Trick-or-Treaters, and Civil War Reenactors.  If I ever figure that out, would you mind making one more map for it?
---
Similar here, and three star ranged weapons are super rare, majority of 2 and 3 star items are melee stuff or armor, like stalkers golf club, ghoul slayer armor etc.
---
American culture is well-know thanks to American movies and such. But I bet that some Fallout jokes about the consumerism and lifestyle of post-war America are seen here as "exxagerated-for-comedy" and not at all "merely pushed to the extreme logic of the era" jokes.
---
I remember finding in a Fallout 4 house a letter from the electricity company teling them they were testing experimental small reactor to feed them power and that it was safe and that "headaches and hair loos would be unrelated to the product" :p
---
I'm sure many people see this as an exxageration, but I'm pretty sure that an US company in the 1950 (or heck, even much later than that) could have wrote such a letter...
---
Sounds like an attempt at karma ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Over the river east of Harper's Ferry is Maryland and you can go there so I don't see why Ohio would be a problem.  The entire map is not all WV when you compare it to real life geography.  There'd technically be some Virginia too in the Cranberry Bog area.
---
You wouldn’t have been looking for them, so you probably wouldn’t have noticed, just autoscrapped them ;)

Why not

How much damage did you do? You have to do something like at least 1-2% of their health in damage to get kill credit for loot and XP.

No matter how you feel about MAGA right now, I feel like 2102 America is the exact right time for it.

Thanks for the info, you helped out quite a bit!

Probably. If I had only known! 😭😂

I respect your opinion as well. I'm just trying to cut back on the grind a little bit. There's no reason not to at the very least have the exams, and archry course market on the map. Basically anywhere there's a Mr. Handy counselor
---
You, are a genius. That worked. Thank you. Now, any idea if Bethesda knows about it?
---
Fucking. Voice. Of. Set.
---
Not worth it.
---
Perfect!
---
Glad I could help
---
I love these so much, so helpful
---
you dumb.
---
It does, but not additively. Most of those % reduction effects are not additive. So you aren’t reaching 100% damage reduction. So like, you have lone wanderer for 20% reduction. So you take 80% damage, now Emergency Protocols takes 50% of that 80%, so now you take 40% damage.

the chameleon mutation will not work unless you have ALL armor parts as weightless/unarmored

Same here and I go around and fix people's turrets too, just a nice thing I like to do
---
Ok. I don't know why he's avoiding you. 
---
Maybe he has changed. He's been running from me too lately as opposed to fighting me but since mothman week, where he was positively annoying (3 fights in 2hrs!) I've been appreciating the break.
---
He’s not dead yet, but he’s been up for me for almost an hour, I don’t know what his timer is!
---
I launched yesterday. No issues
---
this game always stutters and has issues for me, I think its just the game, because I play GTAV, Sekiro, Dark Souls 3, SC2, etc and have little to no issues ever with any of them, but FO76, regardless of settings seems to always have various issues, random CTDs, random crashing my entire PC, randomly uninstalling itself, randomly fucking up my sound so that I have to restart PC, random freezing, etc I've just chalked it up to the game must be poorly optimized to begin with.
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to have good enough error correction in itself from retrieving data from the servers.  The data became corrupted between the server and yourself.  This shows that Bethesda is using 32-Bit Unsigned Integers for Junk items.  As from some site.: "The 32-bit **unsigned int** data type can hold integer values in the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295."
---
This doesn't mean you have all that stuff.  It is just a display error.  Exit to main menu and re-enter the game usually fixes it.
---
Fallout 76 seriously needs some programmer loving and serious optimization.

The blade of Bassett is, but only if you don't have mods for the officer sword or can't make a ski sword.
---
what did you do?
---
There are a few things that point to Zetan involvement in the Appalachia. [Juicehead recently made a video about it.](https://youtu.be/ef6kIYGXfe0) 
---
I'm excited about it. Many quests in 76 have a very mysterious quality to them, and I hope that the Zetan quests follow a similar path.
---
What I'm about to say is just wishful thinking. 
---
What if a special select few individuals were abducted by Zetans? They'd be beamed to a ship along with other vault dwellers, where experiments would be conducted on them. Maybe some of them could be convinced to do things in service of the Zetans, and perhaps they could put other events into motion. 
---
I'd be really into a series of mysterious events that don't happen to all players. We'd hear stories from people that claim to have been abducted by aliens, and we'd see the effects of things that we aren't able to do through exclusive events that result in public events, and only a few people can trigger. The only problem I see here is how easy it is to record gameplay in 2019. But, Bethesda could curtail this eventuality by only selecting players that don't have high profile social media accounts, and then triggering an encounter with the Zetans where they discontinue their relationship with people that share too much video evidence. 
---
I think that'd be really neat.
---
Also the "there is nothing to support this object"  or "nothing is selected" and the infanous "part of structure would become inaccessible"
---
All things I still come across, had the last one happen when placing /removing foundations...even after building a wall/roof and stairs, and removing them, I had to replace my Camp.
---
My main can float there easily once I’m out of the mine (Marsupial + Bird Bones + jetpack). My second character will use this though. Even with a lot of AP, it’s a boring little walk.
---
Instead of repairing the pipes, lockpick the door on the left and hack the level 3 terminal to override the lockdown. It takes half the time to do and is much easier.
---
I got the windmill plan
---
Thanks I guess? I didn't mean for my post to come across as bragging, just sort of stating that maybe OP isn't landing on the right servers. That said, if you're on xbox send me your GT and I'll let you pick where I launch the next one.
---
How do they not know?
---
They probably can't take on players the same level as theirs. I've seen this on adventure mode too
---
My door is always left open so I constructed a half fence all the way around the entrance with no gate so you just jump over it to get in, so far that has kept all the annoying enemies out
---
Glitch?
---
Can you get rid of the old wires? I tried to rewire but couldn’t figure it out.
---
I keep thinking
---
Any day now.. they are coming out with a song store in the Aromic Shop. Big inventory, all songs 30/atomic points each. With a different 3 songs put in a weekly pack for 50/atomic points. (One more popular and 2 meh)
---
That letter is great example. Also, little things, like the children’s toys and school supplies you find as junk to scrap that contain lead and asbestos. Lol. Very dark humor. And even though it is an exaggeration, it is funny. Why? Because it’s true.
---
I find that odd too. Like pistols could use some armor pen cards and give the wr to rifles. Also just need more pistols. My guy is sneaky and after the sommer set 44... I have yet to find a single AP pistol in 30 lvls. I just keep rebuilding my pipe revolver every 5 lvls.
---
A progression system you admit goes nowhere is not a progression system.  Jesus.
---
New music in general... been listening to the same songs for 4 games
---
oh just existing items like lamps and the plushy dolls, floor decorations and the like, all in the camp build menu. the actual "junk" display hasnt arrived yet.
---
I leave a bag with raw fertilizer and glowing blood
---
Link is not working
---
I mean if you can't see someone stealth boii attacling you your new to the series or need glasses because its a pretty obvious ripple in the air

If it is, they'd have a lot of items and low level or not, if you've got a lot of stuff, I'll visit.
---
"Oh hey look a human shaped water texture"
---
That’s what I’m saying the catalog is decent but on the PS4 I hear the same songs when I know there’s other but yes BETHESDA please add more music
---

---
I don't care about your opinion, or that of any internet stranger's.  Just pointing out why what you're doing here is never going to accomplish what you'd like it to.
---
Instead of begging strangers to gimp their characters, spend time petitioning (one way or another) the developers to fix the broken game.  Pretty simple.
---
Have other thoughts on the subject?  Cool, contribute them to the void, I will never read them.  This is the way it is my friend, figure it out and try to make the change you want, or cry to strangers that will never listen.  I can virtually guarantee you not a single "please don't do ______" post actually changes anyones behavior in the game.  Not that any meaningful amount of players are reading this garbage, anyway.
---
Yeah that seems fair. That's what I think too, the stuff I used to just drop back in the day I pretty much have the same thought. Caps are too easy to get anyway and I get tired of fighting that 25k max caps stash.
---
If you take the workshop, you should have control over the wires and power connectors that are already there
---
No.
---
Also Firefly. Gorram it.
---
I have Weightless BOS Combat Chest, Arms, legs and am invisible when my weapon is drawn and I’m perfectly still.
---
I think they've removed some songs since launch.
---
I know I’ve noticed that and it completely sucks
---
Same I spent so much time on my living space why would I lock it so people can't see it? And when people lock all their workbenches behind a door and just leave the stash outside that pisses me off so much.
---
I would love to know the concrete answer to this. I don't remember seeing no star legendaries before a couple patches ago and now it seems that's what I get more often than anything else.
---
Black Diamond &gt; Blade of Bastet iirc
---
Then again, fallout havent been an online game. Way different then playing a single player game
---
Good to know. I need them to craft serums
---
This is uplifting and all, but then you remember it's only because millions were duped. And it puts real traders out of business because trying to sell them on (this isn't as big a deal with mutations as it is weapons) is useless. Nobody will buy anything these days unless it's a two shot explosive, which were all duped. I've got a 100 decent legendaries just sitting in my vendor for dirt cheap, but because it's not a two shot explosive, nobody cares. #LegitTraderLife
---
I just use stealthboys on them in return.

Killed it. 2 star level 1 golf club.

Yep, as i mentioned, i tried that, and it did nothing. The quest still wanted us to repair pipes.

I have a waitlist marine left arm that does the exact same thing the waitlist effect does not work on it, it's glitched

I have a Anti Armour 33% vats hit chance Gauss Rifle for 1200 obo caps on Xbox if you're still interested.
---
my camp is right by a train station, so if they travel and get stuck they could fast travel right across the tracks. but everyone ive seen shows up out in the open or in my garden. took me a while to realize what was going on, people would just stare at my razorgrain for a minute or two lol.
---
You only need to complete 76 to get the challenge I have both the weapons and armor challenge completed
---
If you're doing some data mining though would you mind finding the plasma grenade plan and where or how it spawns ? Can't find any data for that except that it's in the after you poop from completing events I've completed 413 events now I have them all logged and not a single one has given me the plan

Charisma sharing is based upon derived stats. I'm able to share level 3 perks based upon my unyielding charisma of 19. I'm not limited to level 1 perks based on my base charisma of 4.

You said I'm wrong and then said what I said. I literally said that when a ToS is involved there is no freedom of speech. I am right and so are you because we said the same thing dude.

Not quite. Public accommodation laws are worth looking into, if you're curious. Made social gains possible for people of color and people with disabilities, in many ways.

I do the same and I also close them if I done use them lol

Thanks!!

Yup its true. 2 radios and a jukebox in my camp, the jukebox is always on and both radios are off everytime I log in.
---
*You *are dumb. You shouldn't call someone dumb when you can't even seem to form a sentence.
---
All my armor parts are weightless; including the chest piece -- so I'm guessing its bugged.
---
Thanks for noting the distinction between legendary vs. mutation -- shooting and remaining cloaked sounds like a win.
---
I have 4 machines full of stuff on my other character for sale that's all level 50 legendaries 1 2 and 3 star, plans, mods and tonnes of chems and that characters level is only 23, couldn't store all that stuff on my main to sell and still be able to play properly, I think an alternative option would be to be able to view the most expensive product and the cheapest when you hover over a players camp on the map it would give a feel for the quality of goods they have and if it's worth your time.
---
Ahhh, gotcha. I probably just got lucky.
---
This right here. TSEs should forcibly sell for no more than 300 caps just because there's about 3 legit ones still in circulation. So annoying because it's ALL anyone buys.
---
If you're primarily running heavy weapons, the problem with going from power armor to unyielding armor is losing the stabilized perk and it's added heavy weapon armor penetration. That perk doesn't work in normal armor. Your melee (spear) would be more damaging in unyielding armor due to the massive strength boost.
---
Yes me too!!
---
If you dotn say it's because of race or sex or whatever  you can deny service. You can literally say "I'm going to have to ask you to leave the premises" with no explanation at all.
---
And STOP STEALING MY WATER!  I have 2 industrial purifiers. One is locked for me, the other is open for you. I need the water. That's why it is locked. I would build a 3rd, but I don't think it will solve the problem. I provide you with as many resources as I can. You have a full shop to use, but if something is locked, STAY OUT! \*sigh\*

I changed it and it's really good now so wanted to know what yours was at.
---
Agreed Ban them from the game and X-Box live. No one wants that nonsense.
---
ive read reports of people wearing helmets and them counting as armor against the mutation, despite being mostly cosmetic
---
It appears that you now have a stupendously large amount of junk... well, likely not... just saying.
---
Sadly it didn't work. The robot in Dolly Sods gives me more random dialogue and the Stings and Things quest doesn't start.
---
Because there is no perfect build unfortunately. I’m constantly swapping cards in and out.
---
Let’s hope for a quick swap save system in the base game or perhaps making some of the skills passive, I highly doubt the latter would ever happen though.
---
Personally, I’d happily grind out multiple levels of of lockpicking, hacking, home defense, etc. if they were passively active. 
---
Swapping the cards that are that specific can become quite tedious.
---
Not sure why they are attacking you but most lvl 50+ players dony carry much if anything that a lvl 5 can use or even afford for that matter.
---
Modify it and should work properly
---
Ill have to look next time i play.  Have company over and wife would kill me

Kill mutants, sell assault rifles.

They use them to avoid vats which doesn't require skill either

I got my fusion generator plan from starting up Monongah. Thunder Mountain gives you the wind turbine plan.
---
It's my understanding each time you get a different generator plan. So assuming you had none, you'd have to complete like 4-5x before you reached fusion generator.
---
You can counter them :)
---
I'm not a base builder so I didn't know about this, thanks!
---
It's not Charlie specifically, it's that particular silo on that server. I've encountered it a few times and it's just a heck tonne of lag. Server hop usually fixes it for me.
---
This is starting to sound like it just glitches out on me. I haven’t really had it happen yet. Guess it figures the first time is after something I spent 40 minutes doing.
---
Grow thicker skin.
---
I pop into survival on occasion for the weekly challenges, it's pretty chill unless you're actively looking for PVP. I've had way more unwanted PVP encounters in adventure mode.
---
idk what you're doing wrong, I did the "Repair the Monongah Power Plant" quest around 3 times back at release and instantly had the Fusion Generator plans.
---
You mean how you listed some Zetan enemies and how youd like to go over the River when you didn't even know it was Ohio? Get off your high horse
---
Ok but I never do those.  It's not important, I just thought they'd be quests like everything else.
---
They shouldn't work once you've hit the other person, its just a cheap way to get around being bad at PvP.
---
Yup, this one worked for me too... thanks!
---
Yes and no. Cases have been won based on reasonable premise (ex. only people of a specific race are consistently asked to leave, even without a stated reason, as you put it)
---
If a group of nuns walk in from their bus while on a pilgrimage, and you deny them service, a similar claim may well win on the basis of religion. Lot of grey areas in the law
---
Seeing that all on the map is awesome. Seems like a LOT of content.

Just repair the different power plants, they always reward a generator plan in my experience. Not sure if you can get it by doing one repeatedly.

I heard that modifying may result in it not working properly. Guess you'll Just have to try.

I stripped and added piece by piece to see which one triggered me back to visible -- and it's a weightless marine armor chest piece, 2-star: +1 intelligence, weightless. (Incorrectly identified it as +1 endurance in the main post).
---
Right!!
---
Yeah, you're right, I did. You DO have to be on a high horse to assume everyones got it out for you and they want all that you make.

I think I like that idea even more. Finding various plans for different kinds of arms/legs/guns like you could in fallout 4.
---
It's a deliberate design choice so that you can't use it to look around corners or down corridors and get an advantage in combat.
---
I did the event were you summon a friendly moth man and wore my pink Asylum Worker dress and the hat that matches it and it worked for me

If I may ask, how much did you pay? I thought I'd give it a shot since I know how to craft shocks. I've got a set of Excavator and a set of X-01 legs in my machine for 1250 each leg. Thanks.

You get one unknown generator plan each time you complete the Powering Up events, so after four you'll definitely have the fusion generator plan.

---
Lvl 50 is like the teenage years, just enough power to flex (on newbs mostly) but not enough to make an impact anywhere else. Most veteran players imo are 120+ and will more often than not try and help noobs instead of griefing them.
---
I see. Just wondering because I have a Bloodied, SS Combat Knife that shreds but I want something like a Bloodied Super Sledge or DCG with power attack as a secondary for larger creatures. I’ll do a little testing later when I get on, thank you for the input though!
---
i think it must be 100% repaired
---
I had this go 2 days until I realised just needed to clear your games cache if on Xbox turn the power of at the wall and press the on button till the light stops, If your on pc I would assume you know more about clear your own cache then me and PS4 I assume something similar to Xbox.
---
I would do the same thing if I could
---
I have a few days off coming up, I can try and organise a time that suits us both if you wanted
---
I’ve never found one on a deathclaw, though that would make sense. I’ve only ever just gotten meat, black titanium and gears from killing them.
---
Yes, so probably don’t buy 3-star armor from the Purveyor unless you’re ready to trek buggy wood armor back into the vending machine.
---
Ah yes concrete
---
I like not knowing. Kinda brings back the fun of lucking out and getting something rare.
---
LOL.  That’s awesome.  And a great idea.  I am usually wearing Nuka-cola gear and sometimes give away free Nukanades
---
You can’t remember 5 CAMP locations? Btw I personally spend so much time building a CAMP that I can never forget where it is. Perhaps a solution would be to spend more time at your CAMP? Or buy better eyes to spot your CAMP faster on the map?
---
You're a legend, thanks!
---
I love this idea
---
Yep watched a dude called callmekevin on YouTube play morrowind in 2019 and he didn't have a clue what to do because he didn't read a thing..... welcome to 2019 were even simple task need a quest marker.
---
Especially when we have certain challenges set up to follow. There should be a quick access to those. Having to scroll down through all the challenges sucks.
---
My running day and hour count are almost exclusively spent farming tool boxes with a side order of Whitesprings ghouls.
---
Ye straight jackets
---
That seems really odd and kinda sad on their part. How bad are their skills that they feel the need to pick fights with someone unable to truly fight back? I’ve mostly noticed instances of higher levels going out of their way to help lower levels, and enjoy doing so myself actually.  Whenever the chance arises, I try to just drop stuff that I think will be helpful when I encounter low levels, simply because it feels good to do so. Even my vending machine stuff is priced low so those just starting out and with limited caps can still load up. That’s part of what I love about this game. The community is, by and large, friendlier and more helpful than most gaming communities it seems, but I know there are jackass exceptions.
---
Refers to a Ms. Nanny in Berkley Springs. You can also find the Davis Family's residence with correspondence on a terminal about the Ms. Nanny.
---
I'm glad you do.
---
That may well be it. Hadn't thought of that.   
---
Foundations \*can\* stack of you do the following with proper terrain
---
\*FOUNDATION\*
---
STAIR
---
Top foundation is built over to become the ceiling of your base, middle tier becomes the walls, bottom tier is your floor. Allowed courtesy of new floating-foundation rules in last patch
---
*Because it is my thought.* The only thing your post and mine have in common is Zetan in Ohio. Thats it. Literally man, I didn't see your post. I don't stalk this subreddit, much less look for people's posts to nab. Doing dishes is a boring chore, but getting to imagine a cool scenario in 76 kind of makes it go faster.
---
Pressure plate? No.
---
So I’m pretty sure that each power plant is equally likely to award all the generator plans. But if you don’t learn the other plans (large gen, windmill), then they’ll still be options for drops at the end of Powering Up (blah). So if you’ve been hanging onto those other plans, learn them.
---
Also you can just buy the plan from the vendor bot in Camden Park.
---
Weird. Fallout 76 bugged?  Crazy
---
The problem is that everyone only goes to one feeder rather than trying to spread out so none of the other creatures are able to do anything
---
I've seen them back in the early days of the game, november/december 2018. I just assumed they were a bug at the time because there were so many other bugs around them. The fact that they're still around makes it seem like they're intentional, but they are so strangely designed that I still doubt it
---
Step one: select your spot
---
Step two: drop a genny and vendor
---
Step three: have a friend fast travel to your shop (not to you)
---
Step four: note where they spawn and what direction they are facing
---
Step five: layout your shop accordingly
---
Step six: ...
---
Step seven: profit!
---
Absolutely annoying. I like the fact that we have a radio with the Pip-boy but.. 
---
1- there isn’t enough songs
---
2- it doesn’t take too long to get bored of them all
---
3- sometimes I feel like I’m hearing only 2-3 different tracks over and over again
---
Would be great if Bethesda could change/mix the songs every month.
---
U can even move a few steps and still be cloaked. I have a weightless/ chameleon mutation setup aswell
---
Nonetheless.. your idea isn't even remotely original! Going on a boat and traveling off to another land isn't that original in the Fallout universe. I'll admit, mine isn't original either for that very same reason. Let's just agree to disagree.
---
Thank you! It must be intermittent.. wonder if Bethesda is working on a fix
---
I'm having the same issue. A few things have registered, but several others have not. Wolves and legendaries just won't register for the ash heap photo challenge. Other photo challenges are not giving me any trouble, strangely. Also on PS4.
---
you can buy the plans from the enclave for about 200 caps if you decide to give up grinding for one. in the production center. same area as the X-01 mod plans
---
You have to read all the other generator plans and then you're guaranteed to get the fusion generator to spawn I can spawn in a random order but you will get duplicates of each until you've read them when you power up a power station I constantly get dupes of the fusion generator to sell because I purposely didn't read it on that character
---
Thank you!
---
It would be more informative, but tbh the pricing strategies some people use are worse than rng. They might have a great selection but go like 5 times “normal” asking price. Or show what seems like a “meh” assortment when you hover on the icon, but you get there and it’s all good stuff dirt cheap. Sorry but that one little square on the map is never going to tell you if it’s worth the trip. For now you just have to peek inside every machine and see what turns up...
---
It wasn't 3 straight days,or trying the same thing over and over. I would get on, fiddle around with designs for an hour or so, tearing down and rebuild something new. Crack the shits with it and get off, try again next day. Eventually got it going and turned out to be, i think, one of my best builds yet. It just didn't need to be quite so hard. I do promise i went outside and got some air in between. Lol.
---
Lmao I love the assumptions I don’t spend time at my camp 😂 that’s just a ridiculous comment. I found a solution. 
---
Go to map. 
---
Press down in the left stick. 
---
“Are you sure you want to fast travel to you camp?” 
---
You’re telling me you wouldn’t utilize that? 🤷🏽‍♀️ wonder why my flair was set at suggestion. Jfc.
---
So you have a gap that you put a wall over with a window, and they used a workbench to teleport in. I do it a lot.
---
Also thanks for the info on foundations now thought they fixed the bunkers
---
It seems way more likely that you saw mine and copied it but what ever. Regardless you're ideas for the way it would work arent bad. Here is my Original post about it with some ideas of my own...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2mdki/a_zetan_invasion_front/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Specific locations for the spawn are server-side, not client. We can't datamine that
---
I'd forgotten about the Camden Park bot. If I don't get it after trying the other plants, I'll drop by there. Many thanks!
---
This, it’s always a problem with individual instances of silos. The scripting in those zones stretches the capabilities of the engine, it seems, which makes them fragile contraptions on an already stressed server.
---
Seriously though think of a fallout game where one terminal was linked to 18 turrets.
---
Yes. A couple of steps. And you can shoot and swing a Melee weapon and stay cloaked.
---
Good way to up sell dieses cures.
---
Plus i had a kinda maze only cause everyone with marsupial jumped the walls and missed all the signs and jumped into the workshop area. While i had the shop closed off. 
---
But it is fun to watch people walk in a circle like were do i go???
---
Ha hahha that must have taken so long!
---
There is atoms you can earn for having all the diseases! I only need 4 more. Lol
---
I never said anything about going off on a boat.
---
Bullys exist every where their are fragile egos and people who where not hugged enough as kids.
---
People do stupid things all the time in game because unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at ii, allows that kind of game play and is even encouraged
---
I stopped taking workshops because people would take them back to initiate pvp with me then gave their friends gank me.
---
Pvp in this game is broken and people take advantage of it 
---
But don't let it get you down their are plenty of people who actually try to help out other players since you know this is a mmo.
---
I memorized almost the entire game, when I played it on the original Xbox I kept notes and wrote down all locations. Then I found a guide book and spent months annotating it with what I already knew and cross referencing all the quest, map and detail pages. Wish I never lost that guide. My biggest problem going back to playing it now is the controls and how restrictive they are.
---
Never saw that, but cool ideas. Also, how else would you get across the river? Using a boat.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I agree with what you're saying. There is just 1 problem with what you are saying. Everquest. Wow. Pretty much any MMO has a fixed loot pool. I wish this game had one but as far as I can tell it doesn't. So even if something had a one percent drop rate you knew what to farm. In this it's just hope for the best.
---
It’s a bone mine for golds!
---
The river is very thing. The Mothman bridge goes over it and it would only take 2 seconds to swim across.
---
I know games can disable video recording on PS4. 
---
Apex Legends always kills my recording option at the loading screen
---
The bridge is destroyed, though. Still, traveling across water onto another land isn't too uncommon in Fallout.
---
If you don't own a workshop and don't shoot back then they can't damage you, just annoy you
---
What the hell? So, I said perhaps, that’s just an idea more than anything else.  And don’t call my comment ridiculous that’s not very kind. I was trying to help you, and now I feel like you’ve just wasted my time. And I didn’t catch the end of your comment.. plus that “jfc” I guess you’re swearing?
---
Right? At least put them at top :)
---
I found that the vault tec labcoat goes extremely well with the fedora.
---
So do the "scene" type spawn cryptids like Mothman and the flatwoods monster?
---
I don't think that's a bug. There are a lot of Legendary enemies, and I don't think they want all of them to drop Legendaries. This could also be why they drop drills.  
---
If that's the case, I'd recommend making a new classification of enemy that behaves like a Legendary, and is meant to add additional challenge, but not have a guaranteed Legendary drop. Maybe call them Mutated, since the defining combat behavior of Legendary enemies is their ability to 'Mutate' and regain their health.
---
If they did this, they'd have the opportunity to make Legendary enemies truly Legendary, and a challenge worthy of a Legendary drop.
---
Hmm, mind sending me a screenshot?
---
Then maybe run between some of them.  Fast travel is not as ridiculously taxing as some people like to say it is unless you abuse it.  Fast travel is not meant to be used to rapidly hop around the map back-to-back.  If that was easier under this system, people would be hopping between quest objectives without a second thought skipping dangers and obstacles that one *should* expect in the wasteland.
---
In short, fast travel shouldn't be easy or convenient.  It's a logical trade-off sacrificing currency instead of time and possibly hostile encounters.
---
Out of all the things you could jesus christ this game about the non unified vendor reset is what gets it?
---
This is true. All I know is that when you 1st get the game and open up the map, that shit is false advertising man. The mao is only like half the size it shows because the boundaries are no where near the edge.
---
Yes. So don’t buy armor until a fresh day with a new script limit.
---
Then sell the 3* wood back to the script machine before you logout.
---
I’ve never followed this strategy... but it’s definitely the right way to do it.
---
Anndddd you avoided my question, so I got my answer! 😂
---
Ahh alright. I should be on then. Yeah, that’ll be great.
---
No worries, turns out it's nothing.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
Good luck friend.
---
I've been posting a running series of posts about how long I've been looking forward for one. Day 6 - hour 16. 
---
Never cred about it till the back pack. Have played less and less lately because I want that GD back pack, and it makes my playing essentially a tool box farming run. Boring AF.
---
To be clear, it is a solid block of foundations/upper floors. No walls or anything else breakable that is in the structure. But they may have been able to see a workbench at one of the corners, where things line up 100% by Bethesda standards.
---
A side-view

So is it spawn on a random location or does it spawn as a reward from an event is all I wanted to figure out. if it's from a random location I'll keep searching random locations if it's from an event or certain areas event I'll keep farming events in that area, 
---
Or do you mean you can't find out any info on where it spawns. If that's the case. Can you find out if it's still a possible drop or was it accidentally removed like a few other things that they have had to replace like bos combat plans at Grafton station. 
---
I just need to see some light at the end of the tunnel so to speak lol
---
These motherfuckers are already holed up at home and they want to Peapod their in-game items.
---
Story quests and craft a lot
---
I can handle that, but it was the Sheepsquatch horn, rubber, and wasteland oil by my Nuka-Girl poster that concerned me.
---
Yeah that lol
---
I crave to go over there, but the notorious alert pops up saying I cannot go further. I wanna set up my grandpa's lakehouse where the spot is oh so visible around the top of the map.
---
&gt;You do have the option of not saying anything if you don't agree with post content, you know this right?
---
Ah, censorship, the rallying cry of fascists.
---
Is there a YouTube video on how to build this or something. I’m not quite following and it sounds like the old bunkers they had in the beginning of the game
---
That's great, I'll have to up my game it seems
---
I’m intrigued about this. I have a quad that I’d like to use. I’m think automatic. My tse tesla is modded to a shotgun now.
---
Yeah, it seems like it'd be fairly easy to control on consoles. But PC is a different story. And most people have the ability to whip out their phone and record a video. 
---
The Zetans would have to make it very clear that they will cut ties with their operatives in the event that they leak too much information. The benefits of doing their bidding would have to be substantial enough to make fake internet points the less desirable option.
---
I bought mine at the vendor in harpers ferry.
---
Considering I got all the plans from the one power plant, this is wrong.
---
You were asking me why I would not use a feature such as the one you’re suggesting here? I would, because convenient things are always welcome. I never said that you had a bad idea. I was talking about how you could have less trouble remembering the locations of your CAMPs until such feature is eventually added.
---
Good to know. Thank you.
---
yea good luck to you too
---
You'd miss out on a lot. Many people (myself included)  put their sellables on a shop mule. So you'd pass by because it's level 4 while everyone else bought out the good inventory ;)
---
The game could have the most supreme camp editor and the game would still be dominated by "ugly" camps.
---
Do the mama dolce event it'll give you 5 food items that'll give a 5% xp boost for two minutes ( i know its not a whole lot , but it's better than nothing). Also do a bunch of side missions, and events while using the food items  that i suggested above.Although being in a squad does help alot since charisma perks are for being in squad
---
It will just take time for people to get used to it like Encryptid and SBQ kills. 
---
Plus the encounter really isn't that intuitive so people need to see it a few times or explore arkos when the event is not active.
---
I've played most of the game alone, only teaming up with some friends at launch. Lone wanderer perk is nice, and just load spamming areas for loot/ammo. Cliffwatch is a decent place to get weapons, ammo, raider power armor. It also spawn magazines and bobbleheads on occasion. Middle of map, South east east of Flatwoods.
---
My game usually crashes after I see that issue.
---
Stick to farming forest quests until you hit a highr level.  Remember to sleep when you log on to get the extra XP bonus. Try to hit the lighthouse quest as fast as possible too. Even if high level player spawn in near you it won't effect the enemies lvl like when you are in the bog or the mire.
---
How is what I said censorship?  Telling someone that they don't have to give negative feedback to an idea that they don't agree with in the first place is not censorship, it's rather common sense.  Censorship is an OP telling someone they are not allowed to give feedback.  There's a difference and you should learn the two.
---
I've always thought of camouflage as ugly, especially in FO but it's entirely opinion based
---
Yeah I didn’t mean to come off as bitter as the original post made it sound, sorry.
---
Feels like they were going to do something with it and then the money men said "relase this shit now".
---
Wendigo comes from Sinking Feeling which you have to read the magazine article at the rangers camp near cranberry bog which sends you to Scoots Shack and the quest bread crumbs from there.
---
More people should just be more resourceful too.  Don't see any nearby camps?  Jump servers and get a new group of CAMPs.  This is especially effective in the Savage Divide between Top of the world, Whitesprings, and the monorail elevator, which seems to see the highest concentration of player shops.
---
I don't know why but this made me laugh so hard
---
Yes. Worst case scenario you get rid of weapons you weren’t going to use for a chance at something you will. Unless you can’t sell 1400c worth of stuff to the vendors there’s nothing else to do with garbage legendaries
---
Yeah. Buying a new set of eyes is possible. 🙄Demeaning me for not being able to remember 5 camp locations. Assuming I spend no time in my camp. Bragging about how much time you spend in yours? Where’s the advice again?
---
Yeahh.. :/
---
Honestly, you can't just go through the main quest. Eben Top of the World has to be sidestepped partway through because it takes into the more difficult areas. Events, side quests, dailies - anything to get experiences. And be careful which enemies you choose - snallygasters and the like can spit out nasty poisons, so even low levels aren't really low levels. Same with the yao gois and their staggering.
---
I need you people to stop this right now
---
Literally my boyfriend in *this* game. He rushes through quest without reading terminals and notes and then complains he doesn’t understand the story. I guess I love him anyway smh
---
Damage is real low on the automatic. Then again, maybe I dont care on the medics.
---
Right but you said you didn’t agree with that. I thought that is what we were talking about.
---
Perhaps someone could build one for your camp did have to be a team buddy.
---
I like the concept but do think the exchange rate is too high.
---
But you didn't do anything...
---
Farm the Forest and Toxic Valley
---
We already have thousands and thousands of aliens. 
---
They speak Spanish, disturbingly enough.
---
Spend more time in your time, look around. Train your brain so you can memorize things better. I’m was not bragging, I was sharing with you the main reason why I think I’m memorizing my CAMPs.
---
Lol no worries I feel you. I've ran it a few times now and the range of coordination with people is either somewhat non verbal organization of who goes where to protect what.
---
To the normal chaos of people living on habitat letting it instantly die then Killing the alpha spawn. Which is anti-climatic because I like completing things and not just wasting my time.
---
If you can shoot me the coords then sure! Oh and Reddit only notifies if you're tagged in comments I think. Don't know why
---
Ok. To sexual?
---
I guess it wouldn't hurt, but a player's level has almost no bearing on whether or not I visit their camp. If they're near some place I'm heading anyway, I'll go check out their stock regardless of what the map display says. If they're camped in bumblefuck I'll take a moment to look at the display and *maybe* try to find them in the map, but if I see a bunch of stuff in a category I'm looking for I'll travel regardless.
---
I have enough cash that the travel cost is meaningless, and sometimes places without much stock will have a handful of awesomeness. Today I went to a camp easy the fuck out of the way I the mire. The only thing it lasted was "misc" and I was curious. I ended up snagging 30+ serums for below market value and 11 nuke ketcards for 100 caps each.
---
I love it but… it doesn’t say “TARDIS” on the outside, ftr.
---
I agree that it what is in place but I do not entirely agree that it SHOULD be in place.
---
Just dropping in. Glad to have helped dude!
---
Great Idea, actually.
---
I concur
---
What's werid is I've hit enemies that randomly turn into legendaries like the game decides the mob pack needs one. Or non legendary creatures dropping one 🌟  items.
---
I'd rather this be in the data tab in our pipboy so we can look at anytime. Because if it's a camp placed thing we can just hit the bench.
---

---
I have asked a few people in the two days that I have been playing the game and so far only two people agreed, but only one was any use
---
Wait until you’re on a server that is dropping good legendary loot. Then go try your luck. It seems to help. I’ve got some crazy explosive, vampire, and ts lately by doing that. Most everything else has been script fodder.
---
Bro then stop answering 🤷🏽‍♀️ no tears here
---
This game is on three platforms and ammo is plentiful. If you’re having trouble staying stocked on ammo, kill more of the mobs that use your preferred ammo type or switch guns.
---
There are 2 green camos one is ugly as fack and the other actually looks like camo...think its forest camo.  If thats whats in there id say go for it!
---
I've never even considered that.  Good call thanks!
---
Whats in it for me
---
True. I switched my tse to auto and it was terrible compared to my handmade rifles. Shotgun is great... at killing me.
---
So much good stuff in here lol
---
Yes! Thank you for making my dream come to life! Great job! Now, is there a way to easily output a list of all the possible encounters by category? I was going to copy and paste them all but playing the game takes priority lol
---
Nothing past level 50 matters if you planned your build correctly, and even then, most will only need another 20 levels maximum to correct their mistakes.
---
If a higher level player is in the area you need to go to don’t go there. Everything will be adjusted to the higher lvl. Enemies will be bad.
---
I honestly feel like players have turned into asses since the vending machines. Went to one camp had to go up 4 flights of stairs,  then when I found the little room the machines where in; the owner swapped the doors out for walls so I was trapped inside!! Some guy comes to my camp starts shooting my brahmin all my crops and vending machines! Waves at me and leaves! 0_o
---
It works
---
Cats spawn at the billboard near whitesprings. To the north. Follow RR track north from 98 NAR Regional. Look to your right as you walk. Billboard will be on cliff above you. 1–4cats nearly always there.
---
I've been told no but I haven't tried it myself
---
its BGS garbage.   Just equip any weapon (from pipboy, because wheel can't be brought up in this state) and it frees you.
---
BGS sucks.  ass.
---
Wow you are gorgeant.
---
So? How's a political line anywhere near literal racist/bigotry?
---
How do you double like a post
---
Or just allow us to play our own music through the pip-boy.
---
Maybe they just want to teach them the harsh realities of the wasteland, or maybe they were irritated by constant pestering to trade their good shit away. I always have noobs swarming me, spamming trade after an event, usually when the BE laser rifle comes out to melt a boss.
---
Yea pretty much. Can't think of anything else other than buggy melee hitreg
---
Welcome to the club, your jacket and member card is in the mail
---
My dearest affection
---
Where do you find the plans for the rad shower?
---
I guess. I’ve bought 12 3 star melee’s and every one was dogshit. Bought 5 ranged &amp; got all shit as well but you can just turn them back into scrip just at a 60 scrip loss per item for 3 star weapons. Sucks I knew it’d be rng but this is worse than rng I’ve seen maybe 10 weapons that were from the vendor &amp; had good rolls. Obviously not every player has reddit or posts their good finds but just on a small scale your chances are bar none
---
anyone think the patriot skin will ever return?
---
Found it by accident post-patch, no video that I know of. Add me on PC if you'd like to see for yourself (IGN: ArkCountess)
---
Definitely noticed it too, but when you go through the trouble to launch one a lot of people show up usually
---
For real. People always leave mine on.
---
Id buy it  for 12k in a heartbeat, and you are shortsighted person, and considering what you proudly admited you said like you were seeking applause, you are a toxic person too.
---
Your opinions about the prices are ridiculous. The prices for pixel items as with all other commodities are driven by demand. I seen a guy offering 60k for a weapon like one of mine and noone responded!
---
Look for a friend and try to find a good weapon with a lot of ammo and kill everything everywhere that is your lvl or higher.  They’ve removed all XP farms except the event monster mash which still works well if ya know the right spots to camp, but...shit sure gets boring.  Just find a friend n kill, literally the best way now.
---
But why? If you came into my house, I have the right to ask you to leave if you are behaving poorly. Just because you paid a business money doesn’t negate that. so WHY?
---
I see your point.
---
To be fair, it's plainly stated what you are getting yourself into when claiming a workshop.
---
Well damnit now my curiosity is piqued.
---
You can try, but you will fail. The first is because, morally speaking, people may boycott your goods/services and you will go out of business. I've seen this happen many times. This is why so many businesses focus on customer service and have hard line stances against discrimination of ANY kind in their HR departments. As shameless as some people may be, they are a 'customer' and their money is as green as anyone's.
---
The second is because as a business owner, legally speaking, you may not deny equal access to goods/services under a neutral public accommodations law. However, the supreme court has ruled in favor of sincere religious beliefs and denying access to goods/services. In such cases, many businesses would prefer to not spend time and money litigating matters like this. Period. It's just not worth it and it's bad for business on both sides (internally and externally).
---
Regardless, freedom of speech is misunderstood by many. Constitutionally speaking, and as already mentioned, it protects from government interference. North Korea definitely does not have free speech. Got a problem with 'dear leader?' Speak a word of it and you will likely wind up dead along with the rest of your family. That's what constitutional free speech protects against. It's not an umbrella to be used anytime you wish. Obviously, there's way more to it, but I'm going to go play some FO76 now.
---
Google bud
---
Yes you are right but, but this is adventure mode, I'm not trying to get in fights
---
Without making this political, it's not that. Using the word again means it was and isn't anymore, whatever the reasons that are implied
---
I always carry one salt and a single piece of raw fertilizer for just such occasions.  Some acts like a dick, drop them a bag with one piece of fertilizer in it.  Someone gets whiny and lame, drop a bag with one salt in it.  Of course the "pew pew" emote goes along with it.
---
I've also left bags with a skull on people's beds when their camp is blocking or poaching ghoul spawns at the Whitespring, usually on the green behind Artisan's Row.
---
Mailboxes are on their way apparently.
---
No but with class freak it’s not really noticable
---
Of course, though I do have some wonderful people here that could help me too. Plus I’m kind of not in the mood of not messing it up
---
That helps. I didn't think about deathclaw at the fissure. I kept looking for a wolf or mutant hound to finally complete that. Granted I only tried for like an hour. Lol
---
Near my camp is a object type scene. I go there every time I log on. Sometime there is an crashed satellite, sometimes 2 deathclaws with 5 supermutants armed with miniguns and sometimes even a an sleeping sheepsquatch and more!
---
I have mine on a switch for just this reason.  If I find out that doesn't work, I'll just destroy the cable leading to them.
---
Yup great spot for a hidden base
---
On the bench in front of the tea kettle
---
Powering up events or just buy it from a vendor, it's pretty cheap.
---
Sold, message me your psn and ill throw ya some love in a few hours when im online.
---
And yet non Legendary mobs drop Legendary items.
---
It is so important to put your junk items in your stash. At a workshop I always build all crafting stations and a stash box by the collectors that way I am able to stash the items immediately as they are collected.
---
I know about Enlighten, I was just listing what was updated.
---
I really wish the servers were leveled. Or you had the option to pick a leveled or un capped server.
---
I’ve started playing on Xbox one (I played on PS4 on launch but it kept blue screening my console around the Enclave quest line) and some early to mid level quests need server hopping as if there is someone in the area 20 levels or higher near by the quests are flooded with level 40-70 enemies. When you are level 18-28 trying to do these it’s nearly impossible and very frustrating.
---
In the last week nearly three times per quest I’ve had to server hop to find areas without other player present so I can get in and do my business. I could see it being incredibly off putting for many players trying the game out for the first time.
---
I've gotten some pretty good stuff. Some is crap, but the stuff that doesn't fit my build has netted me over 20k so that's not nothing (and I haven't even sold all the good stuff).
---
Amazing
---
I think they mean an ingame map of your work. Like the glow in the dark map, but with all these locations
---
If you on XBox I can. Find me at PapaJLive.   Also, massive lead at Charleston Firehouse and Green county Lodge in Flatwoods. Both have gyms with barbells/dumbells to scrap for lead.
---
Have you tried wearing the black and white tuxedo with the white wolf fedora?
---

---
Well from the many times I visted a low level they were not selling stuff that was useful so you may be the rarity case. Either way there should be some indication of whats in stock. I would be more likely to visit a low level if I knew if they had legendary items.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Sold at Enclave as well, got lazy &amp; bought it there on my alt. First was a lucky reward first time repairing Monongah.
---
I just picked one up and named it May I come in?
---
"Sexually harassed my video game character" is the most 2019 thing I've ever read.
---
From what I've heard, unplugging the venders doesnt actually turn them off, just makes them not appear on the map.
---
Most people don’t carry around things they want to trade. You’re better off just visiting the vending machines.
---
Nukacrypt. Don't know if they are up yet, you will have to check it.
---
Awesome, thanks again. I went ahead and messaged the other two who helped.
---
I want a BIV radio DJ with Nukashine commercials!
---
Oh now im putting everywhere...im gotta kill me some bloodied
---

---
This is a video showing you where to go!
---
That's like saying a car that's lost isn't moving.
---
Yesssss!
---
there is a hell of a lit more that free speech doesn't cover.
---
and even then, it only applies to what you say in a public forum. websites, video games, basically everywhere that has a terms of use you just blindly click agree on dictate what type of speech is and isn't allowed on their platform. free speech does not extend to these places.
---
and no, it doesn't. you gave up your free speech when you clicked "i agree".
---
Honestly I hope a vault opens up and they are totally hostile. Their job was to reclaim the wasteland after all. A bunch of NPC Vault Dwellers running around would be a unique faction. They should also be harder to kill than the normal enemies, like they get the same perks and weapons we do. Imagine an enemy coming at you with TSE bullshit modified by RNG perks. It would be...different. You honestly wouldn’t know if it was a random player or NPC at first.
---
It took a minute, but was worth it.
---
noted.
---
Ah thanks, barely visited the place few times, not fully explored it yet.
---
It could also let players know about new content without reading patch notes
---
Mute him
---
The same has happened to me , I had a three star quad assaultron head and I logged back in to find it missing the quad effect, I’ve got no clue why
---
I got mine on both characters from my first Scorch Beast Queen kill.
---
My thoughts?  My Thoughts??
---
You really want the thoughts of a guy who got freaking harpoon guns on 3 of his last five purchases?
---
spoiler alert: the other two were equally trash for me.
---
But... as soon as I get something good you know I'll love it, so what can ya do?
---
It's because most people play this game as a shoot and loot and don't think about what they're doing. 
---
Can't fix stupid son
---
What is the boost on bloodied at 20% or less HP? 50%?
---
But it lasts. Instigating if you don't get that one shot kill your immediately weakened in comparison.
---
I dunno I've been working to push my Instigating Gauss as high as I can &amp; without low health perks, adrenaline, mutations it's pretty much set in stone. This is a stealth rifle build &amp; I've never calculated a 1k hit with it. Meanwhile my melee character bloodied is easily good for 1k if not more.
---
 you moron do this and they're marked on the map get gud" But I'm pretty sure we can't mark these quest the only place I see them is in the world tab for challenges.
---
TSE is still really good with scoped sniper rifles, or for players that actually aim.  Unfortunately, instigating is a way better option for a good sniper build.  One hit headshots, even on lvl 91 deathclaws.
---
Bloodied, Anti-armor, or even Vampire primary effects are light years better than 2-shot now.  AA/E was still pretty damn good even when TSE was the default meta.
---
Thank you for this important documentation
---
Normally got trash but just now I got an AA FFR Handmade so it’s not all bad, just RNG . Other times I got crap
---
awww... take him to rosie.
---
Yep, that list is something I plan to make soon!  Also, did you see the spawn conditions for the trick-or-treater, Civil War Reenactor, and Vendor Responder Bot? I'm planning to have those mapped out as well! Just need to find a good map with accurate region borders.
---
Always store your junk after collecting it in your stash especially at workshops. Workshops are the best way griefers can grief in adventure mode unless you walk around with pacifist mode off.
---
From what I've experienced when you try and sell an item from your inventory it will automatically dump it in your stash when selected, so I honestly don't know. Maybe their is some kind of carry weight/stash exploit we don't know about.
---
Not gonna happen. You would have to synchronize your picture with all other players on the server. You would basically upload your photo and the other player would download it. Now what happens if you change your picture? Same procedure again, and again and again. Each time you change your pictures the connection would suffer
---
I do not believe it effects when you are aiming down the sights. Only hip fire and vats.
---
Would it be worth grabbing the perk that reduces the negative effects or are all the negatives not that bad?
---
I was really hoping Nuclear Winter would be a permanent nuke zone mode where everything is buffed like it would be during a blast.  Battle royale is completely unappealing to me.
---
Is it your internet connect maybe? I have weird movements on PS4, but I think it might be corrected if I wasn’t connecting my PS4 wirelessly. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Suit has to have a modifier where Nekkers, I mean Mole Rats, attack you more often.
---
Some players have been asses since the beginning, nothing has really changed there.
---
You're not the only one, I love using power armor because of the looks and I don't mind using fusion cores but I haven't done anything aside from putting points into intelligence and luck. I use mostly melee weapons but I do like switching to guns, but I don't craft my own ammo like I should, I just loot and use the ammunition factory every now and then. Killing enemies isn't so hard because I mostly play alone but I wish I could one shot scorchbeasts too, I say just play how you want and if you wanna shift them around without having to level up maybe make a new character and experiment?
---
Can I join also? I am looking for a game to rp and I think fallout may be it.
---
I decided to put mine by the 3 Object locations near Valley Galleria! The river there is also convenient for my purifiers.
---
That would be a good idea!
---
What's your stash at?
---
the amount of times this idea has been posted and this reply has been given I'm lost to how it's not universal knowledge lol
---
Not entirely true several builds can require over 70 lvls to finish due to perks being locked until you've spent x amount of perks. So you will need to unlock several useless (at least to your build) perks before 50.
---
How full is your stash?  I get that message whenever I try to put more in the machine than there is room in my stash.
---
Oh, that would be awesome!
---
Yes but my point is they failed at corralling camp aesthetics so why not get rid of the nannies
---
Its not camp budget but your stash limit, are you near max?
---
You do you. You paid for it.
---
Fuck it. Do what you want, as long as you’re having fun. That’s all that really matters, right?
---
At the very least, put them on top. No doubt!
---
&gt;they should give options to use vs just add more music.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;i personally love my classical camp. but there should be a button to switch the geanre.
---
I have 2 of each radio built (for stereo) so I can switch from classical to Appalachia radio as the mood strikes.
---
or assign an icon to it that shows up on the map
---
Lol, I'm glad someone did it. :D
---
I did the powering up Poseidon event like 5-6 times and got it the plans.. This was months ago not sure if anything has changed..
---
Well not everyone pack mules. I have yet to find a low level who sell lv 45+ items. The smart move would be to sell you best with your best. But then again if your a cap hoarder with 25k cap then I get it. Otherwise not everyone cap hoards either.
---
You shouldn't *have* to do this but have you considered a "Please Shut Door" sign?
---
Yeah mines the one near the crashed plane in the Mire :)
---
Also, Recipe P heals the creatures one has to protect during second part of the event.
---
&gt;I keep thinking
---
&gt;&gt;Any day now.. they are coming out with a song store in the Atomic Shop. Big inventory, all songs 30/atomic points each. With a different 3 songs put in a weekly pack for 50/atomic points. (One more popular and 2 meh)
---
I have yet to buy any atoms, but if they gave us a massive library of good songs at 30 atoms each I'd drop $20 in a fucking heartbeat.
---
I totally forgot about Class Freak, thanks
---
Stairs are easier to build down with i found.
---
So the game sucks, so why not make it suck more? Great argument
---
I paid 3k for one leg which is pretty steep but tbh I was sick of trying to server hop for the mod (I had found 1 after several weeks) and I didn't have the plan or materials
---
What? no I was asking you lol if that was how it worked. I found out tho that it is, thanks so much for ur reply, im using the hunting rifle now :)
---
I felt this way as a solo player through the 20s. I am pretty casual, too. It is a grind. Know it will get better.  What system are you on? I know some people have found team mates through Reddit. 😊.
---
Thanks my dude but im on ps4, ive been hopping gyms quite alot but without ammosmith it doesnt go nowhere
---
If you enjoy being dead before you even know there's PVP involved they we simply find different things fun and I don't see how Bethesda can make a game for both groups.
---
Get to level 15. Kill things that are level 15.
---
Is the boss that usually carries it?
---
Just keep pushing through. You will get good weapons.
---
true!
---
Yeah all three bosses carry a low level legendary weapon.
---
I've never tried Nuke Burrows, might have to give it a shot one of these days. Might change my mind on the location. Is the inside still heavily irratiated too? Or can you hop back out of Power Armor once inside?
---
I've been trying for weeks and have only gotten 1, got sick of server hopping and just bit the bullet
---
I'm just happy that instead of just putting up with it, I can upload these dumps somewhere. I should really backup the original files as well
---
What is BGS?
---
I'm debating it.  My camp is nigh at the limit, so I'd probably have to scrap some stuff.  I think I'll wait a few more weeks to see if they up the build limit or have plans to, then decide.
---
Hmm, I did not try that method... Did you pacify it first?? That's what I would've done!
---
Ok, so make it so you can't have camera mode in PVP, IDGAF. But in Adventure I should be able to take a selfie in my kitchen.
---
I'm happy to [take some caps off your hands](https://imgur.com/farXOXa).  It's gathering dust in my stash.
---
...but can you fast travel
---
The jukebox turns back on every time I fast travel to my camp...
---
Alright, thank you. I may need to go on the hunt for matching stuff. :\\
---
Is it a survival game? You think workshops are fine because you enjoy PVP. It is not fun for anyone who does not. What do you mean 'powerful resources' it saves 20 min to grab some crap resouces its not like you can get gear or anything useful. Its a needed convenience to skip endless grind for PVE and if you want to have more risk/reward then make them coop defenses and have legendaries attack instead of lvl 5 mole rats not allow PVP players for force PVP on PVE players.
---
Yup I am. That makes sense, thank you!
---
Head North.  The Toxic Valley is (give or take) aimed at levels ten through twenty-five.
---
Also, weapons scale in increments of ten levels.  There's no such thing as a level fifteen hunting rifle.  Only ten, twenty, etc.  Similarly, shotguns are levels five, fifteen, twenty-five, etc.
---
No problem
---
There is a Travel type called "Mothman!" and a Scene type called "Wise Mothman!"  Unlike the one at the end of the Path to Enlightenment event, this Wise Mothman has a chance to disappear like a normal one, but it can also give you the "Enlightened" bonus XP status.
---
As for the Flatwoods Monster, I have personally seen encountered it at one of the southern Whitespring Assault locations, as well as the Assault location near Abbie's Bunker.
---
He just wanted to give you a Whopper.
---
Iiiinnn other words, it sounds buggy shit-show over-all, but ***IS*** doable at least!
---
Thanks! :)
---
Wow thanks, yall!  This is hugely helpful!
---
Try the hoard events in the Forrest &amp; toxic valley area, if you only pick up crap, then scrap at the purveyor &amp; try &amp; get something better. 
---
If your unsure where the purveyor is, look for the Berkley springs workshop &amp; fast travel to someone's camp with a vendor near there at the end of the train line
---
I never thought of that.  When you get the prompt to close a door it doesn't say if it has a lock or not, does it?
---
Maybe one person opened it and others didn't take the chance of closing it and being locked in.
---
I can still vaguely recall the holos from the test subjects. As per my usual disposition, I'll be showing absolutely no mercy when they arrive in 76!
---
I'm on PC!  Thanks for the suggestion!
---
I only have turrets
---
I have pics, and I can pm if you really need to see them, but I just wanted to ask how I should handle this situation or if it could be addressed at all.
---
If this were a karma grab, it might be one of the worst this sub has ever seen lol
---
I’m also a beta player. I didn’t launch my nuke until I was level 60 or something. Funnily enough, somebody else launched their own nuke within a second of mine...in the exact spot as mine.
---
Total Apocalyptic Resort Destination In Space.
---
I bought a stimpack recipe for 50 caps last night, made my night
---
Patience, grasshopper.
---
Better weapons will come with (play) time.
---
We all started with an axe or machete, graduated to a 10mm pistol, 38 pipe rifle, a low level 1* 44 pistol, hunting rifle, then a sniper rifle.
---
It is also likely a higher level player will find you and give you a better level appropriate weapon than what you have now.
---
Stay in the forest for a couple more levels,  Follow the overseers quest.
---
  At about L17 or so, head to the alligator on the map.  Stay there until L25 or so, then go to the bottom of them map (ash heap)
---
At 30, start the excavator quest, then head up the left side of the divide.  At 45, go east.
---
Funny thing: until I had map was made, I had no idea there was an Object-type location just a few steps away from the Scene location that I'd visited dozens of times!
