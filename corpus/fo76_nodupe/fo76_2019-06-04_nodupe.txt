bet?
---
---
---
Some of it is justified.  They had released  a plethora of  patches and got the game working seemingly pretty well, but last week it seemed to be crashing a lot more.  It just never feels like the game's kinks are fully ironed out.
---
What are the other 2?? Is one the toxic clean up deal? What’s the other?
---
Stretch Scorchstrong (TM)
---
I've had three bounties ever.  Two of them I earned by orbital striking a whitespring clubhouse CAMP.  The third was from picking a lock on a tool cabinet by the junk node in gorge junkyard.  I'd just loaded into the server and a quick check of the map told me the workshop was unowned.  Apparently it was owned and the map hadn't loaded that fact yet...
---
If it says collect it means you have to actually be the one collecting it. 
---

---
Use the magazine perk card
---
Here ya go:

---
Not gonna work uleas they also added mineral nodes and water ways.
---
They way the game is designed, with how building works you can not get close to another players base (it's around bouble the build area in size. Unless they drastically reduce or remove the buffer zone. It's not practical.
---
  
---
Nice idea but let Bethesda fix the current bugs, and roll out the rest of the year as planned, then ask again.
---
&gt; Is one the toxic clean up deal? 
---
Yup, and the other one is the "collect bug parts" quest that starts at Dolly Sods.
---
Yes
---
it could be seen by some beth mod if upvoted.
---
Up to 90% max, I have 5x5 WWR armor and all my weapons are 10%.
---
10/10 do want those evil little shits as decorations
---
Ewww indeed.
---
In FO4 I replaced every instance of the AR with the excellent DeadPool2099's Service Rifle.
---
And not a tear was shed for the overidden weapon on that day.
---
Best way to combat this is not to do things that leads people to take out their pitchforks. Sure people are hating for views, but Bethesda gave them so much to talk about. At this point, 99% of people in this sub are super loyal hardcore fans. It is important in environments like these to consider other point of views. Everyone is going to try to defend their beloved developer but when you try to excuse all their mistakes and blame others, you've become a crazy fanboy that no one respects. Not saying you are, but I'm just putting my thoughts out there.
---
thank you guys!
---
Not quite, pacifist mode just makes it so you can't damage other players and more importantly if you accidentally shoot someone it won't flag you for PvP.
---
This is a very important distinction to make as there are still people to this day that get confused when they get pulled into PvP even though they have pacifist mode activated. At this point there are two different scenarios where this can happen: 1) if you claim a workshop and someone contests it or 2) if a teammate initiates PvP with someone (this will flag all teammates on both teams for PvP).
---
That said, they also changed it to where contesting a workshop only initiates PvP if the workshop owner is actually at the workshop. Before this change the workshop PvP could be exploited by having a player contest the workshop while having another team member waiting to gank the owner at their C.A.M.P. or somewhere other than the workshop.
---
One last thing of note, when I said at the beginning that pacifist mode doesn't let you damage other players keep in mind this will work against you get flagged for PvP. For example, if you claim a workshop, then another player contests it and you have pacifist mode on you will NOT be able to defend yourself.
---
Also don't think the servers could handle to load more info.
---
OP nice idea but it's so low on priority , dought it's gonna get any traction. If you feel that I'm wrong I suggest you post on the official forums
---
Hell yeah man thanks for that tid bit. That will really help.
---
Yeah I’m wrong lol my bad
---
the other day I went and got a salad at the veggie grill (vegan spot) to go with my fire wings and all the hipsters looked so frail and weak. I'd rather not have my character that lives off of melons not look frail and weak
---
Go do uranium fever event
---
Not to mention the original fallout 2 gauss rifle focused far more on the gun aspect than the energy aspect of it. Both the rifle and pistol were small guns and not energy weapons, for one thing. Granted there's plenty of room for interpretation due to the low quality graphics at the time, but there wasn't ever really any mention of charging like it does in f4/76 or some weird energy ball like in f3/nv. All it said is it uses an electromagnetic field to shoot the bullets. The way I understood it and the gauss pistol were just that they were regular guns that shot small bullets at a very fast speed due to the funny looking spiral barrels they had. 
---
They were actually pretty small/light too. Not sure why they proceeded to make it so damn big and bulky in the future games. Not to mention the ammo is so heavy here for some reason...like hello? 2mm? Why does that weigh so much more than 5mm? In fallout 2, a stack of 50 2mm EC only weighed one pound. So .02 pounds per bullet.
---
At first I was going for a two handed melee build, then it switched to one handed, and I capped it off with some automatic rifles and food buffs. Now all my guns are useless against enemies my level, but at least I take barely any damage from eating and drinking, plus I can craft rank 5 melee weapons!
---
Somehow my carefully hoarded Bloatfly glands keep disappearing. I might have scrapped a couple but I know I stashed some... Hate the travel up to their spawn especially when they are all newly dead....
---
Trying to join can’t find you on xb live
---
The build area is the main idea for having a separate settlement. You still have your normal camp, but then you also have a smaller square area you can build in the settlement. That way everyone's builds can fit near each other, there's not huge amounts of spaces between them, and it allows a more cohesive market rather than fight over the white springs. 
---
And I figure it's better to get this idea to the community so we can start refining it into something better. A year of design before implementation is better than a week of design a year later.
---
Yep you end up as a walking arsenal
---
Some datamined dialogue of an automated robot voice talking about you being in danger due to being out of the storm or something.
---
There are datamined audio files that support it. I was highly skeptical before I heard them and now reluctantly agree. 
---
I watched a YouTube video on it. I already gave him one click, I'm not about to give him more. (Plus I don't have a direct link to it either soooooo...)
---
She's a jealous one, lol
---
Time to find room for that cannibal perk card.
---
Only if Bethesda actually made it more clear how to get the replacement.  
---
You see they made a sneaky announcement on twitter out of a places.  
---
They could make a in game announcement, wait that's reserved for atom shop.  
---
Most people didn't even know that there were giving replacements.  
---
Also you have like 3 days to actually inform them because Bethesda site suddenly went down in between. Also info of person requesting for replacement got leaked. So a lot of people were discouraged.
---
Aaaaand that's enough internet for today.
---
Nice camp! 
---
May I show my [raider camp](https://imgur.com/a/bSpz9mG)?
---
I saw your camp this last weekend I think when I was server hopping around. Didn't even realize it had the minigame. I blame work breaking my brain (30 hours of OT can do that) for missing it.
---
Uranium fever, breach and clear, and I believe load baring will all either net you nuclear material or uranium ore to smelt into nuclear material.  That or take your chances at a workshop.
---
Oh and frogs.  Frogs drop uranium ore sometimes.  Weird but true.
---
Thanks but I got one last night and was able to knock it off
---
Heck yes! Just give us some sports to play alone and with other players
---
Lately I've been getting better drops from events and legendary enemies than what I get from the purveyor.
---
Every time I go to turn in scrip I brace myself for something worthless and wonder why I bother.
---
Firstly I'd love to know how you get killed  in adventure while resting. There's no more slap damage in adventure mode. It makes me feel like this is post is trying to spread lies about this game which is just uneeded. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
---
TWO WORDS
---
ROLE-PLAYING RAIDER THEMES
---
The weight of the ammo is surreal - hence mentioning having to equip Batteries Not Included.
---
Is like the devs felt like adding severe penalties and caveats to this weapon just because.
---
There’s no signage, so you wouldn’t have known unless we spoke.
---
Yes, apparently you lose some 70% on the sale. I put up a sign saying to message for ammo sales.
---
The same profile and equipment carry over so you can pick choose at any time. Survival I think it's 5% extra XP but you'll lose aid items, caps and junk where adventure when you die you only lose junk
---
"Alright, and....are you serious? I need ONE MORE BALLISTIC FIBER?"
---
I got up to 8 out of 10 ghouls to kill and it just disappeared like you said. Didn't get a chance to finish it and get 20 caps.
---
Keep an eye out for that campfire event. And remember to do the daily's. In between them you can look up a guide for easy challenges for the other badges.
---
Right before I got off last night, someone bombed Morgantown. I did Collision Course and Feed the People, between that and just wandering I came up with more mats and flux than I feel like I generally would.
---
So you're saying you didn't know how to contact them?
---
Or you didn't even know about the replacement at all?  Which i would find hard to believe because it was plastered across all forms of media when bethesda put out the info
---
Survival is just spawn camping, open pvp death match mode with mildly more exp, and much harsher loses for death.
---
It's not a bud when some buys something it's takes 30%  so if you do 6300 divided by 30 it gives you 210 so yeah it take of 30% (not a person the game take the 30% of your profit).
---
It could be they claimed a workshop in that session
---
When you die you lose sooooooo much aid
---
I think I saw a video from JucyHead on YouTube about it.
---
Honestly, this. I would probably throw a ton of steel and other scraps that just build up in there. If someone wants it, they can have it.
---
what about rad-shield?
---
I have speed demon, nmprogue
---
Nuke a place that would have alot of glowing enemies
---
Let's see...
---
1.) Shitty looking.
---
2.) Poor damage.
---
3.) Enormous modded weight.
---
4.) Blocks your vision when firing.
---
Why would anyone use it?
---
My opinion is handmade or that what I see most people use
---
Might be waiting for next quarter review
---
I already did. It's still in open condition.   
---
You can just look at this thread and find people who didn't know about it.  
---
I mean some people in this sub were unaware of it ho do you expect regular person
---
Two handed melee or one handed melee?
---
2
---
Ok, I'll get one in about 5 minutes
---
Because handmades are better
---
What the heck i read there...
---
I bought the plan and thought I'd post for future generations. 
---
Prime capcitor does 20% more base damage than gamma with a 4% drop in range and a tiny drop in weight
---
There is no hard data on what you get from burn damage but between how enemy dansge resist is calculated I'm guessing the pure damage is better if you can afford the ammo cost
---
Uhhhhm if you say so.
---
Ppl are aware but they never cared enough to follow up.
---
I had to tell someone that bethesda doesn't automatically take your shipping info from amazon and send the replacement.
---
the build will only get you so far. youl need chem buffs and food buffs for ultimate damage.
---
Handmade looks to be better in general, but I think the radium rifle is good for catching oloodied players off guard. The extra damage helps alot, but I think they cost more to repair/mod.
---
Feels like I havent got a possum badge in over a week. Done campfire like 20 times, never got a badge from either daily
---
I watched the random guys video rather then the pretentious you tubers and yup no need to give more clicks to the click baiters ( that don’t even play the ducking game )
---
Psychobuffs + whisky, is only thing I have
---
You need power patches and stabilized in Intelligence. 
---
You can keep weaponsmith and batteries included but drop the third perk. And take out bodyguards out of charisma for the 3 extra points you need in Intelligence
---
The charging mechanic is already ridiculous. First off, like 40% of the time it just decides not to work; it's fully charged and humming, I let go of the mouse, nothing happens. Getting hit by enemies or staggered pretty much guarantees that your next charge will fail. What's up with the ammo capacity? The gauss rifle in fallout 2 had 20 shots, the gauss pistol had 12. The ammo also had a ton of armor penetration. I don't think the gauss rifle has any innate armor penetration aside from its high damage and a piercing receiver. It bothers me because it was one of my favorite guns, but I barely use it here because of how hard it was butchered
---
Looks nice bro (PC or PS4 or XBOX?
---
Mention Crash - it's a no no. 
---
Mention Canvas - it's a no no.
---
Mention Challenges - it's a no no.
---
Always remind the 3 C's and youre good.
---
The way it works is if your holding a two shot and kill an enemy with a two shot it has a higher chance of dropping a two shot, at least that’s my experience I carry a ton of bloodied stuff on me and get a ton of bloodied drops
---
good start. glowing meat steaks for 10% melee damage and deathclaw steaks gives you strength. theirs a few other foods as well just can't remember the names.
---
When you say legendary scout do you mean both urban and forest? I have a 1\* Urban Chest Piece, but was hoping for legendary forest pieces.
---
Follow-up question are you stimpack person or kill everthing and everthing and regen everthing after you're done fighting person (also VATS or no VATS)?
---
If you need me I’ll be in the research wing.
---
I agree - could never understand why people are always on about having npc s in the game.
---
I'm happy they're totally not in this game and hopefully never will be. They're boring af.
---
Found the person that didnt read the post
---
Go to popular spots.
---
I’m using stimpaks, always used the perk, to use auto stimpack
---
That's been a known issue with wood armor since the Purveyor debuted.
---
Read the post. Just stating that the game has its problems but has gotten better.
---
mutations will also help. twisted muscles and carnivore. marsupial of course.
---
**take em both**
---
*Atomic-Shop-Voice*
---
What spots?
---
Have those
---
In the past few weeks I’ve been running into the Flatwoods Monster like right outside of Berkeley Springs. The fast travel spot to the left of that. I ran into his ass like 4 times!
---
The game takes 10% of caps income as a tax fee  [https://bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)
---
Sorry your build is a little more complicated to set up then I thought
---
Logged out a second ago...
---
Is it worth now to come back?
---
It’s quite clearly justified
---
Even Todd Howard has come out and said they knew it wasn’t ready. 
---
Take your fanboy glasses off for two seconds and watch the hundreds of reviews and glitch videos about this game.
---
Yup, I have problems myself
---
I'll take them and turn them into fully charged Ultrecite Fusion cores!
---
Wish i could upvote more than once...
---
Ok
---
Look for the weekly weapon challenges. All week lakeside cabins and the bog have been populated.
---
Also ppl have protection from one another so events can have ppl fot that extra xp.
---
Yes you can adjust them separately
---
Ok so this may not be the best but I tried on this (I run a Bloodied Unarmed Build so this type of build is a little new to me) here it is: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f169b68&amp;d=s42sm2sn2ss2se2p10ep1ee2ce0i44a04ih2l71lt2lu2i12a80c13cr0cf2&amp;w=&amp;n=Red_EyedWolf's Melee&amp;m=168bcfhi
---
They did add that "some would slightly change your appearance"
---
Edit: It was in the [NoClip](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=1313). "Some of them are visual"
---
-/u/Thavolt
---
Wait try this link instead: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f169b68&amp;d=s42sm2sn2ss2se2p10ep1ee2ce0i44a04ih2l71lt2lu2i12a80c13cr0cf2&amp;w=&amp;n=Red_EyedWolf'sMelee&amp;m=168bcfhi
---
You may have to delete it and do a fresh install.
---
Both links worked xD, it just took away the part of the name
---
max tier at level 50 regens half my health...
---
Me and my fellow weirdos have been wandering around in the nude with vault girl heads on lately. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Alien what Alien? I didn't kill no stinking Alien
---
[https://imgur.com/ah9xHCH](https://imgur.com/ah9xHCH)
---
lol so you post it to get that no talent hack more views?  
---
There's like 5000 copeycat samey youtube guys out there that post the exact rehashed opinions of each other in an eternal circle jerk.    
---
Choosing to spend a moment of your time listening to those guys is silly ;)
---
Ok good
---
20% xp. Add on all the other xp buffs and i think you can push 35% or 40
---
Ah I was afraid of that
---
Can confirm, have also seen the Flatwoods Monster in this exact spot, was at dusk.
---
Awesome camp
---
If youre on ps4 Ill buy or trade for that pipe pistol.
---
I think fo76 should add testing area, where players can go into “single player” testing ground a small area where you can switch out perk cards, try out weapons, and try out your builds on any type of creature.
---
Ah more than I thought. Thank you for the correction.
---
There are rather severe stat consequences for most of them...even with putting 3 ranks  in class freak there are some hefty hits to stats
---
[removed]
---
Yes that would be amazing
---
I'm thinking ppl put on pacifist mode thinking they can not die or something. this happens a lot actually, what are you stupid or something?
---
It makes it a little bit more exciting seeing another player. Do you wave and invite a trade or teammate or do you hide silently and hope they pass before they notice you? I've only been griefed the first week that survival released.
---
Love it! Really do! I would love to create this style of C.A.M.P myself, however my complaint (not to you, but to Bethesda) that tent is leaking rain water. I really hope that Bethesda can tweak tent and atom store vault-tec canopy to be water proof.
---
You forgot to say the game is trash and that you could do better.  Otherwise this is copied and pasted, right?
---
While thematically perfect it'll be difficult to work in without players reporting thefts as glitches and deleted items.
---
That sounds awesome! I would not enter that creepy 'hut' room, though, lol.
---
An option to turn the appearance of them on/off would be nice. I happen to like the way my character looks, as well as having super human skills.
---
I said what I said!
---
When I first started playing, I only knew 1 person who played fo76. Got the achievement pretty quickly bc everytime we teamed up it counted towards the achievement. Dunno if it was changed. Try it out with a friend! Or you can msg me for my PSN &amp; you can join me. But I'm a terrible casual player so don't expect someone who knows what they're doing lol
---
Well not to be dick, but 3* armor is 60 scrip.... u lost 60 scrip ;)
---
If they can get back together and cover Country Roads, sure.
---
Bro, people person info including address,cc details and name were leaked. You can't expect a reasonable person to give them after that.
---
Well it's more a leap of the imagination. We're already 'part' of the raider faction. If you're allowed to kill NPCs you'll be a raider as far as I'm conserned. I know they're are a lot of people who can't imagine anything the game doesn't explicitly show them is happening. But I've always believed Bethesda games require that you meet them in the middle with your role playing. Like... in Skyrim for example, Bethesda doesn't do a lot to solidify my Khajit merchant RP, but there's enough in the toolkit for me to imagine it the rest of the way. Sadly the fully-rounded fantasy roleplay sim doesn't exist yet, and won't in our lifetime.
---
Naw, give Rage 2 a go.
---
Isn’t there a perk card, that your radiation is your health, ghoulish was it?
---
Yall just remember to be patient with the support team you're interacting with for these. They aren't the reason your canvas bag isn't getting to you, and they probably want this all to be resolved just as much as you, maybe even moreso since they are taking the anger from customers.
---
It still happens, so does invincible stretch doggos!
---
Wow nice stuff I like how they incorporate different lighting and items to make it look how it does
---
Ghoulish makes it so that while you take radiation damage, you heal your health points
---
But how!? Meanwhile all i can do is stick a few pieces of foundation together to form a shack lol
---
I can't even get past making a box. Hell didn't even know how doors worked.
---
Change the autosave setting to 1 or 2 minutes.  default is 10 minutes.
---
lol
---
Maybe - although I wasn’t carrying the two shot pistol when the drops happened today.  I think the RNG clusters - which is why I hauled ass to the Legendary vendor after the minigun dropped today.  After playing for a few months and never getting a single two shot then suddenly having two drop in two days, and then 3 more drop out of 6 purchases at the vendor, I’m a believer.
---
[](/celestiahh)That would save me ***so many*** caps in fast traveling.
---
Agreed! Sucks paying caps to travel to a vendor that has 30 pieces of armor only to find out they are regularly spawned clothing... not exactly “armor”
---
I see a lot of people at whitesprings
---
Reviews are 90% of the time opinions and not facts. Bug videos are different however but no one can sit there and act like they havent already improved it tenfold since launch.
---
Auto save? Is this a pc setting? Or also for console?
---
She drops an occasional gem. I received a bloodied Gatling Plasma that’s pretty nice.
---
The extra ammo/med perks require manual search button to be pressed.
---
Oh my, isn't that the truth? On those rare occasions where I feel a need for a Rad-X (mainly suppressing my mutations while still truing to get whoopsies from mirelurk hatchlings) I feel like I am moving in slow motion and that is NOT a jump, that's a mild hop in the air about an inch of the ground.
---
You can stack things like stash boxes and other camp items.
---
There certainly is something to be said for shear cave man brutality.
---
If you want a fun way of farming it kill enemies with a plasma weapon. You have a chance to get 1-5 nuclear material
---
Yes it is very true! Why would someone that has put in over a thousand hours level 290 make up bullshit! The game has been gliched since the last patch! I was attacked by a person wearing a owl mask and moleminer gauntlet, I  whent to defend my self and I was killed, before I  could even get the first shot off. There are many other issues with the game as well after the last patch, just because someone says they fixed an issue dosen't always mean it not possible! Trust me I  have been playing this game long enough, I have seen shit that honestly does not make sense! Just like it normal for ghouls to be invisible and attack you or even slide across the floor and attack you. Or for those of us that could not play the project paradise event for close  to a week, because we kept getting kicked off the server. And the list goes on! Ruin the game, I  am the game! Lmao! Just like any other veteran that has put with all the bullshit over the last 6 months! It is what it is, I don't complain, I suck it up regardless and keep the game going, day in and day out. I wish you all the best.
---
Screw you... You shame me with your awesomeness. Seriously that is amazing. Even in my dreams I couldn't imagine myself making anything half as impressive. How'd you get so much lighting without going over budget?
---
Where ???
---
Wait till you try the powered door and discover there's only one keypad.
---
Yea the crossbows one of those wepons I've had fun with, particularly kill 76 scorched with Xbow challenge, pretty good time.
---
That's probably true, but normally Dense + Fireproof would still cause the explosions to do next to nothing. There's something else going on here too.
---
It does sound particularly dangerous, I have dampened mutaion so not too effective 4 me.
---
That's a dick and balls.
---
I've never played with the Flaming chainsaw, definitly on to do list tho.
---
And let’s not talk about the shady micro transactions prices in the atomic shop. 
---
You and the 6 people still playing this broken mess enjoy yourselves. 😉
---
I have the source material!
---
Pretty much yes
---
Put them in the cash register in front of murmurgh. Cash registers dont have a weight limit for storage.  I always drop my excess ammo and scrap on cash registers
---
👍🏻
---
Hard to say
---
It's a video game? Why does that make me the "Bad side of humanity"?
---
Yup
---
Agree
---
Much. It's at a really playable state now.
---
I like almost everything about the combat rifle EXCEPT it's appearance. I understand it's supposed to look mass produced like the Combat shotgun, but it's just not for me. Performance wise it's 4 sure a nice piece.
---
24 scrip for 3 rank armor.
---
Right? I still wish instead of that dumbass nerf they did do to Sent/Ass they should've made it 10% standing still and 5% damage from players. It'd still make it workable and less tanky, without it literally being based on luck and client-side/server-side calculations on a game with an already shoddy and unstable serverside.
---
On my xbox it &amp; inside environments like whitesprings resort are loading a lot faster
---
Yah they look mean. If I wasn't dampened, or I found a sick legendary one, I could see using one regularly.
---
One man army mode, a soul after my own.
---
The idea is to make you burn caps. I have to burn caps on stuff I don't need because I hit the 25k limit.
---
That's what it's worth, he was saying he paid 100 scrip for 3* armor when it's 60 for that and 100 for weapon
---
How the fuck do you function with all of the mutations
---
Everybody is running around in masks, helmets and power armor. Whats the point?
---
I'll put it in the display next to my 25% fire rate black powder pistol.
---
Rad shield doesn't suppress mutations. It's my go to. And it offers the best rad resist of any drug
---
Lol
---
You are everything I aspire to be. Keep up the amazing work &lt;3
---
I forgot about glowing blood packs
---
Can you imagine how glitchy it would be?😂
---
Lol, good names, I think I'll have to side with "You'll shoot your eye out" as winner tho. But Betty has great ammo efficiency,  best part of the .50cal conversion, 180 bullets per craft.
---
Well, if they're on a mission, I cans ee it. For example, right now I am constantly checking camps trying to find the fashnaht balloons plan. The odds of finding them are tiny by now, so I tend to go through camps quickly unless I see a real reason to stop.
---
Sadly yes, this is currently a bug with how ammo is being "taxed" when sold. 
---
I have run into another weird one where I'll put ammo I never use up for free, and when someone gets it my top-right alert says they got WAY more ammo than I put up. 
---
For example, I'll put 15 plasma cartridges up and when someone gets them it says "Xx69VaultBro420xX bought your Plasma Cartridges (867)". 
---
I have no idea if they're actually getting that many. But good on them if they're getting the hookup for free!
---
...or a decontamination shower, fyi.
---
I remember seeing a pic a few years ago that showed the player carting ALL the stuff we do in game.  Something like a GIANT ASS bag of weapons, amour, junk and ammo falling out.
---
I will take a picture of it and post it on every reddit thread, special edition review on Amazon and Bethesda forum when Thier next game comes.
---
Multiplicatively.  Use awareness perk card and vats to verify.
---
Is this why my left arm won't take either (of the improperly named) Polymer mods?!
---
....damned it
---
Which all currency can be obtained through gameplay and nothing of which is p2w. I will, thanks. And you spelled millions wrong.

You lucky bstrd, you found the mitical creature.  I'm lvl 82 and the only two shot I got is a  lvl 40 1\* sosome dude gave me when I was lvl 15,  never seen another since, an that crapy purveillor hates me, no matter how much I try to charm her she only give me wood armor or  useless melee weapons lover than my lvl 40 all rise.
---
Have you tried advertising it on this sub instead?
---
The polymer mod is very buggy you could just have one for the chest piece. That being said if your urban scout left arm has 12 DR then the bug is happening to you.
---
I calculate it at about 460 with Grounded and max Class Freak. You should get around 525 pip-boy damage without Grounded.
---
Marsupial: thicker legs or reverse joints
---
Chameleon: you are slightly transparent 
---
Scaly Skin: your skin looks like angler skin 
---
Speed Demon: you blur when you run 
---
Talon: sharp fingernails 
---
Unstable Isotope: you slightly pulsate orange
---
Plague Walker: a continuous dark green fog appears around you (like dirt from PigPen)
---
Empath: brain looks enlarged 
---
Electrically Charged: you randomly spark
---
Egghead: bigger oblong head
---
Herd Mentally: you have to stay within close proximity of your friends. You make brahmin noises
---
Bird Bones: super skinny or you give off feathers when you jump
---
Eagle Eyes: bigger eyeballs.
---
Poseidon has a node
---
Sorry. I was mistaken.
---
It benefits from Commando perks.
---
I sell mine for 50caps in my vender. Not sure the real value tho.
---
Forsure. They go for 50 caps at most
---
I pay 20 caps per non Forrest and I will. Uy what u have it's a fair price
---
I've got two separate stacks in my Stash. Presumably for chest and limbs, but neither are attachable. 
---
I may have pooped the bed by putting a weaker mod on and now its stuck? I can't remember exactly which I put on, I was intending to mod it temporarily until I got the appropriate polymer.
---
I buy them when I see them for sale for 50 caps... Maybe 100 if it's one I'm missing for an area to do a bunch at once.
---
Not everyone is at max caps though...I keep mine around 15k pretty consistently. Sometimes it’s high sometimes I dip down to 5k but I’ve never maxed out. I’m not going to “burn caps” on a lvl 5 hunting rifle for 40 caps. I’d rather burn 25 caps traveling this vendor that I at least know has legendaries.
---
The combat rifle does have the little-known advantage of lower VATS AP cost over the handmade. I don't think the assault rifle has any advantages.
---
1. Gatling Lasers (along with plasmas) can stagger worse than most things, Heavy guns in particular are a bit of a rising meta because of the insane stagger. Problem is the spin up which 90% of the time you'll die to a good player during that time. You just have to time shooting and coming out of cover (as I learned in some video games, just hide, wait until you're sure it's done spinning then pop out and use VATs as you're firing. Bada bing.
---
2. There's a reason that I go into adventure mode \*sometimes\* to fight, the fact that there's more caps to be made in adventure mode. You hit most people in Survival and get 20 caps at most per time, in adventure I get 50. But yes, I usually wait until I hit my vendor limit (on av. takes me an hour) before going back to adventure for more caps. It's an idiotic nerf they did and they need to ramp up the cap drops in survival to make adventure less appealing to griefers/PvPers.
---
3. You just repeated what I said. Chumps/Vaultboys/Loot Pinatas. All the same shit js. 
---
4. Yup. But many other games are exactly the same and if you dislike that fact, just go back to adventure? The 20%+ XP isn't that game-changing you need to be in survival over adventure. Plus we all know that perk load outs between PvE and PvP have always been something different in video games.
---
5. They need a nerf, I'd prefer like how in Fallout 4 the second you attack it breaks, or you run into someone/get attacked. It's insane how many top level PvPers stay in stealthboys.
---
6. Erm. I wouldn't say Power Armor is fallout at all, I never really used it past when I wanted to cheese some place with heavy weapons. I found that sniping/sneaking worked much better. Also the fact you server hop to avoid a conflict shows me you're the kind of player I usually dislike, don't take workshops if you won't defend them, JS.
---
7. \-
---
8. Everyone's on this whole "Yeah I wouldn't..." kick today when we all know we do. Come on boys.
---
9. \-
---
10. \-
---
11. Lol what the fuck is this shit? That is the most random rant I've ever seen but clearly you've had your eyes shut during the past games. Fallout 4 had "Fun" and "Comical" armors/paints (etc) if you looked hard enough, need I remind you Fallout 3 literally had some super hero costume of an ant? It's called style, all because you personally want to go around wearing your T-60 Power armor and Enclave uniform and be all "Loreful and RP" doesn't mean everyone else does or should. I run around sometimes in cool matching outfits, othertimes I'm in my Fasnacht masks and silly bright outfits.
---
Probably, but idc honestly? The whole post is literally me being an asshole.
---
Grape was my go-to pre level 31, doubly so because I have maxed out Cola Nut so I can heal to full and get rid of all your rads without endangering your mutations
---
I make and sell so much ammo. 
---
Im a bloodied melee build so... 
---
Free xp. And i always have mats so..
---
Its easy money.
---
Yeah, I found that out too. 
---
I think there needs to be an armor and weapon crafting station in/near that building for convenience.
---
neat
---
Other than what I've said it's similar. It's still near impossible to shoot out a window.
---
Yeah, all sources of armor penetration stack multiplicatively. It is possible to have too much armor penetration, but not until you reach damage = 6.5x DR.
---
Doesn't Talons alter your appearance already? Could sworn I read that somewhere...
---
Mea culpa, 60 script. But still.  It was aggravating enough to get 2 wood armor rolls back to back, but for one to automagically downgrade is... just... soul-crushing
---
Get all of em up before it gets "fixed" back! 🤣
---
I buy cranberry bog and more at 50 caps each and everything else at 25 caps each.
---
I'll buy your entire inventory if it's for sale and you like the price.
---
Go for the "Insecure and douchy" line all you want. It's not me making an excuse but most of the people who preach some "I'D NEVER TOUCH A BASE" thing I'll catch doing it and usually to someone much lower level than them. But you can be like that.  
---
Also you \*can\* PvP in PA, but there's such a small sub-sect of the community which is good enough to and I've only met 1 person who had me on my toes when they did it, problem was I figured out their movements and kept slamming them until they were forced to drop it. It's much more effective to be out of PA because of the lack of legendary effects and VATs issues. (visa-vi, I can VATs you a lot better than you can me.)
---
Not wandering. She stays at the Berkeley Springs Station.
---
Its fallout not fable
---
As people are saying. If you're level 5 and on the leaderboard if I am not going for you as a level 180, another guy is. It's just how it works and since it works off the fact me killing you puts me on the leaderboard in a very quick and easy manner, why would I not?
---
Yep - not even the initiative to Google things any more. This is what happens when everyone just does things for you.
---
Yeah but I wanted to be able to defend myself from the toxic piles of shit that roam the wasteland, cuz back then people could slowly but surely kill you even with pacifist enabled.
---
Pup boy damage? Difference or 65 is kinda big don’t you think?
---
Wut?
---
So you’re fallouts one punch man?
---
The reduce defence syringe is a good thing to carry and U akways bring one
---
The game servers *run* on the internet. You can't access something (data) from somewhere else without a connection (the internet). Therefore if you want something separate from the game servers, the only place it can be is on your machine. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Because the strongest humans weren't infected, they died fighting.
---
"Nothing to be gained".  
---
Let me put it this way.  
---
I can walk into survival with 10 Stimpaks, 10 RadAways, some food, 10 purified water and a Stealthboy.  
---
I can leave with a full STASH of Junk and (I have in the past) come away with hundreds of Stimpaks, drugs, water, food and RadAways. All in the space of maybe 30mins-1hour. This isn't an overly uncommon experience and I generally don't buy aid or even look for it, I go into survival and fill my STASH with it. I make my 1400 caps within 10 minutes from people being dumb enough to run around with full inventories.  
---
So to your "Nothing to be gained" line of reasoning. You're so fucking wrong it's almost sad.
---
Know issue for some time. Heard if you roll 2 or 3 star wood to dump it into the scrip machine immediately or get shafted.
---
If you run away or his time run out he will became aggressive.
---
Did it to Mr. Bandit 10 second later a wild mongrel arrived and finished him off
---
The random encounter gutsy that will threaten to kill you if you don't drop items
---
Since this was originally posted legendary versions of both of the scout armours (urban and forest) have been released.  I have a couple of pieces of 2 star forest now.
---
Oh, I haven't ran into him. Thanks
---
Sell them as I always have 35 caps each
---
While I've seen people overpraising W3 as the best game ever made, i've never seen anyone saying it as a 'hidden indie game'.
---
Saw video where the guy said to save 1000 scrip for 10 or 20 rolls. You have a better chance of getting a good hit that way.
---
Do you have any photos without an ‘old timey’ filter on? I’m not trolling, as what you’ve done here looks pretty original and I want to see it in more detail, but the filter crushes that detail.
---
&gt; script.
---
It's not *script*.  It's *scrip*.  Scrip was a form of currency back in WV's coal mining days.
---
For what it's worth, the burn effect lasts for three seconds with a magnitude of 3. I would guess that that type of effect is applied once per second, but it's not clear. It also lists EnergyResist as a resistance value, which suggests that it would do next to nothing.
---
The beta wave tuners for the plasma gun appear to be strictly superior to all the other receivers except the prime. You get the same burning damage, range &amp; ammo mods, plus either the full crit damage or hip-fire accuracy bonuses.
---
I play on PC but I don't live in ohio
---
I'm actually in ohio right now, but that's only for tonight
---
I don't know what my point is
---
That’s this sub. There’s just a bunch of asshats lately downvoting everything. I’m 99% sure it’s the “fallout 76 is trash” fanboys
---
Here's what I would do (keeping your desired weapon and PA): [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c384b4b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pe2eh2ic4s12id2l71ls2ee2lu2sg2cm2ev0lt2a72a00ei0&amp;w=c72&amp;n=Empath%20Tank&amp;m=367cefib](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c384b4b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2pe2eh2ic4s12id2l71ls2ee2lu2sg2cm2ev0lt2a72a00ei0&amp;w=c72&amp;n=Empath%20Tank&amp;m=367cefib).
---
A few notes:
---
**Perk cards:**
---
* Str/Bear arms - How many heavy weapons do you plan to carry around? Is the x amount of weight savings really worth 3 points?
---
* Str/Lock and load - How much will you really benefit from this using a Gatling Laser? Is it really worth the 3 points?
---
* Str/Blocker rank 3. I don't leave camp on any build without it let alone a tank.
---
* I think that End/Rejuvenated, End/Professional drinker, End/Chem resistant, and End/Aquaboy/Aquagirl are all wasted points better spent elsewhere.
---
* End/Ghoulish - If you haven't tried End/Ghoulish with Chr/Rad sponge they pair wonderfully together in rad zones.
---
* Chr/Bodyguards - Low value perk card IMHO especially in power armor. I would recommend T-51b if you aren't already in it.
---
* Chr/Suppresor - 30% is a lot. Its duration refreshes with each hit. This and empath are your primary tools for protecting your allies. Another option is to use Chr/Team medic rank 3 instead.
---
* Chr/Lone wanderer - Swap in card for when you are solo.
---
* Int/Stabilized - While the Gatling laser currently does not benefit from the Anti-Armor component of this perk card it does benefit from the accuracy bonus. I don't think it's worth it. But, I wanted to mention it in case you think that your accuracy is too low at whatever range you prefer to engage enemies at. If you use other non-energy based heavy weapons it may be worth adding this.
---
* Chr/Thru-hiker - Unless you are the primary chef always providing both food and water for your entire group you don't need to carry much food or water on you. Certainly not enough to justify 3 perk points. Food and water are both cheap, abundant, and easily accessible on the run.
---
* Chr/Action boy/Action girl - I sprint a lot so this is required. You may want to put Chr/Thru-hiker here.
---
* Chr/Adrenaline - Depending on play-style you may not want this card. I think it's a high value card but only at rank 1.
---
* I think that both Lck/Bloody mess and Lck/Class freak are very valuable for your build. Keep in mind that Lck/Bloody mess is multiplicative. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tldz/psa_misunderstood_perk_cards/) for more information.
---
* There are 3 points remaining that I think are very flexible. Maybe you want Str/Bear arms back because you carry 3 or 4 heavy weapons? Maybe Int/Stabilized because you might decide to primarily use a ballistic damage based heavy weapon? Maybe you want End/Professional drinker because your character drinks (alcohol) like a fish? Your choice.
---
**Mutations:**
---
* I would remove both "Electrically charged" and "Unstable Isotope." I think they cause more trouble then the trivial damage they are worth. You might disagree. That's ok!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Please feel free to ask questions, ask for clarifications, or criticize my choices. I'm always open to discussion.
---
That was really cool!! Thanks for the post.
---
NV failed megacritic scores also. Game just couldny be played with out patches and cost them a lot of money... Still ended up being the best fallout to many ppl.
---
Are you wearing food weight reducing armor bc when you get out of the armor you lose the weight perks and can only destroy stuff
---
Is it confirmed the beta wave is better than gamma?
---
Hell got locked in my box becuase I didn't know doors don't open in edit mode. So I stupidly fast traveled back to my camp to get out.
---
I've used it a handful of times in 500+ hours. It goes right to the vendor. I couldn't handle not being about to marsupial jump while in a nuke zone
---
Lol.....sigh...
---
Nobody is arguing that killing people gets you resources. If you read my comment, It was a direct response to someone else regarding destroying player camps. 
---
Unless I'm missing something here.... by all means, correct me. What is to be gained by destroying their camps?
---
AFAIK, my statement still holds true. Nothing to be gained, no resources or reward. Besides satisfying your ego maybe? Beyond that, feels like a waste of time to me.
---
I always wondered about that but was too chicken-shit to use the serum with starched genes, in the chance it would prevent it from taking.
---
No. I can use aid just not in the armor. I am not wearing food weight reducing armor
---
As cool as it is, Would that actually be possible though?
---
Good to know! If you’re on pc do you have them for sale? I just found forest armor this morning and it’s my favorite so far lol didn’t know they had legendary pieces!
---
You got me there. As i stated in separate comment.
---
&gt;That just sounds like a broken mechanic to me. Unless you are somehow some badass level 5 taking on level 100, you have no real business in leaderboards.
---
That is handy to know...I think I got that card in a pack recently!
---
For explosive weapons, we have a much better idea of how the damage value listed in the pip-boy is calculated than how it works in game. Hence "pip-boy damage".
---
Grounded is a 50% penalty, max Class Freak reduces that to 12.5%. 525 \* 0.875 = 460.
---
I'm down a little later tonight. In about 3 hours after dinner and relaxing with my girlfriend if you'll still be on.
---
I would certainly love if, with the Marsupial mutation, my feet would transform into that of a Kangaroo's.
---
Me and another guy found him yesterday. We ran it back like 8 times but no long coat. Got the fisherman outfit and the yellow slicker hat tho
---
There are no specific energy weapon perks in Fallout 76. Rifleman works for semi-auto rifles, regardless of whether they're energy or ballistic.
---
You weren't stating that you were talking about CAMPs in this segment, infact the guy specifically talks about PvP as a whole.   
---
Specify what you're talking about bud.
---
Idk that’s weird
---
SWATTERS COME GET YOUR SEATTERS GENUINE HAND TOOLED HICKORY
---
Unfortunately it’s been delayed a bit, and even more unfortunate is that last they talked about it, it sounds like the functionality will likely be nothing like allowing you to decorate willy nilly with junk items, but just display cases that you can assign certain items to. (Think bobblehead stands, magazine racks, and weapon racks from Fallout 4)
---
Yeah, I trusted your math. Just think I could use that extra 12 and half percent. I’ll probably keep my grounded mutation.:)
---
I'm round 25 to 30 caps.
---
Use neon letters to make a better one that people can actually read.
---
I bought a bunch for 50 caps the other day. I’d probably pay as much as 75 depending on how close to the limit I am.
---
I might have found a way to remove it, see my most recent post I just did it today!
---
I  have a dead flatwoods monster at my feet right now, i assume anyone that joins me will be able to see it and get a pic. I am on PC player name RogueAOV. I will stand guard over it
---
50 a piece
---
Lots at black mountain ordnance works
---
Yeah, that’s my position as well (not on the particular armour, though it is sweet. But waiting for quality.) If atoms were reasonably priced, then people would probably pick up more of the disposable/silly stuff that currently dominates the store. However, as they aren’t, a lot of people are hoarding the free atoms and waiting for cooler furniture/skins etc. I guess enough whales are still hoovering atom packs up to make Bethesda not want to rethink their strategy.
---
I like your idea here. Thanks.
---
that would make my hunt for magazines so much easier. I only need one more, but nobody has it.
---
OP, are you a console or PC player?
---
It certainly looks that way from data-mining.
---
xbox unfortunately.
---
I wanted to keep the charisma at 4 or at least 3 minimum I I have hard bargain when purchasing items.  I forgot about stabilized though. Will look into it.
---
I did that the first time around about 3 days ago (which is why I only had 450 scrip today), and got crap for the most part.  It's weird how streakishly bad the drops are - had pretty much gotten used to it, now it's weird how streakishly good they've been over two days.
---
I also have
---
Puff The Berserker Dragon - Self Explanatory
---
And for armor
---
Brain control Blocker - My Tinfoil hat (wear that with the shiny red dress)
---
John Cena's Tit Protector - 3 star chameleon chest piece
---
 Good to know! If you’re on pc do you have them for sale? I just found forest armor this morning and it’s my favorite so far lol didn’t know they had legendary pieces!
---
If I could get prize bot and insult bot to follow me to that encounter that might spice it up a little.
---
Nah I’m a wannabe. Can’t 1 hit everything. Only reason I mentioned it is because I think the stealth one shots cause this bug. Doesn’t happen on my other character at all.
---
I think you mean the "Grounded" mutation? If "dampened" is your translation of it then please excuse me.
---
Yup totes just cus they're youngins not a humans can be dumb thing nope.
---
Teeing off in power armor....
---
$500?  Nah, that’s totally fair for 10 maps
---
Shotguns are still fun, they're just not broken because of a single explosive legendary modifier. If you were trying to use shotguns as a Run-n-Gun weapon, you're doing it wrong. entire design of them, besides the poor double barrel, is that you're supposed to make a crit build of them, mainly a sneak crit build, surprisingly.
---
look at Mr. Moneybags with his fancy neon letters
---
I have noticed if you have multiples of maps they sell quicker than singles, since each map gives you another "draw" at the treasure. 
---
Might influence your pricing.  Multiples might sell for a bit more than singles.
---
Nope.  
---
Its more stable now, and there's a little bit of new content, but not much. That's it.
---
Damn OP.... I was in the same boat...
---
you sir are a fucking legend. couldn't see it but the camera picked it up. thanks so much, glad I saw this post!
---
Helped one person get the pic, and the body disappeared.
---
The fact that you have to go to a subreddit to have to find that specific thing is of in itself a failure of game, which I think is the whole point of this post - to add functionality that people are wanting within the actual game.
---
It's so-so. It loses its electrcity arcing effect, it just shoots explosive bullets. The best thing to do is to give it the charging shotgun barrel. Each pellet of the shotgun shot is going to have an explosion with the same base damage as a regular explosion would
---
Its honestly the easiest thing to fix though just change the values of 1 armor piece. (I made a similar post and got down voted)
---
😂😂😂😂😂 who tf wants am aae double barrel
---
Bro523 of the offer still stands
---
Not really, isnt that why most subs exist?  To help people find items and information?  Kinda one of the main purposes of reddit
---
Would be great, but you know...Bethesda being a business and all...
---
I dont know how you could really make that work for vending machines. That seems more like something you would want added to player to player trade menu.
---
Nah I'm just special sometimes :P
---
Too soon
---
Your brain is fun... "You can't see me!"
---
if you're on xbox i can give u one, i think everyone should have one so i collect them
---
That’s why I said really a mechanic. But yeah.
---
The thing I want most is for them to display how many unknown plans they have. So lets say they have 33 plans, but you know 30 of them, then it would display "plans- 33 (3). That would mean they have 33 total, but 3 you don't know.
---
The body has now disappeared,
---
What's the point of putting scars on your character or even designing your face? There is no point aside that it's fun to feel like the character tour playing.
---
Pobody's nerfect ;)
---
I have them in my camp for 76 caps.  PC IGN shankwell
---
Just curious, why do people care about the persevered pie?
---
Fable shaped my brain for future gaming I cant help but want a peice of the past.
---
Probably not, unless it was like Halo Golf where the club is a weapon (already in the game) and the ball is a physics-amplified object that you could attack to throw around. Scoring probably wouldn’t be built in either.
---
For sure! Put them together!!
---
Unfortunately, no. I’m on xbox.
---
Purveyor stays in berkeley station, in the southwestern part of the mire. She sells you legendaries for scrip. 60 scrip for 3* armor, 100 for 3* melee or ranged weapons (you get to choose which one). 
---
You get 3, 9, and 24 scrip for 1*, 2*, and 3* armor. 5, 15, and 40 for weapons. You sell them at legendary exchange machines at any train station, but you have a daily limit of 150 scrip. It resets 20 hours after you first use it since its previous reset. 
---
Effects and effect synergy is more important than star count. I roll for 3* only, but that's because I'm hoping for a true god roll. If you just want something decent, you're probably best off with 2*, as that's more likely to get you something "good enough" due to how many more spins you can take. A third effect can very well be useless for your specific build or whatever role the other two effects play
---
Currently, watch out for a bug with assaultron heads and wood armor you get from the purveyor. Assaultron heads you get from her (not from legendary enemies) will lose its legendary prefix after you log off. Legendary wood armor from her (again, not from legendary enemies) will lose any effects it has other than its prefix. So a quad assaultron head with vats crits and accuracy would just become a 2* assaultron head with vats crits and accuracy, and a vanguard sentinel +end wood piece would just become a 1* vanguard piece.
---
Wow. This is very informative.  I followed a lot of what you said.  Thru hiker was in there because I carry a lot of food and water for my team normally.  I’m part of a group that play in a daily basis and there’s always at minimum 3 of us on. I think I can make without the.  All those extra perks in endurance was mainly to counter the Empath mutation which is a must.   Do you think removing so much points in it will still be tanks enough with empath?  Lastly lol, I’m glad you mentioned PA.  My plan was to use T60.  Is the T51b better?
---
I think the sped up animations fo enough for speed demon speaking from a ease of programing point of view.
---
There is a shotgun barrel for the Tesla? Interesting.  I've been playing since beta and just becmver paid attention to energy weapons and wanting to try something new
---
500 is the upper end of acceptable. 
---
Let's not pretend anything other than 300 is a fair price. 400 if you want to split the difference but normalising 500 as "perfectly reasonable" is ridiculous.
---
Exsaculy, how will we know who are the filthy tainted mutants verse the pure vault dwellers(ps in super mutated...)
---
50-100 caps each. Keep in mind that people only really buy these in bulk
---
Did you complete the daily challenge?
---
All 5?
---
Hmmmmmm.....🤠
---
.... eh ,
---
I thought it was fucking great for killing scorched to get the atoms on shotgun kills.  I just merked even lvl 68 conquerors with that beast.  Anything within 10 feet was immediately dead even with no perks aside from Covert Ops and Bloody Mess.
---
and using VATs in Fo76 is downright pointless. you still miss your shot,  and it costs AP to even bring up the VATs menu ADS is still fun though.
---
If people didnt shoot me in the back and contendkill me at workshops we could do this kinda stuff
---
Is that near where the little shack with a tinker's workbench? If so, I think I saw a flatwoods monster there on launch day. I saw a double digit level, I saw flashing purple lights, and I ran the fuck away
---
Imaging spawning into Whitesprings station and seeing this shit!
---
Alright I will concede that yeah the weight reduction perks should 100% be applied to my stash items. That shit is annoying as hell and is a valid point lol
---
Wouldn’t it be nice......    :)
---
Information and communication, yes. If you're having to trade outside of the game because the game lacks what seems like a reasonable function to have within the game, that's when it's a sign of compensating for a failure.
---
Much like the challenge of having to revive an ally. It doesn't encourage teaming up and helping each other out during combat. It encourages people to post on reddit to find someone help them jump through a hoop.
---
Also an issue with assaultron heads, they lose their prefix mod
---
Transgender deathclaw!!!!!
---
There are only 2 bathrooms, which would it choose?
---
I suggested in a post the other day that you could possibly weaponise golf balls through an auto grenade launcher or something. Then it could possibly be possible to fire shots around the course
---
There's a charging shotgun you can only get from a plan. There's a lobbing barrel you can only find as an extremely rare pre-modded drop. Also, if you find one with a charging barrel, it will have a glitched "scope" sight that prevents the sights from even showing up when inspecting it outside a workbench. Also, spamming an automatic one into a large crowd of robots or super mutants can trigger the damage bug. It's fascinating how broken the tesla gun is in this game!
---
nope, it’s an empty space actually. i have my camp there
---
All very interesting,  thank you
---
So mods, the "no meme content as posts" rule isn't a thing any more, right? 
---
You, like, wanna scratch it off the list of rules? Seems like a useless rule.
---
Precisely.

Got my 2 Star Bandolier perk card so I'm hauling 12,000+ rounds just between. 50,

.45, and Shotgun with almost negligible carry weight. John keeps me hidden and I've got enough lead on me to open a pencil factory where ever I setup to clear an area of the squishy soft targets

It's a really rare drop for the forest region repeatable quests you just have to keep doing them and get lucky.

Just found out you have to “search” bodies and containers and stuff, Level 39

I've done Campfire Tales over 100 times in the last 3 weeks ... 3 badges total.
---
The RNG in this game is getting to me .... I keep expecting it to get better, but no fixes on the broken challenges, no changes to anything to make the game more player friendly.
---
I mean I can see that I mean a shotgun to the face is a shotgun to the face especially if you're 10 feet away
---
I'd love for this to happen so that I can go back to listening to the radio. 
---
However, given how miserly the dev and product team seems to be towards this game though, I'm not all that optimistic that we'll see any more tracks any time soon. More songs = more licensing fees to have to pay.
---
Says on their website you have until may 3rd to submit a ticket for the canvas bag replacement. So your probably SOL.
---
Just do what I did if you don't want to grind...buy it with caps lol or trade some quality weapons.
---
See this is why they bombed the wasteland fuck the bos robot this one gots lights
---
Anybody know the name of the tune playing in Big Al's Tattoo Parlor? Would love to have that on a jukebox in camp.
---
Am I the only one thinking that japanese players have way too much time on their hands? Like seriously, they're able to make god-level camps with a shit ton of decorations and creativity you swear this is actually a beta for Little Big Planet 4.
---
Meanwhile, all you can do is make some basic square-shaped building...and that's it.
---
As much as possible lol Shoot me a message if you're selling, I'd buy a few hundred a couple times a week. GT: Hugh Jeffankawk
---
Yeah ... they got my money on Pre-Order, full price Tricentennial edition.
---
I figure they owe me about $75 on what players have been paying since a week after launch.
---
From glowing enemies I assume?
---
Or he got his ass handed to him by a happy vault dweller outta 76!!!!     🤠
---
Just picked up the shotgun Tesla plan :)
---
My camps right by there, gonna have to take a look.
---
I got a few that I like. One of the best I came across incorporated the raider windmill in the toxic valley. They also seemed to have about evey camp item I know of. It was a highly detailed, fleshed out set up. 
---
Some really good legendaries too.
---
I do it every time I see it lol I NEED MORE!!!
---
Go to bethesda website click games, click fallout 76, scroll to bottom of page, click support or my support. You may have to search around the website to find it. I find the website a bit difficult to navigate. From the my support page you can find all tickets you have submitted and their status.
---
I knew uranium fever does, didn't realize the others do. And frogs? Lol I rarely see them. Good to know though, thanks for the tips.
---
In the military wing? I only ever see 3 plans there: gatling laser, gatling plasma, and gauss rifle
---
Two weeks ago or 3 there’s was a dupe method that involved the servers , they did emergency patch I’m assuming they only deactivated them , they’re not serving since
---
I only have one friend who plays occasionally so I haven't even been able to launch one. Good to know to keep an eye out though.
---
Open wide!!!   😬
---
The real karma of the Wasteland.
---
Would like to also list another location , just east of Blackwater Mine up the hill a bit once you hit the woods. 
---
Also on top of one of the roofs at Blackwater there is a log walkway, there's a bubble on the antenna on the roof?? Idk it seems a bubble hints there is a Cryptid location around?? Like the alien statue around Vault 76.
---
Thanks and thats super lame but theres a light so i am happy
---
anti-armor any weapon is still effective if you're at full health or 19% health.  If you have adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage, any anti-armor/explosive gun is going to be a lot better.  TSE is hot trash for shotguns now.  Instigating and anti-armor effects are so much better, the same as rifles after the the TSE nerf.  The best long gun you can get is an instigating/+10% aim hunting rifle now.
---
I'd be happy scrapping the ammo.
---
All I do now is drop it all at a train station, overseer's camp, or vault 76 for someone else to use
---
That's a real good tip, thank you. Does the Tesla Rifle count? That's the only energy weapon I have in general.
---
Dude this was awesome!!!

I had a blast coming across this!! Everyone should stop by and show this guy some love!!

---
Let us know what platform and someone can come help you. I did the quest when I was in my 20s and a Level 92 helped me, killed it in 3 shots :)
---
I'd pay for this to happen
---
Prob easier to manage than all of the other aid perks as well
---
We are pretty awesome as a community but a lot of the time it's self-serving too. Workshop defender is after XP and maybe plans. Same too with the food plant dude but they also get the sweet sweet canned food. 
---
They have to ask to PvP because that's the only way it'll happen now that they've removed almost all avenues to do it. Back in the early days, that "polite" person would have just shot you.
---
Wait til someone helps to revive you when your downed rescues you from a fight you're surely to die in before you see the truly awesome people of our community. 
---
I'm not saying your experiences aren't awesome and worth noting. Just tempering expectations.
---
I did drop a whole ton of steel, ballistic fiber and over a 100 ultracite a while ago. Dropped in the room by the dumpster. Got rid of 200lbs of stuff. Glad somebody got a good use out of it!!!!    🤠
---
Meh. click bait
---
I have the shielded plan. You gotta learn the rest.
---
Make constant trips to Winterspings to get Nuka Cola grape. It gets rid of rads and it keeps your mutations
---
That'd be nice too, but I honestly wouldn't mind the extra caps
---
This comment adds nothing to the conversation other than a cheap insult. If you believe that what he said is false, show your evidence. All he said is that the criticism was justified due to the bugs and questionable stability at release. If you don’t believe it was, explain your opinion and have a productive discussion. Don’t just come in and throw insults and not say anything intelligent.
---
Why was the initial criticism not deserved? What made the bugs and glitches acceptable from a consumer standpoint? How was Bethesda a professional and responsible developer during the release and post launch development of the game?
---
I get notified of their bounties increasing as I get hit/friendly fired from them though

---
Captain Morgan Private Stock used to come in a plush velvety bag... used to have like 200 of those things in my wall locker...
---
That's so contested just for one node though. I usually grab the disposal workshop which has 3 nodes, easy/quick to kill enemy waves, and no one ever wants it. 3 nodes is less than 20 nuclear material an hour though and it's kinda annoying having to keep an eye on the clock and drop whatever I'm doing every half hour. I'd much rather find a way to spend a few hours grinding them out every so often when needed.
---
Shit my bad, I coulda used that aid 😂 I was on edge because I was actually on my way to a workshop owned by a team of 4 people that kept hunting me and failing to kill me. I noticed after I killed you, you started to follow me so I fast traveled back to the station to head to the munitions factory to kill that team
---
Next time I see you though I'll hold my fire if you ever pop into survival again 🤙
---
I have no grudge in my heart, but after getting absolutely merked by this guy and his pal, having them laugh at a lvl 50-something character, fucking up my day while insulting me with homophobic and racial jokes, it just felt GOOD to close off my goodie bag.  I like my gay friends, but I'm just not gay.  I tried same sex and MMF in college, but I'm just not a gay man.
---
... I should probably lay off the Brain Fungus for a while.
---
Idk I use my bloodied explosive lever and aae lever action to this day ans I'm pushing700 damage

I didn't order the special edition and don't give a shit about a bag... but if people let companies get away with even this tiny shit, next company will try to get away with more.  
---
Business is entirely based around profits, eithics and morals don't fit in anymore.  We do nothing and after a decade or so, who knows what shit we will be missing when we buy a new product.
---
You're incorrect. For some it's word placement. For others, it's definitely spelling. Speaking as one who has studied 3 spoken and 2 written languages and who interacts regularly with folks from other countries. 
---
Whether you're a racist, a xenophobe, or just someone who likes to bully young kids, I think you've revealed plenty about your character, so I agree that we're done.

---
I find it funny when people shit on other people for making suggestions. Absolutely no harm in making suggestions (particularly popular ones like human NPCs). 
---
I'm sure Bethesda are big boys and girls enough to decide on what they choose to work on or not.
---
People who ask care about what other people think about the game. Our biggest influencers are other people. Family, friends, strangers. We need to constantly justify doing something, gain approval from others.

Basically, if you enjoy the game they will consider buying it so they feel like they belong to a community.

I know, after getting nothing for 115 levels (I mean, literally, from level 45 to level 90 or so, my main weapon was an instigating baseball bat, which switched to an instigating deathclaw), all of a sudden I've had 5 really good drops in two days.
---
Good info, will PM a CM and see if there is any info, please let me know if you hear back (I'll do the same)
---
I'm expecting a bloodied nerf any day now, because it is just so strong without much downside if you have a high capacity backpack, unyielding armor, nerd rage, serendipity, dodgy and blocker perks for weight management and defense.  The DPS is outrageous and the sacrifice is only in really in carry weight.  A bloodied auto handmade can clear 300 damage a shot, easily.  One head shot will kill almost any enemy on the map.  A maxed "better crits" card will badly fuck up a lvl 50 scorchbeast with one headshot from a lvl 50 instigating hunting rifle with a piercing magazine mod at low health.

Thank you I unfortunately wont be on till Wednesday but I will add you then!!

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

I do occasionally, but haven’t had one in a while.
---
dropping the excess ammo would give you more storage to acquire the items that you can make those extra caps from
---
This is the same subreddit that hates literally every negative viewpoint on the game, and thinks that youtubers/reviewers were "targeting" the game because it was trendy. Now you want them to trust Googling the game, instead of asking the players? I take it you just *don't* want this game to succeed?
---
God scrapping ammo for gunpowder and lead would be amazing, even if the ratio was tiny.
---
Can someone actually confirm this?  Because I feel like it's bs. I carry all bloodied stuff and I feel like I constantly get nocturnal or stalkers

Aww, thank you so much!! &lt;3 I hope you've gotten some good use out of the checklist, feel free to let me know if you spot any issues with it and I'll get them fixed ASAP! :)
---
It's not that they're bad at them. It's a mans needs to conquer and a woman's need to tame.
---
Thanks for this.. I would still like some more information on the requirements though such as  the budget in your camp. Is deleting one regular turret enough, would this alone prevent you from taming it?
---
Well I’m currently using a 3* furious Tesla and I love it

Whichever one has the higher damage rate.

They can be rewards for the primary quests at top of the world. Also check the raider vendors.

---
[](/awelestia)Those people that don't put anything near where they initially placed the CAMP so I don't get stuck in the floor, and have the machines together with no pointless locked doors. These are the people that I'm willing to take a higher price from.  
---
Then for selection I like to see legendaries of all stars aside from maybe one star nocturnal stuff I can't tell you how many shops I've found that will only sell 3 star AA, or Bloodied weapons I don't use either, so I end up avoiding those names in the future. Chems are always welcome if it's at a reasonable price. Missiles, Cannonballs, Mini Nukes, and 40mm are almost always overpriced, but I will buy them all and make note of the shop if they're under 10caps(5 for 40mm) per usually.  
---
As for location I tend to shy away from the forest/toxic valley since there's a ton of low levels throwing pipe weapons, and leather armor up. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I'm sure low levels would rather be able to buy stuff their level than level 50 legendary gear they won't be able to use forever. I see a ton of people either at the Whitespring, Legendary Vendor/Harper's Ferry, or the Top of the World so it's not a bad idea to stay near those places so you're near other shops for when people are hopping from shop to shop.  
---
Those are my 2 cents anyway.
---
Lol I think I said everything when I said it was copy and paste in a thread about people still complaining about the game.  And from someone who claims they dont even play the game or so it can be assumed from his snide 6 people playing the game comment below.
---
Well it kind of depends on two things, does Furious affect the Arch damage?
---
If no use Executioners, not only that I'm fairly certain you lose the bonus Furious damage the moment you attack an second target. So Executioers is probably the better choice.
---
I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to date right now.
---
Honestly, IMO, the game has reached a point where we shouldn't be dropping loot on death anymore. Personally, I'm doing an unarmed roleplay. I can be one shot by the Sheepsquath and die very rapidly from the SBQ and her ads, especially the ones behind me that I can't see. A lot of the time I don't even go down with the chance to be rezzed, I go straight to death. I'm tired of being punished for something I can't help, and I'm tired of the assholes that are being rewarded by deaths I can't prevent.

---
Honestly, on release I still loved this game. I used to gameshare with my ex friend and he bought it and I loved it but he never wanted to play it. I played it a lot and had good progress it’s just I stopped because I had no friends to play with and recently stopped being friends with that guy. Was friends with him for 8 years. I personally think it’s worth the buy if you’re into fallout and have a group of friends.
---
Sniper/Vats/Sneak build and using:
---
Eagle Eyes
---
\- Mandatory for gun damage
---
Electronically Charged
---
\- Not meant to get hit anyway, but good to have if only to AOE annoying bugs and cockroaches, especially flying bugs
---
Healing Factor
---
\- No need to carry healing food and reduces stim pack use
---
Carnivore
---
\- Raw meat generally doesn't give health, but that's what Healing Factor is for. Raw meat = free food, helps with Speed Demon. Just kill a dog.
---
Marsupial
---
\- Mandatory for everyone...
---
Plague Walker
---
\- No disadvantages whatsoever without diseases. If you pick up a disease with no cure handy, then fk the rest of the world too :)
---
Speed Demon
---
\- Paired with Marsupial, you literally become Superman before he got used to flying. With "Escape Artist" perk card and Sneak cards, you can re position yourself around the battlefield VERY quickly. If shit hits the fan you can RUN out of there like the Flash.
---
\- No food issues especially when paired with Carnivore
---
\- No water issues AT ALL if you just loot boiled water/water purifiers/water rewards from events
---
I'm still tossing whether to use Grounded mutation or not, but I'm hoping they buff energy weapons soon since I want to play with Lasers...
---
Ahh thank you so much!
---
No plans for actual armor only plans for under armor
---
The only thing I hate right now is loading screen times lol
---
I'll definitely keep this in mind, if you still have it and would like to join us we wouldn't mind. After all, one friend is in the 80s in level, my other friend is in the 20s and I'll be just starting.
---
That's also my day off 
---
'll definitely be on then also
---
How long are they on average if I may ask?
---
With all defense perks, I can easily run a silo in a suit of T-51b and maybe use a couple diluted radaway and 2-3 diluted stims through the whole process while staying at 15-19% health on my own with a vampire/ss sledgehammer modded with a piercing rocket and never lose a bot on the last segment.  I worry a little with Colonel Gutsies and high level stealthed assaultrons, but that's it.  3-4 hits and they're dead.
---
We are one
---
I would love to play 76 with a group finally but sadly I do not own the game anymore. Kinda bummed now. Hope you have a fun time with your friends!
---
I came back and made a completely new alt (sniper/sneak/vats) having done almost everything on my overpowered 2h melee build (1 month after launch)
---
I also made it a goal to experience everything (notes/holotapes/events/workshops) and taking it SLOW this time round. And also doing Overseers journey IN ORDER.
---
Found myself having a lot more fun now.
---
Totally totally worth it coming back.
---
No.
---
Tl;Dr. It's buggy and glitchy but as a $30 game with friends I recommend it. 
---
It's still buggy and glitchy. I get disconnected reliably once a day and I have probably one of the better experiences. Peruse the Reddit and you'll see people have had it worse than I. Still I'm well over 500 hours and have enjoyed the game immensely. And yes, I know of the texture issues your friend speaks of. 
---
You're getting it at a budget price and going to be playing it with friends, look at it like that and you should have a good experience.
---
Charisma....unsure. I think it helps with the probability that the animal friend Kicks in.
---
I'll try to, but if you ever buy the game again, please don't hesitate to PM me and ask if you want to come along. We're all pretty nice and would love to have a full party (assuming a full party is 4)

I appreciate it, the problem with RNG is outliers, and apparently I am one. I spent 5 hours server hopping, wavy Willard’s, teapot and one other place and nothing. At a certain point you just have to realize continuing is dumb use of limited time.

Who's Robert Patterson?

Do you mean [this Robert Patterson](https://robertpaterson.com/)?
---
...or [this Robert Patterson](https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Robert-Paterson/)?
---
Don't get hung up on terminology, you really don't seem to understand distributed computing. Forget I ever used the word "offline", I didn't intend for it to derail the entire idea. You can seperate processes from the foreground user facing systems and have other systems do other things. Trust me, I've worked in the IT industry for over a decade, and extensively with SQL databases for the last half of that.
---
All items in the game are really just database columns and rows. When you open the stash the database gets queried, and the more data it has to dig through the longer it takes. So if you keep a seperate database that doesn't have to be queried, the game is not impacted by the items on that database, and because it's not constantly being queried you can store a lot more there, easily enough for all the players on all the game servers.
---
So you have the primary database that the game servers constantly query, then the extra storage database that mostly sits there except when a player wants to look through it and retrieve an item. The item then transfers to the primary database and is referenced in the game again.
---
This post is so old Bethesda has since updated it so it actually registers now lmao

I do it because it looks neater and is easier to catalogue.

Like why couldn't loose screws just be screws?
---
[](/parrrtycannon)I nominate "Directed by Michael Bay" for the weapon name.
---
I think I'd enjoy it possibly, currently watching my friend play it through Share Play and it looks like I may have as much of an immersive experience as Fallout 4 (I loved Fallout 3, New Vegas, and 4, but was skeptical on this, mainly because I didn't like how they worked with Elder Scrolls Online alongside the stuff I heard about on launch so I wanted to give it a bit of time).
---
same for me, maybe they fixed it sometime because i know some people have completed it, but we'll need to have more than 50 then
---
Thats good. But i already named my exploding gatling "Michael Bay's Civil War"
---
Upvoted
---
Lol, what a ridiculious, bullshit comment.
---
If you can find it for the price you mentioned, then yes. I got it back in April for 17 bucks and change, and I definitely feel like it was worth it. I wouldn't pay 60 though.

i got you. PSN: reaganpappas

Yeah I see it there on the store for 80 (Canadian price), and I wouldn't pay that much for it. Kinda hoping it goes on sale during the Days of Play sale starting tomorrow. But I'll check elsewhere as well to look for the best price.
---
So long as we can make them as traps.

I’m currently on.
---
This question gets posted every day by people who are too lazy to read what has been repeatedly said or who feel the need to be coaxed to come back.
---
But did you coming and accusing him of being a mindless reposter really add anything to the conversation that may change someone else’s mind after reading what he said? Just because he shares the opinion of a large group of the player base doesn’t mean his opinion is wrong. And there’s only so many ways you can say a game sucks before it starts sounding repetitive.
---
You said he had copied and pasted his comment, but I have seen dozens of comments across the subreddit that you could have easily copied for your quip. He gave his opinion and evidence to back up his claim. You took a cheap shot at it when it had no value in the conversation. Even in the comment where he makes the snide comment about 6 people, he still gives a reason to have grievances with the game. The reason he lists have actually been the basis for legal action, so I would say that they are fairly substantial. You however have offered nothing more than a pathetic excuse for a joke. So from your comment that “said everything” I can only assume that you have no evidence to refute his claim so your only option was to resort to calling him a sheeple.

Keep ghost riders. That song is a bop. But songs like Mr Sandman are the Johnny Guitar of 76. Get them out.

It’s worst than stupid, it’s an intentional artifical gate to create the illusion of challenge and content.
---
I get the player maw of online games is insatiable - takes hours to make each minute; but this is not the way to go about that problem. Bad design decisions abound.
---
Damn, a man of exquisite taste I see. In that case what about something to the effect of "Ma Double Deuce Booming" In reference to the 50 cal being a Browning M2 which had the common nick name "Ma Deuce"?
---
Thanks, I messaged you on PSN.
---
Apparently it deletes explosive , the weird thing is upon reliving in the responders skin was missing and the old tactical paint was in place ,. But 2 guns missing a star and perk after using the skin it has to be a bug with the skin
---
So I have the demolition expert perk card but it doesn't seem to add any additional damage to my Tesla rifle. Does anyone know if it does but just doesn't list it (bugged) or if it actually doesn't add anything?
---
Sounds like you're on the right track. You mostly assign based on build and playtype. If for some reason you do mess up, once you hit level 50, you can move points as needed to balance or correct any mistakes you might have made.
---
Focus more on the perks rather than the bumber of special points that will come naturally. Type fo76 build planner on google there is a good one forgot the exact name
---
I haven't played in six months. Not sure I ever will again. But I definitely got my money's worth of playing in.
---
Yep.
---
Yeah my friend just got booted and is getting psn errors, I'm still on though
---
Ditto. Got home from work and cant get on!

&gt;but I'm just not gay.

This entire subreddit is just "Bethesda can I please have more expensive atom shop shit that I'm gonna complain about once its released"

Just about every material is easier to get in higher quantities and at a faster rate by collecting items, smelting ore, or killing enemies. Workshops are so damn slow in comparison. Fully charged fusion cores are about the only thing that's worthwhile from workshops (especially when you capture all 3 power plants).
---
I used to serverhop southern mountain lookout for one of the previous alien challenges, FM spawned on the cliffs southwest of the tower. You need to run almost straight ahead past it from the spawn point for like 5-7 seconds and you'll see the cliffs overlooking a broken monorail. Did an awesome photoshoot with flatwoods monster there a month ago.
---
Yea, i agree.

I have been in most of the evening, but had long loading screens at times.  PC.
---
[](/kmpinkiecannonball)I'd love that, I've looked around for a ramshackle abode to colonize since I love the scavenged house look(especially the raider camps), but they're all either protected locations, or monster spawn points.
---
I thought the deadline was janurary.
---
I wanted Fallout 4 with multiplayer.
---
I got Fallout 76, but it's missing the human NPC's and the NPC ingame scripts/events
---
Now, imagine they added NPC's back in (no necessarily the scripting), and the ability to join factions. It will open a whole new layer of roleplaying, potential PVP, faction specific challenges and goals, specific npc dailies and rewards etc etc
---
Because right now 80% I'm doing things by myself/solo and not bothering grouping up for anything. Even in events I don't go into groups due to the Lone Traveller perk.
---
I agree. I am completely fine with Robots, vendors, and enemies being the NPCs. The lack of humans contribute to the story and atmosphere of the game. Also, some of the robots are very interesting and hilarious such as Rose and the scout leaders.
---
Ps4 was down for maintenance
---
When we get our canvas bags.
---
Ye not good
---
It literally fucking deletes the explosive effect on a shotgun and this post isn't trending? Oh but the post requesting some cosmetic is.
---
yeah, scaly skin and talons were definitely mutations i expected to have "physical changes" like they said some did
---
Part of me is starting to think this is your second account.  Otherwise why would you even bother defending his obvious troll with walls of text.  Either way good luck to you in whatever it is you do.
---
It may not be related, but I am seeing on some network outage maps that there seems to be a lot of Internet issues with north eastern USA.  If you are located there, it might explain some issues.  Emphasize might.  Or might not 😉
---
This should be locked to maybe one or two items. Otherwise I'm afraid it can remove the incentive to visit other people's camps.
---
Also, you should be able to list items that you don't know about yet.
---
[](/starlightbeam)Maybe? I haven't tried it with lanterns, but you know that free no trespassing sign? I stick neon letters on that, and then delete it, and depending on where I set it they'll stay in the air. Might work.

Power Armor Revamp
---
Power Armor is in a strange position wherein it excels at PvE but it's not good in PvP. We are seeing some buffs to the Power Armor System. We will introduce to you the Tier System. All Power Armor Parts will start a Tier 1 and at Tier 1 it will start at 14.29% of the value and per armor upgrades it will increase by 14.29% up to 100%. This will create a grind and a steady increase in power for Power Armor. To further it out we will baseline the Pain Train Perk.
---
Nerfing the Power Armor Repair and P.A repair perk to increase it's maintenance cost will be one step forward and we're introducing the plating system. The Power Armor will now it's own heakth and Instead of the Pilot taking damage it will instead put a full dent to the Power Armor and once a part is broken damaging it again will damage the pilot. The pilot will also be weaker and all armor effects is also disabled for 1 minute if the pilot exits the P.A. This will overall strengthen the Power Armor capabilities at the same time weaken the Pilot capabilities outside the Power Armor. 
---
The current Jetpack mod will be renamed Jump Jet and a new mod will be added. For Chest it will add Jetpack which will allow you to fly for a short period of time. Legs will have Slide System (Replaces sprint with high speed forward slide at expense for higher AP cost), Vertical Jump Jet (Allows the current Jetpack system) and Horizontal Jumpjet (Allows you to dash).
---
Arms will gain Rocket Powered Fist for high speed punches since punching using P.A is generally bad.
---
To match the refine system we will introduce set System. Basically it will still work like refine system but the final upgrade is Stabilized, Full Armor or Light Weight. Stabilized will increase axcuracy and reduce recoil but reduce P.A Health, Full Armor will increase the P.A Health and P.A Damage resistance but decrease speed and finally Light Weight makes the P.A Lighter in weight and more mobile (less mobile than the non P.A users) but poor in Damage Resistance. You can make the different parts having different upgrade but a full set will make it's current effects gain additional 100% effect (Just multiply it by two). This will make Power Armor stronger.
---
Fan Comment: We made it closer to the RF online MAU System. In RF Online Mau are mech but unlike in Fallout 76 no one is whining about it's strength due to the extreme grindiness to get it at Level 75 and it's repair cost that reach 1 billion although it takes full 14 mage shots to take one down. The Mau Class System is what the Set System is inspired off)
---
New Weapons
---
Anti Material Rifle, Anti Tank Mines (P.A and Giant enemies can trigger AT Mines) and many more. New Backpack mod which is a JetPack
---
I don’t mind the pvpers—until they start whining for game changes.
---
This is something I’ve been saying since about a week after launch when the marsupial mutation didn’t make my character look like a giant disgusting rat kangaroo thing from the trailer. I even suggested that they make it an atom shop thing in my own post. I’d love to see this implemented as an OPTIONAL feature.
---
Well that's probably what were getting judging by the datamines. Here's hoping.
---
Thank you to Reagan and Chaos! This place is great!
---
Beautiful C.A.M.P, Great work!
---
Eso was also a big fail at launch too, just about as big of a flop as 76, but is now in the top 5 mmorpgs out right now. And not because of Elswyer release either. So idk what this dude going on about lol
---
I agree, but sadly 95% of people sell absolute garbage. After fast traveling 100 times just to find non legendary guns it gets annoying.
---
You forgot ;)
---
 Mention **Mods** \- it's a no no.
---
For some reason, the Percepti-Bobble *boing* sound comes to mind when I look at this. 
---
What you got under there? Caps stash? Or Bone Worms?
---
Im diggin it.
---
Need to create the amount (in scrap)
---
Super super does not affect this
---
Interesting that you picked a 2-star weapon.
---
Yeah, I agree.  I literally just left a spot that had 15 weapons listed, and 6 of them were the Commie Whackers... 😐😐
---
Using homosexuality as a sign of weakness does imply the bully is weak at heart.

I'm not ashamed at being straight, despite trying my options and having some exploration in college.  How is that TMI?  This is 2019.

For those saying night seems the same as day, does night not look like this for you?

Right ,...
---
Oh watch out, everyone will hate your perfectly normal opinion.  THANK YOU!!!!
---
Thats what i usually pick.
---
So again, you reply with what you think is a witty comment with no real support for your opposition. If you disagree so much then speak up and convince him that he is wrong instead of firing off cheap insults. And is it really trolling if he is refuting what OP insinuates about the continued negative coverage of FO76? But hey, just abandon the conversation when someone asks an actual question. That’s the way to change people minds about the game!
---
I want to golf cart joust like the corpses did near the clubhouse
---
Wait.. We can have multiple mutations at once?
---
Bonus points if you have it be a Mr. Handy who talks about how he's been given a purse and a shopping list and oh, can't you just help a poor robot do its job? "I have the list right here..."
---
And then it'll pop up, like:
---
100 Screws \_\_ 5 caps
---
3 Mentats \_ 20 caps
---
1 Bloodied Drill \_ 100 caps
---
And so on.
---
And each time you sell it a thing from teh list, it deducts that number from the need. (So, if you give it 50 screws, it only shows 50 needed to teh next person.) ... you stock it with caps, it pays people for you.
---
Everybody wins!
---
Visual bug. It shows how many they have after they bought from you not how many they bought.
---
How did you get all mutations day one? 
---
And I've respected twice, it's not that big a deal. 
---
To each their own, you're going to continue agroing everything, but if that's what you want, have at.
---
Sell me all your leather Sentinel &amp; Caviliers stuff 😍😍
---
No you will get a clown wig and red nose and like it
---
Wow they even added a pp
---
Sympathetic. :)
---
Yup, pretty well known. Happens to wood armor as well
---
Pretty much anything bloodied, instigating, furious, anti armor, vampires, two shot, in the first and with explosive or faster fire rate, will be worth a good bit. Depends on the buyer though, and certain archetypes of weapons are more sought after like handmades and railways currently
---
Bethesda watered down the dialogue trees anyway so I doubt players would shoot the npcs because they don't want to talk lmfao
---
+1
---
I mean, _I get it_, but I don't like it....
---
Its just luck. Starched genes off and go get rads. I think you can only get mutation one per server. It would be easier to just buy the serums though as most people sell them between 200 to 500 caps.
---
Were they bought from the legendary vendor first? I remember people reporting legendaries losing stars after logging back in
---
You can also accidentally gain an unwanted mutation from rad exposure with it turned off so watch it with that unless that's what you want. I only run with three mutations so I use it only to prevent getting one I don't want.
---
Interesting, I'll have to give that a try.
---
make friends, help low levels, pretend you're preston garvey and bother innocent bystanders, make a really weird camp, do all the challenges, become the best pioneer scout that appalachia has ever seen!
---
You can have them all.
---
The point of the game is to show the soreness and desperation of the immediate post atomic blast life, and the game does a good job with it via environmental story telling. To get that, the people have to be dead.
---
Bethesda,, please remove PVP from the game rather than make any further changes that impact PVE gameplay.  Thanks.
---
 I carry both an explosive and vats 10mm sub. Vats is the "every day driver"  and the explosive is for when big things need to die.
---
When you attacked me in the same breath you were trying your hardest to chastise me for doing the same thing is where you slipped up bud.  You let emotion creep into your words.  Gave it away. 
---
Now I'm going to let you continue this charade as long as you like and I know you need to have the last word so I'm not coming back here to respond.  Fire away kiddo.
---
If there were barely any survivors in Fallout 1, around 150 years after the war, do you think after 25 years everyone would miraculously still be alive. No its a fucking post nuclear world. Everyone is gonna be dead.
---
Ok thanks yeah I don't really keep up with what all is sought after and what isn't and are one and two star worth keeping or just three star legendaries?
---
I think the point is that those details are non-essential to the story.
---
Is your build centered around the Deathclaw gauntlet. Obviously it will be better if you don't have a single commando perk 😑
---
2. Sometimes when fast travelling to a players vendor camp, I get stuck under the world.
---
3. and 4. Killed a Yao Guai at its cave spawn point (my base is near) When I went to loot it started rising up to bear heaven, higher and higher into the sky as I watched.
---
5. When I do my rounds of player vendors, more and more seem to have their floor built around camp objects, intersecting each other without the usual problems. I can only guess it is something to do with the slow load in of the camps on log in, maybe allowing players to build over the top of other old objects, before the server loads them in?
---
I came upon a vending machine the other day, low on camps, only willing to buy if there was something I really needed.
---
Boy did I need the Bomber Jacket in the machine for 50 caps! It was a great surprise whether the vendor knew what they had or not.
---
I once asked the same question in this subreddit and someone said no it didn’t.
---
Oh I thought you only get one chance to acquire it from one or two of the very first quests after leaving the vault.
---
Star count is close to meaningless. The effects are what matter. 1* bloodied weapons sell for thousands of caps, a 3* ghoul slayer's +int lockpicking leather arm is only worth whatever people are willing to pay for 24 scrip
---
I also want to know this. I had herd mentality and my solo player took such a hit I had too take radx until it was gone.
---
I have heard some people say with all mutations they equal out.
---
Everyone was over ran by the scorch, not by the rads. The voice acting was amazing but having me run errands though holo tapes is lame. There isn't the same feel of urgency as the rest of the fallout series. They dropped the ball and anyone who says they didn't is sadly lying to themselves.
---
I feel I should say I’m on Xbox ,. I’m not here to bash our precious Beth ,. I simply don’t want others to feel the loss of money and item as I am currently,...
---
That sums it up perfectly.
---
It could be worse, it could have put everything in your stash for 0 cap sales
---
If your talking about the regular outfit then yes if your talking about the really rare one then it's a slim chance on any forest repeatable.
---
How does fixing a bugged weapon that's mostly effective in PvP going to impact PvE? I'm asking for the weapon to function like every other BE/TSE Weapon not the damage to be nerfed.
---
There were 2 legendary effects, and those were assigned to unique legendary power armor pieces (I think it was 2 shoulders and a helmet), in Fallout 4. They were fixed rewards too, so they didn't vary in any way. A lot of stuff was just copy pasted over from Fallout 4, and those effects were just carried over as well. It's incredibly doubtful we'll be getting legendary power armor with just those 2 effects available. It is worth noting though that there is a ton of power armor pieces behind the counter where the Purveyor vendor is, and it would be odd if there wasn't going to be a way of getting legendary power armor parts from her at some point.
---
I am currently rocking a  1\* anti-armour lever action.
---
That's amazing.
---
Ow ok thanks I have been selling one stars to the legendary vendor thinking that they werent worth as much as two or three star ones
---
Buy the whole set for 10k, that's what me and some friends got.
---
That's totally fair.  My two best in-game homoies are middle-aged men from nor-cal that are both gay, so I might be championing them a little too much.  I spend most of my game time with them, so I'm keenly aware of modern gay struggles.
---
Spot on
---
Sure sounds like you are asking for them to be nerfed based on your title.
---
So, given the above, I started trying to get the pie from the machines, 3rd try BAMM, pie!
---
I wish my luck with the legendary vendor was as good, she keeps giving me wood, and not the good kind.
---
You can map out all the perks you want and then determine which SPECIAL you will need.
---
He is.
---
You can always check her FYI
---
https://downdetector.com/status/bethesda
---
Their problem isn't the damage output but the way it ignores protective effects like dense and fireproof and also their insane range when aimed from 3rd person. They don't work as intended so they should be fixed.
---
Thank you
---
Yes you can only get one per in game biome a day. So in Toxic Valley you are supposed to get one of the three: Buried With Honor, Big Game Hunter, or Pass the Buck, each day.
---
You might want to be more specific in your “ask” then.
---
Thanks for the info, I needed it today
---
Just do Breach and Clear every time it's up and you'll finish this in no time. Super easy.
---
You either never heard of dupes or you're dense or just too reliant on them to amount to shit in PvP.
---
Not gonna get crazy damage like that unless you're bloodied and out of PA.
---
"I dont think all this text is necessary". JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Do you only consume information if its being spoken to you on youtube video with pretty pictures in the background!? "All this text" is probably like 2:45 of a YT video, but because its type words that one has to .... \*gasp\* .... READ, its too much. Where is my fainting couch!??!!?
---
"Do more than a quick google research". If you knew anything about me then you'd know that I did far more than a "quick google research". All that "more than a quick google search" that I did kid, the thing you likely didnt even bother to do yourself before replying, has been trickling out over the lifespan of the game. Pretty much everything I've said.   
---
As for pre-orders, they are lazy cash-grab that you are paying for a product before it even gets to you where you have no clue of the state it will be in. You're basically ordering Schrodingers Game. You could open the box and find a happy cat, or Fallout 76. A lot of things people complained about in this game were prior knowledge as a BETA STATE WHICH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. Bethesda promised that all of the pre-released bugs would be addressed prior to release. Yet here we are. Finally, pre-orders are NOT fine regardless of the amount of research you do because game companies continually and consistently lie to you. About gameplay, graphics, content, features, promises of things like "no microtransactions EVER" before putting in microtransactions, etc. The bonuses you get are typically not even worth the money either. They may help you for the first hour or so of a game, then you usually find better gear.   
---
And if you are too lazy to read a few paragraphs (holy fuck what happened to humanity where "a few paragraphs" is too much?) and if you're too goddamn lazy to even READ what is said, why the fuck are you bothering to comment? Just to hear yourself spout out random words because you dont know how to react to a post that was too long for your attention span? Heres a hint: Read the post. Then respond. (Groundbreaking eh?) I even gave you a goddamn "TLDR" but I guess your attention span didnt get that far?  
---
A little clarity about the "mods" and the creation club aspect. Bethesda got such a gargantuan backlash at the attempted cash-in of free mods via the "Creation Club" that they are now trying to slowly re-introduce features like this. There are so many incidents involving a gaming company doing something stupid then SLOOOOOOOOOOWLY trying to reintroduce it (I'm guessing a lot of the responders are of the "I BOUGHT HORSE ARMOR!!!" breed, and "Pretty boxes make colors and noises yay!"... thanks for that). Of COURSE they arent going to just slap it back in our faces. When SW:Battlefront got flak for its gambleboxes they took them out then   
---
After the backlash of the Creation Club, WHY would they ban mods now after all they went through. They know their reputation is tarnished (again Todd Howard said so............ for those of you who need citations for every sentence, please go see any of Todd Howards recent interviews on Fallout 76), and the have to re-earn customer trust. Much like after other avenues of venue became untennable, the gaming industry shifts things around.   
---
Todd Howard even admitted, in corporate speak of course, that they knew the game was being released as a pile of shit.   
---
Yet the delusional think that using a game engine that looks about as good as Dwarf Fortress at this point, one which they STILL have somehow not mastered in multiple games, think that the Bethesda gods are purity incarnate.   
---
FInally, to all the deniers who say the people who were modding only fixing the FOV are lying and were probably modding like crazy... please, put the tinfoil hats away. Most of the ACTUAL cheaters know better than to come onto official forums to complain about innocent things, and the deluge of comments SPECIFICALLY about the same topic says that all these people arent SUP3R H4X0RZ but just want to play the game without wanting to vomit.   
---
Out of sheer, morbid curiosity.... how many of you naysayers are able to get into an NC-17 movie without holding a grown-ups hand to get in?
---
You seem to have gotten lucky lol. Most people won't sell it for less than 12k. I think 10k is plenty fair though.
---
Come to think of it that's the only place in 550 hours I've ever seen a flatwoods monster... and it happened for me once.
---
On and especially when it is the boss of an event
---
I'm asking for its bug to be fixed. Whether that nerfs the gun to shit idc.
---
You lose some aid, and using PA/not sneaking is a death sentence, but its fun if you like PvP.
---
Here here. It's impossible to fight this cancerous weapon
---
Try power armor
---
I am not the same poster as the guy you responded to first, but hey, anything to get out of actually giving an intelligent answer right?
---
At that point I had asked you for evidence of why you disagree with the original comment and you provide nothing but poorly thought out insults. You obviously have no opinion and just wanted to make a quick jab but got caught.
---
And where exactly is the insult? Calling you out on your insults? Saying that you would rather leave a conversation than add anything useful? My emotion are perfectly fine, but you seem frustrated that you can’t hang in this conversation. All you have to do is say why you believe FO76 doesn’t deserve the criticism it gets for being released too early or the numerous bugs and glitches. Then we can have a productive conversation, but you won’t even do that.
---
Cuz its awful.
---
Gotta love those lucky days I’ve had days filled with wood armour and days filled with decent bloodied gear. Some days rngeezus smiles on us
---
This is a terrible idea. This would give the dupers with mule accounts prestige items and literally nobody else would give a fuck, and fuck those assholes.
---
I don’t want nerfs requested by pvp players to impact PVE—again.  I would prefer Bethesda making legendary affixes work differently between Survival and Adventure.   Barring that, I would prefer that the needs of the few (pvp) be subordinated to the needs of the many (pve).
---
Nope, its multiplitive, not additive.
---
No, they're just gonna continue the story :)
---
And I would prefer that PVP be removed from the game rather than have yet another nerf caused by PVP whining.
---
This was patched a LONNNNNNGGG time ago.
---
Huh. So how often do first aid boxes refresh?
---
Its almost better to take concfire perk off and just shoot torso.On PS4 Vats dont stay on bodypart u have aimed for a long.
---
I really liked how he put his vendor machines on top of his skyscraper and decided to logoff while I was shopping
---
Can’t speak for anyone else, but I’m not a fan of PVP in most games. I’ll get a game specifically for that, team deathmatch, battle royal, etc. I play Fallout to take my time and enjoy myself. When competition in PVP comes into it, I can’t play the way I want to. I have to play a meta to stay competitive, and that’s not fun for me.
---
That being said, once I feel that I hit a wall in the game I may make a Survival only alt. “May” being the operative word.
---
Posting to increase visibility.  If your situation is true they should fix it fast and make you somehow whole.
---
It's here to stay and the next big dlc is going to be PvP focused. I paid for the game just like you did and I have the right to complain about a bug affecting PvP even if you're too reliant on a broken weapon to kill a bunch of ghouls.
---
Yes max adrenaline is a must have for most builds.
---
That’s a bummer. I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down at a table for the first time and had a waiter come over with a trade window. I thought it was a really nice touch. 
---
This is why we can’t have nice things
---
All world loot boxes refresh like every 20 hours
---
If you don't care. Then your opinion is invalid.
---
Nerf these weapons and what else will noobs in PvP have to bitch about dying to? Literally every other BE weapon that kills just as fast.
---
Source: I own a BE laser, BE handmade, BE combat rifle, BE gauss rifle... All of them capable of one or two shotting you in PvP.
---
The lasers aren't the issue, it's noobs thinking they know what they're complaining about.
---
Just sell ammo and good legendaries.
---
Radium can really mess up bloody builds.  It’s much rarer though from what I’ve seen in game and mods are harder to com by.

---
Nope you would be been one shot by the 110. Get your ego the fuck out if here, you're probably terrible at this game, acting like your some merciful angel of death lmao kid.
---
Ok literally everyone said starched genes, which is great and gets the job done but also not useful to you if you’re level 10. 
---
I’ve been maintaining 3 mutations without starched genes. Brahmin milk will help with rads a little bit, but it’s kinda unreliable to get it and it clears like 25 rads a pop. It’s good if you have it. 
---
Diluted rad x and diluted rad away also don’t always remove mutations, but there’s a 1/3 chance to remove them in my experience, possibly as high as 1/2 chance of removing. Diluted rad away is your best shot at keeping a mutation while also removing rads that i have seen. 
---
Nuka grape can do it too, if you can get to the white springs resort and afford it and it’s in stock. Like Brahmin milk, it’s all about whether it is available. 
---
Decon arches remove all mutations. 
---
At level 45 you can get sun kissed. “Slowly heals rad damage” really means even with 1 point all your rads are gone within 3 minutes of playing during day time. I let my rads build up at night and then let sun kissed take it away during day light. I haven’t used starched genes or any kind of rad away or decon arch in a long time. 
---
But mutations are tough to manage early game. You can only get them at that point by random chance when you take rad damage, and what mutation you get is also random. Your only real options at removing rads will also remove the mutation. 
---
Later you can buy/make serums that let you choose your mutation and you can pop perk cards that help you keep them and/or suppress the negative affects.
---
 Us: "It can't get worse right?" 
---
Bethesda : "Hold my atom points."
---
Really? Then that rules out lag as the issue.
---
Ive been told tse's no longer drop and are therefore legacy.  Guess that theory is a bust.
---
Palace for all flux
---
No, that's just more luck shit.
---
I.... never tried that.
---
Wow first I didn't know Rad-X suppressed mutations and now this.
---
Oh really? And are those on like a global reset timer or is 24 hours since the last time you did one?
---
You're full of it aren't you? You know very well the weapon doesn't function like every other BE weapon. No other BE weapon kills with splash damage if you have dense and fireproof. This particular weapon melts through Assassin's sentinel like butter with a shot or two max. Hell one beam out of the scatter is enough to melt you on contact from any distance. You don't call people noobs while you're defending a literally bugged weapon. Bet you'd have no place on the leaderboard without it.
---
I am gay. 
---
Living a lifetime as a gay man has taught me that when a person publicly and openly states "*I'm not gay*" or "*I'm just not gay*", it further emboldens the close-minded societal belief that there is a need to defend one self against the public perception, or belief, that he/she is gay. The author is attempting to avoid whatever negative assumptions they believe the receiver of said message might have if he/she actually was gay. Your need to state (and defend stating) "*I'm just not gay*" (twice in fact) only further reinforces the harmful perception/belief that such a statement is even necessary.
---
You're doing more harm than good.
---
I don't have the posts to reference. But i vaguely remember it also mentioning new Power Armor types. With different versions like mark1, mark2, mark 3 etc.... i knew i should have saved it...
---
Anyway, my point is maybe it's not just leftovers from fallout4 and hopefully actually new content to be added at a later date. One can i dream i guess lol
---
It does suck that it’s remove all or remove none. I’m not looking forward to the day I randomly gain another mutation I don’t want.
---
Wait seriously. I didn't even know that was a thing.
---
Its a literal perk under luck. So it is based on LUCK. Some days you'll have to repair 7 times, some days not at all.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Relax man. The point of this was to poke fun and say low levels can be annoying. I don't have an ego. You simply weren't there so it doesn't matter. Don't get so upset about what I've said.   
---
I'm not good at this but as a level 171 with explosive weapons and someone to watch my back yes I could have killed them. It was a joke saying I let them live as the point was to seem like an 'angel of death'. Not serious at all I just resisted to shoot back.
---
If so my first time logging in tonight on my new character I have the tourist at the water park if you’re online
---
Thank you ,..I assure you,I have better things to do with my time , I was hopeful it was a visual bug , but the shots aren’t exploding , looks like I need to get trading to afford a replacement,... it sucks cuz I’m a shotgun collector ,... so I’m pretty demoralized at the moment
---
AAE is better in PvP greatly and slightly better in PvE.
---
It’s because of Magnificent Bastards like you that I can’t go shopping without Power Armour.
---
Out of curiosity, have you ever managed to fling a character into one of the Whitespring robots?
---
That worked!
---
Thanks
---
Lots of robot skulls with only a legendary +bash damage effect out there these days. You should keep one in case it becomes a meme weapon like the ghoul slayer's gamma gun
---
Yeah, I see certain digital platforms (such as the PlayStation Store) still sell it for full price. I got a "Used-Very Good" copy from Amazon, and it was super cheap.
---
No.....
---
Have you submitted a ticket yet?

Any rifle with the less vats cost, 50 crit damage for pve i just use one bloodied handmade and an instigating hunting and 1 shot everything in stealth except scorch beasts
---
I like how no one is reading this at all. The perk is proccing. I am getting the pop up and sound effect. But it is repairing nothing. That's why I'm asking if anyone else is having the same problem.
---
No. Stop making this same post and research the damn game and other posts like this.
---
Buttery in a good way. FO4 is super stiff but your character kinda slides in movement. In this game it's much more fluid but you don't have that movement slide. 
---
As soon as you play you'll understand. I really miss the peak out of cover it would rule but the enemies are not smart in the game unfortunately it's not needed as much. Why it was removed I have no clue.
---
Always wondered about that. I'm a long time player but I always took SG off when using a serum just in case.
---
Been an issue since the legendary vendor came in to the game,
---
But don't worry, I am sure Bethesda will eventually get around to fixing the problem, as soon as they first confront other more pressing issues,,, like the bug that allowed players to receive free topiaries from the Atom Shop.
---
That one was cleaned up right quick, but the bug that downgrades certain legendary items?? That one has persisted now for nearly 3 weeks... all while support has repeatedly stated that there is no assistance or compensation for players losing out due to the very same bug.
---
I heard just having the gun out triggers the 10%.
---
😂😂😂😅😂😅😂😅
---
Confused on the downvotes. Saying former BattleCry is incompetent despite the fact that they were tasked with this game specifically because of the people there's history with multiplayer is disrespectful to the devs. they're around 60-100 people.
---
Thats very strange... well, the bug is a strange one too (I still refuse to understand how the heck game language can be connected to graphics) contact tech support and link them this thread, I think it will be helpfull, I gathered information about this bug for a long time and all I discovered is posted here.
---
Clever girl...
---
I have , yes . Not getting my hopes up,. I’m pretty sure they don’t have the administrators tools to create a replacement item,..Just gotta roll with the punches today I guess,.. time for a beer
---
Queen drops.    Or trading subReddits.   Once you read the plan you can make the mod and ammo.
---
Oh yeah lets just make the fucking game Skyrim and add more radiant quests, but don't worry, you retextured a fucking crafting bench.
---
Check your tone. After the nerf to assassin sentinel, anything cuts through like butter. And the beam splitter causes more explosions. I cannot see any way to change it that won't fuck over non-legacy energy weapons. So lets just keep our opinions to ourselves why don't we? 
---
Especially when you are in fact the one who is "full of it."
---
They better give you a bunch of Atoms at least.
---
I have been server hopping this location for a while now and have had no luck.  The spawn point is the cliff that roughly resembles a triangle, correct?
---
Congrats! Launching a nuke was one of my favorite experiences in the game.  Attempting to launch the nuke is why i quit FO76 initially. On Ps4 the game would inevitably crash at some point making your way through ALPHA.  Made 3 attempts, the further I got before crashing was the very end when the bots need defending. I didnt realize how close I was.  Put the game down for several months. I came back specifically to launch a nuke - that bug was fixed like a week after my 3 crashes I guess. Probably the most satisfying experience in my gaming life considering the issues I'd had previously.
---
/u/LadyDevann Might be worth passing this along
---
I built this for someone so I’ve barley seen anyone get thrown off of it, but he told me someone hit the train station. On all his other characters he is a very great trader :)
---
How did you get so close?!
---
I bought the skin and only got the red one. Smh
---
If the guy had pacifist on it wouldn't have triggered pvp and the shotgun blast he got in return would have dealt no damage and only engaged pvp (where he'd be open to full damage then with return fire), right? At least... that's my current understanding of adventure mode rules.
---
Ummm.... because it’s a perfectly preserved pie.... duh!
---
Someone above mentioned that some players have found an exploit to build their CAMP below the surface of map .... having fallen through the map a number of times myself, I think this is likely.
---
Sent a friedn request, IGN MrBright01, hopefully I'll catch you in the near future. Regardless if I do or not, thanks for letting me know.
---
You got my upvote.
---
I noticed a bug where i had w badges one day. Showed zero the next.  Went to the vending machine and it updated to show i had 4.  Might be a visual glitch. Check at the possum machine.
---
Does the 25% not count towards a faster reload? Not exactly great but why not if its the only one you got? Lol
---
Might be worth a go if you decide to try again, probably a much larger pool of players anyhow. Good luck!
---
Shoot heavy energy weapons that don’t benefit from armor penetration
---
Dupers used to have 60 million pounds of carry weight and the servers were just as crappy. Dont let bethesda fool you into thinking dupers ruined their crappy servers.  They could do a 2k stash no problem.
---
Is that the one with the green hood and squarer look to it? If so, I see them for sale all the time at Sutton station.
---
They did say before launch that some of the mutations would cause cosmetic differences. But I don't think it was ever implemented. 
---
It's something I'd also like to see.
---
U’re literally out of the meta ...
---
Whoa. I bought the flamer skin and was planning to apply it to my BE flamer. I don't think I will be doing that any more, thanks for the heads up.
---
Yeah I had a day where it gave me 5 guns in a row with mutant slayers prefix and +33 vats accuracy. Last roll after I was about to give up turned out to be an AAE Western Revolver. I was carrying a mutant slayers explosive gatling and an AA +33vats .50MG.
---
Yeah, but honestly, without a constant sticky, an ongoing contest cannot garner much interest. We had a sticky at the other sub, but they can only have 2 at a time, and they needed to announce something else, so ours got taken down for week, and that was the death of the whole contest. 
---
I had a pretty cool thing planned out. King and King of the Wastes and all that.
---
Wow thanks captain obvious, I still do good damage to NPCs but half the time my damage doesnt even register
---
Don’t restart.   The first 20 levels are a grind.
---
This is a post on a public forum I'm not obligated to keep my opinion to myself especially regarding a bug that affects gameplay. 
---
Firing a QE harpoon Flechettes which does around 900 damage near point blank at sentinels Assassin's doesn't kill in one shot or even three shots because dense and fireproof ignore most of the explosive damage and the armour the rest of the damage (through the protective effect or dr) but the BE laser seems to work completely different in an obviously unintended way that makes its beams melt anyone from any distance with minimum effort aiming. If it worked like every other BE weapon you wouldn't see it as often in PvP. No need for Bethesda to remove the effect just make it work like on every weapon. 
---
 Good luck getting used to aiming again after your unicorn weapon gets fixed
---
Didn't realize that until now. Thanks for enlightening me. If that's the case then Bethesda needs to bump it up now. Do you feel the stash increase is a good move or a bad move? Also is it too high for an increase?
---
i can sell you some diffusers 50 caps each
---
Dont worry too much about picking a wrong perk or placing a point wrong either.  It wont impact you that much and it's easy enough to fix a spec past 50.  I'm willing to bet there are hardly any characters past 100 with exactly the same specials as they had at 50.
---
That’s kinda what I was thinking. I just have such poorly chosen perks... and I don’t remember like 90% of how to do things...
---
You know collect 7600 wood means do the collect action 7600 times, not actually collect 7600 pieces of wood? I've only collected 1300 and I always collect when I see a lot or wood pile.
---
I kept server hopping and running a circuit in Cranberry Bog. Found Mothman four times and the Flatwoods Monster twice, among a few other cryptid spawns and way too many scorchbeast spawns. Lol
---
No bag here
---
Get any good trapper armor, and you can wear carry capacity backpack without any isue.
---
I'm still waiting on playing as a ghoul
---
Did you see the Capitol in PLAN, God people are slow learners these days huh?
---
You've only seen the tip of the iceburg. The render distance for shadows is scary short, textures actually move as you jump.
---
For calling someone a slow learner, you aren't even on a marketplace sub. Lol!
---
I don't have faith in the team to make a game like that and I especially don't have faith in the community to recognize it.
---
You want legitimate PVP at workshops? Great. Give us some working turrets and traps. Being able to contest the workshop from anywhere was a great change. Now spawn a Defend _**event**_ that gives rewards to the people that win. Now we have a game.
---
Do the same thing for CAMPs. Add a respawn timer and build the penalty. Scrap the stupid penalty that makes no difference when I can one-shot _even under penalty_ and/or cripple/burn/bleed/grenade/irradiate. Now we have a game.
---
Make the WANTED amounts scale. A level 10 can be 5 caps, but about the time you're 375 you !@#$ know you destroyed someone's crops and picked their door lock. Now we have a game.
---
And ffs do something with the workshops to make them desirable again. Defending them for 3 pieces of nuclear waste per hour is stupid.
---
That's ok you still can't read correctly
---
ugh, and getting rare flamers is hard already, I'd be devastated if I had a good flamer become trash from applying a skin.
---
Lol.
---
Trading is no longer allowed in this sub, so I guess you have your answer
---
i NEVER buy paints with atoms anymore.the way some are  advertised make it look like its a skin for any armor i so i bought one not knowing.another time i went to view what armor the paint was for remembering that i have to do that. i click ciew and nothing comes up i do another press and it forces me to buy the crap skin.
---
This is why you need a trap base.
---
Or an icon in the corner of your screen when someone is using a vending machine. I almost logged off once and I made a decent sale right before I did. Usually I check, but I was in a hurry that time.
---
Hopefully I'll come across you on PC! I'd love to give it a try. 😊
---
Yeah, movement and gun play on 4, though greatly improved over 3 and NV, still left a lot to be desired. Luckily though, once I got the handmade rifle, I finally found a gun that felt good in fully auto. 
---
Are the AI even more janky than they were in 4?
---
I've been tracking this, which paint was it?   
---
Want to check the game files and see if they borked up the AP usage
---
Rad shield doesn’t suppress mutations it’s just harder to get.
---
😂😂😂 I died today to Mothman for this exact reason. Stupid camera challenges. 😂😂😂😂
---
On another note, I've had two scorchbeasts land right in front of me in the past week and stare me down. If I didn't have stealth, I'm sure I'd be very, very dead.
---
you can respec as you go. but hit lvl 50 first. even a lvl 50 doest really have all the perks they want, as you get a bunch of useless ones early on or choose some for QoL early. Did you get any PA back in dec already?
---
Are you sure gatling plasma works? I just built one and have killed over 20 enemies so far with no nuclear material :/
---
Had a guy lock his door with the machines on a higher level. Good thing I had marsupial. Otherwise, I’d have to use the jet pack.
---
Or you could just manage your inventory like the rest of us.
---
It is the Repsonders skin for Pump action shotguns , currently in the shop
---
Sounds like "normal" Anxiety/Depression. I don't know the details on the internet/gaming sociability, I just know they don't generally leave their homes, avoid most social interaction, don't work and are usually still with their parents...
---
Use a gatling laser out of power armor! If Armor Ignore doesnt work for energy weapons, the stabilized is a moot point. :D
---
I’m free
---
Add me on PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Normally I would say start over, but you might have some rare stuff on that character since you started at beta.  I'd at least check that out, then start over for the story since it's been so long.
---
Yes! This sounds good also and it  wouldn't inconvenience someone that wouldn't really care and would dislike the additional pop-up, especially if they're server hopping to farm something. Though some may be forgetful in checking for that icon as well.  I would like to add if there was going to be a pop-up notice like I suggested maybe have an option to opt out of that notice in settings somewhere.
---
Yeah, when i first started playing my medic and took that perk i didn't realize i had to hit a button to search for extra drugs for quite awhile. Oops 😂😂
---
Cavalier/sentinel gives 15% dmg reduction for each piece, so total 75% reduced damage before it even considers the DR of the player. And they can stack it with Assassins armor which is 8% per piece.. 
---
What you are seeing is the lag between what your console perceives is your damage output and the amount of damage your'e actually doing.
---
Your console thinks thinks you did 500dmg, so you see health drop. But once info is processed server side and takes into account the 75% dmg, it turns out you only did 10dmg. So the health bar corrected and gives illusion that they are healing. 
---
They recently made a change to make it so it only reduces 75% dmg, 75% of the time instead of the 100% prior. So you have a better chance now, but still pretty good armor.
---
It worked for me and my friends we do this when we farm nuclear material so It should work
---
Bethesda tell us it is a work in progress, well they landed a man on the moon in less time it takes to get a poxy canvas bag, let's not rush these things eh! Bethesda
---
As a fellow collector you have my utmost sympathies bro. Hope they get it fixed for you.
---
Well, now I feel a total idiot -- it turns out that I've already scripped the nocturnal armor arm I had -- I had another 3 star arm piece and must of decided not to bother with the nocturnal.
---
One glass too many of Cuban rum I fear.
---
If I ever get a nocturnal armor piece I will make a better effort to note its effects.
---
Sorry for wasting your time.
---
man here im think im a bad ass at build camps. nope im not im a noob at building camps. amazing work
---
Which 3 do run with? I currently have Marsupial and Electrically Charged. The latter one is ok, I suppose, but I really want to run Healing Factor, but I’ve read that it’s bugged?
---
i would love to finished that damn quest about killing the golfer ghouls and then to top it off 18 holes sounds like a hell off a time.
---
yeah both pieces for 10k is a steal. theyre worth a lot more than that. there are zero posts on reddit about how people have been grinding for months and still cant get 10k.
---
You’ll soon have bigger problems like making tons of food/chems/ammo and not having the right cards on to maximize their yields.
---
I miss the "feed the people" serve wide reward
---
Wish you could vendor everything, especially those old world stacks of cash. Being able to salvage ammunition and use it to make other ammunition would go a long way as well.
---
Do you still have it? And if so, what are you looking to trade for it?
---
"If" they add NPC's I hope, but at this point, i'm doing my best to quell any hope I have.
---
Ok just peaked, it is configured properly (ap_material).  
---
I've been seeing an increasing number of reports of items (besides the Salvaged Assaultron Head) loosing stars, or "morphing" after you modify them.   
---
I had a weightless/luck/sentinel Raider arm that turned into weightless/CHA/sentinel after server hoping for example.  
---
   
---
Did you put any other mods on the gun when you put the AtomStore paint on it?
---
Also if achievements are important, you may want to start over. You won’t get any achievements from early level beta otherwise.
---
Yes but I've had it where I hit people and the damage I do just doesnt register at all, their health drops, but returns to full
---
&gt; Read the words as they were literally put down and in context.
---
Yes, I misread your comment, sorry.
---
Now do wing zero.
---
no transgerder deathclaws 
---
no to playing as ghouls
---
no to playing as a raiders
---
but I would take a presets for the perk cards or make passive perk cards actually passive ( no need to equip them to have them active)
---
Uranium fever pick up the weapon drops from all the mole miners that should get you a good chunk there’s also some cement bags and that comes up in building
---
I did not do any other mods , just the skin followed by logging out, no crash or anything crazy
---
I do, specifically the Missile Launcher, which kind of annoys me, because an over the shoulder rocket launcher is specifically a recoil free weapon so that a regular soldier can fire it. If you're perked out for the missile launcher you might as well bring the auto grenade launcher as well, because oh well, it's just that good.
---
Pick up stuff to salvage. It shows what the items breaks down to.\
---
 Tree branches give wood as well.
---
i would as well as soon the show more love to other PA or skins for gear,
---
i get that the excavator PA more than llikely is the most use but damn enough with the excavator skins show some love to other PA/ gear.
---
Thanks, trying to find a common thread..  
---
I modded the Armor, adding the material and lining upgrades, and that (Modding) seems to be the only related bit
---
This is an actual bug, don't try scapegoating Bethesda for your own inability to actually read before you purchase something.  There's no fucking way for them to "make it look" like a skin applies to an armor or weapon it doesn't, the ONLY pictures they display are for the specific skinned weapon/armor and the description specifically states what the skin applies to.
---
Literally pick up every log you see until you get the perk card “woodchucker”
---
Farm Flatwoods and do the event at the Ag center for robot metal. 
---
Head north to WV Lumber for low lvl super mutants you can farm. 
---
Plastic is everywhere but Morgantown HS has a lot!
---
Find weapons from enemies, make sure Scrapper perk card is equipped. I would do low level areas for steel and wood. Plastic you want Super Mutants for their laser rifles.  With scrapper you get 10 plastic each i think.
---
i never blamed bethesda chill! read the way i worded it
---
It's managed as best as I can make it.
---
Scrap of every kind is below 100 each. It's the weapons and armor that I'm selling that takes up space.
---
How do you get the daily mission back?
---
How the game is now is what it should've been at release. the acceptance of triple A games that are released early and then worked on later has become ridiculous. Ship the game when it is ready and stop defending this poor practice people. You do a disservice to all gamers when you give it a pass.
---
Metal &amp; Wood:   Run through top of the World area and gather up all of the wood skis and all of the guns dropped by enemies.  Use the scrapper perk.  
---
You can also use the woodchuckers perk and start farming the woods on the other side of the road from the station
---
Concrete:   There are a bunch of cement bags on top of the really tall bridge near Flatwoods.  It’s in the back of a truck near the radioactive barrels.  Also, garden gnomes...
---
That’d require either a) reworking all armors to fit this new skeleton (power armor included) or b) you can’t use leg armor or power armor.
---
There's even a statue playing as the pilot
---
pics pls
---
Oh god, can you imagine actual white power armor -- permanent -10 INT and CHA.
---
I agree,
---
the vendor bug, happens to me what I pick anything up from my stash using the vendor machine menu. I have to pick it up dirrectly from my stash before I mark it for sale, if I pick it up directly from the vendor machine menu after I mark it for sale I have to exit the menu for it to work again. its freaking annoying. 
---
i also thing they should add a few more taps on the pipboy (specially on the aid section)
---
Today's census was really bad. I did it and all I had were Lvl 91 Glowing Deathclaws.
---
It depends on your luck for drops, charisma for events.
---
"First half."
---
Patch 1.12 is literally the last patch of vanilla WoW.
---
Sure the person didn't like the whole of vanilla wow, but you can't claim the last available patch was anywhere close to within the 'First Half'
---
chill out dude im not blaming bethesda?? i was new to the game at the time
---
use scraper and scrap weapons,  all the steel and wood you will ever need, for wood you can also equip the wood perk and run around the forest, plastic hit the watoga/morgantown high schools and there you should get all the plastic you need.
---
Yeah, I wish that Stabilized didn't required power armor to work, it's the only weapon category(Heavy weapons) that forces you into a specific armor type to get the most benefits, not counting unarmed ofc.
---
Tank Killer, Crack Shot, Ground Pounder, Skeet Shooter,etc none of them force you into a specific armor type. Even other Heavy Weapon perks like Bear Arms, Bullet Shield, Lock and Load, One Gun Army don't force you to use Power Armor.
---
Adventure mode it does as long as you don’t take a workshop and leave pacifist mode on. 
---
Problem comes daily with people trying to slap others to instigate a conflict. Saw it just about an hour ago when this lvl 220+ was farming White Springs... after killing most the ghouls he started hitting others, players just ignored him as he taunted them over area mic. 
---
Many lay low and try to farm caps at workshops. They don’t want the workshop, they want PvP and 90%+ of the time leave after getting the caps. 
---
If PvPers thought survival was so great, they’d stay there but they don’t. 
---
Early on there was numerous posts about people getting destroyed and losing a ton of caps and aid items... many I bet are still ticked about that. 
---
If Bethesda said players would have to start new characters in survival it would be totally different but instead you have high levels killing way lower levels just to... so really no sense in going there if you’re newer or don’t want to lose anything until you get way better!
---
Mostly mods...there around and sometimes at vendors.
---
That's it? 10 and 10? I have close to 100 total and still have space for more not to mention the plans and junk and aid I have. Do you only keep fully modded heavy weapons? I don't understand how people have such a hard time with inventory.
---
Wow. This got some traction.
---
PC
---
You can certainly prevent these deaths by using the appropriate perks.
---
Also run around in the ash heap and kill mole miner's
---
I vote for a restart
---
Don't delete your other toon, it has resources you'll remember and need. But for the most part you'll enjoy re-exploring the world while it slowly rids that tainted memory/you relearn what your place in the wasteland is
---
Another poster mentioned near the oil seep by the ammo workshop which is where I’ve seen the FM as well. I plan to retest this at some point too.
---
Sounds like you’re just insecure about yourself
---
I’m looking for the enclave scout gas mask.  Had one and lost it somehow.   Been sever hopping but it never shows up in the Enclave vendor for me.  Must have hit 15 different servers tonight.
---
Does removing the skin revert the 3rd star?
---
Thank God someone agrees with me on this, the fucking shilling of bad practices has got to stop.
---
500 caps my friend
---
I used to have this problem until I did the following: 
---
NEVER store/sell chems, just run the reduced chem weight perk (clears a few hundred pounds for me)
---
Scrap the crap (all campaign legendaries, 1 and 2 \* unless semi god roll 2\*) 
---
Batteries Included 3\*(I walk around with 100+ fusion cores and I'm barely over 300lbs)
---
If you can't do that, you're probably screwed and just need to stop being a hoarder.
---
I want to be able to scrap ammo for lead.
---
Check Grafton Station
---
It's a non perishable food item and it is relatively rare to get one from a machine. I have 20 on me and give them as gifts to people who buy from my vending machines. Or I leave a couple on top of other players machines when they have one and are asking 25000 caps for it.
---
It still works, I've definitely found a few critters via the encounter map, they're just rare rng, same as pretty much everything in this game
---
I am ran into a mythical flat woods monster behind a small shack a bit south of white springs golf course. He was a blue. Took him down and got the pic.  I’ve seen a purple o e here too a while back.
---
Nope I tried , reverting back to tactical skin ( which it had prior ) then to no skin , the item is altered,. Relogged multiple times ,.. tried all the usual fixes before posting this the second gun was to test my morbid curiosity on how the heck this had happened , the BE has been my trusty sidearm since February I am quite familiar with the perks it had
---
Luckily I have an Explosive LMG, which does more than enough damage per shot without PA that I can run around with normal armour on instead. It also has the right "look" for it.
---
😅 oh yeah I forgotten that I have a collection of bobbleheads and magazines, high radiation fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass.
---
I even bulk up my scrap as much as possible and sell excess scrap when I can.
---
I have the modded weapons on me. I have bear arms where it reduces the weight by 90%
---
TBH I'm managing my stash better than when I first started.
---
Btw is your stash nothing but gear. If so then that means the junk items take a good portion of space for me even when it's 100 items of each scrap.
---
This was after white springs was nuked
---
would be nice if it working in marine armour, it kinda looks like it should with those stabilasors on the legs.
---
Tamed 3 this week....
---
Toad 
---
Snaglly
---
And snaggly
---
Whisperer and Friend perks maxed
---
All only single monsters alone, random spawn.
---
Option to tame pops up after pacify
---
I think the camp requirements is gone.
---
Thats it....still works. Unhave to server hope a but to get the correct spawn.
---
Occasionally (maybe 1 in 20) a normal scorchbeast will drop a prime receiver plan, but mostly you farm queens, which drop one every time. They won't duplicate one you've learnt, so eventually you get them all.
---
Yup, if you walked into the dining portion, the handy/nannies tell you to take a seat, and if you did, one would come up and sell food via vendor window.  
---
It's currently broken though, same dupe "fix" that disabled 2/3 of the enclave bunker vendors/set them to perma busy.
---
No it doesn't. Theres a faster reload legendary effect as well though
---
Actually it was within the first hour of playing the B.E.T.A. I got all of them except carnivore... You can't have carnivore and herbivore at the same time because the game won't let you and you will die of starvation. So I settled on herbivore because plant life is everywhere and eventually getting the green thumb perk I would never go hungry. 
---
Before I played for the first time I was really interested in the mutations so I thought hell get them all. But how I did it might of been a exploit that might of been patched already but even if it wasn't I'm not to keen on talking about it in a public forum... I wasn't aware that you could get a permanent ban for such things when I did... So I've decided to take it to my grave.
---
Vampires flamer 33%VATS hit chance plus one perception and vampire effect want it?
---
This is the kind of pic worth dying for
---
Here is one of the most mind-blowing tips I've learned that I'm pretty sure wasn't mentioned yet - when leveling up you can pick a stat point and a card from different specials. So you don't have to pick an intelligence card in order to gain the intelligence stat.
---
[Here is how if you are interested (not my vid)](https://youtu.be/8dLvjsj8hYM?t=121)
---
Last SBQ gave me 2 mussels and 6 harpoons. The event is bugged as shit and still after months isn’t fixed
---
Welcome to 76 end game, where it's nothing but farming and idle busy work. I just farm the daily/weekly atom, and am slowly doing the possum badges, so might just start with that. It probably will get stale but that's just how it ended up.
---
This is pretty much me. My strength cards are made for carrying all my meds, heavy weapons, bandolier and I have strong back. They are all maxed out. Intelligence has batteries included for me. I use radicool at times for strength to carry items.
---
Like I said to another user, I'm doing better at managing my items since the 400 stash limit.
---
You get an upvote and you get an upvote and you get an upvote! Everybody gets an upvote!
---
Why? Just... Why? You know there are perks for that stuff right? Is anyone really that hard up for wood, leather or plants? 
---
Just use Butcher and Green Thumb like the rest of us if you need extra trash or meat. 
---
If anything, this request will prompt the dev team to roll out new useless legendary effects. Worst idea ever.
---
How about a nice game of chess??? 🤠
---
Thanks guys for the help I'm kinda new and trying to base build and craft some stuff
---
That sounds like a good time
---
Actually i think they would make more money on this idea because more people would buy atoms because nobody would trade there legendaries with scrip or caps anymore
---
You'd start to look like four-arms from ben 10!

I thought it was confirmed that drops on servers are ‘Seeded’. Some servers draw from a pool that doesn’t even have two shot or explosive in the table and if it does it has a lower chance. Others have it super common and you can pull more than you can handle, there have been reports of people getting chains of good legendary modifiers in s row while on a specific server. 
---
I personally don’t turn in scrip until I see a good legendary affix drop for me and then I beeline to the purveyor.
---
Here kitty kitty......     🤠
---
I keep about 200lbs of junk for repairs and modding in my stash. But I don't keep mags and bobbles that I won't use. And no ammo in the stash it takes up space for no reason. Same with chems and aid.
---
I named my ts 50 *Ma Duece*
---
Scrip yes. Atoms no. I really think ppl wouldnt even accept scrip or caps for legendaries anymore.
---
You could’ve just edited and stored the door?
---
When you post matters a lot in terms of traction. If this was posted during US morning, this probably would have blown up.
---
May still do. Just things are much slower. I'm surprised it's gotten as many upvotes as it has already.
---
I have one I’d sell.  On XB1.
---
Quarry x3 by north of watoga beside the main building in between the big pump.
---
Visual effect on crit: enemies turn to trees
---
Thanks, when I get back on I'll go grab it!
---
Better late than never I suppose.
---
Also:
---
* Scrap all junk before putting it into your stash to save space. 
---
* For perk cards like Pharma Farma, they're not passive effects. You need to activate relevant containers for them to potentially work.
---
Much more risk/reward. Be prepared to repeatedly die whenever fast traveling (you can only go to train stations, your camp or team camp, and 76). Be prepared to encounter players that are seemingly totally invincible, invisible and kill you instantly. Most of the playerbase isn't like that but almost every server Ive been on has 1 or 2 of those guys
---
Wait till you find the lone survivor super mutant after his buddies met BAA BAA
---
Np !
---
Rad shield is just about perfect...no adverse effect upon mutations, you can use it at will 😁👍
---
I always scrap unless there's a bit of junk I want to keep in the mix for our item shelves/decorating down the road like untarnished, clean, etc items
---
Everyone is insecure about themselves... some more than others. I am self-aware. As a gay man, I have a personal understanding of the unintended harm statements like these can have.
---
Unless I am hitting on you at a bar, or at a club, or on the street, etc., the primary reason for anyone to proclaim "*I am just not gay*" is to alleviate their own anxiety that a person (or persons) reading this might believe the author of such a statement might be gay (doing it multiple times further reinforces the likelihood of an inner anxiety that person is experiencing). A person comfortable with their own sexuality and/or unconcerned with what others think, or believe, about themselves will not feel the need to make such a statement, whether out of fear and/or anxiety. The conscious or unconscious belief that such a proclamation even needs to be made further reinforces the widely held negative perception that a person needs to assure the world that he/she isn't gay. It does more harm than good.
---
&gt; The Jerk called me a salty fucking asshole and fast traveled away after punching me for 10-15 seconds with no effect. 
---
To be fair, he's right. You're salty af. Don't blame you for being an arsehole back to them though.
---
Excavator armor gives you 4x the ore from veins. The breach and clear event is a good source of ore too.
---
I don't use vats what so ever and at the moment I have an OK flame, but thank you anyways!
---
Hunting wasn't very bad.
---
Handmade imo. If you wanna piss off a low health build use a gamma gun instead
---
It just gives max level gear regardless of what level you are
---
We might get lucky and they'll release the fish-mailbox
---
Can I suggest making an event focused on it? At random holes enemies decide to join the fun... By attempting to kill everyone playing golf (charred, ghouls, super mutants) or by stealing all the golf balls (malfunctioning Whitesprings bots, molerats, dogs).
---
More likely you're doing tiny amounts of damage through their Sentinel + Assassin + Dodgy + Lone Wanderer stack, meanwhile they're popping stimpaks and healing it right back up.
---
I’m also a newcomer (lvl 13). I’m really enjoying the game but struggling a bit with the best way to level and find stuff. I’m kinda putting off the main quest (currently at the one where I need to go to the top of the world) because I’ve read its best to wait until higher level so I get better rewards, so what in your opinion is the best way to level?  Side quests? Just randomly exploring and killing stuff? The whole game is fun to me so I’m just curious as to what my best course of action should be because the game isn’t super clear on WHAT im supposed to be doing.
---
That's what I thought, but when I put it on it only gave me one, might be a bug for that one time.
---
Fair enough. I am wondering though...
---
&gt;homoies
---
...is this a typo? or intentional?
---
Or they aren’t gay and want it to be clear. It harms them to be mislabeled or feel they give off the wrong image of themselves and potentially harm their social lives. Nobody wants to be called something are not. I’m dropping this because it’s not fallout related but I find it astonishing the people that call others hateful are so often the hateful ones
---
I've fast traveled to those camps before. Not an issue. But the one camp by whitesprings was on the map and not there at all. So idk.
---
It effects the base gun not any mods you put on said gun
---
Yes but, I've shot dudes standing still, afk and it does nothing
---
My friend made it to level 30 before realizing that there even were perk cards.
---
Marsupial is visual
---
The one that shocks the enemies when you get attacked also
---
Try checking your Pip-Boy there should be a blip if someone is in your camp.
---
But then if I have an unmodded Minigun it doesnt weight 2 pounds intead 20
---
I think they need to blur out the penis. /s
---
I'm all for that option if that's what you want to do but I don't think it should change appearance by default.
---
Maybe unlock appearance options which you can then change to or switch on/off? I'd be up for that option.
---
Tbh and I hate to say this but IMO fallout 4 had better AI.
---
Agreed. Mainly because I run a full set of mairne and am a heavy gunner haha.
---
But yeah. Hate that Stabilized is pa only. Would be nice if the armor penitration worked outside of  pa but the accuracy didn't, I can see why pa would effect accuracy
---
The responder bots sell them sometimes. I might have an extra one though, I’m on XB1
---
Oh that happen to me, Idk why when I put in my Excavator PA with Calibrated Shocks and +1STR I can carry even 552 pounds!!!
---
Salty tears are salty 
---
I don’t have.  I wanna. Gimme or else I tell
---
Lol. Bad is bad
---
I died but think of the number of likes I'll get on Instagram. So worth!
---
I like the electrical nipples.
---
&gt;Or they aren’t gay and want it to be clear. It harms them to be mislabeled or feel they give off the wrong image of themselves and potentially harm their social lives.
---
Why does this need to be clear? That you believe there is "harm" if someone else believes you are gay (or that being thought of as gay is "the wrong image") further reinforces your belief in the still widely held perception that even being thought of as possibly gay is "harmful".
---
I've used both and in my opinion Executioners is better. You attack and kill one target and then turn your attention to the other guys around it, some of whom are below 40% due to the arc damage. You then proceed to kill the rest of the group in one or two shots.  Also,  if you use the charging mod, you don't have to fully charge it if you aim at the floor instead. With furious I'm pretty sure you have to aim at a target.
---
I’m at 225.   I’ve used the extra points to fine tune my build a bit and had the redo a couple of my card stacks to lower levels.  Beyond that, it’s purely about picking up perk cards...
---
Upvote.  This is bs. Don't let them give you "we don't have the ability to gift weapons."  I'd also fight the charge via cc.  You didn't receive the product or quality of product/seevice you bought.   It would be like buying a bluray player, it playing, but afterwards eating your discs.
---
If they’re interested in someone that thinks they’re gay? If they have family members or colleagues that dislike gay people? People’s perceptions always come into play and people will always look to clarify something potentially negative. I’m sorry you’re insecure about your sexuality.
---
Did you not read my post?
---
I believe archery requires the crafting of a crossbow, right? And hunting the killing of an animal with a crossbow? I don't have any crafting perks :(
---
That would be great!
---
challenge accepted i gonna do an iron man now
---
just wonder if there are some yellow thing
---
I had a legendary lever rifle which never lost condition. This was not listed as a characteristic. After I applied a skin to it, this behaviour disappeared and the weapon began to lose condition in the normal manner. You'd think a cosmetic would be just that but apparently not. That said I would like to see more weapon cosmetics, though with a more neutral effect!
---
&gt;I’m sorry you’re insecure about your sexuality.
---
You're projecting...
---
It's most likely server sided corruption causing the issue as either the slots are being erased or overwritten somehow
---
I don't know why, but read the title as Modus :)
---
Mutatation... should alter a characters appearance... slightly...
---
I’m up for it, add me.
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Definitely
---
Help me 😂
---
I was eating my feelings, ok! Total atomic annihilation, hello!
---
Also, call me.
---
then you need to figure out what you want more profit or space. we all are in the same boat, and im doing fine. when im close to the 800 pounds limit I do a flash sale on my vending machines and so far it has worked like a charm. 
---
i think it would be good if player vendors could get thier own 150-200 pounds and leave the 800 for personal stash, that would free a lot off space.
---
I’ve got it in my vendor for 75 caps. Psn is same as here
---
That's it I Think
---
ok thanks for the info, i will keep looking.
---
Look at Camps!
---
\#2 orange case thing?
---
I have been checking but no luck so far, thanks anyways
---
Does the enemy type matter?
---
One possible cause is disease. I know Blight lowers all SPECIALs. Check the active effects section in the Pip-Boy. You may also have armor/underarmor that affects Strength you unequipped.
---
Mysterious Box, sorry.
---
It works for ghouls and super mutant ik know for sure
---
real wood harvesting animations too!
---
PC, but thanks anyway!
---
I use mine out of PA all the time,  though I don't use that perk card either.
---
I’ve been around since the beginning, and I’ve struggled with getting a handle on this one but I’d say it’s worth it. (The only reason I struggle is because I can’t play like most players, I have kids and i fall behind. )
---
Also, diluted Rad-X doesn't surpress mutations.
---
Might have drank alcohol and had +1 strength
---
I set up my camp in the Bog near TALA. I'm regretting it....but I just love TALA too much to move.
---
There's a wood factory with just ticks as enemies right under the vault. For steel whitesprings coat hangers are each one steel
---
Ah, I was doing that on deposits, do you know of any silver vein loactions?
---
I'm always too afraid to grind out more mutations for fear of getting one I hate, going to remove it and losing Talons instead. I run an unarmed build so that would be devastating.
---
I kinda skipped over that whole area until tonight, there sure are a lot of them. I thought they were only at Lucky Hole mine, Uranium Fever, and the Lode Baring events.
---
are you on xbox?
---
Ok, so it *was* broken.  I noticed they come up to serve you, but I never saw a trade menu.  Nice to know that actually did something at some point, so it probably will again.
---
let me try to convince you this way- I’m racing toward a Brahman for milk, you’re about to blow up a truck to kill this guy messing with you. I run by you but why do you care when you’re trying to kill that other guy. I’m an NPC. I simply existed for a moment and I could still be there, you can buy some milk from me. I’d serve the role as NPC for that fleeting moment.  it’s not to diminish the human behind the player, but at that point I only have a minuscule ability to influence your game’s outcome (ie. sell you some milk). or, you come to my vendor to see my wares and i stand there like a dum dum cuz in real life i’m smoking weed or some shit. again, i’m your NPC. lol sounds psychopathic as i type this but whatever, we can be something insignificant for one another in this game. i think it’s pretty cool and keeps this game super dynamic.
---
Oh, ok. I've walked West from there and don't see a FWM, but it's probably random.
---
"Asians".
---
It's over 9000
---
AHHHH...and this explains how we're back to one working vendor per area in the Enclave bunker.  This post was way more informative than I expected.
---
Completely because of the comments--thank you!
---
it’s random but not obscure. i see it about once a week.
---
I think of mine in terms of mobility. I use vault 76 to fast travel to for free and my camp. So i try to put it either in the middle or east side of the map so that fast traveling from side to side is greatly reduced.
---
Another brick in the wall...
---
Yep and molerat food also gives +1 strength
---
The plans are a random spawn, but there are only four of the random spawn locations on the map that spawn the "Civil War" outfits.  At least that I know of.  I HAVE COLLECTED THEM ALLLLLmwhahahaha!  But also, if you find me in game, I'm happy to show.  I pretty much tell everybody I see in game.
---
I feel personally attacked. I was the guy behind the play as fodder raiders post that I'm assuming you're talking about. I've made suggestions that would be very simple to implement that would make a big difference in gameplay with little effort/time investment. It's just that no one cared about those.  
---
Would I rather have dev time go to a double barrel reciever that fires both barrels at the same time, and a missile launcher reciever that deals half damage but can fire twice the missiles before it breaks requiring minutes worth of time to design since it's just numbers?, ***OR*** would I want them to add my crazy fodder idea? Honestly, the small weapon mod changes are the better value for time.  
---
As for bug fixes, I'm sure most of us would be happy to have an entire big update just be bug fixes, and simple qol. But Bethesda is as we speak developing what is plainly a shitty pvp arena/BR instead of doing that. I'd ***MUCH*** rather them waste dev time on jetpack PA clad megasloths that fly around dumping bags of jangles the moon monkeys on protectrons than whatever the fuck seems to be is in store for Vault 51.
---
What is that weapon it looks totally unfamiliar to me?
---
GO FOR THE KNEES!
---
Another place I have seen it three times and I think once was during the day but it remained in shaded areas:
---
From Morgantown Train Yard head SW on the map going toward the river, the junkyard and the route 64 sign. In the somewhat wooded area you’ll see a bit of soot flower but one big tree has rhododendron... right about there it seems to spawn.  If you get to the 64 and that little green area above the 64 then you’ve gone too far. 
---
I’m suspicious of the lone rhododendron being a placement cue left by a dev haha
---
Kill excavator Bois at workshop.  Never fails.  Got 700lbs of just about everything for about a 36 cap contest fee.
---
Im on xbox as well but I havent encountered these errors, lucky me I guess
---
I’ve experienced these as well
---
Can I ask why less for forest etc?
---
It’s not “levelled gear” issue as I’ve gotten a max Gauss from a forest drop before.
---
Me and the boys at 2am looking for BEANS
---
I do use a mule. The main reason is when you have been trading for a while your collection of weapons starts the grow and grow to a point where it gets out if hand. So the only solution (in my eyes) is to make a new character and give him all the items.
---
You can find a crossbow instead (there are a couple of world spawns, you can server hop them), or ask another player to make you one.
---
Codebreaker's probably the only tadpole challenge one with high-level perk requirements. Mammalogist is maybe the easiest one for the low-level character. Remember that you can take pictures of dead creatures and it works.
---
That's only for energy weapons
---
Math is hard apparently.
---
Nice trap
---
whaaaaaat??? there are blue ones? i have only seen pink/purple.
---
nukes turn them blue? or only the blues appear after a nuke???
---
Probably the path to enlightenment mission. A "wise" Mothman shows up and isn't hostile, nor does it run
---
Nah I did maybe it didn’t work for me but I thought I’d try getting a low lvl 3star, I turfed all my gear into my stash and still got lvl 50 pistol wasn’t a bad roll
---
Look, you're all over the place with your terminology and idea, so I doubt it.
---
From Wikipedia, "**Distributed computing** is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another."
---
You're saying to improve game performance, Bethesda should spend time and money creating a whole separate "database", by which I assume you mean storage server, exclusively for people to store unnecessary items? How is that better than dedicating more infrastructure to the existing system(s)?
---
And these items would all be unique in everything from attachments to prefixes, each one would have to be it's own entry. The thing that causes strain on these servers isn't the fact that they're being constantly accessed, it's that they have too much to access; too many unique entries. A character with 500 different legendaries will take longer to load than a character with (99999999) Ultracite scrap because the server has to load each item individually with all of its descriptors, whereas the scrap is just loaded once with its count. BGS themselves claimed that the weightless carry glitch/infinite stash glitches in the early days were the cause of slow loading times. The whole point of the weight limit in stash space is so that the server doesn't have too much to access, Todd Howard didn't get this either, and incorrectly told us that stash space would be infinite prior to launch.
---
By definition, there's no such thing as a "separate database that doesn't have to be queried." Literally the only way to access something stored separate from your machine would be querying or physically connecting to the storage media. For it to truly not "be queried" the "database columns and rows," as you've described, would have to exist physically on your machine, thereby available for alteration.
---
You're either basically asking for more dedicated cloud storage, like what all of our profile data is, but for items. Or you're asking that our items be not tied to our profiles, but to the game files. And you're describing it in ways that aren't even correct.
---
And SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**, so...
---
Don't listen to this guy, unless it's changed recently it's not easy at all to change your special. I'm only lvl 88 or so and I am still picking perk cards I want. I would definitely recommend having a build in mind around half to 50 and committing to it by lvl 30-40. I recommend at least enough perception and intelligence for hacking and Picking locks. Past that depends on the building. I personally did a general melee/buzzblade build so I mainly pick a ton of strength and agility plus some Chrisma to share perks( check out that one perk that increases your chrisma per squad member, can be used to charge higher perk cards.) Most importantly have fun!
---
Check out my comment in the thread in this post.
---
What paint you get is dependent on the receiver you put on it. I have a friend that tested this, so if you have certain mods it will only be red. Try changing some of the mods on it and you can see which ones make it blue.
---
Probably because it'd be too easy to exploit. Assuming each bullet = 1 cap, Ammo Smith plus Super Duper some 5mm and you'll hit 1200 bullets very quickly. Would much rather break down unwanted ammo instead
---
Thank you so much! Ill take a look at Mammalogist! Also ill take a look if i can find a crossbow. No idea those dropped!
---
Oh I do have the grounded mutation, maybe that's the issue.
---
I'll be on later on tonight. I'll open the locked door for you if you like
---
Wait what? You sure you're not talking about Fallout 4?
---
That's very true! I can only imagine what my collection will become, as I definitely experienced the 'out of hand' during my trading journey... and I just started. 😂
---
Personally, i have yet to test it all out. I'm still in the buying phase to get a good quantity before i set out to dig them all up.
---
From what I've heard though, it's different loot options. Yes it's all RNG, so even after digging up 100 i might not get anything good, but supposedly Mire and Bog have potential for Power Armor plans. Not sure what forest and the rest would drop.
---
Like you said it's bugged.
---
There is usually one in the Archery Range at the Pioneer Scout Camp.
---
I don't. In general I associate people with one with dupers. I mean our stash has Doubled since launch!
---
I believe it was explained that it's actually a visual glitch that shows how much of that item the buyer has in their inventory, not what they bought from you
---
I think I do main low. I do 25 down like in forest and heap I do 5 and for salvage divide I ether do 15 or down same with toxic valley and mire I also do 25 or 15 and for cranberry I do 25 or 15.
---
Just a reminder to all the people who say that 800 is fine and that you just have to learn to manage your inventory.
---
During the beta, it was stated that they aim for unlimited stash capacity.
---
The game is clearly not designed for a stash with not even 1000 lbs space.
---
The wording is strange. It’s a personal bounty, if you choose to retaliate- and win. No one else sees it.
---
I think the only way to actually get a bounty in Adventure mode now is lockpicking someone else’s stuff.
---
Great!! Ill take a look cheers!!
---
Are you on PC?
---
It was patched some time ago, at the beginning of the year. Ressource Spot respawn is now tied to your Charakter, sadly
---
Really thanks I appreciated it just message me when you get on
---
Nope, I don’t get the problem people have with the storage. I understand the desire for more storage space but the arguments don’t make sense to me, other than people hoarding a lot of stuff they don’t need. Or at least hoarding MORE than they need. You don’t need that 5000th roll of duct tape, leave it be.
---
I have plenty of materials for anything I need. If I go on heavy smelting binges I may get a touch low on acid. By the time I do it again though, I’m back up to a decent amount. But with all my materials, my hoarding of magazines and bobble heads, ammo for guns I don’t use, my inability to get rid of unique outfits and quest items I’ll never use(damn you mistress of mysteries), as well as weapons and armor for me to switch between, I hover around 650. It gets to about 800 by the time I log off, from casual scavenging and legendaries. Then when I sign back in and the vendors have caps again, I sell and turn the legendaries in. Back to 650-700. 
---
Vendors kinda messed it up a bit. I personally wish there was a limit to one shop that could hold 50 items, but I’m not complaining. People hold on to items for far too long now because they may eventually get a couple of caps. Sorry if a legendary doesn’t sell, after multiple price drops and play sessions, I’m exchanging it for script. 
---
One of my favorites is when people have 6-7 suits of power armor. I get having two, maybe three, but if you HAVE to have one (or even multiples) of every suit and it’s eating up 100 lbs.... No one to really blame but yourself.
---
That kills my desire for any weapon skins. That needs to be fixed ASAP.
---
Those are the power armor plans. OP is asking for the craftable non PA armor
---
No its not a visual bug
---
Those are PA plans
---
I don't really like thinking about nuclear bombs in real life. They freak me out in a similar way to oceans and deep space. With those it's the infinite nothingness, with nukes it's the sheer power and fact we could absolutely blow ourselves off the face of the planet if people in charge make the wrong call. I know there are failsafes and multiple people have to agree--it still feels like that list is too short and troubling. Fallout being rife with black comedy makes it easier to swallow to me, like Dr. Strangelove.
---
the worst part is, that bethesda doesnt refund items derstroyed by rhere bugs. in every other game you would get your guns replaced.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong - I FEEL like the storage system is broken (should have 4k space spread amongst 5 characters on 1 account, not 800 per each 5 characters [with a total possible 4k storage] on 1 account, there is literally no difference) 
---
Their is definitely a difference. Despite the combined 4k weight between 5 characters, only 1 character is used at a time. Therefore only 800lbs worth of items is being accessed/loaded at any given time. If it were combined, the system would now have to work 5x as hard to load your 4k stash worth of items on your single player.
---
I'm not saying this isn't doable, but without knowing how Bugthesda has setup there infrastructure, their is no way to tell if this will put a severe strain on the already weak infrastructure. Servers are laggy as it is....
---
I've gotten some incredible RNG on this account - no perfect pie from a vending machine, but 10/10 worthwhile Purveyor weapons today - not to mention the daily grind for them... I find it fun 🤷‍♂️ If it weren't for the Scout's I wouldn't have even done the main story after Rose - I lost interest. But what enticed me was having something super awesome, incredibly fun, or just so beyond terrible it's just one of those things you've gotta keep.
---
Don't get me wrong, there's dry spells, but that's usually when I have a buying spell 🤣
---
Stash has doubled since launch - totally proud of that - but how in the world am I supposed to find the single needle in, in a truck full of needles, that has what I am looking for... and expect to have what they're wanting, on 1,000 - 1,300 if you perk with bloodied on the right build - perk cards can easily drop the weight if I keep everything on me, but then I'm not built to play the game.
---
Just my 2 caps... but yes... my original general association was it was dupers. Can't lie about that.
---
Sorry for your loss brotha! Shotguns getting no love at all lately, I really thought it couldn't get worse..
---
sh&amp;t  F\*ck Sh\*t F\*ck , that is not my gun ...run
---
I usually get one of whatever I just dropped into the scrip machine... She clearly likes you.
---
So it's...pay to lose?
---
they talked about this when they implemented the repairkits and it sounded alot like they are going to the atom store.
---
Yep
---
While I appreciate the effort, your points are devoid of facts.
---
Definitions of NPC:
---
&gt;*A non-player character (NPC), also known as a non-playable character, is any character in a game which is not controlled by a player*. - Wikipedia  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*a character in a video game who executes scripted roles and is not controlled by the player.Abbreviation: NPC* \- Dictionary.com  
---
&gt;*A non-player character (NPC) is a video game character that is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI) rather than by a gamer.* \- Technopedia
---
What you've described can have a number of other words, like player, antagonist, vendor. However, NPC just isn't one of them, sorry. Facts just don't support your case.
---
I mean stupid people have also said that Fallout 76 has no NPCs at all, so why not call every other player that isn't yourself a non-player character? I mean those real people who play those characters that are not you are really not players, right?
---
You're free to make up your own definitions if you want. They just won't be based on reality.
---
The colors depend on what mods are equipped.
---
Very true point, and one I had considered... which is really the only viable reason why I can think it hasn't been done - yet. Just imagining 25 people going into their stash box with 3,000 items makes me think about quitting to the dashboard. The servers definitely aren't able to handle it yet - stability first for sure 😁
---
No.  Not really.
---
It's been glitched for a few months now where after you do it once you rarely, if ever, can do it again
---
I have a several hundred hours in the game, but I don't have time for a mule so to speak.
---
I've played enough to know that nothing is irreplacable, and now with player trading it's easier to give up stuff that I'm not really using and to find new interesting gear to play with.
---
Any specific ones you’re talking about?
---
Sounds pretty cool to me
---
Bear in mind that you will not be able to attach limb-specific mods to the arms, these are: Aerodynamic, Braced, Brawling (which in itself seems to be bugged), Stabilized, Weighted.
---
The ARMO record is missing a keyword.
---
Conversely you will be able to attach 'Muffled' to the arms (which should be legs-specific).
---
The 'universal' linings: Pocketed/Deep-Pocketed, Lighter/Ultra-Light Build, Strengthened, Lead Lined will work fine.
---

the people behind the other players may just as well be AI players. maybe those definitions are approaching obsolescence as other players perform functions that developers simply could have implemented in the first place.
---
think outside the box for a second there, old balls.
---
No problem.
---
I honestly don’t know how they draw that conclusion. They think they’re so smart but they’re just so dumb 😂
---
Lets bump up stash size and lets also bump up camp budget while we're at it. I'm dying for some more budget size
---
Solar Powered perk?
---
I’ve gotten this too
---
Before I got into trading - totally agreed - 100% and to a T. I never had stash problems - maybe a few hours once a week I was over encumbered. It's all just about managing what you have 🤷‍♂️
---
Player vending may have led me down this route - kind of, the good stuff is in the private and public markets - but trading lured me to the idea of starting at a Gameboy and going all the way to a Ferrari... just gotta have what the right person wants. 🙂
---
Unfortunately they never give items due to insufficient tools
---
Real fun when something important goes missing
---
I'm travelling at the moment but will be sure to add you when I get back in a couple of days :)
---
first thing I thought of was world of warcraft..the gold sinks there are mounts like the  reins of the mighty caravan brutosaur that cost 5 mil, or the bloodfang Cocoon for 2 mil. And everyone has always wanted a dogmeat type companion so  a tamable pet  like dogmeat would be kinda the fallout equivalent to the mounts I think and an easy gold sink to create in my opinion.
---
&gt;the people behind the other players may just as well be AI players. maybe those definitions are approaching obsolescence as other players perform functions that developers simply could have implemented in the first place.
---
LOL! Your contortion of logic to fit your narrative is just so adorable. 
---
&gt;think outside the box for a second there, old balls.
---
I like logic and facts. Helps to give credibility to the points that I make. Maybe give it a go sometime.
---
Why do you want to build large buildings in a workshop? I mean its fine but Im just using it for small defensive structures etc. and I think its perfect for that.
---
Same here
---
We already had the two game modes combined, and people generally didn't find it fun because it led to griefing. Or... "raider roleplay," as the griefers liked to call it. This game isn't exactly designed with balanced PvP in mind, which resulted in things like the legendary stacking for invincibility and the one-shot capabilities of various guns. Not to mention the huge level disparity. I don't necessarily mind PvP, but in this game? No, thanks. I'll pass on that one. 
---
With all that in mind, it would've been nice if Survival had required players to start anew, and find their footing in a wasteland that is decidedly more perilous with players added to the threat list. Stack rebalanced legendary affixes on top, and it would be a genuinely fun mode that I think a lot more people would play. But it is what it is.
---
I’m making multiple character builds. We don’t know what the next update will bring so I like to be prepared. Right now I have a PA heavy energy weapon build. A stealth rifleman build. A berserkers shotgun and unarmed build. And lastly a junkies gunslinger build. So no matter what the new content brings, no matter what nerfs/ buffs come. I’ll be ready to jump right into it.
---
ahh this is gold
---
There is a crossbow at the archery range at one of the scout camps.
---
I'm interested
---
Fair point, part of me definitely could be the hoarder within since Fallout 4... what can I say, I love a variety in my weapons to play with 😶
---
thanks for the info, and that sucks that some off the mods are bugged.
---
Just like the Quantum bottle sales, or the lunchboxes on sale in Fallout Shelter.
---
Very kind of you! But I prefer earning my stuff just like I have in all previous Fallouts 😊 what a miserable bellend I know. Thanks all the same though!
---
Dog food weighs a bunch, but it's only 1 star.  Hard to give that up.
---
and if i am not wrong and they havent fixed it, the modification descriptions and stats don't match. like the long barrel gives less range than it should or something.
---
I don’t have friends so I have to compensate with a lot of munitions
---
No worries some of my friends are the same, if you want to stop by my camp and check out my wears, they are fairly priced :)
---
Pleasure.
---
At least the legs and the torso 'work'.
---
The same cannot be said for the Scout armor.
---
While everyone in the server is naked
---
When will enough be enough though? If we get 1000, why not 1200?
---
We've already gotten 2 stash increases since launch. 800 is a perfectly workable number. You can't open a grand bazaar but I think that's a good thing.
---
i have done repeatable tadpole events every day after they came out and I have never got any badges and camp tales even more times and also no badges. 
---
its more like .00000020 % drop
---
&gt;I get into the game without falling through the world \*HELP\*
---
Wait, isn't that the goal you WANT to have...? I get into the game without falling through the all the time.
---
Simple answer : Yes 
---
Bethesda Fan Boy Answer : Yes, but in the next update..
---
Plasma gaitlyn
---
yeah I got a sweet 3* unyeilding/sentinel torso, the only thing it is a robot torso and Im trying to beef it up but I am missing the plan/mods for it. 
---
but thank you.
---
Ahh... you wanna maybe direct your mire to the mods for not enforcing their own rules of "6. USE DESCRIPTIVE TITLES AND DO NOT CLICKBAIT"?
---
yes, appreciating logic and facts is important. here’s a fact for ya- definitions change as perceptions change. definitions take one new meanings and abandon old meanings. it is logical for definitions to change. i’m not suggesting that grass isn’t green anymore, i’m saying those definitions are too simple. perhaps that is why you fervently cling to them. NPCs originate from single-player games. then they moved to multiplayer games. but games like this, and i suspect Ark, it’s new territory and things are going to keep changing. it’s all about perception. if players perceive other player characters as non-playable then that is what others become, non-playable characters. eventually we’ll have games with AI and humans and we won’t be able to tell them apart. at that point, the burden of proof will be on the human character to prove themselves to be human. hell, NPC as a term may completely disappear.

The nerfs for PVP are definitely required in some areas, let's not forget that PVP is an important element of adventure mode as well as survival. Most of the damage balancing can be done though PVP specific normalisation which has no effect in PVE. The nerf of armour that stacks to give huge resistance to specific PVP damage is a good example of where nerfing should be used in the interest of game balance.
---
Hunter, Archery and Mammalist.
---
How do you even get to the shooting range I am struggling to find it I would appreciate any help
---
Responding for visibility
---
i know a few ppl that have it for sale on xbox, dont know if they are on right now but I will ask.
---
\+1 for restart. Enjoyed the game so much more during the earlier levels than the later ones. Also, there's enough that's different that the experience is a little different from when you first played.
---
Also you're not bound by the special and perk choices you've made. May make smarter and more effective choice for new character that isn't burdened by the old one.
---
Honestly, if you dislike power armor, you're cut off from the only thing considered an endgame in this.
---
...which is odd to say about a fallout title. A lot of this experience is very disjointed from the rest of the franchise but I guess that's to be expected.
---
Make a new character but keep the BETA character to transfer stuff over later. Drop rates have changed since then so you might have some stuff that's harder to come by now.  
---
Don't stress too much about your builds until you get past level 50, try and take perk points and cards where you think you'd like them based on a particular armor/weapon loadout you might prefer.
---
Oh but it will be patched in less than a day though, it deters people from spending money on the atom shop, so yeah.
---
No nerfs are required.  And PVP is not an important element of Adventure.
---
As far as i am aware, you cannot get a Bloodied 90 redux gun, so this would indeed be a bug. 1st prefix being bloodied and 90 redux weight is a 3rd prefix. Beth need to sort this out!
---
it still has bugs but not like it was at lunch, try it out and find out for yourself. 
---
what is a fun for me, it might not be for you.
---
Last week i also had Census Violence in the bog, but near abandoned bog town, just under the Monorail Pylon. The event spawned Ghouls, that somehow lured a level 80 Supermutant Behemot from Bogtown directly to me and the annoying robot. I cound't kill the Behemot fast enough, he smashed down the robot in two hits.
---
I think what makes it easy for me at my vendor is unless it’s truly rare, I don’t charge very much. Plans I know? 5-20 caps, Fusion Cores I’m never going to use? 10 each regardless of charge, hard to come by clothing that I already have? 10 each(everyone deserves to look good). I’m not in the game to make money and I’m not hurting either. I’ll charge market price for a god roll though, don’t get me wrong.
---
Np
---
then what does this post make you?
---
People were not kidding when they say how next level Japanese players get with CAMPs. That is ridiculously amazing.
---
codebraker is also easy
---
Have you tried 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Same...same process too I think....psn pathofcinders
---
Grilled radstag and Ribeye steak increase carry weight too.
---
Why do they have a slap system, wanted and workshop contesting then? Also nerfing and buffing is required to have a balanced game, your logic assumes They somehow found a perfect balance to begin with.
---
It's nonsense. Just a good ol' case of confirmation bias.
---
You're correct, the only ways to enter PVP is workshop claims or hunter/ hunted while in pacifist.
---
When customer service say "we don't have the ability to restore items" we know they're lying. How did they wipe out the dupe items, but only leave one of each if they don't have the active ability to tamper with our inventory?
---
and drunk
---
Cheers for everyone's reply, I now have more than enough plastic :-) happy wandering fellow fallouters
---
I feel for you, but when I read
---
“So I decided to test on my TSE RW Pump as well”
---
my immediate thought was, “That’s a bold move, Cotton. Let’s see how it works out for him.”
---
I recall reading a few days ago someone saying Charlie is bugged.... if nobody else responds with confirmation on codes. Might be worth a shot trying Alpha instead. 
---
Also curious myself, i was planning on launching a nuke today but didn't want to waste the run until i was sure.
---
I'll give it a try now and I'll let you know how it goes
---
Workshops
---
Hunter/Hunted
---
Team members picking fights
---
being near a workshop when someone tries to claim it (if you are in the claim area when they try to take it, even if you do not own the workshop)
---
Eh, I usually just check my CAMP before logging off. This is a good idea just not one that needs to be prioritized for a WHILE. So much other stuff needs to be fixed or implemented before this quality of life stuff
---
I definitely have at least one chassis. I don’t particularly care for power armor though. At least not in Fallout 4. 
---
Most of my perks are related to carry weight and survival.
---
Yeah, look dude. I can understand that it can be hard to admit that you're wrong. I get it.
---
If you can change the world so that the definition of NON-PLAYER CHARACTER means other player characters just so you don't have to admit that you were wrong, sure, whatever dude. 
---
I mean the word "literally" has lost all meaning now because it means both actually and not actually at the same time so why not have NPC mean both characters not controlled by players as well as characters controlled by players?
---
*liberty prime intensifies*
---
I love the vault boy in the middle as pilot!
---
Only like half the stuff you listed will happen. So.. flip a coin?
---
That’s the rationale I was thinking with restarting. And I think it could be fun to restart in the Vault with my sister when we’re able to coordinate (different time zones, work schedules, and sleep schedules). I don’t think she’s played in a long time either and the reason I was excited for the game at launch was to play with her. I also always love the beginning of a game.
---
Sure, why stop there? Why not make the stash infinite? I mean if we get 2000 stash, what's to stop the next person asking for 2500 stash limit? 3000? 5000? Let's got for 10000 just as a round number. I mean my mega mall shopping complex camp is going to need separate stashes for each of the stores there.
---
Let's just go infinite and save on all these stash increase request posts.
---
That said, I have a lot of time for this game, so the perspective of those with less is likely different.
---
Variety is something I struggled with for a while too, but the combination of player vending and backpacks has eased that somewhat.
---
I often look for legendaries with the lighter weight effect now, though the effectiveness of that on weapons diminishes with mods, the lighter certain-class-of-item armor effect is great, comboed with bear arms since there's quite a lot in the Heavy Weapons class.
---
I'm still hoping for some future balance or perk for rifle weight though, it being the odd one out in terms of weight relief for weapon classes can be noticeable.
---
That I can do :) I'll add you later
---
Charlie was working fine yesterday.
---
Been playing fallout since day one, Fucked it off to play Conan Exiles the past couple of weeks. 
---
Apparently it's not buggy but that's just another lie coming out of BGS
---
Using your damage numbers, with the correct reload formula, it should be look like this.
---
.50cal:
---
Fire 250(250) rounds +21.96 (21.96) +reload **4** (25.96)
---
Fire 250(500) rounds +21.96 (47.92) +reload **4** (51.92)
---
Fire 250(750) rounds +21.96 (73.88) +reload **4** (77.88)
---
Fire 250(1,000) rounds +21.96 (99.84) = **99.84** seconds to reach our goal of 1,000 shots fired on .50 cal
---
LMG:
---
Fire 75(75) rounds +3.77 (3.77) +reload **4** (7.77)
---
Fire 75(150) rounds +3.77 (11.54) +reload **4** (15.54)
---
Fire 75(225) rounds +3.77 (19.31) +reload **4** (23.31)
---
Fire 75(300) rounds +3.77 (27.08) +reload **4** (31.08)
---
Fire 75(375) rounds +3.77 (34.85) +reload **4** (38.85)
---
Fire 75(450) rounds +3.77 (42.62) +reload **4** (46.62)
---
Fire 75(525) rounds +3.77 (50.39) +reload **4** (54.39)
---
Fire 75(600) rounds +3.77 (58.16) +reload **4** (62.16)
---
Fire 75(675) rounds +3.77 (65.93) +reload **4** (69.93)
---
Fire 75(750) rounds +3.77 (73.7) +reload **4** (77.7)
---
Fire 75(825) rounds +3.77 (81.47) +reload **4** (85.47)
---
Fire 75(900) rounds +3.77 (89.24) +reload **4** (93.24)
---
Fire 75(975) rounds +3.77 (97.01) +reload **4** (101.01)
---
Fire 75(1050) rounds +3.77 (104.78) +reload **4** (108.78)
---
Fire 75(1125) rounds +3.77 (112.55) +reload **4** (116.55)
---
Fire 75(1200) rounds +3.77 (120.32) +reload **4** (124.32)
---
Fire 75(1275) rounds +3.77 (128.09) +reload **4** (132.09)
---
Fire 75(1350) rounds +3.77 (135.86) +reload **4** (139.86)
---
Fire 75(1425) rounds +3.77 (143.63) +reload **4** (147.63)
---
Fire 10(1435) rounds (147.63) = **147.63** seconds to reach our goal of 1435 shots with LMG
---
Sounds like that's the way to go then!
---
Also you can still keep your level 20 just to see what that's like too. Best of both worlds.
---
Flying cars? Never heard that one.
---
But hey, if you hated it before then no, it's still the same. But without the whiners.  Some of the issues remain, but most of us enjoy it. Bugs and all.
---
Don't play it if you expect perfection. Ain't this game.
---
IMO you can survive in the wasteland or you can thrive. If you want to sleep comfortably at night knowing you’ll be able to run tomorrow you need at least one mule. I personally have one for weapons I can sell/trade some day, One for junk weapons I buy for scrip but can’t turn in due to limits, and one in a safe place exclusively for junk.  I’ve been trading relentlessly since launch and even if I didn’t have a hoarding problem the game would be a nightmare for me without my mules. It takes some getting used to but it’s very easy to move stuff between accounts. I usually run my main around 500lbs in the stash and then when it fills up after a couple days I just toss my stuff in a desk, hop off, hop back in same world on the mule and voila!
---
Yes and also add flux to normal ammo and turn them into ultracite ammo. Right now it’s as if ammo is useless once created. It should be able to be recycled or reused. Ultracite plasma core is a good example, you simply add yellowcake flux to normal plasma core and turn them into ultracite version. We should be able to do that to all ammos.
---
it would depend on the situation. if there are actual NPCs using current definitions then player characters would largely remain player characters. in the absence of traditional NPCs, then players at times temporarily serve as NPCs for one another. yes, you would still refer to all players as player characters and you could also refer to them as NPCs when they serve as such roles during specific gameplay. loom at 76 now, the NPCs are merely animated versions of a checkpoint. sure, they speak, they tell u do this do that, but what consequence do they offer besides being able to launch a nuke? they’re hollow and besides their models and voice acting they are simply a place where you click an action button. computationally, they are nothing more than click-events. they are nearly void of character, and character is a crucial component of NPCs. for now, that’s everyone else for the most part.
---
what is the reason for taking a picture?
---
is it for some challenge?
---
what do you even get from challenges?
---
I’ll be on around 6:30 central time if you haven’t got it by then. Psn is brm138
---
It would be fun to also be able to play pool and basketball
---
To be fair I'm going to be giving 76 a break for a little while until this gets sorted because I don't want any of my 3star items getting buggered
---
Most of them, including combat ones, Adamantium Bones, Lead Belly, Ammosmith, etc, etc, etc.....
---
That’s the normal and expected behavior.
---
I recommend completing events and explore if you want side quests. You have better chance (IMO) to engage random encounters (like legendary creature with leg. loot) when you travel on foot. For example Horde events spawn legendary creature every time and are low level friendly.
---
Also daily and weekly challenges can bring you to interesting places, however there is no exp reward.
---
It's usage may vary. The more you sprint or use vats the faster it will burn. If you use the perk card to extend how long batteries will last you may not need many so farm as much as you can until you work out your play style usage
---
There are no 'Bethesda' fanboys, what meant to do was to criticize and be snarky to people who enjoy the Fallout genre and FO76. After all if we don't like what you like we have to be simpletons.
---
It's a bug carried over from Fo4.
---
A power core usually lasts for quite some time. It depends a lot whether you're running, using the jetpack or fighting but for me they usually last more than 1 hour of constantly doing the 3 things mentioned above
---
I think they'll expand on it in future docs, just as they did with Arktos, pioneer camps etc. There's a door that inaccessible at this point in time.
---
I guess we'll see
---
Even with the 200% perk, vats will drain them pretty fast. I've never seen an exact duration.
---
 Never stop farming them if you plan to spend any real time in PA. Never stop. Expect to pay 150 ea. From other players, and remember they're 2.4 pounds with all associated perks, so plan for that as well. I spend 75% of my time in PA and am always on the lookout for them. I try to keep 20 on hand at all time.
---
I played the game just as much I just got tired of being fucked over by bugs. Can't you people understand you're feeding into the bullshit main stream game logic of "let's release a incomplete game" and then "well promise no in-game microtransactions that have benefits" but then turn around and get fucked over by more bugs and more lies. You guys need to realize it's sad people stuck with this game so long when all they do is add new bugs.
---
Would'nt even invest in that fusion core perk, they last long enough and are easy to farm, I don't even need to go get some most of the time
---
Well I don't mind doing deals of course. Message me at my GT when you can so we can work something out :)
---
Mannn I really damn hope so. I love space apocalypse stuff
---
In times of confused panic the brain shuts down.  
---
Just ask the guy who threw a plasma grenade at the ghoul hitting him in the golf club.
---
That’s it. I eat them all the time.
---
Bye then, doubt we'll see you whining on this sub anymore, enjoy the next game you go to :)
---
Thank you valued ~~wallet~~ player, we have heard your concerns and reported them to the team, and don't worry, we have a solution on the way! For only 2500 atoms, starting next week and available for a limited time only we are introducing our amazing new ammo mill into the atomic shop, so get buying those atom packs and you'll be prepared for when we release this great new feature! 
---
Regards ~~money extraction~~ bethesda support
---
Would love to see a throwback or reference to mothership zeta
---
You on PS4?
---
Wait is that true?
---
Definitely! That was my favourite DLC for fallout 3
---
They work. Charlie is bugged
---
Lmfao I don't mind I can play working games and be happy not being in this shit show of a sub and people dick riding
---
Agreed, although those hillbilly ass, axe wielding fucks from Point Lookout added a whole new realm of tension
---
They last less than an hour for me, and I’m constantly sprinting, using vats, jet pack etc
---
Awesome, thanks for the confirmation.
---
Are no mods for the bowie knife.
---
Furious handmade fullauto... I play three characters that all farm for 5.56.
---
Have you tried the vendor near the Top of the world?
---
Id gladly take a hit in breaking down the bullets into the items that can then create more bullets personally in terms of what I receive back. 
---
At least then they all wouldn't just sit in the vendor!
---
Hahaha hell yeah that’s true! Man I miss the auto-axe from The Pitt though! I used to decorate my megaton house with all the exotic weapons from the dlc
---
Bummer, I have a Mutant's Explosive Flamer with 90% reduced weight
---
I've been looking to trade for an explosive cryolator
---
They admitted they were using the wrong silo's code on the same post.
---
Well I guess I won't be buying it.
---
I didn't like the game itself before anyways, I just wanted to know if It's still buggy If hypothetically I wanted to buy it again.
---
The only mod is the knife paint from the scouts, that's it.
---
I can help out now what's your tag?
---
For the trade failed on server error I think there's some statement between how many of the item thinks the vendor has Vs how many the client thinks they have.
---
I work around it by buying half, and then buying buying a few at a time until I can't buy any more. At this point if you exit and then go back to trade you'll find the item completely gone.
---
Cheer up Charlie, give me a nuke
---
What happened to that nuke I used to know?
---
Yep first place I went to
---
Yea, everything's glowing
---
You can turn a pistol into a rifle by changing the grip. Under Ultracite Laser Gun. Yes there are plans
---
Japan &gt; Murica in everything except big bombs
---
Where is this crashed space station I keep hearing about?
---
I tried to but I keep levelling them up.
---
I saw one for just under 3,000 caps at a vendor on Xbox. Just have to keep looking and hopefully get lucky.
---
My guess is that the bags will be released near a possible sales holiday so they can sell more copies of the game with the free publicity, maybe it will be ready in time for summer sales, perhaps black Friday, or a Christmas release.
---
Thanks, I have to try this
---
/u/LadyDevann
---
Are we getting our extra stars back or what is going to happen? :(
---
Very north east corner of the Toxic Valley
---
There’s a few medium leveled scorched there but it’s not too bad. Oh and you can find the spacesuit there too.
---
It’s actually +25 disease resistance but mislabeled as radiation. I have no idea if disease resistance actually works as I catch one every time I look at a ghoul...
---
If you read here it's like that kid game where the first in line says something and report to the next . The last one will say something of a complete different subject.
---
You need: 
---
-3 charisma to be able to equip one of the card(3 because lvl 2 has better chances; each creature depends on a specific card)
---
-a random spawn event of a single tamable alone.
---
- to get super close to it. The prompt will show only when next to it. This is new and probably unintended,might be fixed later.
---
- the budget of a turret: they follow most turret rules but they aren't( go figure). It was 10%,now it's way lower.
---
Now there is another condition that i'm still testing and it's your level. Because my lvl 260 toon cannot find tamables anymore.i looked for 7 hours during a whole week and i didn't see one. It usually took me one at best. You can still tame if someone else find one for you though.
---
This would be awesome!

Thank you 😊
---
Thanks 😘
---
Hope that helps, I’d post a picture if I knew how to do that on reddit 😁
---
Thanks for the tip. It’s a pain to find them for disease cures.
---
Uhh source? First I've heard anything about disease resistance on armor.
---
Waitwaitwaitwait...there is something different.. Something is not as it used to be.
---
It's either the shine colour of flatwoods monster or the hat... I go with the hat. Yeah the hat... Hat.
---
*Btw - Dress up a bit. It seems a bit cold outside...*
---
Nah, it makes sense it works that way. You should be happy that players are able to use miniguns with their bare arms as it is. I'm more dismayed that PA doesn't remove ar at least reduce recoil whatsoever.
---
Gamertag?
---
With class freak. Negative effects of mutations are reduced by 75% its even better if youre in a team as strange in numbers boosts ge positive effects  👍
---
Answer above 👍
---
How is it the customers fault that Bethesda blatantly lied? I'm shocked that this level of thieving from the customer is legal. I mean, red bull got sued for not actually giving you wings and they lost and had to repay every single person who made a claim. 
---
I've seen other companies release products and come out groveling and apologizing profusely for not being able to ship the exact advertised product and they make up for it with other freebies to keep the customers happy. Bethesda tried to pretend it's normal to advertise one thing and deliver something else and hope the complaints don't get taken seriously because it's a video game and apparently that means we are supposed expect cheap garbage no matter what was actually advertised.
---
You are a corporate bootlicker if you think it's okay or normal to get ripped off like this because you've seen other shoddy video game products.
---
Thanks someone already help me
---
Np nice man!

Not sure about that last one. I was inside a shop when someone tried to claim it and didn't become hostile to them but I did prevent the claim meter from progressing. 
---
Similarly, when I contested a shop with a bystander inside it, he didn't become hostile either.
---
Yea now I'm trying to get a backpack
---
Yes now I'm trying to get a backpack
---
It’s been discussed on here and the fo76 discord but I’m not awake enough to find a reference. I also confirmed this by checking the game files myself. If your armor actually shows the 25 rr you have the “correct” version but if not you have +25 disease resistance. Lucky you!
---
Team members too. If anyone on your team initiates PvP the entire team is dragged into it.
---
If you lose loose screws, you're screwed.
---
I've started noticing missing stats on armor pieces too, but the star isn't missing, just the stats. I have several 2* and 3* items with +25 rad resist or +25 poison resist that don't display any rad or poison defense when inspected, and no resistances go up when it's equipped except the normal armor and energy resists. I even found a piece with an extra effect that it doesn't say it has. (both 25 rad and poison resist on a piece of armor that should only have 25 poison.)
---
I normally use Charlie thanks for the heads up.
---
You lose them. Nothing to prevent those sales, if you go over limit, they are simply lost.
---
Oh, that's crazy! Thanks for helping me understand what that was. It's actually kind of cool to be able to see how much you're contributing to another person's stockpile :]
---
Still on?
---
Interesting, thanks
---
Damn thats pretty lame
---
Interested to see your bitchin house
---
Well I have no idea then. And to be honest, I don't recall seeing the plans for actual armor parts, only mods.
---
If you use a 100 charged fusion core while in VATS.... aaaaaaaaand it's gone.
---
5 min for me if using vats. Has to be some glitch. I only use PA at Queen fights but its about 5 cores when using vats for me
---
Only plans for mods exist
---
That sucks
---
Yes, but this is assuming lone player. Adding another player to the mix changes everything.
---
LMFAO ;)
---
LOL at your edit :D
---
thank you very much :)
---
LOL smh
---
Yeah sorry dude, they reportedly don't have the tools to give us replacement items.  I had a couple weapons disappear, but they told me they couldn't do anything about it.  Best we can hope for is that they fix this bug.
---
Scrap the helms, you can learn the BoS paint, it’s dark, not really black though
---
True, and it does happen. I try to minimize that by building a vending kill switch that I flip when I hit about 22.5, 23k and go on a spending spree - usually cheap ammo or anything else that catches my eye and then I'll turn then back on when I've spent down to 17.5k or so.
---

---
Raider power armor is just the result of Raiders finding other pre war PA models and modding them for their own use, it would be like trying to find engineering plans for cut down hot rod cars, there aren't any only for the original factory models they are based on.
---
So the lack of Raider PA plans is kind of logical. But I'm always finding frames with various Raider pieces, doesn't take long to get a full set or sets.
---
Happy hunting :)
---
Rifle and pistol are the same weapon and share the same mod so it doesn't matter in which of these 2 variants you scrap them
---
Im after the regular raider armor plans lol
---
No fuckin' way... I feel for you dude, I really do. But I'm just surprised at why you decided to test it on two shot explosive one when you know the paint removes a legendary effect. Still I feel for you cause that glitch wasted you
---
Are you on PC with mods? if so you need to adjust your custom.ini file. Look at Nexusmods for help.
---
Yeah but I doubt they will be able to fix the legendaries that they broke :/
---
I wonder why I got power armor in my head then, funny that ;)
---
Go buy it from the enclave then, you'll see "reasonable" prices there.
---
I cannot give you a solid answer, but it looks like it's related to some mods. Try to search the sub, there are plenty of posts with this issue.
---
"Oh! this skin broke my best weapon... let me try again on my second best weapon..."
---
I always liked the heavy version, looks really bad ass and fits into the wasteland perfectly, shit stats as tier 1 but still cool.
---
yeah but what about the helm plans? Do they exist? or do I have to go loocking for helms?
---
My vampire buzzblade is still godly for whitesprings
---
Yes. This.
---
Had the same problem. Removed (replaced) the .ini file  .
---
We need to setup an account on imgur then learn how, I've not bothered yet either.
---
I have other characters and use my wifes Ps4 to transfer 25k to my alts. Maybe try with a friend if you can
---
That was it, I wrongfully assumed a fresh install would fix anything inlcuding the custom ini file.
---
Thanks. It's been a while I'm reading up now.
---
If said in a statement along these lines: "I'm not gay, but I support gay rights." is it still hurtful?
---
I think I've written along the lines of that before and thought of it as an equivalent of "I'm not a woman, but I support women's rights."
---
Now I'm not even sure if that's harmful. I've meant it as "Even though I'm not part of this group, the need of improvement for them is so obvious that even I can see it".
---
oof, I've got an explosive vampire's cryolator, but because I have one of the mutations that lowers energy damage I can't use it, heck I can't even use the flamer either way :/ but I feel like it's the only way to have high enough defense for my heavy build to just give up energy guns.
---
I hate you for giving me this hope. 😜
---
Only level 78 atm... something in me tells me to keep waiting before launching and taking on the sbq. Well done to you.
---
Responders mustache comb! Nuka-cola lufa! RAIDER STYLE WICKER CONDOMS
---
I'm thinking of Eve Online with thousands of concurrent players and the servers remain stable.
---
Hell that would be great for all corpses. Lost way to much loot in the Mire and Cranberry big because of the long grass.
---
"If" they add NPC's, we don't know and it's best not to get excited until it's confirmed and can be played.
---
OR, being able to player vendor ammo at less than 1 cap each. 
---
Eg. 5mm ammo - 1cap for 10 rounds. 
---
.38 ammo - 1cap for 100 rounds.
---
Every time I post I get told it’s click baity. I have no idea what I’m doing wrong.
---
If you want your gun fixed asap, change the title to "DON’T BUY ANYTHING FROM ATOMIC SHOP, IT’S BROKEN".
---
Yes, it sucks. On PC it takes two buttons presses to do a job, what should take only one. And the whole mega menu design from 90s is garbage. I am talking about places where you click on thing and then have to move your mouse to menu on side and if you don't go straight horizontally, shift little bit too much below or above, the menu closes or even worse, menu of other item gets popped and now you are sending team invite to wrong person.
---
If they do, I'll be happy. If they don't, I'll still be happy and excited to see what they do with the DLC
---
I have loads of those repair kit but never use them. Just found out they have weight so I'll probably just drop a lot of them. I want my weapons repaired to 200%, not that crappy 130%.
---
I love the idea of introducing npc’s as random encounters.
---
Character or account?
---
I would say start over, with a friend or group. Lvl 20 is where the game gets really rough on you and all the enemies become bullet sponges if you don't start getting your damage perks perfect.
---
Pick a weapon type and stick with it. Avoid weight reduction perks and things like lock picking and hacking whenever you can get something useful for killing or survival instead. The 1 QOL card I'd say get early is Good Doggy. It lets you focus on having only 1 food type on you at any time. You sell the rest to keep your weight down and make some caps. Sell most of the other crap that's everywhere like chems as well.
---
Speaking of caps, while low level you use very little plastic and steel yet find lots of it. Throw your excess in your camp's vendor and any shotgun user passing by will gladly buy all your plastic, and many high level players will take your steel. Just want you to know that caps won't be a problem if you try even a little.
---
Then take those caps and buy at least any legendary you see at player vendors for 10 caps per scrip or less. More if you start having lots of caps. Turn those in at any train station and by the time you make your way to Berkley Station, you'll be ready to try for some really good drops appropriate to your level. There's lots of new stuff to play with since December.
---
I'd suggest playing with other people regardless of starting over or not. 20 levels isn't a lot once you start killing the right things quickly. Most of the game is boring and simply tedious grind when solo and playing with others adds a lot. Don't like building houses but one of your friends does? Great, let them do it. Enjoy taking workshops and farming materials? Perfect, share with friends. Playing in a group makes almost everything easier, and it increases your chances of getting access to good weapons that match everyone's builds.
---
If you do start over, as I said, pick a weapon and your build early. Throw the points you eventually need into INT early on to maximize your XP and level up faster, even if it means picking an INT point and a card from a different tree that you can't even equip yet. Balance that out later on. I would say the exception is damage cards, but there really are no good damage cards early on. The game pushes you towards weight cards hard in the early stages. Avoid them like they're a disease.
---
Hunters long coat looks so nice only my character. 10/10
---
Same, I just don't want to be disappointed anymore. :/
---
This post reeks of someone that's a jobber, no friends besides virtually, doesn't go out much, takes gaming as their 2nd job through time consuming looter shooters 
---
Not a lot of people are like you mate, we all have lives and agendas, we have friends and family to spend time with, jobs to work up to 60 hour weeks, we work for our stuff and enjoy as much as we can with the time we have
---
This post is just as ignorant as everyone believing that duping is an issue and damages the value of the game, when in reality, this game is below average at best, no real incentive to play besides "Oh but if you complete quests you get things to survive", it's a constant climb just to find ways to only survive in this game and not to thrive as a player
---
People whining about seeing people with legendaries who aren't griefing just reeks of insecurity as well, "Oh no he hasn't played this game 12 hours a day to grind for that" just seems insane to me, I play red dead 2 and grind for my items and it's fine, my problem is previous fallout games had fair RNG as opposed to 76 where once you get a 3 star after countless months of farming all of a sudden it's some type of entitlement to show that you are in fact wasting away grinding for more better alternatives
---
I'll be enjoying my time wrecking players who try to grief me with my two shot crippling explosive minigun thank you very much that I duped, with my 3 other friends from to join me that I duped for them as well, whenever I'm not playing some other game to entertain me that is
---
&gt; like my gay friends, but I'm just not gay. I tried same sex and MMF in college, but I'm just not a gay man.
---
And we should give a fuck about that why, exactly?  Are you going to tell us whether your white or not, because that would be exactly as irrelevant.
---
Lol I didnt know that either. I was wandering why when I take rad x my carry weight goes up, obviously it supresses Eagle Eye mutation with -4 ST. Lol
---
&gt; Finally, do you know that every single serum vendors for 500 caps ? 
---
It's adorable that you think that. You keep being you.
---
The most I've paid for them was 400 and that's because I wasn't willing to shop around. There are plenty of 500's, 550's, even 1k's. At the same time 300-400's aren't that scarce as vendors, let alone in the trades.
---
Its time to craft some!
---
I feel you but this is where the purveyor is great, turn all those crappy legendaries into a good one!
---
We can get strangler bloom from project paradise, so it's easier to get now
---
&gt; I might be championing them a little too much. I spend most of my game time with them, so I'm keenly aware of modern gay struggles.
---
How does adding the detail that you're not gay "champion" your "homoies"?  You want extra points for being straight but still offended by homophobic slurs?
---
If they changed the swing animation for golf clubs, and then had golf balls as world-interactable items, yes.  Would it be any good?  Maybe.  But it would have to change the whole swing animation for golf clubs, and then they would be useless as weapons.  (unless they just turned into shin-breaker weapons, which could actually be double-cool)
---
If you have proof that it happened though maybe one of the Bethesda developers can borrow the shotguns and mod the lost explosive effect back on
---
Play this game, should I?
---
That is something it makes me wonder since ive got camera. Being in the sneak, chameleon and pulling the camera out makes me discovered but pulling big ass cannon out doesnt. How does it work then? 😛😃
---
Thanks for your help
---
Panic! I just applied the flamer skin to my tse flamer!! Hope it doesnt have it’s star removed
---
We could have something like smelting workbench. Melting all the resources that we dont need to carft ones that we do.
---
I had the white wolf fedora vanish from my stash, went to wear it for one of the badges and had to go and find a different one.
---
Came here expecting a story about an Enclave event, stayed for the bittersweet romance.
---
I think they can give a pretty big damage bonus (50%?) without the need to be at low health like bloodied so it’s probably that
---
Also bloodied has been very very strong for so long maybe people are anticipating a nerf so moving on before a nerf
---
Atleast then i would have stash space 😂😂
---
Upvoted and upvoted.
---
Don't forget to pay it forward.
---
Upvoted.
---
Agreed. I don't want to bother some other person just trying to enjoy the game, so I can get a photo of them wearing raider gear with rose at the top of the world.
---
Making me feel like a beggar.
---
You know that the vendor bot spawns elsewhere, right? Was posted a while back when people would tear down people's camps out of impotent rage to only realise that those camps weren't preventing the vendor bots from spawning at all.
---
Since patch 9 you no longer loose addictions from death or over time so a junkies build is now viable. I didn't know this until I over heard some people discussing in game yesterday. Check out this guide https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
I remember back after launch playing with a friend who excitedly proclaimed that he'd found a box with a ridiculous amount of loot in it. He cleared it out and went about 600 lbs over weight limit. We started walking away when he shouted fuck, that was my stash. Always get a good chuckle now when others talk about it
---
Agreed that said im looking for a ps4 player that i can revive now lol
---
&gt; Final step before launch is a secret unlock code for the missile. 6 character digits, 16 possible characters per digit. 17 million different combinations so the code cannot be brute forced (in a reasonable amount of time).
---
With the minor problem that the code was set to "000000" for the first 20 or so years -- the USAF were more worried about being unable to launch than the possibility of a unwanted launch.
---
Buy even a crappy explosive weapon from some other player and then keep grinding for 2-3\* enemies or keep rolling for 2\* ranged weapons at the Purveyor.
---
Have you heard of our lord and saviour RNGesus?
---
Gary?
---
I don't mind challenges that involve other players. I do mind that it's crucial in completing a DLC quest though.
---
If you have to turn to Reddit in order to complete a core DLC quest, something's wrong with the game.
---
I know it spawns elsewhere but I had much luck exactly that place, like all my friends. I fully disagree with destroying other players camp, but I actually have no idea why players even make camp in Charleston. No players nearby, no good material spots, so it’s absolutely makes no sense.
---
The amount of god dam sting wings I’ve lost in the grass around tree tops
---
I tried at low level and it's a MASSIVE pain because my options for safe fast travel are limited. Had to get someone with a high level character to help me out.
---
Damn, Bummed I missed this.  
---
Thanks for the heads up though.
---
PC.
---
Indeed it would be great! To be honest, I would be perfectly happy at this moment, if legenadary corpses wouldnt just magically disappear after I just killed them, loosing all the loot.
---
For the pioneer challenges?
---
I'll help you with any weekly, dailys you want
---
I switched from bloodied to junkie. One reason were the prices for weapons. A junkies explosive for example is way cheaper then a bloodie explo......at least till now. Prices are rising. Melee is still dirt cheap though.
---
Yep ive done 4 badges now need revive someone
---
Gary Gary Gaaaaaryyyy!
---
Translation:
---
(How'd you know I'm from Vault 108?)
---
Activate Encryptid event and pray that less bloodied characters will come. You can also be lucky and revive them in the little puddle there.
---
As someone who use to have a camp there for a while, having an existing structure and free bed to work with just makes things easier. It's also less of a burden on the budget (though that didn't affect me any) and it's right next door to a vendor and a large water source.
---
If it weren't for a want to build my own place and foot traffic is on the low side compared to other locations, I would have happily stayed there.
---
Does anyone know if the Broken ProSnap Delux Camera can spawn in containers if you haven't found the tourist? Cause what I will say is? go to a Silo and search every container. I regularly find those in Silos, usually 2-3 per run. Also, the tourist is easier to find if you Google F76 tourist location map. Pick a server and FT to all locations. Odds are the tourist will be at at least one of those locations. I occasionally hunt for the tourist for people on my Discord and can usually find him/her between 30-60 mins
---
&gt;  I know there are failsafes and multiple people have to agree
---
Actually in the US one person has the unlimited power to launch a nuclear strike.  It's currently Donald Trump.
---
Nobody has to agree with him, by law they have to do what he says.
---
Lots of people think that someone (usually claimed to be the secretary of defense) has to confirm his order, in fact all that is required is that someone confirm that it is actually the president who is giving the order.
---
Add me, psn bryangolley. I'll help you out
---
MODUS thinks chess is for wimps.
---
Always been like that.
---
After I sacrifice myself, could you die aswell so I can do it?
---
I do the same.....i switch a flip and lock the door.
---
1200h and 1 explosive drop
---
Yes, of course.
---
It's the same for players. In adventure mode, if someone attacks you or your camp, it does no damage. If you attack then back, pvp is activated and both parties deal full damage. If you keep pacifist mode on, you can't instigate pvp by attacking or attacking back, so you are *mostly* immune to pvp and pvp based griefing. There are a couple of exceptions:
---
If you control a workshop and someone contests it, you are open to pvp, **but** only within the workshop's boundaries.
---
Pvp is team based, so if someone on your team engages in pvp with another player, you are open to pvp from that player. It's possible to exploit this. Random person sends you an invite, you accept, they go to your camp. Their partner, who isn't in the team engages them in pvp, which opens you and your camp to damage. This can be avoided completely by not accepting invites from random strangers.
---
Ok, my psn is Trivago_0

---
I can see it now...
---
I find I get heaps of opportunities to revive people at the Encrypted event, occasionally at Free Range, and sometimes also when fighting the Scorchbeast Queen. If you can’t find anyone willing to die for you, you may happen on folk in those places.
---
Yes. I own one.
---
Worthless asshats, eh?  
---
That's a little harsh, IMO.
---
Wait how does explosive work on a cryolator?
---
You say missed as if they can't possible add lore to that area in future.
---
I'm actually looking forward to an expansion of the lore there. With that and the Flatwoods monster, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they incorporate a space-themed DLC.
---
I agree I have over 500 hours in and I’ve never found one in the wild and I’ve done all kinds of legendary encounters Including the SBQ and events. If I did as a lower level it wasn’t until around level 20 that joined this subreddit and learned what is worth keeping and wasn’t. And also agree with the previous comment when purveyor came into town I know have had around 5 explosive weapons. There are still others weapons and armor that I haven’t came across. It’s definitely bull crap how unbalanced this game is. You have people talking about they’ve came across so many rare or unseen items from most of us they just scrapped them or dropped them on the ground because they didn’t want the extra weight lol. But 100% agree with you
---
How perverse the situation is that you need to ask someone to risk their life in order for you to get a backpack.
---
Please Bethesda just give me God roll weapons and armor every time. I don't want to search for my own stuff and I know your software can read my mind to know exactly what I want, so where is my bloodied, explosive, reduced weight 50. Cal machine gun with matching the set of assassin/sentinel forest scout armor. These thing should be dropping every time.
---
I was wanting to post on here if anyone has seen a rise in legendary drops within the las week? We hit a nuked whitesprings a few days ago and I ended up with 15 weapons mostly 1 star but I’m feeling like it’s happening a little more often now
---
The responders put out fires, yes? Hmmm...
---
not a new addition
---
in water
---
I see a lot of pitchforking but has anyone else confirmed this bug?
---
Might have been a rare one of occurrence? (that still needs to get fixed don't get me wrong.)
---
[GARY LOVED THAT.]
---
Go down to where spruce knob lake and let a mirelurk hit you while the water then do the rest, this will get you the swimmer's revive done as well.
---
Also, able to harvest wood from trees, instead of just...fallen rotten logs.
---
dont feel to bad, i got over 350 hours and the only explosive weapon I got I got it from someone, I also get ton off trash gear it the way the  game is. I do agree the bugs need to be fixed and the loot tables need some adjusting.
---
I will try to do that now.
---
I wonder if the scouts was a death cult before the war.
---
He already did that and more like I said get over it or just don’t play the game or any other future Bethesda games
---
Wait really?
---
I would like to think the Power Armour pieces decorating the shelves in the Purveyor's shop would also be an indicator that this is true.
---
I would also like this.
---
More like a glitch.
---
Charred Feral Ghouls - like that one - do not wear armour. Ever.
---
Feral Ghoul Reavers do but they have a very different character model.
---
I have ended up wearing trashcans - that was fun - probably happened the same to this poor fella.
---
It doesn't have the armor 'equipped' but rather 'stuck' hence it falling off when you whacked him.
---
Full marine set - goals
---
Guess I can add this to the missing texture for the suppressor with the same skin to it's issue list then.
---
Guess I should be glad I've had lousy luck getting a legendary pump action shotgun so far.
---

---
&gt; You have to scrap weapons and armour to learn mods. 
---
Is this really true for armor? I can't remember learning a new mod from scrapping pieces of armor. It only happens on weapons for me.
---
You still need a second person to res you and get ressed by you.
---
They don't ever but there's a photo of one doing just that? You sure about that lol?
---
Yeah, haven't played in weeks, since I learned that I can't get the backpack on my own.
---
That was the first thing since release that really pissed me off. I have enough things to organize in my daily job routine, I don't wann organize with some stranger when I can meet online to enjoy  a game.
---
they mentioned it in one paragraph with repair kits, so it's obvious they're planning to add it to atomic store
---
As for all dlcs past/present/upcoming- careful with expectations...
---
As long there is not an official statement which say npc will be implemented - enjoy the game as it is and don't hype yourself too much to not get disappointed.
---
Yea and thanks I'll check that location out
---
Bethesda forgot what is Fallout.
---
We dont want challenges photos and brewing. 
---
I bought the game to play fallout, not a brewer / photographer simulator!!
---
Lol if I see one I'll hold onto it for you
---
Pretty sure.
---
The NPC record does not have the relevant subrecord provisioned.
---
I think it's less us being lucky, and more people like OP assuming that the issues they experience must be shared by others. I don't know what causes the broken thought process, but it seems kind of self-important, at the very least narrowminded.
---
Kind of sounds like he could benefit from a more stable internet connection.
---
Oh yeah I could see that. I moved fast tonight though I was pissed but focused lol.
---
A couple of months ago I run through all 3 silos up until the nuke card. I left 2 silos cleared and launched from the 3rd. When I immediately went back to the other two, I had to redo them again. There was no change in story, quests or anything. Triple nuked Whitesprings with completely overlapping zones; no extra rad damage or excess enemies.
---
This game have many problems, ability to obtain good gear is not one of those.
---
did you put the red headlamp on it?
---
Make them sellable only in whatever stack size they are made by. For example 2 caps for 5.56 ammo but only if you sell astack of 20.
---
If your on xbox I can craft you a full set modded out pretty dang well
---
This is pretty much the question the US was asking in the Lore, if I'm not mistaken. They rapidly went through several PA designs, meanwhile the Chinese were developing their stealth technology. 
---
If you can't beat them, nuke them?
---
I hate picture challenges in general.
---
I haven’t came across the camera by itself. And I’ve been looking. But  doesn’t mean it don’t.
---
That's a wicked idea!
---
From someone who has farmed the bot, Charleston isn't the best place, try the soft serve.
---
With Charleston if it isn't already there spawned in by someone else you have to run out of the zone then back in along the track.
---
With the soft serve the random event will spawn in as you run to it. It's much quicker to do this with someone else, then leave and reload, it will have different inventory, just let it walk around a little and trade some stuff or it'll die.
---
Those details could've also been added to antagonize the griefer. While griefers are lowlives, like GTA tryhards, they could've been added to, once again, antagonize the griefer or "bring out the worst" in the griefer. OP might as well be trying to look cool by claiming to have 2 gay friends. Who would use that as bragging material?
---
 It's 2019, and it's not really uncommon to have people claim to have LGBT friends. It is pretty outlandish, though.
---
inb4 this comment gets downvoted to oblivion

I think you can find bowie knifes with the serrated mod, but cannot craft them.

lol you a right charsleston its great place to have a camp like mines.  i had better luck at Janes than i did on charleston.
---
Nightmarish seems a bit overreactive, but this seems like a personal issue. So, I guess use whatever description you'd like. The menus work perfectly fine on my console, though. I don't think they need an overhaul.
---
Yeah I would like the option to wear any clothing over or under the armor. Would be neat!
---
Nice. Mine was meant to be very junkyard inspired though so it has much more clutter. Yours reminds me of a spot close to Rivet City in FO3 that some raiders lived at.
---
Massively for me. I go to whitesprings and I get a bunch from non legendary enemies. I struggled to find them before honestly.
---
Our personal terminal should give us quest to find missing camera guy and mark like 5 possible locations on our map like horde event. Current implementation is frustrating and basically camera is exclusive for Reddit/discord users as casual player will never figure out where to get camera.

Get Contractor level 2.

Always have it equipped. Don't do the same mistake as I did. My camp resources are empty.
---
This is non nuked also.
---
Well you could say it's a bone of sorts..... or a worm.....
---
Tell me about it, only thing I need for Stings and Things. I’m lucky if I can find 1, never mind building up a stockpile.
---
Yes, there still is a bug where you select something to sell, confirmation box is correct, but then it sells another item if your mouse cursor is pointing at it
---
It’s a legacy weapon that no longer drops. The rounds turn into projectiles, and the cryolator would fire much in the same way as a minigun.
---
Happens when vendoring stuff too, quite annoying when it jumps down to a different item.
---
You must find the tourist, without that you're not able to repair it and broken camera is just regular junk.
---
I built one of my first camps opposite the trader. It used to take my game about 30 seconds to fully load everything (vendor included) in.
---
Oh god I bought a be rw pump myself day that skin came out put it on used for a bit and stashed  it now I gotta go check mine if I lose a effect on it ima cry lol
---
For sure, it’s probably the biggest anti-climax in the game (when seeing the E3 footage, the space station was what got me pumped.)
---
I mean... I've gotten quite a few from legendary enemies and the new legendary vendor gives them out like candy on halloween.
---
Oh yes, the separate open-for-all stash... I seriously need that. I'd put it in my impenetrable fortress of an enclave bunker. Or just 1 a floor and walls, and a roof, and shove it inside.
---
Game as a service - don't worry guys one day we will fix everything 👍
---
Nah, the vending machines work even with no power at all. The only difference is that your camp doesnt show up on the map without power.
---
I'm on xbox and I swear this is how I lost my veil of secrets !!! Grrr
---
Drum, because you could be firing way more bullets and not spend half the time reloading. The optimal build would be Quad Perforating Handmade which gets you 80 bullets and 40% armor ignore. Quad drum is just 145 bullets and unless you are pretty badly swarmed, there is not much use to that.
---
I'm just buying assaultron circuit boards if I'm above 20k caps
---
I definitely get the ‘scroll down/scroll up’ issue on PS4, it’s really irritating.
---
Well so much for that event
---
Hit and miss for me... sometimes it's really good... sometimes really dire...
---
Yes, it is bugged. For difficulty, you should be doing the killing blow, but when I soloed it her the way back, that also didn't count. Good luck soloing her now.
---
I struggle for ammo honestly, go i'm frequently farming acid, steel and lead and crafting it. Gives me something to do so not sure if I'd be up for just scrapping old ammo. That said, having a perk like "ammo smithing/crafting" or something allowing you scrap say 100 10mm rounds into 20-30 .45 rounds or something. 
---
I'd like to be able to "mod" ammo, so having incendiary rounds, buckshot, armor pen etc.
---
I'm on PC unfortunately but thanks for the offer!
---
Bastard. All I’ve gotten so far are shite laser and pipe weapons.
---
Started yesterday too and have zero idea what’s going on but I’m happy just wandering around like in the other fallouts. 
---
Played for and hour or two and met maybe 6-7 people all of them nice. Had one guy in stealth pinging the ground around me with a laser. Fired a couple of shots at them and we ended up just waving and going our separate ways.
---
Even stuff like berets. Heck, I'm going to puke for mentioning this, but even goddamn GTA Online tacticool-style outfits would probably be good.
---
Don't get me wrong, Online is a piece of shit but the choices you get with clothes are amazing.
---
Just regular bugs now.
---
 [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Does the type of weapons you have in your inventory effect the roll you get on dropped legendaries and the purveyor?
---
Purveyor is a good idea, but I think player vending has taken something away from the game, it seems a lot less survival now, I no longer have to grind for junk ammo or meds. For new players it's worse I think.
---
It would have been better if you couldn't fast travel to them, would feel more special finding one.
---
Light Wood Laminate. Fuck the bag!
---
Have to hunt helms
---
Technically plans don’t exist, but, you can learn to craft them, by scraping helms
---
I would make sure you are deleting the my documents/games folder as well as the install folder. Start from scratch completely. 
---
You could also try installing on another HDD, if you have one with space. 
---
Short of that...it's a known mod issue and just deleting the .ini should have sorted :(
---
300 may seem like a fair price to you, but for me to accept anything less than what I can get from a vendor would just be stupid. I'm not a charity.
---
You could go through with that, or you could tie one to the roof of your car and drive to the cheating whore.
---
I found someone selling a lot of 1\*, a lot of below max level, doubtfully desirable legendary effects on weapons and armor for 3-4k caps each. Serums for 5k caps. They were even hanging around and circling me emoting ??? why I haven't bought anything most likely.
---
In the best of times, I bough a max level 3\* Furious FFR Agi Handmade for 1300 caps or so (to replace my 1\* Furious Handmade). Best deal so far.
---
Yes, a Finnish Winter War, how fun. Homeland advantage!
---
I got rid of grounded to be able to use energy weapons and I feel so much squishier because of it
---
Hey to each their own.
---
Basically the same way an explosive flamer works
---
What Mr. Bandit?
---
My two shot explosive lever action takes out any enemy faster than any explosive, anti-armor explosive or two-shot explosive shotgun I own. It doesn't matter if it's a double barrel, pump or combat shotgun. They use to be a perfect boss weapon or back-up guns, but now they're not practical for anything. I run a sneak build in every Fallout game and and I tried a straight sneak/crit build to no avail. I'm only keeping my shotguns in hope Bethesda stops listening to the whiners in pvp and people that don't have better weapons.
---
114314 remember
---
Based on my experience and reports from others, it does increase the chances you get the same type or same legendary effect. For example, if you have an Anti-Armor handmade and nothing else, you'd likely get Handmades or Anti-armor rolled more often (1:25 for the type and 1:11 for the effect). Unfortunately, recent pickups and the previous purveyor rolls can have this effect, skewing the results away.
---
Is there anything that does not have a bug attached to it in someway in 76?
---
Again, that's on you. There's been plenty of evidence that shotgunners can do fine, it's just they need to change the playstyle of just 'run and shoot'.  It overall just sounds like you're focusing too much on the EXPLOSIVE modifier, which is known to do 20% of the base damage of a weapon, so it makes sense a lever action would do more damage than a shotgun, considering the modifier has to do the damage of 7 pellets, not a single bullet. Dunno how you're telling me "They're not practical" when they do just fine as a sneak build, save for, again, the double barrel.
---
Cool, I did not know this. I’m gonna have to purge some of my crap weapons now. Do you know if weapons stored in stash also affect this?
---
I know exactly what you mean; the strategy I use in situations in which invisible ghouls or floating horizontal ghouls are attacking is to swing my 2H melee weapon rapidly in as many directions as I’m able for as long as it takes (typically about 30 seconds to a minute) for all the attackers to die. Then I’ll pop a stimpak or two, listen for additional incoming attackers and brace myself for their arrival. In the golf clubhouse, this usually means the loud breathing of the Wendigo, en route to my position by the baby carriage close to the sleeping bags. On a slightly different note, when you see dust clouds appear on the ground while being attacked outside from invisible enemies, best to GTFO of there quick! 😰 (this happened at the mole miners area jogging distance from the Whitesprings train station..
---
The responders don't like explosions, cmon man everybody knows this.
---
On that note any known spawn points?  I've only come across  like 3 of them and I can't for the life of me recall where.  I kind wish I knew someone who could craft them so I could scrap a few to learn it.  I did somehow learn the shadow paint but  I'm evidently not in the correct spawn area for them to drop.  Over 900 hours and I just take things as they will come when they come but I kinda like to learn all the plans just for the hell of it I guess.
---
I had a lvl 50 junkie's explosive gatling drop from a bear. Not really into trading but someone who is told me to stick in my vending machine for 1000 caps. Does that seem reasonable? I see prices all over the place for junkie stuff.
---
OHHHHH so it's a mod technically
---
Thanks for the link!
---
Why wouldnt you have tested it on a lesser weapon instead of a good one? Im sure you could have found a junkies with vats and bashing damage or whatever. 
---
Maybe your weapons were duped and bethesda has just fixed the problem, and made you pay for their time.
---
Haha I love whoever this guy is. Hhe deserves a medal or something, like perfectly preserved pie
---
I would definitely buy it for this price. It's worth more......to junkies!
---
Is this their God? l'm interested in joining this church.
---
Considering that a few simple console commands in Fallout 4 allow you to create any item with any legendary property, even normally impossible ones, it seems like a pretty massive oversight that the customer service people can't do something similar. Did the thought never occur to them?
---
Just use Class Freak and you won't notice the -energy damage.
---
Ah ok, shame. Thx for sharing.
---
With luck 10, charisma 3 and WS void of players for like 20 minutes, I can get 10-15 legendary drops. Less than 10% of the time otherwise it is 0..5 drops. ([Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=2122967287))
---
I have never seen an explosive flamer or cryolater, that's why I asked
---
Yep, they function as a combination of extra storage and extra vendors (one for weapons, armor, junk...). It also helps with transferring between my main characters.
---
Have also the right clothes. Great retro golf outfit
---
It’ll be an emote in the Atomic Shop for 1200 Atoms, on sale for a limited time (720 caps: 40% off).
---
When Stash was 400, I had one. Once I started playing again after it was 800, I dropped my mule.
---
The Fireman Outfit is *only* a quest drop. You may be thinking of the Fire Breather outfit.
---
I got the outfit on Thirst Things First, and eventually got the helmet doing Back On The Beat. It's doable!
---
You can sell it for 0, which I what I usually do with 5mm if I remember. Might as well give it to someone who'll use it.
---
How do you even float the vending machine? Asking for a friend......
---
Just a heads up for anyone that makes this mistake in the future, you CAN buy it back, but if you leave the menu then it will completely disappear
---
Eh "We don't have the tools" is an excuse to keep from having to deal with 10,000 tickets. It's software, they can create any item they want. 
---
I haven't played many online games but the other one I've played wouldn't replace items either.
---
It kind of sounds like he was playing the game his way and you just didn't like it. So since he was within game parameters and wasn't being a dick at the time, you're a salty asshole lmao
---
Thanks for the info. I'll keep trying to vend it.
---
Yes, they have a similar effect, mainly after logging in via a similar chance-improving manner. So recent pickup &gt; on hand inventory &gt; stash. 
---
Note though that the larger the drop pool is, you'll still have to get a considerable amount of drops. For example, there could be over 100 armor pieces and 50 ranged weapons in the purveyor's pool. With chance boosting to 2x for two respective items, you'd have to roll 50 times on average for the armor and 25 times for the weapon.
---
Just convinced me to never buy a skin for a gun.
---
Thank you, Ill look around Helvitia, seems like there are a few spots there
---
I've heard Helvitia has a high change for those!
---
Nothing has changed
---
I have believe that it only effects hip fire accuracy. So if you are aiming the shots are unaffected
---
She never gives me anything good.
---
Two-shot weapons are not good in vats fyi regardless of the mutation. If you are aiming it wont matter.
---
I would start a new toon to get them achivements we didnt get from the beta, after that its up to you. I was thinking about doing the same but once I got to lvl 15 i said f..k that im goig back to my old toon.
---
I've had the shots not landing as expected issue. Really frustrating.
---
Yea I will post then on here when I get home tonight!
---
That little raider camp directly next to the top of the World train station tends to spawn one, near the bookcases with the corpses thrown over them
---
Xbox, join me if you can my GT is C411um 13
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, they nerfed it months ago when TSE was the Meta.
---
Haha Iove mine too!
---
thanks, i'll have to make more
---
Thank you! Yea luckily it hardly rains at the north end of toxic valley so I don't notice it too much.
---
I feel there should be a limit but not too small. Hopefully they can get this taken care of.
---
I didn't know they were pushing for infinite storage.
---
Thank you glad you like it!
---
Okay thx, my camp is up there and I've been finding military caps but I'll check that area closer.  I'm always amazed to find something new in an area I'm farming daily on two different characters.
---
If there is a camp at the pond. the bot spawn changes to the other side of the upper train bridge. But, lady Janets is a much better location to farm him. I net about 3 or 4 hlc's a day from that spot if im bored enough.
---
I have had turrets disappear only to find out that they were damaged during an attack and just vanished rather than just lay there broken. However when I went into the build mode they would pop up highlighted then I would go into modify and it would pop up to fix or repair once I did  the repair they reappeared.
---
Honestly I'm just not playing anymore on patch days. It angers me too much and I can't help but count the bugs
---
Ok guys, thx everyone I didn’t know about lady Janet place and come mad about vendor. I am sorry for now.
---
Any info how to trigger him in lady’s place?
---
I know, but damage numbers on that launcher say otherwise
---
It's probably standing on a small foundation piece that floats.
---
Yeah lucky OP has so many of them.
---
That also happens a lot during the junk menu on the Pip-Boy. That highlighted item will jump up or down as soon as you junk something. I've nearly lost some good stuff.
---
Maybe they figured because they nerfed explosives into the dirt they should leave that at least.
---
I sell them for 50 caps each. And that's what I pay. Anything less than that is a bargin, anything more is overpriced.
---
That would be awesome, because on this character I never used VATS. I spend a lot of time in PA and VATS just eats up cores. If I use a gun, it's always ADS.
---
Would it be the same for miniguns and gatlings? I was thinking of those as a ranged option, and stabilized looks like it would be nice for the stagger and armor penetration.
---
Lol over 200 but keep thinking 88 is end game.  
---
Moving a point is as easy as getting one level past 50.  Something you can do in 45 minutes tops.  If that's hard then you need to find an easier game.  Btw much past 100 and we just sit on level ups till a new spec catches our fancy and we buy a bunch of perks or move a special point.  So yeah, it doesnt matter much if you are short a point or still need to pick up a perk at 50.
---
Thank you, you are correct. When looking at my time line in premiere, I think I mistook "5" for .5 due to how premiere has a lot of extra decimals on the time. I'd even say it's probably closer to 5 seconds, which skews it even more in favor of the .50 cal on the long term.
---
I'm not going to lie, I was secretly hoping that the .50 cal would come out on top because 1, I have a really nice B25 with reload speed .50 cal, 2.) I have 200K+ ultracite ammo for it and it absolutely melts SBQ, and 3.) I was sick of everyone telling me the LMG was better despite having a gut feeling when watching others using it vs. queen and a gut feeling about the math and reload times that it was inferior.
---
Thank you for double checking! I will edit my original post with our timeline once I check it and make sure everything is correct.
---
Have you checked super duper to make sure that it's doing 180 x 2, and not 100 x 2 + 80? I have a theory on the super duper procs, because when I did an ammo crafting video a few months back, and even recently, I've noticed that I don't get expected results, even when mass crafting 100K+ at a time. This theory is that Super Duper procs happen BEFORE the extra ammo is added from ammosmith. So instead of getting 180x2 on a super duper proc with ammosmith, we're getting 100x2 + 80. Need to do further testing to confirm though. Easiest way would be to empty inventory of all ammo and do single crafts, emptying ammo each time, until we get a super duper proc, and then seeing if it's 280 or 360 ammo made.
---
As far as I know it doesnt effect ads, maybe a little down range but you shouldn't notice it too much.
---
I think it's quite complicated to implement, and likely we will never see such feature.
---
Depends on the enemy. With spongy enemies, FE can get up to 50% bonus damage after the 10th hit which is more effective than ignoring 50% armor.

This damn bug is in like every UI element. Hell it used to drive me up the wall back in Skyrim!
---
Please don't mention being able to decorate with objects found in the game, it just makes us sad.
---
take one of the power plants and craft some fusion cores
---
That would sound logical but this is bethesda so no double damage on two shot fat men, auto launchers, broadsiders or m79's
---
Am I the only one who found him first time in the first spawn location I checked...?
---
Number one for me: even moderate use will cause the highlighted item to *not* be the item under the cursor, which it should.
---
Can confirm 2 and 3 on my side, both on PC and Xbox..
---
Surprised you weren’t downvoted for explaining that it’s unconfirmed
---
Lol. I’m still waiting for so many stars back from the vendor. Hasn’t exactly been addressed promptly.

It’s still an item-based game without item integrity.

---
Yep. It's crazy how they are so bad and complicated on PC, too.

Latest favourite of mine is how function of space(jump, activate in menus) depends  on which side of screen you are when using your own vending. There's only a resemblance of consistency.
---

---
That's more like an inconviniece. It's a sync error. The item you are trying to buy, isn't there anymore. If there's several units of the item, you can try to buy fewer. But if you can't buy any, they are gone, and there is nothing to fix.

Pink hat is typically in the office just inside the main entrance

---
I prefer farming nuke zones for flux.
---
Yup. That’s all I can do for now. Thanks. How’s the blue look?
---
Even if pvp wasn’t at all a part of this game tse weapons were too strong. No discussion. The balance they were going after was not being achieved.
---
All server RNG. On one server I’ll get 1-2 legendaries on a WS run. 
---
Hop servers and on the next run it’s like every other ghoul is legendary.
---
Why don't you not be a mutant then you can have normal accuracy and not worry about it... DOWN WITH THE RISE OF THE MUTANTS!!! sike yall play anyway ya want I got nothing useful to add here haha
---
Which oddly enough about a patch ago, the scrip recycling menu tends to close itself at times.
---
Then?
---
Each silo requires an 8 digit code, so there are 24 total individual key codes that need to be obtained from the ghoul officers. But to answer your question, you would just need the one code for the silo of your choosing.
---
Could you please explain why that is?
---
God. Seeing the word META for a fallout game makes me wanna cry.
---
Ok thanks, that's gonna make tonight's mission a hell of a lot easier
---
Archer and swimmer
---
Swimmer you need to revive someone in water, but you can normally post for help on here
---
Ask the game designer. It just dont work properly. Think is has to do with the fact that 2 bullets shoot for every one.
---
I found a broken deluxe at a vendor in white springs more than once. Found the tourist whilst doing path to enlightenment a few times, also found them slumped over a bench at the giant teapot a few times whilst doing the vent there. For me they always seem to be tied to an event at that location. Well the ones I've found anyway. I haven't ever seen them at any of the monuments or the water park..
---
Hunter is pretty easy also.
---
It doesn’t though. You can see the damage change for a split second if you release aim and open the pipboy.
---
Absolutely, it just gets boring with so many people who dislike or it seems hate Fallout 76 and BGS still loitering on this sub whining.
---
My recommendation/advice, find a sweet deal for the game code and give it a try, you may be surprised at how much fun you can have, even if it is not perfect, not much in life is perfect :)
---
I bought it last November for about $20.
---
THIS is exactly how it is, they can if the wanted to, they could in Fallout 4, so it's a white lie to stop getting a lot of work since this seems to happen all the time in Fallout 76...
---
The crossbow is my big problem at the moment, am I able to craft them or if not, where are some spots to find them? I sold my last one for some very needed caps
---
That’s kind of what he’s asking...
---
To launch a nuke you need a nuclear keycard, and the 8 number decrypted silo code. You can either decrypt the code yourself by using the wall in the enclave to do a keyword cipher, or if you want to skip the headache, you can always look up the weekly launch codes online at nukacrypt.com. If you look up the code you only have to get a keycard, you don’t actually have to collect any of the actual code pieces off of officers since you’re just getting the code online.
---
just saying that you can craft them there instead of paying 150 caps or having to go search for them
---
Isn't this already possible?
---
- Drop all unused ammo
---
- Capture the Hemlock Holes workshop and build acid collectors
---
- Put on excavator PA and head to Lucky Hole mine and Hornwright Testing Site #2
---
- Make 5k+ ammo of any type
---
- Takes literally 5 minutes?
---
Archer and Mammologist - Swimmer is easy too but you need someone to kill themselves in water for the review.

does having unstable isotope and electrically charged still trigger pvp when you're on pacifist mode?
---
Crossbow plans can be found near the Archery range at the pioneer camp.
---
Can you get a screenshot of the weapon now? Bloodied plus 90% weight reduction is an impossible combination alone so that screenshot alone should be sufficient proof for them to see SOMETHING went wrong.

Nice to know, i thought it was just some made up currency :)

Way too many of them if anything.

Enjoy, friend! It is quite the experience imo. Feel free to reach to me if you would like the assistance on PC. Same username as here.
---
The plans for raider armor are a mix of savage divide quest rewards (for sturdy) and doing "signal strength" quest (not guaranteed drop for light/heavy). Its the only place those six plans can appear currently. Or at least that was the datamined loot pool location around patch 6 or 7.
---
I've only looted two explosives since beta, but so far have gotten 3 from the purveyor out of maybe 20 total items from her. I don't know about anyone else but she seems to favor Gatling laser/plasmas for me, even though I have never used a heavy weapons build on this toon.
---
Ah, thanks for the offer but I'm on ps4. Got some friends that are keen to help so I'm gonna do some tadpole badges while I wait. Thanks again though!

RNG I guess, for me it just does its thing, I drink or sit in dirty water to drop health.
---
I can offer all my caps on both my toons for it. Ehaich sady is only about 8k

My Junkies Explosive Handmade sold for 1700 caps yesterday.
---
This has been my experience as well.  As soon as I get something I don't want it's put in the scrip machine.  
---
I like Instigating effect so I tend to get a bunch of those.
---
As dumb as this sounds, have you tried removing the paint?
---
Yeah I do the same thing most times, specially with the toxic goo from West Tek that gives you a good chunk of rads. However when I'm at my CAMP and don't feel like traveling to West Tek or drinking 50 L of dirty water, I just jump from the top of my CAMP and God it's really annoying when this happens.
---
I saw the lemonade vendor down there
---
Two Shot has crap accuracy already.  IMO just run Class Freak and a slew of mutations - so worth it!
---
That's kinda my point though, that it seems lazy and shortsighted. Item replacement for things that are decidedly the fault of the engine is the easiest and lowest effort customer retention a company can do. Hell, as an example Blizzard has a completely automated system that allows you to restore any item that was lost within a certain time frame. It's not tough and buys a tremendous amount of good will.
---
Will have to quickly drop the card, self harm then put it back in :)
---
A dev or admin can most certainly replace missing items. It’s the call center grunts that don’t have the tools to help.
---
Is that when u level up u get to move 1 instead of a perk point?
---
Thanks for the info
---
They won’t, according to support they have no way to recover lost items.  Had a vendor transaction go bad after the vendor machines lost.  There policy is no
---
Item recoveries.  It does seem pretty easy to send an admin into the dev room, grab a gun then join your game.  I imagine it wouldn’t scale very well to the number of lost item reports they must see.

Wood.

I've thought about it. I basically have a "go big or go home" attitude. If I'm just going to dabble in a few, I don't want to spend the points. But if I could take most or all, then it would be worth it. I've been hoarding ones I find at camp vendors, just in case (Healing Factor, Adrenal).

I AM THE LORD OF NO CLASS!! NO MUTATIONS!!! but play as you like... I use almost EVERY GUN and round I pick up.. switch my perks out IF NEEDED or I just want to.. although I dont play survival cuz I hate people
---
Cool will try again today. I'm pleased that others have been able to do it. It is one of the few things in the game i haven't done yet so
---
archer and codebreaker.
---
Does it shoot explosive bullets still? If so its probably just a naming mistake caused by the skin. If not f*ck Bethesda.
---
I imagine this can't be done with the *current* way inventories are managed in the game because it would be too taxing on performance.
---
Notice how when you view any inventory you get this delay as your client polls the server for contents? This perk would have to constantly do that for every inventory of any sort within X range, which would be taxing on the server.
---
Snazzy...I'm sure I paid too much for it but whatever.  
---
1K wasn't too bad with how many times I server hopped...
---
Think I've more than made up for it with the multiple Brown I've found.
---
Still need that Pink
---
When i brought my two PS4 to my parents, i couldn't talk with mother or brother, cause they were stuck on FO76 till night.
---
For right people, this is extremly LAN-party capable.
---
I hate going for drops so if I found them in the world, they're free, but if a player gave it to me or I bought it, 25 caps.
---
Near 1700h and got a few explosive, a few two shot. Never together though.
---
Yeah I sorta missed by accident and not enough people came
---
I think the default reload time is 5 sec on heavy weapons, and that -20% from the serum makes it around 4 sec.
---
Also, im using B25 .50 too, almost in every situation now, and its just melt down everything. The LMG starts with the big dps burst, but after you empty 2 magazines, the .50cal starts to get away with the sustained damage, and its just gaining more over time. The LMG probably better in PVP scenarios, but definetly has his drawbacks in PVE. It also a bit weird, that the reload times are the same, because it should be faster to change a lighter 75 rounds mag, compared to the heavier 250 rounds. Not that im complaining, im perfectly okay with the balance of the ballistic heavy weapons right now.
---
I will definetly check into the super duper later on when im in need of ammo, but even with that rate its still efficent to make .50cal rounds.
---
It's clearly possible, and that can be fun :) 
---
To plan your trip you can look which type of build (heavy, shotgun, melee, sniper, ranged / VATS/Stealth/Power-Armor) is good for each of you :).
---
Your post is *A N G E R Y*. But I do agree, I'd prefer a focus on QoL and bug fixes rather than changes that are "nice" but take much longer to get live.
---
&gt; for me to accept anything less than what I can get from a vendor would just be stupid. I'm not a charity.
---
Here in lies the problem. If you can get it from a vendor at 500, why would anyone go to you at 500 (or worse in a lot of cases I've seen)? Why not go to the vendor where it's reliably available at 500? I would have thought it'd make perfect sense to sell at a lower price to, you know, compete with the vendor.
---
While I get exploits are a thing, the examples of stuff I've purchased are from people who I know haven't exploited. For the one serum recipe, I have no problem setting the price at 300. 
---
Also whose to say all those 500 cap sellers aren't exploiters too? Nothing really.
---
I mean, set the price to whatever you want to. However, let's not pretend that when something was available quite readily at 300 caps before player vending and the same product is selling for 500 caps post vending, with nothing affecting the cost of the materials used to make the serums, that the 200 average hike in price is little more than a profiteering cash grab.
---
You either compete or you don't. If you can readily sell at 500, go ahead. There are plenty of poorly informed buyers out there. The more savvy people know that you can buy it with not a lot of effort well below 500.
---
The inaccessible door contains a space suit and helmet, unless you’re referring to the areas locked in the center of the space station.
---
The few is simply Marsupial and Speed Demon - then you don't run Class Freak.  If not then go full monty for the most part - I would still avoid Electrically Charged and Plague Walker...  that stuff can get you into sticky situations like aggroing Whitesprings robots and such.  Not crazy about Healing Factor myself - but I know a lot of people like it - I just want my chems at full strength.
---
In any melee build you want Twisted Muscles and Scaly Skin.  Add Talons too if you plan on unarmed.  Bird Bones is a great complement to just about any build with Marsupial and Speed Demon.  Class Freak allows so many options with mutations its hard to do without it.
---
Any tameable creatures?
---
I didn't know you could choose wich perk cards you wanted. Had more than enough Charisma on that one, RIP first failure character.
---
Yeah, I would think a handmade would go for at least that. In fact I would trade my two star gatling for a one star handmade with a decent prefix, or a crap 1st star and explosive.
---
No that's an accessible area, that requires a code to enter. There is another door that seems to lead to more spaceship buried underground, but there is no way to open
---
can you play together right from th beginning or do you have to complete some kind of requirement first?
---
If he can find the deathclaw trader,then there cannot be tamables
---
I literally have no armour underneath my power armour so I’d last 5 seconds against something stupid like a radroach
---
I use a three star explosive handmade and Fixer as my day to day. I’ve had two drop at Whitesprings.
---
2☆&gt;3☆ weapons. The third effect will rarely be worth it, and a 2☆ weapon costs only 50 scrip.
---
There’s a bunch of these spots all over the map. There’s one right below the Crevasse Dam in the Mire, super close to the spawn point. There’s one in the middle of the path for the Free Range even in the Mire as well. And there’s another near Charleston Station that you can check out while server hopping for the rare resonder vendor.
---
The one below Crevasse Dam seems to spawn the body with Halloween costume plans a lot, as well as plenty of other interesting stuff. I tend to server hop this one while looking for Strangler Bloom.
---
The queen no longer scales based on the number of players present since P8 and has only a flat 30% incoming damage modifier, that is, 70% of incoming damage is simply ignored by her (then the 300 DR comes into play). 
---
I haven't seen indication that more players attract more regular mobs either, in fact, the more the merrier due to higher chance of legendary mobs on the ground. I'd say lvl 20s can help with the regular mobs to aggro them away from the damage dealers and perhaps be able kill those annoying bugs that keep chipping us away.
---
That sucks, this bug shows up in any type of menu system and I've had it pop up when doing player to player vending.
---
You can only have either Carnivore or Herbivore
---
Oh god damn. If we *actually had ANY visibility* on what they were working on, what they had turned down, what bugs they knew about, what they didn't. Fuck. I'd use the hell out of a tool like that. I'd add so much information they could basically hire me
---
Got 61lvl deathclaw there, but they are no longer tameable if i read patch notes right.
---
It is open world game, even lvl 200 can go to "starting location", or level 1 can go to level 50location (he will be dying there tho).
---
Best is start together ofcourse, so you can do all quests like party.
---
This did not work unfortunately. If do it this way, I have to make sure, that both switches are off, if I want the door to close.
---
Would pressure plates work better? Do they cut off power by themselves after a bit?
---
Yesterday I scriped some stuff, then went back later to get rid of some more stuff I had picked up and it was still showing the stuff I had gotten rid of earlier. I closed and opened the window a few times to make sure I wasn’t just seeing things.
---
Ah well better luck next time
---
Cram Handmade
---
I have to make a decision to either avoid whitesprings or never be under weight. I cant scrip or sell all the stuff I find fast enough.
---
it would be nice if they gave some ballistic benefit , well it is a helmet for fuck sake
---
NP.  Had a good time killing scorched waiting for Ansel showed up in the parking lot :)
---
Perfect! Thank You!
---
Yepp. Would also like to show my dweller roots.
---
Best option would be if we get under armor plans, get them also as outfits imo
---
Would be a good idea to balance out their overusage. I doubt everybody would use marsupial if their legs were as thick as tree trunks.
---
Based on my personal experience with Murmrgh, I believe her name should be changed to Viagra, since she gives me Wood all the time.
---
Lad, you're not alone.
---
I Had the same Happen to me Yesterday. I Attributed it to me having a free week and the feeling of assured codes of a usual Weekend.
---
I was standing in front of  the keypad, helplessly starting at "Code Not solved yet".
---
Wasted that keycard.
---
And hopped from that Server in shame.
---
Especially raider underarmors would look cool as outfits.
---
i dont understand why this isnt a standard mechanic..
---
Or better yet, let us wear armor over every outfit.
---
I have 2, just for diluted chems.
---
I have 2 normal water purifiers and that keeps me satisfied pretty well.
---
Yeah they were only available in the loot table for the first couple months and energy weapons were shit back them so nobody wanted them and nobody duped them so they are pretty rare
---
Try to tell a player you have left the some stuff is really tough with just emoji things :(
---
It would be awesome for a lan party so long as you're either very patient with allowing everyone to read terminals and such or you don't care at all about the lore and just focus on combat. Either or. A mix of both won't work because it's going to get really frustrating for someone.
---
The other issue may have to do with latency, given that you're all sharing the same internet connection. If it's ok with other online-only games, maybe give it a go. Just bear in mind the netcode for the game is probably poorly optimised.
---
Yeah, super lucky. Dude should play the lottery.
---
This is exactly how I got mine.  I sat on top of the shed shooting at the ISS and kept an eye on the puddle, and sure enough, someone went down there and rushed up to revive them...and saw like 3-4 other people rushing to get there too!
---
Yeah for PC pls... and maybe add it for PS4 as well? And while you're on it - on xbox would be great too.
---
I mean the struggle hits all platforms... *???-Emote* *thumbs-up-emotes* *waving-emote*
---
I found Athlete only at decently high levels due to the areas you have to do the course in.
---
For me, it was Archery, Hunter, Swimming and Mammalogist.
---
For what on earth do you need 17 of them?! I have just 2 and still get water for days ..
---
U rock
---
Sorry to hear that bro :( thanks for the heads up, I applied the skin last night before I quit, I’ll check it after work to see if it happened to me to
---
Oh, 300's not bad at all. 
---
I was talking about the extreme upper limit - for me that's a bit over 1700# when my stash is full.
---
I figured, but thanks for the reply.
---
How do you use those items in your camp? Whenever I drop anything it goes into a paperbag.
---
No problem
---
Well it's not really a LAN party if it's online service. However you can form team and invite your friends or join their world. The game is funnier this way although easier. Also listening to holotapes while talking with other people.
---
I wish it would have self contained worlds where only a select few can roam. Yo play in the true spirit of LAN parties.
---
[Nothing very impressive with the few things I have unlocked so far, but I like the layout](https://imgur.com/a/WAvSAXT)
---
Ok, time to tell them to stop adding stuff to the game and FIX the freaking accounts..!!! too many screwed up accounts for
---
"Customer service does not have the tools to fix this."
---
what BS!
---
Sounds like your codes expired at 7pm like they do every Monday.  Wasnt that you had the wrong code because the week changed, it's that they blew themselves up in your bags.  I had this happen like two weeks ago cause I was sick, high on cough syrup, and not watching the time.  I feel you on the sense of defeat.
---
PLEASE BETHESDA!!
---
Yup, 8am on the east coast and this is the first post from this subreddit on my front page. 
---
Midnight isn't exactly peak hours for Reddit.
---
*am i a joke to you?*
---
Getting downvoted for this request lol. Bethesda wants us to have a good ingame community but the game doesn't have text chat, a basic feature that is missing. Someone raised the concern long time ago that for example people who, for whatever reason, play without sound or disabled people have no way to interact with other players in a fitting way.
---
I kinda feel they just forgot about adding DR to those... then they decided to left ir as it is so it does not look bad...
---
I renamed all my good legendary items to start with a Z - like "z AAE LMG" -  so they all stay at the bottom now.  This has helped me avoid accidental scripping and selling.
---
Lol that's right by my camp
---
Wood 3* armor from the purveyor.....I learned to have scrip available in the machine before trading for 3* armor. 
---
I haven't had wood armor in a bit from the purveyor, I wonder if they removed it or just RNG?
---
And some people just don't like to talk, simple as that.
---
Up vote this.., kill the atom sales. too  many issues..
---
You can't have both, but if you want an opinion on which is best, it's carnivore, hands down. Soups are nice, but  not nearly as nice as foods like Grilled Radstag, Yaoguai Ribs, and Ionized Meat for pure food points. Not to mention for exp boost, you can still use Cranberry Juice, and Cranberry Cobbler, as well as a great deal of foods one might think to be vegetarian, but don't count against it, and of course every prewar food still, so it barely makes a negative impact at all.
---
No, "weak spots" are just that - they allow you to deal critical damage outside of VATS. Shooting muties in the head or protectrons in their arms will do that. Crippling a limb will just apply a debuff, but deals regular damage, unless the crippled limb is a "weak spot" as well.
---
So, you sent 5 hours and 15 mins in the Porta potty, must have been an emergency
---
during a radstorm
---
Cool, what was strangest thing you found there?
---
For me it was corpse of some guy with plan: skiing outfit on him. Didn't know you can get outfit plans this way.
---
I work in IT and frequently rename stuff to z, zz, zzz etc. This didn't even cross my mind for some reason, i'm going to do that for sure.
---
There are several factors I can think of:
---
* **How many 100+ players are on the server.** You'd need at least 3 non-bloodied builds with decent DPS to kill her in time. If I don't see at least 6 people with 100+, I don't launch. If I see a Prime launch and only 1-2 people hanging out I don't join.
---
* **Ammo cost**. With no heavy hitters, it could take up to 2-3k rounds to take her down or 1-2k ultracite rounds and versus weapons. At worst you get 1 violet flux and up to 150 raw violet flux at best, but may not get 15 ingredients each there to stabilize them. With SD, one can get \~20 stable fluxes and at best 1.8k ultracite 5.56 for that, not really evening out. (3 of us 100+ fought her once, no one bloodied and the others were probably not equipped to fight her. Took us 1.5 hours - she glitched out - and 8k regular ammo on my part.)
---
* **No interesting plans**. She drops prime receiver plans (non repeating) and once you got one for your gun, the Ultracite plans/jetpacks are not really worth it. Also she no longer drops serum plans.
---
* **Bad legendary loot**. Even though she is 3\* she disproportionately doesn't drop 3\* items, mostly 2\* in conjunction with the event giving a guaranteed 2\* armor. Out of 54 drops, I got 6 x 3\* (11%) item and 39 x 2\* item (72%); 35 armor pieces (64%) which indicates quite a different distribution from regular drops (7% 2\*, 4% 3\*, 54% armor).
---
Oh no... I feel with you... I have understanding for so much, that's Fallout, but this "pay to lose" issue is unacceptable... :-(  
---
Tell me if I can sign anywhere to support you at Bethesda.. ;-)
---
4 level 50 "mules" is 600 daily script. It helps my gambling addiction.
---
Just the bomb actually, usually there's a couple yogis there that want to play, they can be sneaky little assholes tho. I'll hop it a few times today and report back!
---
Had the space / CAMP budget - was pretty easy cash flow.
---
I think I'll be adding a row of 5 or 6 smalls - unlocked for visitors
---
Your premature bitching is now trending
---
I started “drinking” inert flux after we couldn’t sell it anymore and have maintained farming my 10 purifiers so I can sell the water to bot vendors.
---
I'd buy that.
---
It's always pay to lose lol 
---
Pay to **consume** too
---
Oh right! I forgot you can sell purified water :D
---
Bro, sorry to hear about your losses but have you got any screen shots of your broken shotties?
---
Put them up here so Bethesda might get more serious about the problem.
---
I think you may be onto something.  I've worked in IT for many years lol
---
I had this happen to me and I had my Bloodied Explosive shotgun turn into a bloodied. I think it is something to do with explosives
---
I applied this to my BE shotty last night so folks would STOP requesting it.  I did not check to see if it demoted it. 
---
I.. may take a break from the game for a bit if it did.  It took me a very very long time to get my hands on this thing.
---
I got a kneecapper 10mm pistol on my first FO4 run through that basically broke the game it was so OP.
---
Yeah, the one at this power station is guaranteed to only spawn deathclaws. I would have been fine with that if not for the triple scorchbeast invasion
---
facts, I think I have max tier of good doggy so I can eat that while in power armor.
---
I have one but it's for the new players, my camp is across the street from the Overseers camp. I give away water I end up with so much just from events.
---
Damn bugs
---
Can confirm, also received PA plans from Savage Divide maps too. :)
---
On pc it is nothing short of a nightmare!
---
The location youve chosen is very picturesque, also love the design with the open hole in the top floor etc and the rooms to the side!
---
I found one very very similar on pc, different name, but after I made it back the owner gave me a 3* piece of armour
---
Also there was an extreme parcour course to reach the base
---
I mostly play shotgunner/sniper, but I do keep a .50 caliber machine gun with me for those tough fights. It’s the only heavy gun I use.
---
BTW, speed demon isn't required to use inert flux as water.
---
Agree on the weight = for my build, inert flux weights 0.2, purified water weights 0.35.
---
Wasn't a lot but it would account for about 30% of my daily 1,400 caps
---
I'd suggest just exploring the game world, and doing quests/events as they come by instead of rushing through them. The suggested tier progression in the game is forest -&gt; toxic valley/ash heap -&gt; savage divide -&gt; mire/cranberry bog.
---
No I meant thanks Speed Demon for making me thirsty as fuck all the time haha
---
Holy shit, that was my night last night too. Got 12, I had to count and recount to make sure I wasn't going crazy. 10 of them are one star, the others two star. Strange night to say the least.
---
Does it work if they're crouching? A lot of people crouch at mine for some reason
---
at 4:17 PM
---
It's been like this since launch, so it is intended I guess? And yes, some of the quests require a substantial chunk to be completed to save progress.
---
I heard upvote
---
Thanks for the feedback, one of the issues I had with my first character (melee) is I maxed out strength early on, and I wasn’t able to see what the other strength perks were.... do u guys find it beneficial to max out a stat?
---
Dude yes I wanna raid yo stuff
---
Where was you before I bought 4k worth of 5mm D:
---
I love it
---
Best response here
---
18k of 5mm......
---
*drolls*
---
You need to apply perk points to get other cards to become available.  
---
I've run a new character and get to lv22 and was getting pissed that I wasn't being offered the cards I wanted (rifleman) and it wasn't until I put a load of points into perception that the cards were unlocked, even though I had reached the right level to make the available.  
---
After balling up my first go through, I was determined to use the points right, was a ballache getting to lv22 with all 1s in my special stats!
---
Can't be dropped.. but stored in stash. think of it this way. They weigh tons less than all the components needed to do a repair if you have an awesome weapon. If you want to "Trade" them I recommend this you offer to repair a weapon in trade for X. in this fashion, you might use it as a barter for adhesive, aluminum, copper etc as these would be normal items needed for some repair items.
---
Lol, same issue. I'de look like a cartoon if I where to emty my pockets. Just 10 minutes of throwing bullets, guns, knives and bombs into a pile.
---
What spot is more romantic than near a lighthouse? 😍 I value my privacy so I went up a mountain haha
---
Can you elaborate on the excavator part? Does it do something other PAs don’t?
---
Thanks.
---
Looks like you run into a Purveyor streak. Loot in general, but specifically her, likes to drop similar effects subsequently. For example, my last 10 3\* ranged rolls gave me 4 bashing damage and 2 Mutant's Explosive.
---
2 Ghouls 1 bat.
---
Wearing a full set of excavator PA doubles ore vein yields! :)
---
That's one sick ass black metal cover.
---
Thank You!
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Well, it certainly is now given that I've had about 30 levels with it.  
---
My build is a high str, high agl build, so I go around sneak attacking everything with a 3.5x sneak damage modifier.  I didn't use a build planner and this is my first build so I have a lot of wasted stuff (it used to be a 15 INT build).
---
Oh..... didn’t know that.
---
And you thinks that’s enough to do 5k ammo? Because I can use close to 10k ammo per session.
---
Is it easier to level up after 50? I feel like it’s kind of long grind right now, the double xp weekend helped out a lot but now it feels like it takes a long time to gain a level.
---
To buy more shotgun paint?
---
Oh!  I don't play mutated, so didn't know it made you thirsty(er).
---
I'm 15 Str +2 from PA Servos.  I think the weight reduction perks I have loaded are Packrat3, Throughhiker1, TravPharmacy1.
---
Gatling gun has better DPS than 50 cal and minigun, plus it uses a fraction of the ammo.
---
Besides, then it'll take 10mins hehe
---
The +200 carryweight bonus is the glitch. The armor is supposed to give only +100 carryweight and 50 for each legs with calibrated shocks up to 200 total, not 300.
---
Confirmed.  A friend and I got Charlie to 75% prep and it hung there forever.  A total waste of time and ammo.
---
HMU on Discord when you come on!
---
That's crazy. I hope they fix it for you.
---
I know. That's stated directly in my post.
---
True!
---
But minigun look, sound, animation and bullets flying can’t be topped! :D
---
Yep that's also very true :D
---
Pfft, look at this heretic. Cram master race.
---
Let's all keep bringing this one up shall we, maybe tag the CM's while we're at it 😂
---
Yes unless you are on a team.
---
Yeah I know only getting 100 tho instead of200 when I get out and back in didn't mention 300
---
Well that's resource collecting.. "Farming" is repeatably doing (server hoping/ same ole' mission/event/etc) just to get an item or a chance for an item. Constantly just hitting a certain location for it's particular rewards. Personally I attribute this action to "work" and not just "fun" that's why i'm only level 205 for the amount of time I have in the game.. I got great stuff but all of it is from having fun not working for this/that..
---
Want another? I have plenty! You can have it for free (PC)
---
Damage indicators on explosives are incredibly bugged in this game. It seems to depend per weapon whether or not TS even shows any effect in the pip boy display menu. That display menu is also inaccurate by itself half the time. Look at the unique bunker buster missile launcher, it has a +20% damage boost but in the pip boy it only has 1 more than a regular missile launcher
---
RNG I still got one, gave it to a friend to scrip immediately
---
And I have it CHROMED!
---
WITNESS ME! xD
---
ya, 52 here.. and I agree..
---
They extended the deadline multiple times to give everyone enough time to submit a ticket.
---
Nope they don't, but I'm sure there's more places that have lots of iron veins! There's already wayyy too many lead veins in the Lucky Hole Mine luckily
---
Yea, but they've never shown any more damage on smth like Fat Man and Rocket Launchers, not even before they nerfed TS, it's the first time I've ever seen a rocket launcher with this damage, that's why I wonder. But it seems as if these are valid now. They've also changed that on Auto Grenade launchers
---
To be fair, every game can have a meta.
---
It's a good build with minimal trade-offs. A couple addictions lower strength, so it's a bit better for guns than melee, but it's still a universal 50% damage boost with just a few small SPECIAL debuffs for it. Compare that to bloodied requiring you to be nearly dead for 95% damage, berserker's requiring you to be naked for 50%, or nocturnal only giving 50% in the middle of the night and lowering your damage throughout the day. The only reason junkie's wasn't popular to begin with is that death took away your addictions before the latest patch
---
Today I’ll give it a go, why not?
---
I’m always short on lead, steel or both.
---
Pretty sure they don't have unique ID's for items. Not part of the game's code. Bethesda has no ability to tell a duped item from a non duped item.
---
Mark them as favorite.
---
Tbh I think heavy guns look awful without PA, they’re too big.
---
" **Hey Bethesda could you add text chat in Fallout 76? K, thx, bye** "
---
FTFY
---
Ayy there's a specific route you can take at both locations, I'm sure yt has all the answers!
---
I’m sure you’re right.
---
They had a case of the runs if the hair tie on the controller is anything to go by.
---
I've had disappearing turrets sbd thanks to advice here I was told a fix. Always have the turrets on something. If the disappear store what they were on and then both the floor and turret will be in your stored section
---
A white wolf fedora? Oh no! That's almost as rare as b/e 3 star weapons!
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
The armor only provides a bonus of 100 (+ 50 per leg with calibrated mods). The bonus 200 from the armor on login is a bug, which is why it goes away when you exist and re-enter. While it is good that we bring it up, it will mean that we will lose that extra 100 forever soon most likely.
---
Feel free to do a quick search on the topic in this subreddit if you do not believe me. Lots of posts about this.
---
That doesnt sound like reality. When I see someone in power armor in Survival I already know I will kill them and they dont stand a chance, melee or otherwise. In fact, anytime I see anyone running melee I know how it will end, VATS crit while they are running towards me and me rifle butting them to kill them and take their loot. 
---
Stealth Rifleman/Commando, especially if bloodied or junkied, is the META in survival.
---
Bethesda needs to set the tourist as a static spawn somewhere early in the game. Especially since you need the camera for tons of atom challenges and ever upwards quests. It really made the camera dlc underwhelming.
---
So adding calibrated legs does nothing? Because I got 100 bonus without mod to legs.
---
I have a furious auto grenade launcher, does that actually buff it? Or should I find another one?
---
Bought the skin so I ont accidentally sell or get trade requests for my vamp/explosive flamer ... but now I'm wondering if the skins are really a replace item, and the original is no longer in the loot tables
---
Sweet. I’ll add you now. I’m a whole level 7. Or 8. But we can play together.
---
Yea the thing is these TSE pumps  are so over duped on Xbox I figured a replacement wouldn’t be hard to find,. I see people selling them on the market here on Reddit and they just sit with no responses , so in my opinion it was the perfect Guinea pig
---
Stupid question here - what the heck got you 5000 caps in a porta-potty?
---
What I really notice, nothing really is getting sold unless You do have 3* weapon or armour that someone needs it. Anyone can get junk, meds, stims, chems, plans, outfits etc. The only thing I tend to sell time to time is ammo. In particular 5.56mm and 5mm.
---
Damn thought i had the secret because it worked twice for me but i mustve gotten lucky.
---
The bonus if 50+ from each leg is what shows in your stats page, the 100+ bonus is built in to the excavator suit, it doesn't show as an extra amount.  
---
When you see a 200+ bonus in your stat page when you log in, it's a feature of the armour, it's not a bug at all. Please stop mentioning it or they'll "*fix*" it.
---
The TSE had no worth to me as it so over duped on Xbox and a bit lackluster now thx to nerf ,. I couldn’t believe my eyes when the BE was Reduced down so the TSE was the perfect test in my opinion ,..
---
From what I've read, the broken camera only helps if you've completed the initial quest but lost your camera somehow.  It won't give you the bucket list quest.
---
That said, I've run across the broken camera *soooo* many times.  I completed the quest line long ago, so I don't know if that makes a difference.  But just yesterday, in my short bout of farming, I ran across at least 3 of them.  I think I did a thorough run of WS and the bunker, and a couple clears of Huntersville.
---
Is the New Gorge course the one in the trees?
---
It’s not my second best weapon , TSE is trash
---
I recommend the Text mod, it is great. Fantastic way of meeting people for events, SBQ-fights and good in-game trade. Text mod has been around for 6 months, nobody has ever been banned for texting and playing (though I don't recommend texting and driving).

---
It was pretty meta before. I'm using a shotgun build, and we got hit hard by the nerf :V
---
No
---
OP, for compensation would you rather have your 3* shotgun back or 1000 scrip?
---
Check the map before, you can see player icons.
---
Once you know the areas better and find out what works for you, I believe it is.  Your gear slowly gets better and your spec starts to get tweaked for your playstyle.  Most importantly you get the ability to have more than one perk layout for your special setup.  You can do this to a lesser extent before 50 but after 50 it really starts to shine.  This let's you tweak your strategy to maximize dps or def or ranged or whatever to the area and enemy's at hand.  You also stop caring about your level at some point and start to just relax and enjoy playing.
---
To maximize leveling make sure you sleep in a bed every chance you get, use xp food buffs, and when in a party use inspirational.  For the most part I only really keep up on the sleeping part and still level a couple of times nightly.  And if you're willing to balance risk vs reward survival servers xp bonus is sick provided you can find someplace quiet to kill stuff.
---
This.  I always cringe when people start a sentence by saying “not that I’m racist, or not that I’m homophobic” and the very next phrase is literally racist or homophobic.  I mean, it’s just not necessary.  No need to draw attention to the issue other than if someone was really offensive then just report them.  You don’t have to write an editorial about it.  By the way, I have a daughter that is gay and nothing annoys her more than getting special attention or preferential treatment.  Just treat her with respect and dignity that’s all that counts.

Here is the Mappalachia map of all the random encounters in the game:  
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) 
---
The guys making the Mappalachia maps are awesome!
---
They are completely lying about the "we don't have the tools". Perhaps they might have had an argument about the number of emails they might get if they opened up that box... but seriously...There's like 100 guys that play this game now...
---
Yeah, I want the raider version like the Nuka World obstacle course.
---
you mirror my situation very closely, tho my kids are older now. I too am enjoying the fringe multiplayer aspect of the game but once it becomes a requirement to complete a task, I lose interest. I've already resigned myself to the fate that I can't have a backpack..and that's ok :)
---
I'm level 76 and still haven't nuked, so I've got things to do yet ;)
---
It does not , my hope was it’s a visual bug , so I test fired ,... no more explosive ,..
---
Player vending. By not being logged out he could keep selling while he was off doing other things in the real world.
---
I was referring to Internet Historian, I'm not a nazi lmfao
---
I noticed this last night. Works almost every time I fall from a high place or splash damage myself. Almost never works when I am in conflict with enemies.
---
Yeah don't blame you I don't use it either lol been collecting dust 😄 might as well scrip it.
---
I will buy your 5mm rounds lol
---
I’m sorry to hear about this , and glad to know it’s not exclusive to myself
---
I like sleeping... Which I don't do enough of thank you very much fallout 76 LOL.
---
I agree I am solo and having to pray that , that single even happens and then the single chance someone is face down in a puddle happens is just plain silly! Come on guys!
---
Made excavator armour gives 100 carry weight bonus right from the start.  bought calibrated legs 50 + bonus each so now should be +200 . It is when I log in but if I get out I lose 100 of 200 bonus which kinda says something Is broken.theres nothing for them to take away it just needs fixing so the mods work on top of the starting bonus or what is the point of selling those mods for the armour.
---
If it helps, perhaps you were in the mentality the same as I was until I stumbled on a post the other day.
---
X amount of purifiers don't produce equally, they are essentially storage. So they fill up one at a time. You get the same amount for one that you do for 50.
---
So I now have four after cutting back, which will give the same amount as your initial 17 per hour?
---
Just so we have a cash flow though :)
---
I LOVE the sound of the .308 machine gun.. You know when you hear it.. and...it's like WOW that dude has $$$ because it's so expensive for the ammo to power it.
---
What you looking for for this :)
---
Didn't mean you, but the downvotee :P sorry if that wasn't clear.
---
Still hunting for a weightless one!
---
Bethesda's engine has the worst inventory user interface. It's a tour de force in bad UX.
---
The ultimate in "GET A JOB YOU BUM!" Good God do you people really have all of this time on your hands to waste?
---
Armor provides 100. Calibrated provides +50 per leg. 
---
The extra 100 at login is a bug. At login Excavator gives you 200 bonus (which is a bug), 250 at login with one calibrated leg and at login 300 with both. 
---
If you get out and re-enter the armor the bug goes away and you get the correct amount of 100 from the armor, or 150 with one calibrated leg or 200 with both calibrated.
---
For mine?
---
You're good, I'm kinda dumb
---
Yea i accidently Put a legacy tesla troubleshooter explosive shotgun in my vending machine for 500caps.... didnt notice it until the message popped up that some rando bought it and i went HUUUUH?
---
Deathclaws are still tameable - however they must be at least half your level and as far as I know the albino animals cannot be tamed
---
They definitely have the tools. Otherwise those weekly survival mode challenge legendaries wouldn't exist.
---
Yeah, I know that feeling bro.
---
Had a deathclaws gauntlet I named vanish, then I got the exact same drop hours later so it didn't really bother me
---
I want an instamash brand commie whacker
---
I will share a fun fact about myself so you do not feel bad. When I first started playing, I found someone else's camp far away from mine. I shot down his front door and got a bounty for it. I found his stash box and thought 'Oh wow, I wonder if I can steal all his crap." I emptied out his stash box. I spent a good 10-15 minutes slow walking back to my camp because I was severely from stealing that guys "stuff". I make it to my camps front door and then get killed for my bounty. Bounty killer takes my bag. I then realize I just took all of my own stuff from the other stash box and also lost all of my junk in the process.
---
Keep in mind that most of what I suggested is simply my opinion based on my experience and testing and is most suitable for the only play-style I know very well - mine. It's always important to consider carefully how any suggestion might impact your game-play and make adjustments that you feel are necessary. Worst case, you test it and you don't like it. But, hopefully you will have learned something beneficial to you either now or for later.
---
Assuming that the downside of the Empath mutation is affected by Lck/Class freak rank 3 you will receive a mere 8.25% per teammate of the damage to them (the most recent testing that I know of has shown that the down-side is reduced but a visual bug may still remain in the pip-boy). After getting Lck/Class freak rank 3 I highly recommend that you first ensure that it is in practice working with Empath. You will know if it is working or not. If for whatever reason they do not currently work together I strongly suggest that you abandon the build until they do.
---
Consider the following: If not much has been changed since FO4 (likely, although not guaranteed) the endurance attributes primary benefits are reduced AP drain, reduced chance to catch a disease, and +5HP base per point. The first benefit only starts to show it's value when you increase your AP pool of which you have not done (AGI). Furthermore, you have a mutation which reduces your total AP which diminishes the value even more. The second benefit I listed is trivial for everyone. It is safe to completely ignore nearly all diseases. The 5HP per END attribute point I think speaks for itself. For example, it won't save you from a strong melee attack whereas Str/Blocker most definitely will. Filling out the END attribute more without adding a useful perk card means that you won't be getting much benefit out of those points.
---
Other than Excavator use the PA that you prefer. It was a mistake for me to write what I did without explaining it. It was simply a suggestion based on the highest ballistic resistance PA. The truth is, the difference between T-60 and T-51b will likely be unnoticeable in practice. You will do fine either way assuming that you took into consideration at least these important perk cards:
---
1. Lck/Class freak rank 3
---
2. Str/Blocker rank 3
---
3. Chr/Suppressor rank 3
---
Without Lck/Class freak rank 3 I think that an empath tank build isn't practical. So, at minimum you'll need to work that perk card in your build if you don't want to change anything else. The rest of what I suggested will allow you to more easily go toe-to-toe with the worst that the wasteland has to offer.
---
These ones were not showing up in build mode nor reappearing when 'repairing all', they had simply vanished.
---
Fyi, Get class Freak 3... -75% negative effects on mutations (luck perk card)
---
Right, it saved me from checking them every few minutes...and I could dick around for a few hours before withdrawing.
---
Yeah I really love the look of the BOS officer suit but sadly it be under armor
---
Just run down the hill past the overturned bus
---
I like both, when in Power armor i use .50cal, minigun and gatling and out of Power armor my lmg. I just looks better...
---
It’s easy to do if you aren’t paying attention. I lost two legendary armor pieces that way because I didn’t name them and they were not equipped since I was in power armor at the time. 
---
So aggravating but hey, now I get to find better armor out there.
---
What is not trash?
---
That is super sweet that you get to play FO with your GF. You're very lucky! That makes you the polar opposite of me who prefers to play alone but may not if i truly had a choice.
---
And to add that the veggies most easily cook up as soups. Getting boiled water to make them takes extra time.  I vote carnivore for sure.
---
Yeah been looking for a vamps flamer rosswellalien#2928 on discord
---
If you suck.
---
I have mules for caps.  One of them is dedicated to holding things that I can't use with this build, but may want to use with another build.  And yes - some things are indeed irreplaceable, despite what others try to tell you.
---
Take that haters! We aren’t Pay to Win, were Pay to Lose!
---
Holy crap you're a legend 😂 if there was a /r/gaming TIFU this'd be top
---
i just hate the clunk clunk clunky feeling of PA, i like to speed demon zoom around and jump without slamming into the ground and having to stop because of the ground slam effect makes it so you cant run
---
and in survival PA is a death sentence
---
I accidentally put in my favorite AA/E 50 Caliber and it would not let me get it back. I had other items in there so I tried them and it allowed me to get all the other items back except 50 Caliber. Now it is gone forever. Still emotional about it. Be careful be very careful.
---
Melee seems to be the most common build. With the one or 2 handed perks, incisor, suppressor, tenderizer, and a few others melee gets some insane damage and armour penetration
---
Yeah. I only let it get under my skin for about 5 minutes, then I said oh well F it. What bothers me is I specifically took precautions against it, and still it ate it and would not give it back. Just want others to be aware.
---
I'm hoping the adjustments are just changing something similar to explosive on future drops, and leaves the legacies untouched. Spent alot of caps on mine, as did many other people.
---
All I see here is looking for another "TSE" to blame for deaths in PvP due to lack of skill.
---
if you favorite a legendary and go to scrap it for scrip, does it prompt you like it does when trying to sell it to a vendor?
---
yeah this happens to me too, but only on some servers, other times its fine, but when it is bad, its all the things you desribed
---
im on  Ps4 btw
---
Never encountered this on console so it seems like it’s PC only.  Unfortunate that it’s a potential issue at all.
---
That is true also lol, but the space needed for large purifiers is ridiculous :/
---
I start all mine with ZEE. ZEE TSE Gatling, ZEE TSE Lever action. i still sold my ZEE AA/E 50 Cal.  Dammit man.
---
Cool, thank you.
---
What should my SPECIAL look like? Should I go with Stealth as well? I figure that will make it easier to solo?
---
Unarmed melee outside power armor. But in power armor is 2handed melee.
---
iF yOU sUcK
---
Yes it does
---
i have gig fiber hardwired, and all other games perform just fine
---
the issues Op describes happen to me only on certain servers, i simply server hop, and its not as bad on a  different server usually
---
so its Bethesda's programming and wonky servers, not the internet connection
---
Oh my. I put it on my TSE pump and it was fine while I played. But I haven’t been on since so now I’m scared
---
Weapon skins, where are them?
---
I can't wait for all the glorious different ways the sanctity of my mother and my lineage in general to be questioned.
---
If the internet was populated by grown ups sure, but it isn't.
---
Text chat would devolve quickly into a way to harass and troll other people.
---
Sorry but, I'm gonna use what I want, and I liked them before they were cool. When they broke even faster and sucked damage wise. My BE railway, gauss, handmade, as well as my AAE weapons kill just as fast, some faster against high energy resist enemies. The handmade is just as good. The laser has range and that's it.
---
Y'all just want another thing to blame for your PvP sucking. And I promise I'll kill ya just as fast with my handmade.
---
I'm leaving them in the locker at the pylon site now. I do not want another fedora
---
I don't know so much. Without getting into immersive arguments that would suggest if you are able to kill everything then there really isn't any point. I mean fear would be a staple of "really" living in a post-apocalyptic world. I mean if scorched people REALLY existed they'd scare the lunch out of you. ...and not in a funny way. Here they're just a nuisance.
---
Yup, I know this, which is why I favorite and name as many of my valuables as I can. It was favorited, and named. . . And for whatever reason (which I've been noticing a lot of lately), it was unfavorited and reverted back to default name. Unfortunately I did not notice this until it was too late. Later on after this debacle I noticed I had random armor and weapons that had become unfavorited as well.
---
Any point to not using PA? Sorry, like I said I haven't played in forever so if the question is dumb, please tell me why lol.
---
Why "disappointed"?
---
in fissure sight prime during the queen fight
---
Any item disappearing, is still an item disappearing.
---
I don't even understand why so many ppl build here. All I can think is proximity to a vendor, which really shouldn't matter at this point.
---
Just remove all legendary effects when player fight player, problem solved. 
---
No more daily requests like ‘mama mama i got one shot by someone using that boomstick, i don’t know where to buy it so can you ask Bethesda to get rid of it so I can one shot those assholes again’ 
---
Rely on your reflexes and strategies and fight like a man, not a competition between different ebay guns and duped armors.
---
Nobody has to rely on these. I guarantee that anybody with one has a BE handmade waiting to swap if a nerf happens. Complainers will keep complaining.
---
Yeah I'd get onto support if I were you, do you have screenshots?
---
No thanks. Next.
---
I would call you “The Collecter” Build. Looks like you hoard a bunch of stuff and don’t like to damage things much. Lmao.
---
Stealth would probably help yeah but idk how well melee and stealth work together, like if you'll be able to sneak up close enough, I've just never tried it cuz I'm not melee
---
Another good one is sniper, stealth definitely helps with that, and you can take most enemies out in a couple of hits
---
LOL clearly you don't suffer from the hoarding gene I inherited from some distant pack-rat. Getting from one side of the map to another is a major event for me!
---
Shelf that attitude mister.
---
My Gatling's each weigh around 2. I carry so many because they can break easily.
---
Cool, what would a good Sniper build be?
---
Yes it is.
---
Deathclaws don't regenerate though so you must have some pretty fast, constant killing moves going on. Wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley. :)
---
Bring back real raiders, the vaults are open.
---
Average carry weight of unmodded PA is about 250. A complete set of excavator pushes this to 350. Add a pair of calibrated legs and you're up to 450. When you log in wearing the excavator it glitches and turns the extra 100 into 200, taking you up to 550 (ish).  That +200 is what shows up in your stat page, the 2 X 50 is separate and is shown on your apparel page.  
---
When you get out of the armour, or die,  and get back in, the armour uses the correct extra weight settings, extra 100 (200 is a glitch) for the complete armour set and 2 X 50 for the calibrated legs.  
---
Or do you mean that your calibrated legs aren't registering?  
---
What is your total carry weight, with and without glitch?
---
No idea. Like I said, I don’t really use PA much.
---
You can't buy serums from a vendor for 500. Are you daft?
---
&gt;You're saying to improve game performance, Bethesda should spend time and money creating a whole separate "database", by which I assume you mean storage server, exclusively for people to store unnecessary items? How is that better than dedicating more infrastructure to the existing system(s)?
---
Dude come on, it's not that hard or expensive. It will improve the quality of the game and keep high level players interested, otherwise you collect all that you want and have nothing left to achieve. Keeping more players means they can sell more Atom shop items so it will even pay for itself over time.
---
It's more efficient (and cost effective) to split the data apart and query it separately than it is to attempt to beef up one system to handle it all. Especially if those items are not needed by the players 90% of the time, why have the server have to query through all that all the time.
---
All this when people are already asking for stash size increases and you should see how this is the preferred solution for both performance and can grant more than just a 200 stash increase.
---
&gt;By definition, there's no such thing as a "separate database that doesn't have to be queried." Literally the only way to access something stored separate from your machine would be querying or physically connecting to the storage media. For it to truly not "be queried" the "database columns and rows," as you've described, would have to exist physically on your machine, thereby available for alteration.
---
You are setting up a strawman argument here, of course it gets queried, but not by players on the game servers, thus not impacting the live game. It's accessed only from the main menu.
---
That's the kind of thing i wish I could capture on vid. Maybe Beth should consider a camcorder next?
---
Good to know - I have been needlessly frightened that it wasn't the case and too scared to try hahah
---
The most expensive item I have seen in a vending machine was a suppressors’ black powder rifle with extra bash damage, priced at 20000 caps. I’m sure someone will eventually buy it.
---
What I was thinking also. . . For my $$ your missing the Heavy Gunner Perks under STR, and One Gun Army under Luck at the very least. I'm heavy gunner as well, so there's probably a bunch of others I 'd recommend, but I don't really know exactly what you're going for.
---
Get a full set of unyielding armor to buff your stats and you wont need all the carryweight perks maxed.
---
I agree with you about the fleeing. if we could just waltz up to anything and kill it, the game would be boring.
---
I've noticed myself randomly unfavorited weapons/armor...thought with the weapons maybe I dumped into my STASH for some reason but the armor never leaves my body.
---
Why leather? Not combat or marine?
---
Yeah, it's super annoying
---
Huh. Maybe they changed it?
---
I think it was intentional.  If they gave DR to headwear, there would be different values to them and everyone would be running around with the same optimized one.  With no DR to headgear, everyone is free to customize and be different without Bethesda having to code hidden headgear.
---
That's what I said, however without the alternating capital letters.
---
Try using some battle tactics instead of charging in with power armor. Maybe then you can fight against the good weapons.
---
Technically vats is not aiming, it’s you asking the system ‘please aim this gun for me’, so it doesn’t count.
---
Two Shot explosive shotguns ,.. they are a dime a dozen on Xbox
---
Well damn, hope I wasn't missing out then. I did an angry emote so they might have thought I rage quit or something
---
Same here, wife and sprogs to distract me, main character is lv135, only just joined the enclave! No rush.
---
F -Squared
---
You can get all crazy sorts of armor that are way more beneficial to use than pa. The only benefits of pa are carry weight and rads, but if you wear full unyielding, you only get more carry weight in excavator armor... wear full unyielding weapon weight redux though and you can carry a goddamn arsenal!
---
I use a pipe bolt action rifle because it's effected by both the 3 rifleman perks, and the gunslinger perks so it boosts the damage a lot. Concentrated fire, stealth perks, and I have luck maxed out for the critical attack bonus perks
---
As a shotgun collector I’d rather have the BE pump,... had 2 at one point but traded the second,.. womp womp womp 😑
---
Well Im working on rifle perks so don't really have enough DPS to kill one quickly and I always seem to encounter once when the weapon is at half health lol
---
Lucky!
---
Sweet
---
Wow, I'm a PC player and I just figured it was a crappy menu port to PC that caused the scrolling up / random selection in the menu issue.   Crazy it's on all systems.
---
not going to judge this, but, there's a LOT in there that you flat out dont need. Or rather,
---
a LOT you could swap out as required. (like the perk for gun breakage. yes 5,but thro your duplicates away )
---
They're having to go in a new direction. It's still got the background fallout story (spoiler : vault-tec are wankers), but just living in that environment constantly would be a grind.  
---
The vending, scouting, brewing and photography are great fun distractions that the players can mould to their own liking.
---
This sounds awesome. Any chance you can show me the full build?
---
I will hop in before work and take SS , for anyone on Xbox my Gt is SickDreyke you should be able to view my recent captures
---
I got the backpack on my own without organizing to meet anyone.  It's not impossible and didn't even really take any special planning, just being aware of other players around you during events.
---
I'll happily take one off your hands, but i'll give you some caps for it :) - or an item of choice from my vendor. 
---
You online tonight?
---
I can take a screenshot when I get on in a bit no problem, I'm newish to Reddit how do people share pictures around here?
---
I’m not OP mate lol
---
Yeah there's stuff in there I keep on just because I use it regularly, like ammo Smith.
---
Yup. That gun had never left my person since I bought it. . . Back in like January or February. So much for that now lol.
---
Alright, Variks.
---
Bethesda nerfed the shotguns before releasing the skin, then they nerfed them again with this skin. They REALLY hate shotguns 🤮
---
So like a low HP build? Being low on health all the time makes me nervous.
---
Didn't have much choice.  Came home from work the Monday after launch and she had been playing my copy of it all day after watching me play it all weekend and I knew if I didnt get her a copy i would never get to play it again lol
---
As much as I enjoy playing with her though sometimes after a long day I like to unwind by solo questing and grinding so I get your desire to lone wolf it and so far this game has been very fun to do both.
---
I believe there's another one outside of Abbie's bunker.
---
I just upload mine to imgbb and toss a link out.
---
This isnt a min maxed build in anyway, it looks more like something you would use while leveling up, before you decided what spec you wanted to move into. I mean that with all due respect, but this doesnt appear as though you have even begun the process of min/maxing.
---
If you're on pc, ill take it off your hands :D
---
I don't really want to be a mix/maxer, I think that's shitty to other players
---
No, the players would be shooting at and around the other player talking to the NPC to try to get them to hurry up.  They wouldn't be able to do any damage, of course, but it is annoying as fuck.
---
Alright thanks :) I'll figure it out aha
---
Weapon Artisan rank 3 should help immensely with that. I carry multiple GG's too. But not for breakage reasons. For situational use.
---
I submitted a ticket ,...10 hours later the sun is up and shining and my inbox is empty
---
This happen to me. I accidentally put in my AA/E 50 Caliber with other items.  I tried to retrieve it and it would not let me. It would let me get the other items back just not the one I wanted back.  The AA/E 50 caliber was at the top of the list not sure if this had anything to do with it. I was pissed.
---
Someone else did. I’ll have more later . Username is the same as my psn though
---
I wish they had a recipe for pemmican or just plain old jerky. About the only thing I carry around anymore is ionized meat.
---
They REALLY want to nerf the shotguns...
---
While the DMV quest is the most known example, several quests don't save progress at minor steps but only at what the quest considers major resolved quest steps. Which is impossible for us to know which is which. I always try to complete started quests before logging out. If possible.
---
Sounds eerily similar to my situation.
---
&gt;Final step before launch is a secret unlock code for the missile. 6 character digits, 16 possible characters per digit. 17 million different combinations so the code cannot be brute forced (in a reasonable amount of time). I wasn't clear whether this secret code matched the authorization code provided in step 1 or was tied to it in some way, but that makes the most sense. Secret code is provided to the silo for that specific missile, code is authenticated using information inside that silo that is only available to individuals who know the safe combination to get the keys to decrypt the launch code.
---
A minor correction: a launch control center actually has control over 10 missiles (not a single missile), so the authenticated key turn, depending on the activated war plans, could send up to 10 ICBMs flying.
---
You’re awesome for posting and reporting. If users want to be weird about it, that’s on them, but the majority appreciate the heads up.
---
I swap in weapon artisan when repairing. I switch weapons for situational use too, e.g. a hunters Gatling for SBQ and an executioners Gatling laser for when she gets low.
---
yes yes it does.
---
Hell yeah! According to the story those puppets where mass produced after all. Boxes of them, one could say. Man, I would pay Atoms for this.
---
I recently made the switch to the minigun and I'm floored by how quickly you go through that stuff. I'm in the process of transitioning from a rifle build to a heavy weapon build, so I know when all is said and done I'll be able to do more with less ammo, but still. 
---
Little things that didn't matter with the rifle build (missed shots, "only" having 200 rounds of ammo, etc.) are a HUGE deal with the minigun.
---
More specifically, it's mouse/keyboard only. I don't think this issue can be replicated with a controller (the cursor disappears for me on PC). Moving the cursor is crucial to reproducing this issue and other UI issues.
---
Man you're absolutely delusional. The BE laser unlike all other weapons doesn't function as intended giving it a massive damage and insane range and accuracy. I understand it's the only thing keeping relevent in PvP and augmenting your shit aim but it's a bug and bugs should be squished regardless.
---
As mentioned in another comment, if you mark them as favorite it will prompt you and ask if you're sure you want to sell an item marked as favorite.
---
I play melee, no mutations.  
---
Made L94 over the weekend.
---
Challenging at times, but quite fun, IMHO.
---
Use a weapon with +1 strength
---
If Bethesda has any ability to detect and remove or alter duped items they would have already done it. Duped items are perfectly safe as long as you don’t have a million of them sitting on your mule.
---
I have a bloodied mr. handy buzz blade with +1 strength. Any other suggestions?
---
When will you be on
---
there’s +1 strength weapons that increase when equipped, not sure of much more
---
You need to go to Sutton and find a metal tub. Then head to Morgantown and find a rooftop with a radroach. Kill it with cultist dagger and toss a Molotov at the body. Then go to the hilltop between Sutton and height is and look for a small campsite. Place the metal tub in the cooler there and shoot a flare straight up into the air. He will be waiting on the road by Deathclaw island.
---
 I get it, again 'but'. ammosmith ,only good when making ammo,lock picks when you need,travel agent only when travelling . they'll all still be usable
---
when you need them.
---
maybe think of adding perks for your chosen weapons. that 3/9 cards,but 20/60% on your damage output and add bloodymess to that.....
---
like I said, I am not judging, you go,as you feel you want to.
---
Legit?
---
Well, it seems we have a future focus group for the Berserker Meta. Strip down to your underarmor, get those berserker essential perk cards, the silly cheap weapons that nobody wants and get to it!
---
Radicool perk?
---
Lol you should keep all Sent &amp; Cav. Personally I like the look of leather. That's all. Safe to get rid of things with Aqua &amp; Blocking. Hunters, Exterminator &amp; Cloaking not that great.
---
That would be a cool resource I've never found one and I'm too lazy to do it myself... oh the shame :((
---
I couldn't agree more. I don't mind playing with other players when I choose to, I just hate being "forced" to to complete certain parts of the game (yes, I realize that I can choose to just not to do those parts).
---
I feel the same way about the weeklies that must be done in Survival mode. I have zero urge to play in survival mode. I **especially** don't want to hang around in Survival mode waiting for a fucking rainstorm just to complete the challenge. It would be one thing if they alternated between Survival and Adventure mode to get these unique weapons, but to force me to play Survival mode for them is a jerk move.
---
Idk but i found hime just walking in circles by the whitespring
---
New players still have to grind because they lack caps.
---
I have radicool but I’m missing solar powered
---
The BE Handmade has recoil, reasonable hitbox for the projectile and normal range, its explosive damage gets cancelled by dense armour and needs actual aiming. Stop comparing the two the BE laser is being exclusively used for a good reason.
---
If you know anyone with 50+ strength please inform me how to get there
---
Then get solar powered, do you also have herd mentality w/ strange in numbers
---
You've convinced me. Time to automatic mod my quad railway, with 25% faster fire. Unfortunately all my perks are rifleman. No commando points...yet.
---
There are a couple responses here I see that I am not alone
---
Can you explain what you mean by that? Min/Max means you are getting the most out of your own build by focusing on what your character is good at (and your play style) and minimizing the stats and perks that dont assist you in that.
---
I never play with people or else I would get it. That might be the play though isn’t it like +4 to strength with strange in numbers?
---
Absolutely not. He is a random spawn. There are maps availble of his route though. Might help locate him
---
Wondering if there may be some hidden mechanics, to keep a certain caliber of item? Hope not. . . But it sure seems weird that the machine would let some go back, and not let the item that you really wanted back to be returned. Ive never been in the anti-bethesda/76 crowd but, you guys would be trying to thin the top tier weapon/items herd would you? I sincerely hope not, because this would be a TERRIBLE way to go about it.
---
It's a bit of a mess mate. You have both regular armour and power armour specific cards slotted for example. However not everyone wants to min max so if you enjoy it fair play.
---
I followed a couple of low level folks around for 10 minutes until one was killed by a super mutant.  Revived and then I spent another 15 minutes helping them out because I felt bad for letting one of them die in the first place.
---
I am a proud owner of a backpack now.
---
Hi,
---
We're looking into this. Thank you for posting!
---
Oh yes I think leather has the best look too. Some others like raiders and trappers just look heinous lol 😂
---
You could uhhh sell it and buy the ammo you need... or buy the mats you need to make ammo
---
It'd be interesting if some made you look more like a Super mutant and some made you more like a ghoul.... and one grew a plant out of your head.
---
At level 50ish this was happining all the time to me, it would be 210, then 180, 190, down to 150 at one point. I think it was the food I was eating and meds adding and removing it.

I would be so sad if my gauntlet vanished. I had the veil of secrets vanish for a day... Not a real loss, but weird because it’s not possible for me to accidentally sell or drop it because I haven’t finished the quest.
---
Also... I was running around and was awarded a random piece of armor. Its my only chameleon armor and I love it, but it makes me wonder which poor user lost it from their inventory.... and if this transfer is happening every time we lose our items.
---
Morbid curiosity
---
I think its +3
---
I would say instigating. If you stay undetected you’ll do pretty good damage without the meta builds. + it sounds awesome with the suppressor
---
It's weird tho, heavy leather arms appear unmodded on my character. So I try to find Sturdy stuff cuz I like the way studded looks.
---
uh, also higher fire rate means higher rate for stagger and luck of the draw... Arguably better.
---
Every time I go to Morgantown lol
---
What perk do I have that's for regular armour? White knight?
---
Good to hear 🤗
---
Never understood the locked doors. You want to lock down your water purifiers or junk extractors, I get it. But 9/10 I’m stopping by for three reasons; check your shop, use your workstations, and check out your build. It’s not like I can steal your Nuka Girl poster.
---
Even so that’s +6 with maxed out solar power
---
*Damn Sanjay!!! Tone it down mate...*
---
I just can't imagine it's that much fun beating a dead horse once the eyes become dislodged from the skull, but that's just me.
---
yeah, that would be nice :)
---
Was a funny moment, never seen on sleeping in a nest...
---
Ill be on around 4pm est, and don't worry free as free can be!
---
Same. Rarely does it not spawn a random encounter. I've had the sleeping sheepsquatch 3-4x lately.
---
do absolutly nothing at all. he'll find you.
---
The usuals, TSE, BE, AAE, IE, or EE. They’re all pretty good in their own way.
---
Im jealous. You're very lucky my friend.
---
I would pay atoms to be able to mod my stash box any day.
---
Will order one. Got 200cps - deal?
---
*great Job! Honestly would put it up at home*
---
Instigating with 10% extra dmg whilst aiming or explosive, with sneaking this combo can be pretty destructive
---
You can buy it back for the same amount you sold for as long as you don't close out of the machine.
---
Me, after reading this and realizing I have that skin equipped on my AAE shotgun with reduced weight: ...wait, has a star disappeared from it and I haven't even noticed up until now?
---
Goddamnit, this post making me paranoid as fuck. Now I'm gonna be waiting all day to get home and check cause it's been a few days since I had it on
---
That and sturdy frame.
---
I'm currently at work. Can someone check the shop and see if it's still available?
---
I'll PM my username, look forward to meeting you later! Thank you!
---
get this mans his pumps back
---
Who are you trying to convince?
---
That's why I am not paying for crap from their store. This isn't the first glitch and it won't be the last for sure
---
dude you Forgot the part where after going to deathclaw island, a scorched officer will be on the ground, use his code to launch a nuke, nuke fissure site  prime, go to the moth man museum and swing a super sledge with insistigating effect (nothing else) into the direction of the sun. Then return to nuke zone, eliminate the queen and finally, a holotape made by graham stating that he traveled to the commonwealth will be located on her corpse. so install fallout 4, and you’ll find his body near the crater of atom, in a cave guarded by a death claw, he changed his name to virgil and will order you to kill a courser. Do that and he will order you to build a molecular relay to travel to the institute. There you will meet you’re son and will be faced with a moral decision. Side with the brotherhood, minutemen, railroad or institute. Virgil will then change back to human if you retrieved a FEV reversal serum. The end war never changes yada yada yada
---
Supermutands seem to drop them fairly regularly.
---
I miss my daily jokes and water from Megaton
---
Lurk on Reddit/fallout pages until someone posts that they have him
---
Thanks, I thought both affected PA too...
---
Then idk from there
---
MORE STEEL  !!!!!!!!!!
---
I'd rather have Kung Pao cat.
---
Woah the Nuka girl Poster?
---
Damn...if i could i would, but i can't so i shan't.
---
If you are going to start a new character I suggest dumping your extra legendaries onto a friend so they can give them to your new character to scrip at the legendary Purveyor. Even one or two low level legendaries might change your entire perspective if how you will play.
---
Did you happen to notice if the suppressor on your pump was a broken texture? Mine, was a bright purple which I imagine wasn't intended from the paint. Wish I had taken a picture before removing it.
---
Sturdy frame.
---
PC has a mod available that changes the colour of meat piles, makes it a lot easier to get paid for your kills.  
---
Unless *not* getting your loot is part of the intended game design...?
---
Trade, Build, Nuke, and Farm basically
---
I've heard it does not show up after crouching.
---
My guess is that it’s a server load issue. Will probably have to tie every item to an amount of camp capacity which I’m sure takes time
---
Thank you Ma'am.
---
Looks like Bethesda started investigating the problem. Good luck on recovering your stuff
---
To up your damage a bit you could get rank 1 in each of the 3 heavy gunner cards for 30%, max bloody mess and put one point in adrenaline.
---
I like to wear high heels and pretend to be coach Klein.
---
Almost positive most of the Toxic Lakebed area is going to have future DLC's, would not be surprised in the slightest if the Space Station is apart of that, even in a small way. Bethesda talked a lot about "large, underground areas", and I'm guessing the Space Station will have access to something like that.
---
yeah these are my picks code breaker can be finished with one nuke run almost all the terminals you need to hack are found at a silo plus the launch don't forget to have a valid launch code at the ready
---
I did my best making something lore friendly and makeshift at the same time by using a something already existing. 
---
Maybe you’ll get a few ideas from this! 
---
https://youtu.be/8CZ8S0JpwAM
---
But I do so agree with you. I’m much more into the junk-look that could look like something already in the game
---
Used to meet him pretty consistently on I-59 near the Gorge Junkyard.  However, haven't seen him in almost three weeks (real time).  Maybe he's queued up at the Purveyor's with everybody else, eh?
---
Can confirm stagger, sometimes enemies can’t even move, tbh it happens all the time, even with SBQ.
---
Depends. I like to collect legendaries, trade, make various builds and characters, craft lots of stuff, collect, yada yada
---
It would be nice if you could get them to tend crops and clean out any extractors.
---
Dont worry, when Beth finally figures out what a gold mine pets and skins for pets are going to be for their atomic shop this stuff will happen.  =)
---
I know it’s been a few days, but It seems like you missed ultracite and raider power armour?
---
I know raiders just for low levels but what about ultracite?
---
Awesome idea.
---
I will do that. I just read that you can exchange legendary items now.
---
There is probably some yet undiscovered spots on the map. I am level 154 and have yet to discover the space station in the upper right corner of the map, I'll be doing that today.
---
If you dive deeper, you can discover much Player generated Stuff.
---
The Fight Club , Karaoke nights, Labyrinth Houses, Roleplay communities...it's all out there :)
---
When Bethesda releases more content over time, then it would make sense to increase it. 2,000 WT in my opinion would be the max and I don't like the idea of infinite because then everyone would have too much stuff. What we have right now is limiting me big time.
---
Wander . . .
---
I thought that, but there are so many reasons why you should. Unyielding and the extra 15 points you get on each skill is a ridiculous difference! Your melee attack goes through the roof and you get tonnes of ap. The strongest weapons are bloodied. Then theres nerd rage and serendipity! Low health builds are the way to go... just dont get hit ha!
---
Heavy gunner PA build is what I use when soloing.  It’s cheap because you don’t need any legendary armor, just a weapon or two.  Heavy guns don’t synergize much with any legendary affix currently on armor, and the perk stabilize in the intellect tree gives you armor pen and recoil reduction in PA no brainer there.  I choose to run a bloody PA build and I have solod the SBQ on rare occasions no one showed up.  It’s a very easy build to learn, no vats, no stealth just point and shoot.
---
If you cant find legendarys, then find the penetrating capacitors.
---
If you can find a legendary, then find the penetrating capacitors.
---
Not in any way accusing you of duping in the slightest, but since you said you bought it I wonder if it was duped and if the game can detect that. There have been a few other posts where people lost items, all usually good/god rolls. Other than just a terrible series of bugs, I assume the purveyor is there to cleanse as many legendaries from the wasteland as is possible so I wonder if it has special characteristics.
---
It's either that or "Attention all Responders, Sanjay here! Letting you know that STEEEELHAAT is fully charged and ready for action! If you're in Morgantown, go ahead and activate him so he can check the alarms on the stash rooms. Just don't let him take too much damage! - ^I ^got ^enough ^repair ^work ^as ^it ^is"
---
Yea I think the player vending is a brilliant idea, especially when they’re concerned about inflation. I spent hundreds upon hundreds of caps just to travel around the map without even realizing it. Then just like any flea market shopping I bought stuff that’s no purpose at all but just because ‘oh I didn’t know this existed’. Shopping around is mostly what I do in the past few days lol, can’t believe this is happening, I thought I bought a typical first-person-shooter game. 
---
If all prices go up across the board, that means those shoppers will have more caps in their pockets to spend if they are also sellers, so they will still buy from you. Again it’s the typical inflation phenomenon. As long as people are earning and spending, it’s going to be ok. Only those who hardly play (earn caps) will feel left out, but I highly doubt they will spend real world money to buy in game stuff. Bethesda shouldn’t limit everyone’s ability to earn and spend just because of the players who hardly play.
---
I'm so sad because I'm yet to come across one of these
---
Hopefully you will have better luck with it too!
---
You can't exchange scrip between characters/ accounts, so it's a slight hassle but worth it to try and see. I restarted a toon assuming I was going to be a heavy Gunner, but I rolled a VATS enhanced two shot pipe revolver, so now I'm planning on rocking that for the next 20 levels.
---
well that's kinda screwed up.. it should allow you to choose. After all you PAID for it..
---
After it happen to me  I was trying to figure out why that one item would not allow me to get it back.  I traded for the weapon so i thought it might have been duped and somehow they new that and that is why i could not get it back.  Not sure it is possible to know if it was duped or not just trying to rationalize it.
---
Lmao good. Fuck your tse shotguns.
---
I don't think I've ever been 100% certain of returning to the same server after a disconnect, game crash, or just logging off.  Got a hint on how to ID your server or how to recognize the one you want?
---
Cram fat man.
---
Well if you make a quick trip to the sulfur water fountain that will clear right up!
---
Is that even an option?
---
I'm 266, doing my usual runs for gear and challenges (dailies and weeklies), trading with other players, doing SBQ runs. Soon I'll do another run of treasure maps (collected like 200+ of them).
---
Yeah. . . I even exited the machine, knowing full well that it would seal my fate, but hoping somehow I could retreive it. . . Obviously to no avail, lol.
---
Yeah.  I can see the issue with cash bought Atoms being used to buy Caps or Scrip .... so that's a NO.  
---
But Caps earned in grinding or selling in vending machines used to buy Atoms or Scrip, or Scrip used to buy Caps or Atoms, those I would still like.   Caps and Scrip are becoming a bit unusable for me.
---
For me, Scrip is becoming a bit of a nauseating currency.   Over 3500 scrip spent, converted into about 1200 scrip (re-scrapped trash) and 1000 caps (items sold to scrip) in my vending machine (i.e. becoming NOTHING, due to the dud drops by the Purveyor, which is almost "legendary" in its consistency of giving at least 2 wooden armour pieces out of 5 and 1 assaultron head out of 5 .... go figure out that probability of that if the tables were truly "random").
---
Thanks, didn't think of subtitles.  Good suggestion . . . lame message, eh?
---
Oh Crap. To be fair thats a small detail to miss. Oops.
---
LOL whoops! That’s kinda funny.
---
Yes, that’s how all my weapons are, including minigun that weights..... 3.6 including modified aim.
---
That's if its on sale this week.
---
It will not happen, my friend got a Bloody with swing speed and +1 endurance mole miner gauntlet from the legendary vendor, it got scrapped at a workbench (they [patched](https://imgur.com/xE9kE5s) it in the next patch) but he filed a support ticket and got [this](https://imgur.com/arbPg62) response. Big bold letters "WE WILL NOT BE RESTORING ANY ITEMS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE"
---
Thanks, guess we'll just go cry :'(
---
I suppose you could quickly just check the map to see if there is a player at your C.A.M.P., but I guess if you're hopping servers on the fly a notification would be helpful, so as a QoL feature I don't see why not (if the overhead isn't large, since only one person can use a vendor at a time for sure there is a software flag that already exists).
---
Good with salt will help boat loads with spoilage. I use it to keep my raw flux from going bad.
---
Spend all day with Grahm
---
I’m not offended, just surprised that young people still use them.
---
Instructions not clear, penis stuck in a roach.
---
I had no suppressor equipped on either gun
---
Hmm that sounds right up my alley lol.
---
"a little bit of this, a little bit of that"
---
Log in, claim a workshop. Defend it whenever you need to. Do every event that pops up on your map, and is nearby so you don't go broke travelling. Defend every workshop, even if it's not yours.
---
Explore every building you come across. Kill every hostile creature that moves. 
---
I find a combo of exploring and workshops works well for a good, honest, consistent forward momentum.
---
I havent seen him in weeks either. Wonder if he is on vacation?
---
Lol. I am going to look into this build as well.
---
Are you still playing and if so still offering this? I’d like shielded raider please
---
This is exactly what I thought when it would not give me back my AA/E reduced weight 50 caliber that I traded for.
---
Same here, i love the heavy gunner pa build. I rarely die and except for the weapons you don't need an execisive amount of caps/trade items just to get the good armor everybody is looking for.
---
That’s true. Sorry about that.
---
I hope for your sake it was a bug exclusive to whatever my situation is /was
---
It's supposed to allow you to capture still images, continuous video, and either save as files or broadcast to the internet.  Have only used it to do screen shots.
---
until you get batteries included (weight reduction)  and power user (consumption reduction) perks, it will seem like your PA eats cores.
---
Once you get those two perks, then consumption rate drops considerably (assuming you don't have jet packs and/or don't use VATS often.)   Watch your weight - cores weight 3# each w/o batteries included.  They weigh 0.3 after.  
---
I have been in PA full time since about L48 (I'm L94 now).  I walk everywhere, do not use vats, and do not have a jetpack.  A 25% core last me (at least) 4 hours - usage appears to be linear, as a 60% core lasts about 9 hrs.
---
In the interim, learn where the PA spawn points and fusion generators are, and farm them. (there are at least 12 PA spawns in the forest, at least 2 of them can yield up to 5 cores.  PA spawns have 25% cores. Fusions generators are at least 60%, and event rewards are 100% charge. Some enemies are now carrying cores, too.
---
I keep several in my vending machine for 1c per percent of charge.
---
be aware there is (at least) one weapon that uses Fusion cores as ammo, and do not confuse plasma cores with fusion cores - they are not interchangable. (so don't use a bunch of mats crafting them thinking they'll work in PA - they will not)
---
Suppressor: You shoot bad guy, he shoots back not so good.
---
Tenderizer: You shoot bad guy, he blocks not so good for next shots.

---
Has a bunch of mods listed. not sure if it’s what you’re looking for.
---
I bounce around the map taking every workshop.  Not for pvp purposes.  I could not care less about pvp, but because you get a plan for taking it and doing the defend mission that comes soon after.  I've stocked my vending machines with extra camp item plans for 15 caps each and they sell really well. 
---
My goal is to learn all the serum recipes.  Right now I know 11 and stock my vending machine with serums for 250 caps each.  
---
I grind nuke zone for materials and flux to keep doing it.
---
Then helping new players is always awesome and fulfilling. 
---
Trying to find God tier weapons. 
---
Trying to get more opossum badges. 
---
Grind every event that pops up on the map except Arktos Pharma.
---
I just have a lot of fun and I'm level 212. On ps4 if anyone wants to join me.
---
Its a known bug
---
Or...make it a habit to check  your map before you log off.
---
Best part is the weirdly contemptuous way he says ‘I’ve set them up to make cans of stew.’
---
&gt;suppressor
---
Okay, so this happened to someone else too. Thought it was just me... might be worth submitting that to the Bethesda Community Manager who commented.
---
Yup....hit the events i like when theyre active....scrap and make ammo in between....constantly hunt better legendarys then i have. 
---
I have had periods of a few days at a time when i got bored with it, but most of the new events that come out keep me entertained.
---
Its a completionest thing for me....when i have everything perfect and the best it can possibly ve for me and the way i play....ill probably stop
---
Bloodied, executioner, furious are my main attributes I tend to keep, everything else I scrap or sell. After that, it's swing speed, VATS, or explosive. 
---
Attributes I don't use are bashing damage, aiming damage, or movement speed while aiming.
---
Damn that’s kinda harsh,..
---
OK .. it took long enough for me to register with Bethesda and figure out where to put in a comment, but here is what I just wrote (and Bethesda, again, please consider adopting a voting platform like uservoice): (SLIGHT BoS SPOILERS)
---
"The quest system can be very frustrating at times. For example, I tried pursing the quests for the Brotherhood of Steel and got to the part where I needed to go to Charleston to get a government ID. I guess someone thought it would be fun to take real life frustration and make players go through it in game - maybe not the best of ideas. 
---
However what made it horrible was that I kept doing one part of the quest and would have to log, then upon return the progress (and items) were gone -  without explanation. I thought it was a bug of some sort.
---
If you have a quest chain like that, where it's "see NPC A", "get number", "Get postmarked letter", "see NPC B" plus several more things, WHY would I lose progress after any of those steps? This is horribly frustrating. Think about it - if players are not cheating by looking up the quests on the internet then they have no idea:
---
- Which quest might not save progress
---
- Is lack of saving progress a bug or did player not do something right?
---
- How many steps are required to complete the quest or get to a safe stopping point
---
- What point must be reached to save progress
---
Plus though rarer, there are still unexpected server crashes, and players should not lose progress.
---
I don't see any reason NOT to save progress EVERY TIME a new mini-goal is met unless it's poor game design / coding problems - and players should not have to suffer for this. "
---
I have a Bloodied Cultist blade that has the reduced weight third star. If I'm not mistaken I also have another weapon with both Bloodied and 90% reduced weight. Albeit his three mods are the best three possible on a shotgun imo.
---
Why do we need to worry about this?
---
If you have all the caps...then just stop collecting them and farming for more. If you've bought everything and have farmed the heck out of everything in the game then congratulations you win. For everyone else...well we'll just keep playing and collecting and spending caps as we usually do. 
---
I don't really see the need to worry about the cap limit, players who are maxed out have lots of odds and ends of plans and recipes to buy and if they still end up maxed out with everything buyable bough then that's fine, they can do business buying and selling through their vendor shop or just plain help out low level players for the heck of it. We don't need to always control everything in the game world. I have  a lot of plans on a couple of characters but I'm not particularly rich cap wise...lucky to have 5000 or so most of the time, but I don't farm it, whatever I get I get and I don't worry about it otherwise since there's no reason to.
---
Just enjoy being rich if you're maxed out otherwise just buy some more of the ridiculously overpriced whitesprings plans or serum recipes. Don't fret over farming (unless of course that's the only thing you find fun in the game in which case have your fun but don't complain about the fact that you constantly hit item caps that the rest of us who just play without farming/server hopping don't run into)...just have fun.
---
Quad bpr
---
I hope you can find this, really.  I like the ideas.  I'd probably use them.
---
That being said, I don't think they would have purposefully put in a setting that bypasses one of the modes you can play.  I hope I'm wrong, but that seems a bit counterproductive.  They want you to have that option, a setting to take it away seems like a waste of programming time.
---
Same goes with the news popup - pretty standard to inform you of things going on in the game, they want you to be informed and have an easy place to go to find out what's new.  And, honestly, hitting one button to bypass it isn't really asking a lot is it?
---
Had it on My TSE flamer since day of launch in shop.  So far no issues, now scared to remove it 😂 on PC which might make a difference

This is so dumb. Why not just craft another shotgun or something? You know instead of testing it on a 6k gun.

Bloodied Explosive one, mine do 1000+ dmg with 20% health...

It’s somewhat flexible in that I keep 3 into perception for making the silos easier by picking the door and hacking the terminal.  If I’m not running silos I run glow sights there.  If your not a fan of dog food you can put another point in demo expert or max out Lone Wander.  The AP regen from Lone Wander and Nerd Rage don’t really stack with action boy so that’s not needed.  If your in a party you could always swap LW for strange in numbers and suppressor and tenderizer.  Let me know if you have any questions why I picked what I did.
---
Not really but I do keep it just in case which is why it stays below 100. If you take over a workshop you will need them at times but cork is not that important all the way.

Hey, thanks. That is what I was looking for, but it doesn't look like most of it was finished unfortunately :(

Player Vending yes.

Purveyor NO.  Not the way it works.
---
I actually think the wood armour and assaultron head "glitch" is intentional.  Them turning to dross, and having their drop rates increased is very, very similar to the \*\*\* Boss drops of drills and syringers ...... Hillarious (sarcasm) to the program team that thought about putting it in the game.  So much so that they increased the likelihood that everyone experienced it, Insult-Bot style (totally Bethesda's MO).
---
Solo Challenges, or at least Challenges that can't be screwed up by players standing around doing nothing.  I actually encountered a player who left his avatar at the edge of Campfire Tales (just standing there, so clearly just leaving his game running while they checked out), just collecting whatever rewards were given for however many times the event successfully ran while they were absent.  The events get progressively (possibly even exponentially) harder the more players show up.

For me, bloodied and AA are by FAR top for weapons.  Armor is unyielding and I'm slowly putting together unyielding cav set as I'm melee.  (I have full unyielding and optional chameleon pieces.)  I'm a bloodied build, but I'm also working on a second account that's a sneak sniper and the exact opposite so I'm looking for vanguard pieces and AA ranged weapons.  Anything else is fodder for my vending machines or the legendary scrap machines.
---
Nothing, I didn't get good drops until I hit 50. That's what made the difference. But I farm like crazy and I've yet to find anything Bloodied Explosive. The OP most likely bought this gun on the market. I'm not sure how people actually find them. I've only ever found 1 or 2 star bloodied weapons.
---
Neat! &lt;click&gt;
---
Set up a vending machine in your camp and make sure it's receiving enough power, put items in the vending machine and yeah.
---
At this point in time Bloodied explosive and Anti armor explosive weapons are the money makers. TSE also will always sell good. Junkies explosive is also on the rise as well due to little trade off with that build. 
---
Good 3rd rolls are faster fire rate, reload, or weight reduction. 
---
For armor obviously sentinel and cavalier assassins are hot commodities. But I’ve actually been looking for some troubleshooters/cav to make the imposter and nuke runs even easier. 
---
Vanguard is also a pretty good seller especially when it has ap refresh.
---
Camp budget needs to increase too. We are going to have decorations soon and I'm sure Bethesda wants to make each item a budget item.
---
Strangely enough the budget for camp, no matter where I go, fluctuates. It's based on location, enemies in area, objects in area, and possibility of another factor but I can't seem to put my finger on it.
---
Sanjay here!
---
The popup can be removed although I don't know myself how to do it. AFAIK there is no way to bypass the mode selection.
---
Why do you need to take over a workshop? I only do that when the daily or weekly challenge requires it.
---
Because, to you and I... that makes sense.
---
However, there's an ENTIRE subset of characters to whom "I done did everything, now what" translates to "Well, let's go harass everybody else".
---
Yes, of course I would prefer more content first... but, in cases like this, "new content" always means" Catering to the mega-levelled" anyways.

that's damn funny.. Up voted.. :P
---
I do it to gather supplies, XP, caps, rewards, and just to spin things up a bit. I do three workshops max.
---
Good question, I've been trying to figure that out for the past 100 levels now. I'm sitting on around 38 or so unused perk points, max caps on all my mules, most plans and recipes bought, have all my end game weapons and gear. I usually just run WS, Westek, Steakhouse, Harpers Ferry, turn in technical data, scrap legendaries, and launch nukes. I'm not a camp builder either, I literally have a tent and my workbenches.
---
I bought it on put it on my TSE. Last I played it had no issues. Fingers crossed it stays that way

\&gt;insulting me with homophobic and racial jokes 
---
Maybe it's just me, but whenever I see a story like this I immediately think, "uh this just got way less credible."
---
I virtually never run into people making homophobic or racial jokes. When I do, it's some 15 year old kid with a temper problem trying to be edgy.
---
Workshop defense missions. Take all the workshops. Get Charleston landfill, wade airport Poseidon energy. The food processor plant ( I can’t remember it’s name) even get the junkyard by vault 76 that has a black titanium deposit. You will hopefully have a constant defense mission waiting for you. Giving you tons of enemies at your level as well as caps, food, water, aid, and camp plans. And don’t worry if some one tries to pvp you because you will have very little to loose 25 caps and maybe some loose junk you didn’t stash in between workshops. All while you level fast. Make sure to stop into mama ducles for the feed the people event that gives you canned meat stew. This gives you an exp boost for one hr when consumed. Also get inspirational in charisma and just send random team invites to other players around your level you will find a teammate eventually. Having both inspirational plus canned meat stew nets you a bonus of 20% exp.
---
I found one of those masks if you hadn't found one yet
---
Maybe.  I was surprised it was still showing the stuff from a couple hours previous.  It's not a bad idea to keep that there until the 20 hours runs out in case you change your mind, or you're trying to get that last few scrip so you can grab back something and scrip other stuff to get that last little bit.  But once the 20 hours are up, it resets along with the daily scrip allowance.
---
What rare things have you found from them?
---
It's ok.
---
I have an explosive vampire gatling, is that good enough to warrant changing specs eventually? It seems pretty great but I haven't dipped into heavy weapons at all so I've got nothing to gauge it by.
---
You don’t like arktos?
---
Interesting, never noticed that 🤔
---
As others said.  I'm intensely solo.  I hate being asked to "trade" even.
---
Encryptid easily got me the assist.  (Go and hang around on the periphery - don't even participate - just look for an opportunity.  The players charging the pylons always go down, they can't help it.  Either the health drop gets them, or the fact that everything attacks them to uncharge their pylon does).  I haven't been to one Encryptid event that doesn't give at least half a dozen opportunities to revive someone.
---
That or SBQ .... and watch the level 50 or below characters ... if there are none, leave.
---
rare plans (dense, shielded, PA parts) mainly.
---
Please don't give them that idea. :(
---
When the game started we (friends and I) thought about the best way to improve the stash.
---
We came out with the idea of adding a +50 weight each 10 levels, costing the player something like 100 steel and 1000caps
---
Instigating is nice, but it struggles against things that you can't one shot.
---
Bloodied is great, as always. Anti Armor is a fine second pick if you don't like bloodied.
---
Faster Fire Rate and Explosive are prime second star effects, and Damage while aiming is solid as well.
---
The third star barely matters, but reload speed and weightless are the best. DR while aiming is good if you have Damage while aiming as the second star.
---
 look at this...  ha ha ha ha ha

Pipe revolvers benefit from both gunslinger and rifleman perks, and are cheap and solid as main weapons for a long time/forever if you get a good legendary. That way if you do find a great rifle, you have already invested points into it. My non legendary revolver did 140 damage vs my western revolver at 125 for comparison. Marsupial is an amazing and fun mutation that changed how I played. I would jump on top of trees/buildings to create ambushes not possible before.
---
But in some ways you have to admire that they are able to so desperately cling to a ridiculous theory that's so easily proven wrong...but they hand wave all evidence to the contrary as made up or false and show the crazy conspiracy evidence they have as if it were real. 
---
At some point you do have to wonder if the people making those flat earth videos are really just trolling people, what other explanation could there be really?
---
Build in your camp a vending machine hook it up to the power source and voila
---
Collect as many players as possible... surround them with fences... set your pricing. It's a tough playstyle, but I have faith in you.
---
I like and live in PA for the DR/RR, and carry weight,

The almost sensual tone he uses to say Mama Dolce is disturbing

There is an abraxo cleaner power armor skin in the dev room
---
I've seen him mainly at the Charleston Fire department, and at Watuga however his location seems to be random and not along a set route. The odd thing about him going to Watuga is that even though he shares a CAP pool with the Watuga train station vendor, the robots in Watuga are hostile to him. So I'll normally see Chally the moo-moo outside Watugo (usually on the south side by the rail car) while Grahm is in Watuga hacking away at the robots.  Just follow the dead robots and it'll lead you right to him.
---
Lol one time he scared me and i shot at him..good thing I missed
---
Was it like a green glow on them or does there name actually have glowing in it?
---
Green glowing smoke trails?
---
Green glow
---
Or, maybe allow us to turn the Armor peices invisible, and only the Under Armor can be seen.
---
I have not... However, waaay back in November during BETA I was in flatwoods and listening to a holotape and somehow had two audio tracks going at the same time. I am pretty sure one had directions to a grave to dig up in that town with a bunch of aid items... but I was trying to listen to them both and that is about all I got from the one recording. Not sure if there is one in flatwoods to dig or not.
---
Sounds like it might have something to do with custom names. When you scrapped it by accident it reverted back to system name in the right window, but when you attempted to buy it back, the system doesn’t know how to rename it the way you did, therefore it refused to give it back. That’s just my guess, since both yours and OP’s were renamed and couldn’t be bought back.
---
while under the influence of alcohol.
---
Even that’s a good idea. Honestly any way to mod it at all would be good. Maybe even with a prestige program that adds 50 or 100 when you do it.
---
When legendaries spawn they have that. How long they have it seems to vary.
---
In a clown suit.. (ya know while naked)
---
Lower level players (70 and below) still buy One Star items.  But they know what weapons are top of their class and what legendary prefixes are good and which are crap, and they need them modded up to be the best they can be, as they don't tend to have learned all the mods for lever or handmade yet .... otherwise they can grind them out themselves.
---
Open up the CAMP menu at your camp.  Build a vendor.  Attach the vendor to enough power to activate it.  Walk up to your vending machine and select the items you want to sell and at what price they will sell.  
---
If you are selling multiple of the same item, eg ammo, the price you are setting is for each unit not for the lot.  Thus if you are selling 1000 5.56 ammo price it at 1c not 1000c.
---
Don’t place things in your vendor at the default price.  Typically things sell at lower prices than the default unless they are very rare.  Most of my plans are 5-25c for CAMP stuff, 25-250 for armor weapon plans, and 5-30c for recipes. For legendary items I do 500-1k per highly desired effect.  Rare plans, like the civil war top hat, or rarer/harder to build items, like the shielded vault 76 underarmor , go for a lot more than the default price.  
---
Vendors use your STASH space so you need to have room in your stash to vend stuff.
---
Wow can’t believe I’ve never seen it before.
---
I'll see you down there, it's time for another lead run myself. You'll have so much lead, it'll actually be a burden. I'm an auto rifle build, so I don't quite have the ammo problems you heavy builds do, but I think I got roughly 400 lead ore last time, and it smelts 3 ore to 5 scrap (I think?) so that's over 600 lead. That's a lot of bullets, and it legit takes 10 minutes to clear our Lucky Hole. I farmed steel for a week just to keep up with my lead supply.
---
Sounds awesome friend, thanks for tips.
---
This is my weapon, this is my gun, this is for fighting, and I guess the camera is for fun!
---
I spent a week trying to find a mirelurk hunter and every stinking spawn location had mirelurk kings instead.
---
Yesterday I had six mirelurk kings in the train yard near Watoga. None of them were legendary. I hate mirelurk kings.
---
Do my daily quest for plans and recipes to sell in my vending machines. Sell stuff to get my cap limit. Do a few events for daily legendary scrip. Browse player vending machines.  Then on the weekend I drop nukes and collect the flux for serums. As well as level different characters for different builds
---
xD
---
Hi! The thing about raider, and T-45 are that yes they are for low/mid levels. There’s nothing great about them when you reach max level unless you like the looks. Likewise, ultracite armor has decently similar resistances to T-51B armor but the mods for ultracite are only available as plans dropped by the scorchbeast queen. Additionally, it’s crazy expensive to repair. It’s just a harder to repair and mod, slightly worse version of T-51
---
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BETHESDA!!
---
QUAD&lt;3
---
Xbox?
---
Would love to!
---
Being able to upgrade it instead of having it maxed at the beginning would benefits everyone :
---
A) Mules would have to farm / quests / spend caps
---
B) It would add reasons to farm
---
C) Having a better stash would be more rewarding
---
And much more (that I can't think of atm)
---
Stabilized still provides a nice accuracy bonus even if the armor penetration does not work correctly.
---
Oh please no! I've put those skins on my 3 characters main weapons! B/E , V/E levers and B/E shotguns. Worst part a had to spend real money to buy those damn atoms!
---
I hope your on Xbox I don't wanna scrip it out I know someone can use it
---
There’s a discussion that Im too lazy to source that suggests the rad resist is actually disease resist.
---
I mean no amount of skill can make up for the fact that explosive on energy weapons is doing something unintended and uncounterable. I’m sure bethesda is highly aware of the fact that 99% of the good legacy weapons are heavily duped. I don’t think they’ll be untouched
---
I took most of the advice.  Class freak is in the build and I looked up the max level resistances if the PA.  I think the T51b provides better DR and ER with a slightly less RR as compared to the T60 so will be looking for a full set of T51b.
---
Pretty sure that just means a legendary just spawned it's like when you do uranium fever right when the legendary mole miner spawns he will have a green glow on him for a few seconds to indicate he's legendary
---
I would prefer area-looting for corpses instead. Nonetheless, any solution to reduce the tedium of searching for corpses for those not willing or able to use a mod or disable the grass would be most welcome I think.
---
Was expecting something epic.
---
Kill queens, imposter sheepsquatches, and alpha predators
---
It is, in my opinion. The only problem with a heavy weapons build is that you HAVE to wear power armor for the Stabilized perk, else you're missing out on so so much DPS. This renders is unusable in survival mode, as people cut through power armor like butter. Also, Bloodied weapons outmatch any other prefix by miles, so it's always worth your time to start switching to a bloodied build. Your damage will legit quintuple, it's amazing! Bloodied +25% fire rate gatling guns go for a measly 3k on the reddit markets, and I haven't yet found a non-legacy weapon that outdamages it :D
---
I keep seeing people say this, but I've had hundreds up in my vending machine for weeks no with no bites. It's at one cap each, so I can't make it any cheaper without chucking it on the floor.
---
Shotgun shells selling pretty fast tho, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.
---
Oh ok, thank you
---
as another solo player, husband with kids and wife, I salute you.
---
My problem with both of them is that even when using gunsmith they break way to quickly.
---
Make sure there are no other events active in the nearby area. Some events prevent other events from starting.
---
if you are talking tonight (about 7-8 hours) I am down.. I actually have a keycard also and have never launched a nuke.. maybe make it a 2fer!?

Meh. Just becomes a time-sink when we get that stuff. Id rather just click and go. Watching a repetitive animation is fun... for the first 5 times, then it's just impatient button-mashing to get through it from then on.

Technically the Pipboy paint is new. That wasn't around with the original release of Hot Rodder.
---
I can't tell if vampires wouldn't work with bloodied or would synergize perfectly with it. Seems like if you're stacking rads to keep your health pool low (like most people do for bloodied), having that constant health regen as you fire would be awesome. 
---
Thanks for the tip on the stabilized/PA necessity, I'll look into that before switching. PA is a deal killer for me. I really don't want to mess with it. 
---
Might have an explosive/vampires gatling for sale.
---
I have an instigating explosive and it's my favorite gun for months now. I've tried to find an alternative, but I keep going back to it. Once I learn the suppressor mod from scrapping it will be perfect.
---
Nope.

Dogs everywhere a day after this content launches.

I abhor in-game pet followers in MP online games. It just ruins the entire "feel" when everyone is running around with a pet.

---
Melee is different, as usually with regards to guns it is some varient of damage modifier (ie Explosive/ +50 CRIT), that cannot be applied to melee weapons. The only one i can recall which goes against this formula, is the All Rise which is an even reward. This has no primary 1st prefix.
---
How did he scrap it it, legendaries have never been scrapable?
---
Good plan ill think about it lol
---
Oh and then I trap the people got it
---
Sanjay better be the only human NPC out there cause he's constantly setting that cannery up.
---
If you use a gatling gun instead of a 50 or minigun, you don't need stagger or luck of the draw.
---
Gatling gun's fire rate is relatively low (still higher dps than the other two heavy weapons), so it won't need repairs even after multiple queen kills.
---
Why would you want to stagger an enemy in the first place? Just marsupial away and continue firing? Theres better dps perk cards to use than One Gun Army.
---
But I guess that's just my playstyle hehe
---
Watching that was pretty funny mainly because your lack of skills. Power armor isn't particularly great for pvp.
---
Can you have multiple additions stacked?
---
Well that’s not nice
---
Love this.

I would like a Sugar Bombs skin for PA...
---
not everyone thinks that way though. lots of people like to take it slow and enjoy the atmosphere some people even enjoy swinging an axe to a tree for countless hours in game. ive played endless hours of survival games just hitting at rocks and trees with a whole clan fighting off monsters and what not as we go. i get it its not everyones thing, but a lot of people playing fo76 for the survival element may actually like it.

My friend and I once put on police uniforms and equipped batons and told players in whitespring not to run in the hallways.

They actually listened XD

I guess so. Cause she also gave me a BE Mg42 the other day.

It's a wasteland, not the 1st grade.

Another factory needs your help!  Here, I'll mark it on your map.

That creepy kid should be enough to scare anything else in the wasteland.
---
So many things I would change but the main one I would suggest is heavy gunner perks in strength. No need to really max out each perk card. Just get 1 level of each for a total of 3 points. Strong back is unnecessary especially if you get the backpack. I would rather you use traveling pharm 3 points instead of strong back if you have alot of chems. Take some of your endurance perks points and move them to strength if needed. Aqua boy isn't really needed as radaways are found everywhere. Unless you spend a lot of time in the water lol.

It's going to be for the space gun...

---
Hey, I love the survival element. and I like an immersive game,
---
But, eventually... it gets old. Look at the "skinning" animation in the  RDR, even.
---
I mean, in a game like Skyrim, where it's a "ooh, I found a node, lemme hit it with a pick a few times" every *once in a while*, sure. But when I'm collecting wood, and it's every 4 seconds that I have to watch a 5 second animation... it gets a bit tiring.
---
If you can find someone higher level to tag along with and tag enemies that also works well. Well rested, well tuned and other xp boosters also help. One Violent Night is good for xp if you can get a few people there that don't instantly kill everything.
---
...craft a legendary? Do you know something we don't?
---
Not sure why im getting downvoted.  I know full well explosive energy weapons are legacy.  There was a theory floating around that tse's are legacy too because no one had seen any drop legitimately in game since the patch that nerfed them.  This proves that theory wrong, partly.
---
Roses quest, the mysteries quest, and the Overseers quest will eventually lead you to places a lower level is not quite ready for, or places where enemies scale depending on who else is around. (When the overseer takes you to Lewiston, for example.).  
---
The western side of the divide and parts of the ash heap scale enemies to the highest level person in the area.  
---
The eastern side of the divide, the bog and the mire are always high level.  Parts of whitesprings scale, parts do not, but its almost always higher level because of nature of the area.
---
 You can go back later - if there are no high level players around, the enemies will change from high (mutants) to low (ghouls).  
---
Its time for you to slow down and explore.
---
Rule of thumb: At 23, the Toxic valley is a good place to roam around.  With a good weapon, WS non nuke about 27-30.  The ash heap at 30, anywhere on the map at 45+
---
It should have been the clean version... unless someone themselves bought it and sold their shitty one in its place..
---
any luck? :D

I think that if you want to upgrade your stash space then it should cost 25k for 200lbs upgrade. Now that would be a cap sink.

I have my camp by the train tracks south of the Whitesprings train station.  My workshop and vendors are in a long building right next to the tracks and my bar/house is up the hill.  In the house there is a locked room with three beds and a few stash boxes, that way my teammates and I can drop stuff there for each other without worrying about anyone popping in and taking anything.  You're welcome to use anything else in my camp but my little locked oasis.
---
I mean, there's no law against it

---
Lucky for you the punch bowl is disabled until a future patch.
---
I'm glad to have helped. I hope that you enjoy your latest build.
---
For clarification, when I use the term "DR" I am referring to any type of damage reduction be it perk based, legendary effect based, or mitigation towards any of the other direct or DoT damage types.
---
I did not mean to confuse you and if I did then I apologize. If not, then disregard this next part.
---
For example, the T-51b does provide more ballistic and energy DR versus the T-60. The X-01 PA set affords the highest radiation DR of the PA currently available (last I checked, it's been awhile).
---
Additionally, I didn't know if you preferred the look of one PA over another (or a skin) and just wanted to let you know that you don't *have* to use T-51b to be successful.
---
I sell players all the time. Rail stations are you best bet. Sometimes they don't want to but it's easier than you think. Just do us your hand with a stimpack then bitch smack. Pimpin IS easy.
---
You people ruin this community.
---
Filling it is disabled. Players can still drink anything that was still in there prior to it being disabled.
---
Stagger with minigun makes the queen not even able to move. And I don't know about you but my Gatling breaks much faster than my mini with luck of the draw.
---
Is it your camp??
---
This is the only weapon skin that is dependent on the reciever as to which of the three appearances it will take. 
---
I'd avoid these particular bundles, for the time being. I've never had, nor heard of a similar issue with individual skins!
---
I hate his voice but those cans of stew! 5% XP boost for one hour and they no longer spoil. So pleasing!
---
I'd be happy with a perk that highlights dead bodies so I can find the freaking things that move else where after I kill them!!!
---
Ritual mask and enclave officer uniform is also my favorite pairing. "Freaky demon mask on top, sophisticated uniform on the bottom"
---
You cant buy renamed items back rn bcs i think thats how they hotfixed a dupe very recently, it involved buying back named items
---
Looks like you're on XB1, if you ever want to sell that let me know!
---
What? too harsh?
---
I like this... make the basic starter set free.  Helps the player base while also encouraging another trip to the atom store for them. 
---
Another solution without the shop would be to not allow the sale of named items. Might be easier to implement than all the different skins or decals you’d do from an atom shop
---
Mmmmm papa
---
I will be on in about 3ish hours
---
Mmmk? Uggh. Hell of a hotfix, lol.
---
I think I got it

My Special section of the pipboy lists them at S1 P17 E1 C6 I15 A16 L15. Also for effects well tuned and well rested.
---
My intelligence is higher than it really needs to be, I've been thinking about bringing it down and putting a couple extra points into agility
---
I don't have stealth perks in right now because I've been messing around with the shadowed and muffled armour mods, they've actually been working really well. I'm going to switch them to ultra light for the extra ap regen and see how well I do with just normal stealth with the perks I have now.
---
I would normally have Better Criticals with level 1 critical savvy instead of Grim reaper's sprint and level 3 but I saw a post saying better Criticals wasn't working so thought I'd test it out. Honestly starting to think they were wrong though.
---
Last thing, at low level (5 or 10+) always do the leader of the pack event, it spawns just north of vault 76 and you get a legendary item from it.
---
I got it out yesterday, though really a friend did not me so it still it, im just not sure on the method
---
A Mr Handy that made repairs to your Camp (as long as you had the materials), is something I would pay a lot of Caps for, and even more to upgrade him to a Colonel Gutsy who also Defended.
---
Are you listening Bethesda? Want some of my 500K caps? This, yes this, is how you get them.
---
If the word “clean” isn’t in front of it, it’s the same one. Same goes for helmet. 
---
Much like Ranger Hat and Ranger Outfit there is a Clean version of them as there are many other outfits.
---
I will be on in about 3-4 hours, if you are on more then happy to launch 2 nukes
---
We just got multiple large underground areas, I kinda want something more
---
This has been suggested before. One of the suggestions I read before was to provide everyone a free clear skin, that didn't not change the appearance of the weapon/armor, but would provide the function of the skin. This would also solve the current P2W issue around skins.
---
Sure, I can make you a Shielded Raider. Do you know which of the four styles you want? I can make all four. Or, do you already have the underarmor you want upgraded? What's your IGN and when are on next?
---
-J.C.
---
If you are on ps4 I’ll make you one for free
---
Yea, that's just part of the general hostile design in this game. On some level the devs just didn't understand whether they are making a roleplaying game or a survival game, and made something that sucks at being both of those things. 
---
My idea going into FO76 was being a high intelligence based character that specializes in medicine, repairs and explosives. Perfectly reasonable character concept for a post apocalyptic roleplaying game, not really viable in FO76 because at the end of the day it's all about chewing through armies of bullet sponge enemies to find legendary gear, and there is no such thing as legendary medicine or grenades.
---
I pretty much just went back to FO4, because 76 just doesn't let me make an interesting archetypal character that has a specific role in a group like a multiplayer RPG should encourage, and the nonstop grind just to be allowed to still have armor and weapons on top of a complete lack of actual mechanical roles is just a dealbreaker.
---
Indeed that makes sense to lock it then yeah.
---
And as i said - you're good to go keep your privacy as long you're not hiding your shop or want your customers to break in lol
---
Cool thank you, and thank you for the Leader of the Pack suggestion.
---
So you couldn’t trade it later to another player, but I guess you could remove the skin first.
---
It was part of a weekly challenge for free atoms
---
I like this idea as well. Just trying to utilize the systems that do work in game would be easier than trying to create a new fix. Clear skins would be perfect.
---
I see it all the time.
---
They will surely focus on the upcoming Nuclear Winter DLC, which they have previewed in a recent article:
---
" As mentioned in the [**2019 Roadmap**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019), we’re planning to roll out a new game mode with Nuclear Winter, send intrepid explorers into Vaults 94 and 96, and make major changes to the main questline with Wastelanders. "
---
I've thought about it a couple of times. Sometimes I need a simple item such as aluminum or screws and everything else is 50+. it's a good feature. Also, I would setup how many do I need so no one will drain my caps.
---
Im level 230 and leveling up is kinda not important anymore at the moment, 63 unused perk cards so getting more just adds to that and not knowing what to use them on. 
---
The most fun I have is actually helping out other players I come across out in the world or that come along to my vending machine. I have lot of the weapons I want at the moment, and also a lot of weapons I don’t plan on using. The ones I don’t plan on using I’ll sell SUPER cheap or just give away to lower levels that can use them. I help mod their guns or armor, give them plans I have many duplicates of, stock them up on ammo and chems. 
---
I do runs around the normal places like everyone (WS, West Tek, harpers ferry..etc) I do loads of events, probably send a nuke ever other day.. I nuke the queen usually, never whitesprings. 
---
I think after you get so high you either start another character to actually play or many people like to just help out others. I know almost all the plans so it’s nice to help someone out by making armor that will help them or a badass gun that can deal some real damage. 
---
**I’ll always make you marsupial if I have the materials and you have starched genes! That’s a must have haha
---
Couldn't trade, scrip, sell accidentally. And would protect armor that you can not favorite.
---
And scrapping would pop up the box that tells you that you're deleting a mod.
---
Also *your. Sorry autocorrect.
---
This is both irritating and impressive. LOL Mucho kudos for imagination.
---
In this corner, from the wastelands of Appalachia...Sanjay!
---
And in this corner, from the heart of the Commonwealth...Preston Garvey!
---
I want a good, clean...oh hell, just slaughter the heck outta each other!  FIGHT!
---
I personally wanna see legendary power armor.
---
That would be great- I was excited to find that location but after exploring it, was left wanting.  I still built my camp nearby since it is amazing to look at.
---
I don’t understand why people lock their bases. You can see their camp on your map. You can fast travel there. Most likely you just want to see their vendor but if you’re like me I want to see cool stuff people build. No ones going to mess with your stuff. Just unlock it
---
Yeah, I have seen it. My build is stealth, vats, range. By doing this I would have to sacrifice different perks in luck I find very usefull on this build.
---
Strive for efficiency. That means in weapons and gear loadout, min maxin weap damage, farming routes, best strats for different events, specializing into this or that type of weap or style of play (sneaky sniper, bloodied melee, etc). Building second perk loadout to accomodate a diffvtype of weap (1 melee,1 heavy weap set for example).
---
Also there are two endgames. Glamour is endgame, finding rare outfits etc. The second is organizing stash.
---
 Alot of high level truly enjoy the game and are willing to help out and mentor to some degree if you just ask.
---
I'm curious, how do you figure these out so quickly?
---
When i use it in VATS i miss the first shot every single time and most of the time its a 95% chance. :(
---
Time for code review....!!!
---
More efficient code puts items in variables, stop the insistent use of
---
if (labelbox.Text == ItemToScrap.Text)
---
etc...
---
When the camera came out, I too had a problem getting it. So what I did, is I waited til about 11 pm, let people sack out, and then I found it a wavy parking lot. Now it can be found a lot of containers broken and can be repaired at a work bench.   🤠
---
Deezer was a real G
---
I agree, there was nothing inside that locked area that needed to be locked.
---
I scraped them and learned Shadowed, BOS and reinforced.
---
If this happened I bet there would be tons of screenshots of people in tracksuits squating.
---
My build is bloodied and I have a TSE version. I get 900+ damage with my gauss, I haven’t decided if it’s worth that much of a difference. Have you tried each? Is there that big of a difference usually?
---
Hey Jess - we will need something in order to "repair" these broken weapons back to their previous state as well.  
---
Since the resulting combination is a 2-star with the second star being "90% reduced weight", it should be easy to find script-wise on login - as 90% reduced weight isn't a possible 2nd-star value.
---
Let's make explosives great again.  
---
:)
---
I play in survival. Adds the danger I was missing. And a reason to keep grinding.
---
Other then that find stuff to do. Do the challenges. Look down in world challenges near the bottom for the tadpole challenges. They are generally fun to do.
---
Question about this one. How do you swap out perk cards like ammosmith and super duper without leveling up? I’ve just got my build set and don’t really have a need to change cards except to craft and scrap.
---
There are already mud cookies. Not sure if they spoil or not.
---
I’m now Halloween Skull mask and Prepper uniform because I like to imagine I’m some kind of Mad Max villain lol
---
Any quest that gives a weapon.
---
What would be good if you could put the handy in ur camp and  be able to place it anywhere and assign it to either crops, defending camp from enemy npcs or fixing things provided you have the materials in ur camp. Also it would come with a mr handy box u can place and some mr handy fuel, the fuel u keep having to buy to power it, an entire mr handy fuel tank lasting maybe 3-4 in game days. Also it should have durability if it is assigned to defending, with every bullet took take a certain amount of damage. Also it should have paints that you could buy in the atomic shop at 100 atoms each. Also (ik im saying that alot xD) record new dialogue for the mr handy AND have the option to choose between miss nanny and mr handy
---
I don’t think it matters since you’ll be using mainly 2-3* legendaries at 50+. I would say the all rise would be worth getting after 50 that’s about it in my book.
---
Heres mine to take a look at:

---
I use all Heavy Combat Armor with BOS/Chameleon/+1 Strength  
---
Weapons I use are AAE Handmade and Instigating Lever Action.
---
This is stupid. We see someone who sucks at the game shooting people who don't have good gear.
---
They've already implemented something like this with the tagging necessary for player vending.  That was also going to be co-opted for the CAMP decorations.  Basically, it's a flag on an object.  They just need to take the next logical step of creating a basic flag that is either a hard lock until removed, or a lock like we have with the Favorites wheel.
---
It carries both versions.
---
No problem :) I hope you enjoy the game
---
Also start the pioneer quests early because then you'll do most of the challenges just as you're playing
---
I've seen that crap coding for sure.. no way to sugar coat this.. the interface needs a code review and serious coding fix.
---
A current "fix" or "work around" is exit the trade and re-renter. then things sort "right" again.
---
The way the inventory boxes is drastically flawed. Even when it appears to be working it still decides to change from an almost consistent index + 1 to index - 1 in the middle of the choices (not index == maxIndex or index == 0)
---
Grind
---
Congrats, however, you used up all your luck for the rest of the year.  Brace yourself for wood armor and rolling pins!
---
These commercials are just brilliant
---
Oh what styles are there? I’m looking for the under amour that gives +3 per and agility.
---
Same ign as here and will be on in a few hours thanks!!
---
the inventory jumps around randomly when selecting multiple items in a row. As the Dothraki would say- it is known.
---
Always review the right side before you leave the scrip machine.
---
Shows up in the morning after 6am.
---
God bless the Two Man Rule.
---
Its why I have never been able to take "computers launch all the nukes" seriously. Even if the computer has the arming/launch codes the missiles are still stuck in their silos.
---
Best case scenario for the computer (assuming the codes can be used to wirelessly arm the missiles), the missiles blow up in the silos.
---
Worst case l for the computer, it can't do it anything.
---
When I posted about locked doors in camps with vending machines I got like 35+ downvotes and VERY VERY adamant people on why they lock their doors. I definitely don’t understand this.. I have 1 locked area of my camp but there’s nothing at all in there. Only reason it’s locked is because I drop items to transfer to mules and don’t want it stolen (yes some little level 18 stole my stuff once) so I lock an empty square room.
---
Nah, top of the world alone has ample bodies for my....  needs.  Plus they’re a tad fresher!
---
Off the top of my head, the Water Park quest, the first Enclave quest, and the Mayor for a Day quest all award weapons with unique effects/mods.
---
Free storage? woo hoo.. as long as you know your 20 hour cut off.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Yeah I've had no issues keeping a huge stock of ultracite .50 cal rounds. Even using my .50 cal with ultracite ammo for literally everything, I'm operating at a 200K+ ammo surplus at this point, though I do make a point of gathering flux at every queen I nuke, and I usually get 200-300 raw violet per run. At this point I'm just struggling to find stuff to do. Finally got a B25 gatling plasma, which is far worse than my .50 cal until they fix energy weapon armor pen. Have a B25 .50 cal, BE gatling gun, all the plans I want, and pvp is pretty bleh in my opinion in this game... though my TSE gatling plasma melts everyone when I do pvp.
---
I do this when playing The Division... just to upset my friends.
---
There's a discord dedicated to it
---
I feel you. Had to move 3 perk points from agility to luck.
---
careful, my items are reverting back to prior-named...!!!
---
Enjoying it so far. Messed around on my old character and decided I liked it enough now to start a new one.
---
In about 3 hours, I have not had a crash or any major issues like I had at launch. Those were making the game unplayable for me. Glad to see they got fixed.
---
Same here.  Benched my TS gauss until these....IF these ever get fixed.
---
I see max level “the gutters” and “daisycutters” in peoples shops pretty often cuz they just waste space in your stash when you have better options
---
Aha thank you!
---
Well, for Suppressor at least, if you hit the bad guy, any damage they attempt to do to you will be nerfed by 10/20/30% for the next 2 seconds.  That resets every time you hit them, so if you continue to hit them, any counterattacks they do will be nerfed.
---
It comes up quite nicely with the SBQ, because if you can blunt her attacks by 30%, you can basically go toe-to-toe with her without fear of getting killed in one hit.
---
Honestly? All of them... *IF* your goal is to max your rewards for gameplay longevity.
---
Even with 2x the shots you can't hit one of the two people standing still.
---
Removing player trading while increasing the number of stats on an item pretty much guarantees that it will be impossible to get a perfect roll on a piece of gear. This is a terrible idea that would cause way more frustration trying to solve a minor issue.
---
Spotlights have helped with this issue. It helps the turrets identify better from what ive seen. That being said, if a mole rate is hidden inside my razor grain, my turrets will just sit there. Maybe they it blocks their sight somehow
---
The Order of Mysteries rewards you with two named weapons that can be recrafted all the way up to lvl 50 as long as you hang on to the original (the weapon itself is needed as a crafting ingredient). So, you can take that series of quests on anytime.
---
SOLID Xbox 360 controller for PC user only..
---
Have same issue(s)..
---
I hope not lol
---
I dove in to player vending. I don’t get massive stretches of time online any more but in an hour or two I will focus on one thing and farm the heck out of it (ballistic fiber in the bog,plans and lead/ammo are my favorites). I’m using all the profits to purchase all the serum recipes which in turn become more profits... then I need to farm flux. 
---
After i get the last recipes I need (4 more to go!) I’ll work on acquiring all the power armor plans. 
---
Doing this usually keeps me in stock for garbage legendaries so I don’t need to necessarily go out of my to do that.
---
Go into your Pip-Boy and go like you’d level. You have the option to remove cards and put new ones up. Or you mean with me having so many unused levels? When I get to the level up screen where you can pick a perk or move a point if you press B (XB1) it will pass it and then you can see your cards instead
---
Would of loved a level 50 somerset special
---
IIRC, there is a door that you cannot open at the crashed space station, so there is probably a plan in the works for future content.
---
If he couldn't think to use his leg to pull the food and water closer then that's just natural selection.
---
Glad to hear it, they've done a lot of work on it. The servers are way more stable, there are still some issues but nothing I think causes any major problems, and the new quests and areas are really fun
---
Dude.... melee is not the meta. Maybe it would be if it wasn’t so buggy. Melee in PvP is so incredibly buggy. If a guy jumps he’s basically untouchable for melee. 
---
Meta in PvP is without a doubt the bloodied auto-rifle builds. You can have the perks for Tesla’s and Handmades and Laser rifles all at the same time. And if you’re bloodied this gets even better.
---
Sanjay is dead, face down in a sewage pipe at the Tygart plant. 😋
---
Damn I have a floating base and I get grief if people without marsupial can't get to the top where the machines are (SO i had to put down something for them to jump on)... I can't imagine the blowback if I made them go through a maze lol
---
My typical routine is log in and:
---
•Clear out the daily scrip and caps
---
•Check the atom challenges for anything easy
---
•Run a loop at Whitesprings for legendary trash if it’s not too busy
---
•Maintain my shop inventory
---
If all of that is done in a reasonable time I move onto scout badge challenges and I’ll look for events to do.
---
?
---
But I prefer the fermented ones😬
---
I would only like to see 4 and 5 restricted, and even then have a hard but non rng way to get the mods you want (specific reward for doing the harder content). You could craft exactly what you wanted but you would have to really work for it. Both are what I think would help make this work, I would not want restricted items that would also be pure RNG based as well.
---
Yasss
---
The crazy part is that this is a recording, which means that Sanjay decided to record his snippy "I got enough repair work as it is" for *anyone* who ever heard it, then, now, or in the future.
---
I keep a shovel on me at all times because of the Pricket’s Fort daily quest. I don’t think I’ve ever come across a grave I can interact with.
---
Yep, try it out ;-)
---
I just found a mod on Fallout 4 that puts repair bots at your camp. It's sooo nice. Also, police protectrons. And EMS. I love it so much.
---
This is because they don't re index the ID's / or do a simple check for (object.IsValid()) in the code. instead I would almost bet the farm on it falling into a Try/Catch and this restarts the enumeration of the now existing list of objects there for the same currentIndex no longer points to a relevant item.
---
Read in the voice of the Grafton Mayor, of course.
---
I want them to leave it as is. 
---
Travel, check out other player's bases. Meet players. If you wanna sit in your CAMP and get all the info sent to you... maybe "accounting simulator 2019" is more your speed.
---
I went to west tek with a high level friend who let me tag all the high level super mutants and then he finished them off, server hop and repeat, doing this in nuke zones too I went from 1-30+ in a day.
---
Sims it up, make a load of building pieces as content, and pets, and they could watch the money roll in.
---
you're not my supervisor
---
Oh dang... you’re probably right
---
Wait, are punchbowls drinkable from again?
---
All of which can be completely nullified
---
Player vending/trading is an integral part of the game. Removing the best gear from that system would be a huge negative.
---
Sick burn. I still go for other things. Sometimes I’m just looking for good weapons. Other times I’ll check everyone with food to see if they have dog food. Hop off the high horse, buddy.
---
&gt;Read in the voice of the GRAAAAAAAAAAFTON Mayor, of course.
---
Drink my caps away while watching nukes go off
---
I mean with having unused levels. I’ll go up two to three times without using the level up and then go to craft and have to use them all to get to my perk cards I already have. I was think when I hit cancel it exits the perk cards altogether.
---
If you’re talking about what I think it’s a bug that’s been around for a while. If you are in your PA when you sign off, when you log back in a world again you get a +100 bonus. Once you die or you get out that extra 100 is gone and it goes back to what it should be the +100 extra or +200 for Calibrated shocks
---
**It depends on the weapon.** 
---
For primary affixes: 
---
* **Bloodied** is best for most meta weapons; if you're running a bloodied build (many are). Demand generally exceeds supply.  
---
* **Junkies** is good for most meta weapons; if you're running a junkies build (few are). Supply generally exceeds demand. 
---
* **Furious** is good for weapons with fast attack/fire speeds, and excels at long fights where the damage has time to ramp up. It's the opposite of...
---
* **Instigating** is good for weapons that attack slow but hit hard (e.g. lever action/super sledge). It's great for PvE, if you play solo. If you play in a group, your teammates won't get their tags in. It's also weak for long fights, since only the first attack is boosted.  
---
* **Two shot** applies a good-sized bonus against any enemy, but only if it hits. It's nicely versatile for close and mid-range weapons. 
---
* **Quad** is best for weapons with smaller ammo capacity (e.g. double-barrel shotgun, Tesla rifle, Cryolator). It's less impressive on other guns which  benefit more from other affixes. 
---
* **Anti-armor** is great for low-damage-per-shot ranged weapons (e.g. minigun). It's less impressive for big-damage-per-shot ranged, since they can punch through armor using math. They're almost irrelevant for melee since melee can get more-than-enough armor penetration from the Incisor perk, unless it's a back-up melee weapon for a ranged-player.  
---
* **Executioners** is a big but situational bonus. I find it's weak because of the way legendaries heal. They spend more time above 40% health than below. The only niche they excel at is killing bloodied builds in PvP. If you don't believe me, I have a great 3\* executioners Gatling to sell. 
---
* **Assassins** is a smaller bonus and only PvP. Supply generally exceeds demand. 
---
* **Mutants** is a smaller bonus. Can be saved by secondary affixes, but never ideal or very valuable. 
---
* **Enemy-specific (e.g. Hunters, Troubleshooters)** weapons are adequately powerful, but only good at one thing.  I keep a troubleshooter's weapon for silo runs and Imposter Sheepquatch, but one can only carry so much. Likewise, some people have anti-SBQ-specific weapons (hunters or zealots). 
---
* **Stalkers** is trash. It's not even good for the builds it's meant for. 
---
* **Nocturnal** is trash half-the-time, which means it's trash.   
---
For secondary affixes: 
---
* **Explosive** (ranged) is... always be good? 
---
* **Faster Swing Speed** (melee) is... always good? 
---
* **25% faster fire speed** is... usually good. It's irrelevant on a double-barrel shotgun or assaultron head, but goes great on most other things. 
---
* **+50% VATS crit damage** is... good for a VATS weapon (e.g. pistols), but not great on a weapon with high AP-VATS costs (e.g. heavy weapons).   
---
For tertiary affixes: 
---
* **90% weight reduction** is... usually good, but best on rifles, which weigh lots yet don't have weight-reducing perks. It's also great for niche weapons like tesla rifles carried for tagging, cryolators carried for freezing, or Fat Men (sp?) carried for fun. 
---
* **+250 Damage Reduction while Reloading** is... again, weapon dependent. How often will you reload and will you be taking damage at the time? 
---
Every item depends on the weapon and the affix. Even bloodied. If you don't believe me, I've got a rolling pin to sell you.
---
You cannot mod a stash box, because they are everywhere.
---
And still not a solution - your junk weights less means more junk can fit in the box, so no difference with simply increasing the stash limit. Still same performance problem Bethesda needs to address, improve or fix
---
LOL.  That's happened for me too.
---
I dropped everything i was doing to watch this and i was not disappointed. A+++ will watch again.
---
??
---
Oh ok. So not really too worth it?
---
I actually kind of like the joint picture challenges, they feel like a way to connect with other folks. There I am hanging around Pickett's Fort, killing time searching for magazines, and someone else shows up also in confederate gear. We take pictures of each other, a big thumbs up, and go our separate ways.  It doesn't always work out, but if it doesn't, I'm out 10 atoms.
---
It’s those damn rad worms and parasites AGAIN!
---
Outlaw Country!
---
The only condition nerf I remember was the White Knight nerf.
---
And it was overly performing for its cost in points.
---
Been mostly buffs for heavy/energy weapons since then
---
I made a potentially serious mistake and forgot to mention that I added Lck/One gun army rank 3 to your build. I checked the esm to confirm that the Gatling laser does indeed have the "WeaponTypeHeavyGun" keyword and therefore should benefit from this perk card. The stagger will help you keep enemies at a distance and the cripple will allow you to force scorchbeasts and the like to land if fire at their wings. You can also cripple varies limbs (like legs) on other enemies to help subdue them or keep them away from your allies.
---
That’s probably how old he was. Definitely younger than 20.
---
As i encountered a few of them in the past days which locked their stores i imagined what they might think why no one is buying something. I mean it's more funny than anything else. And a bit pitty for them since you can't tell em.

Well that's the point of this post. Instead of them having to code or implement anything for armor and gear, other than favorites, a series of clear skins (as the other poster suggested) or a simple color set in the atom shop already utilizes a well working in game system of protection with the most minimal effort on Bethesda behalf. A recolor of skins takes 5 to 10 minutes work tops. And could be implemented immediately into the atom shop.
---
It's a hard wasteland, protect your caps.
---
I feel like last year and early tis year the fusion cores lasted a hell of a lot longer too
---
I agree player vending is awesome! You could still get your "precursor" 3-Star items with the god roll you want to help reduce pure RNG and then run content to get the upgrades you need/want. Realistically the very best hardest to obtain items should be character bound just like many other MMOs, it stops people from exploiting and trivializing them in a way they shouldn't be.
---
You don't find Grahm, he finds you.
---
ManyaTrueNerd did a complete playthrough on youtube and even did a playthrough of surivial. Same with Joseph Anderson, Hell he was able to show over 3 hours of just bugs of fo76.
---
Largely agree, but faster fire rate is a 2nd-position affix.
---
Vats damage or criticals?
---
Even after finishing most of the quests in the game, I still have way too much to do. A lot of my time is spent gathering the materials to craft some item I’m after. I want to make more RadShield? Time to make a trip to Dyer Chem. I need to make more ammo? Time to break out the Excavator armor and hit up Lucky Hole and maybe hike up to claim the ammo factory. I want more pumpkin grenades? I’ll go gather some pumpkins for Jack. It’s just a constant stream of small objectives I set for myself that keeps me busy.
---
Lol so how do you level without doing quests? Just kill mobs?
---
Come to my C.A.M.P. He and Chally stroll by a couple times a day like he thinks he's the ice cream truck.\*

People already play as raiders... Too late.
---
I've only got them from world plan spawns and treasure maps. they don't last long when I put them in my vending machines.
---
The myriad of emotions that Sanjay expresses during this short voice line is crazy.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Yup, the "crash the server" rollback dupe is still alive and well. Not to mention just recently they had the whitespring waiter dupe, and before that the player vendor dupe, and before that the Modus dupe, etc etc etc.
---
You can also find one at the Palace of the Winding Path (I think that's what it's called). Just use it as a bash weapon and keep repairing it as it breaks.
---
I'm always Medieval, lol
---
I hate that they changed White Knight, but I won't complaint too much because it was definitely OP.
---
Because! That's why, you plebe.
---
You know bethesda has never spoken out if mods are allowed or not ??? Its a grey area, people shouln't have to use a mod for text chat. I know it exists I've been playing for some time now. Keep on defending them jesus christ.
---
My max weight goes up to 410 instead of 355.

So then what would you price a 3* bloodied gatling laser with bonuses to fire rate and VATS criticals?

---
They really weren't that rare overall if you had the right character name. You have to keep in mind the drop chance algorithm uses your character name as its "salt" to randomize the drops. So with the right character names you can modify your chances of certain drops. It is why you should never have a space in your character name because it severely hurts your drop chances on good gear.
---
Bloodied explosive handmade.....until the next nerf
---
Spotlights in the DAYTIME too? My turrets will sometimes do nothing at the brightest time of day.
---
you can buy it from modus
---
God I wish John and Jo(Jo Jo NANI?!) Were the norm, but we both know that's not the case. Anyway I'm not trying to die on the hill of "fo76 was Todd's gift from Godd" because let's be honest it was a 6/10 at launch. I just think that much like Metal Gear Survive the wave to ride at the time was "X game is literally Hitler" and that a lot of people were pumping out content at a breakneck pace in such a way that precluded thorough examination.
---
Grafton I think
---
Last I heard, this was still a possible issue, along with aggroing friendly bots in WS and pissing off your Brahman in your workshop.
---
I *highly* recommend against these mutations for beginners.
---
There's no "high horse". 
---
it's 25 caps. The vendor you're visiting has spent how much time building their CAMP, collecting crap to sell, trying to make something for other players?
---
This forum loves to brag about how easy it is to make caps... but complains when they have to spend 25 of them to cross the entire map for a "wasted visit" due to a lack of some profitable weapon.
---
Face it, if you can get a look at exactly what  player has in their vending inventory...travelling to visit them will drop off dramatically.. and, quite frankly, I think that the "visiting" is the MAIN reason for their existence, it's one of the very few things in this game that builds community and player interaction.
---
I dont even get mad, i just laugh how beth manages to fuck up again and again
---
I usually message and ask if the can open the door, mostly they are pretty nice and will. I had one guy though... not so much. “No, don’t be lazy just fast travel away and walk back” was his response. Man I just spent 39 caps to come buy your junk, why would I pay again to walk up a cliff just to see you’re selling a level 1 pipe pistol for 1k caps. Sooo I got my caps back, he owned a workshop and I went to say hello. 120 cap refund and 120lbs of scrapped junk later I went home 😊 he messaged asking for his junk back, Well guess who was busy now.
---
&gt; Example: I logged off my lvl 50(max level at the time) Hunter in a dangerous area. I had been in a full group and we were surviving but taking a huge beating. I never logged back on, that was the last day I played that character. I quit the game a short while later.
---
Vanilla WoW's max level was 60, not 50. Are you sure you actually played the game? 60 was vanilla, Burning crusade increased it to 70 and WotLK increased it to 80. I quit after that so didn't keep up on level caps after the lich king.
---
How did this even make it past QA
---
Something similar happened to me yesterday. I killed a scorched. Looted his body. Got a one star weapon. When I went to check my inventory I had no one star weapons. Other than my Allrise sledge. I had not logged off. Just walked around looking for a blood pack. I was not impressed.
---
lol - you go UP!
---
So for critical hits I've found that you have to press L1 to trigger it before you actually do the attack. So once you're in vats just hit L1 when the crit bar is full and then it should set your next attack as critical. Hopefully that explained it enough
---
I am likely calling it the wrong name, but its the turrets that are just lights. They just help to identify targets better
---
try server hopping Raider Avenue at pleasent valley. dont pick up any plans unless its robot. shoudl spawn next to the armor(?) bench. iirc ive gotten a few there looking for BOS back in the day.
---
Man, ha! I wish I could serve come uppance but I don't even have much stuff people would want (and teh stuff I do have is stuff like ammo or junk that they could get anywhere). And I'm nowhere near good enough to win in a pvp match (Even when I'm given a huge advantage I tend to lose. Probably doesn't help that I just don't play pvp so not really used to it and not really motivated to try to get used to it).
---
i like the "idea" of it, but unfortunately, all you would have to do is give caps to your friend and have him buy stuff from you...
---
It has been a long time, with many games since. you are likely right.
---
Get as many as you can and sell them. I gladly paid 2k for mine
---
No it's not mine, I just wanted to state the facts.
---
Random encounter, a Mr. Handy imitates the regular one (calling for help) and then demands you hand over your valuables, his name changes to “Mr. Bandit” as well
---
okay, this maybe where i got the arms.
---
Try top of the world, think i found some there.
---
Cant link it now bc at work, but try doing a search for interactive map. There is one that you can filter diff plan types on a map to show where they span.
---
Do you want ants? Because that is how you get ants.
---
Todd Howard please fix your game ok? Fix it now, then add new stuff.
---
It’s all in what you want to price it as there is no set standards, but imo that’s at least a 15 to 20k weapon on the market. If not more. 
---
I had a 2 star BE Gatling laser that went for 25k + 3star handmade, but that was also a legacy weapon since explosive no longer drops on energy weapons.
---
Is there a reason you are not using Bloody Mess under Luck?
---
Interesting. I think we are describing two similar but separate issues.

What in name of Jas are you talking about?
---
Yeah, but to act like it's his fault that he is salty (and how dare he be salty) is BS.... it's the griefer's fault he is salty. Let's not act like when some one says some one is salty they are not portraying it as the other person's fault for not "taking a joke" or "for not just letting me be a griefer and not be pissed"
---
long standing member here with a 5 piece chameleon strength build my switchblade 3 star swing speed instigating + strength name "Ponyboy's Revenge" is a force to be reckoned with.  the dps this thing deals out is insane.
---
I knew what you meant. But my question still stands.
---
Build a cage underneath the vending machine and remove the foundation while they’re shopping. It’s really quite easy
---
My point was that the people who were critizing it were doing so after beating the game or playing as far as they possibly could.
---
If you watch Todd howards IGN interview just a couple days ago even he admits that the game at launch was a cluster fuck. Definitely not a 6/10. Maybe a 3/10, a 5 out of 10 would mean average, so 6/10 would mean above average. FO76 at launch was NOT above average, or even average.
---
Because a game allows it does not necessarily make some one's gameplay not an asshole. It just means the developers didn't or couldnt' think of a way to stop asshole moves. Or alternatively the developers don't care about fair gameplay which honestly means the developers are creating a crappy game that allows for that kind of stuff.

Agility - max it out for more Action points. Max Action Boy. Max Gun Fu for damage bonuses when switching on kills. Max Adrenaline for extra damage on kills.

Perception - as much as possible for vats accuracy

Armor that is ultralight for Ap bonus, and is powered, or grants perception/agility bonus for reasons above.  Bonus for weight reduction perks because I run only 1 strength and no deep pockets.

Guns with vats critical damage, refresh, and or ffr depending on your weapon.

Yeah all I see is someone being bad at the game, you wouldn't survive in adventure mode against me and my friends let alone survival.

Someone's in a bad mood, just take a chill pill and stop pissing your pants over a question. Where did I say I was coming back? sounds like you're always angry and you can't read.

I have had this issue since last patch, but for some reason it seemed much better last night when I logged on.
---
Laser muskets in Appalachia? Wtf... Also why are there Radium rifles in Appalachia too? Ugh Bethesda kinda not handling this game well.
---
I'll do that when you stop crying, deal?
---
Nah I don’t use any of them, I sold my all rise after I started using a bloodied sledge w/ SS increase. And as far as guns go, the 3 star legendaries are superior in damage also
---
Workshops. Defend workshop events. Repeatable events (not story/questline stuff... stuff like "Fertile soil" or "Leader of the pack").
---
Jump in on every "workshop defense" event that pops up... great way to farm plans, too. My highest level character (still only 36) hasn't even finished the storyline Morgantown stuff yet... 
---
Wander, explore, hop in on all the sidequests, and none of the main. You'll level quickly.
---
While you are in vats your crit meter fills with every shot.  When the bar is full on PS4 you press triangle and the next shot will be a crit.  There are a whole slew of perks to modify how fast you get a critical, how much of the bar the critical uses up, and how much damage the critical does as well as gear to make it easier to hit in vats and up the critical damage.  Medics weapons also heals when you crit.
---
I am no expert in vats, just mess with it now and again, but I have watched videos of people wrecking the game with back to back to back criticals etc.
---
It's a multiplayer game. Just because you play solo doesnt mean the developers should bend over backwards to accommodate. 
---
In the time you took to make this post you could have asked for someone to revive or whate er, and would have gotten plenty of helpful folks ready and willing. 
---
I play the same as you. An hour at night when baby and wife are in bed. But it's a multiplayer game , I k ow what I've gotten Iinto.

Other then trying to get an absurdly good legendary weapon / armor set of your liking, doing the daily's (Biv for alcohol \[GIMME MY DARK NUKA COLA RECIPE DAMNIT!\]) and working on making a very nice base are good wasters of time. I've also been slowly collecting daily / weekly Atom points to build up for the next set of cool stuff incase I want any of it for free.
---
Wow that's just impressive. Thanks for the idea.
---
It’s a good place to camp, having a space station in your backyard is always a cool sight. Plus if players visit, have them follow you to the locked door for two free space suits (or sell a ton of them in your vending machine there for cheap). The code is 111418 (still remember it from when I camped there over 4 months ago)

Legendary vendor.  Some new events. Backpacks. Come enjoy.

Why do you care if some one sees you as gay? Why is it so bad to be seen as gay?

As some one else pointed out, being so concerned about not being seen as gay really helps add to the whole stigma that some how it is bad to be gay.

(Best place to find that vendor is near Lady Janet's Soft Serve (north of Vault 76). You walk west down the road near an overturned bus and it can spawn in the middle of the road. Repeat until you get what ya want.)

I'd test it out first with things you don't care about.  I was going to test it out again today when I get home from work.  But I was thinking the same thing!

You're welcome.

Yeah, I won’t be buying any weapon skins now or ever. Not worth it.
---
Sure some people did, but most didn't. And by 6/10 I do mean below average. If this were a college class Todd got a D.
---
Thanks I’ve had it in my vendor at 4k for about a week.  I’ll try that out in the marketplace since I’m running a melee build.

Weapon conditions are degrading faster and faster with each and every patch.

Frasnacht Owl Mask

I think you can craft them, under quest items? And they’re affected by super-duper ?
---
Oh they could, they just choose not to. It is still the creation engine, just like on fo4 it only takes a couple of inputs in the console to create legendary items that don't even exist in the game.
---
AFAIK, The quest does not finish by design.
---
There are/were rumors that new content will be added to the overseer's mission.

I have not noticed that at all

For what it's worth there are usually about double what you need in spare unbroken cards just lying about in the silo from the residence area at the start till when you get to that computer for the door.  Keep an eye out for them this run and you wont need to do anything next run ;)
---
That happened to me to recently on PC. Relogged or fast travelled or something and it came back up.
---
Cold case quest at wavy Willard’s. You’ll get level 50 Perfect storm.
---
Aten_ra has come in here and confimed he had nearly the same issue happen on 3 star armor changing after switching servers.
---
Really? I mean, I'm cool with that, but it seems sort of weird. I would like more to happen with that, but I guess it doesn't come off in-game as clear that it's not over.
---
I ask too... I only ever find plans for MODS to robot armour. Never the armour itself. It's been my main quest for weeks now... I have spent so many caps travelling to vendors looking for it.
---
Not true, they are mostly mitigated with 3 perks of class freak but they do not eliminate the downsides
---
If your on PS4, I can sell some. 50 caps each.
---
1. open world map
---
2. push right on controller d pad if using PS4 (not sure if same on XBOX or PC) this will open quest options for daily, weekly etc.
---
3. go to bottom that says world
---
4. scroll down until you see tadpole and then push triangle on the ones you want to track. but you still have to go back and repeat to see your progress. the game will not highlight on map or give you guidance on where to get items to complete the tasks. it is up to you to find them. good luck
---
Really? Is that only during the silo run? I’m gonna have to check that out. Thanks.
---
Thought about it but not a fan of the effect, I remember when I first used it years ago in Fallout 3 and didn't like it and never used it since. Is the 5% worth it? I do VATS a fair bit but I could drop gunsmith a point and make room for it. 
---
I think I also remember reading something a while back about it causing issues with looting enemies.
---
Rumour has it ash heap events/maps.
---
Is there not a Sanjay fella on Far Cry 4 as well? Might not be same name but surely it's the same voice actor
---
Check at you camp, the tinker bench. Unless it has been changed, I think you can make them there if you have been on the quest once before.
---
I keep seeing these posts which is worrying, but I've been selling chunks of 5000  556 rounds and getting 4500ish everytime.
---
It hasn't, WE are the QA.
---
Yeah. I’ve only done it once by myself and it was absolute bedlam. lol. I just want to be as prepared as possible.
---
Man I've been begging for a cool Handmade skin, glad this wasn't that!!
---
what platform? I'd be okay with friending and just helping whenever you catch me if you're on PC
---
Aten_ra came in here and confirmed it also happened to him on legendary armor after server hopping. So it isn't just weapon skins, but armor skins as well.
---
Field medic is relatively easy to obtain if you're levelled enough to join in on Scorched Earth, Encrypted, and the Arktos event.
---
It's less common on armor... but it works. Not every mod for every armor or weapon can be learned though scrapping. Some have to be learned via a plan.
---
Add: 
---
Supressor : I just stated toying with a supressors (spiked ski sword) in melee.  
---
For those cranky supermutants with full autos - when I hit them, they drop their arms and stop firing. (sometimes also saying "Ow, my arm!")
---
Some ghouls drop their weapon on the floor when hit.
---
I do tend to prefer to play solo, but I also don't mind helping out for the Events / Quests that need it if anyone is stuck - in fact I much prefer someone knowing I'm just here to help achieve a specific result, then we can both go on our individual ways rather than feel obliged to hang around and get in each others ways. Each to their own of course. I'm actually able to assist on both PS4 (LonesomeRoamer) and XBox (Solo Roamer) if needed, feel free to add me / message me if you get stuck.
---
I get that the average person if selfish, but you really shouldn't expect every single thing in the game to be catered toward your personal situation.
---
Some of us can be invisible when crouching.
---
Use gunsmith or makeshift warrior, as intended. I have 0 issues with weapons degrading.
---
You're in for a treat then.  The level, variety of robots, and number of turrets change every run.  If the last solo one was tough this one will either make you quit running silos or be so easy you're going to think you cheated somehow lol
---
I've lost several legendary corpses in Whitespring because a vehicle decided to blow up and throw the corpses halfway across the freakin map
---
Here's hoping. I've just moved CAMP to that area, and made it my new stomping grounds... outgrown the forest finally.
---
...and LOVING it, Third person view, while wearing the hazmat suit, or the spacesuit... epic. Like wandering the surface of Mars. gave me an idea for a whole new goofy character build.
---
Let’s hope for the latter. :)
---
This kinda reminds me of the dagger skin. I bought it (with atoms I earned, but still..) and then it said I’d lose the mod on the item I was going to equip it on. I was like wtf nvm. Really disappointing.
---
I see what you're saying now duh. I still wouldn't have tried it on another gun like a TSE.
---
You can get level 1 hazmat suits or a full suit of level 15 raider armor.
---
Unless you take a serum while mutated, which eliminates the negative effects completely and increases the positive.
---
Thank you so much for posting these!! Bravo!!
---
Don’t be number 3 or above on the leader board and you should be good
---
15 are needed
---
You'll get no clickys from me.
---
I have the exact same problem, I submitted a support ticket to Bethesda months ago and they said it was a known issue. But nothing has been done about it. I know some people did actually complete it, so idk what's going on
---
does the truth hurt too much?
---
Yup, something like this would make me go crazy and go out of my way to destroy the game. Dupe, grief, w/e, ddos, etc. The fact beth is trying to claim they "can't" replace the item is a lie, the same shotgun is in the dev room, you can see it in numerous videos of people in there. 
---
So it is a complete LIE that they "can't" replace it, they just don't want to do the work of going into the dev room grabbing the same shotty and trading it to the OP.
---
I love the game and play everyday, but he's not objectively incorrect lol.
---
My apologies for misreading your reply. I think I agree with you more than disagree. I still go to pretty much every vendor camp on the map to see what they’re offering. It would be nice to know if they had legendaries. That’s my only point. When you see they have 30 weapons and they’re all basic it’s a bit of let down. Never meant to imply that my game experience is ruined or the game is unplayable without my suggestion. It was a suggestion. I will disagree that people put a lot of effort into it consistently, but that was never my point. If someone is only selling plans I tend to not go. I don’t hunt for a lot of plans. They put the vendor display up at peoples camps for a reason. 
---
I love seeing most camps and draw a lot of inspiration for my own camp. As I said in another reply I don’t need a caps sink because I keep my caps low. Maybe it’s mismanagement rather than proper management of funds. Who knows! The very first sentence in my post was that I love vending and only wanted to see if there could be a feature showing legendary quantities along with non-legendary.
---
If that's the best headline you can come up with, I doubt any related video would be worth my time. Or of interest.
---
This is awesome. I'm a fellow tent camper and I love the look of them so much more that the boring boxes people make. I just hate how finicky the tents can be with certain decoration items. The makeshift barricades you made are very creative and I'm definitely stealing the idea for my next camp!
---
Well to each their own. At this point in the game weight is a huge issue. Having an awesome Shotgun that weighs 5 lbs is huge. But back to the main point is makes sense. Bloodied is primary and explosive is a secondary effect. The third on a gun could be reduced weight, although I could be wrong because I don't recall having one. I will check when I get home.
---
I triple check what's in the machine before leaving. Just really paranoid that way.
---
exactly, we're not shitting on it because we hate it, but because we love it and want it to be better
---
Not only that, but go watch videos of people looking around the dev room of the game. This exact shotgun is in there. They easily could go grab that shotty out of the dev room and trade it to OP to replace their screw up.
---
I just started toying with a suppressor spiked ski sword.
---
Was in Huntersville to get the key fragment.  (If you've been there, you know the swarm right outside the hardware shop - full autos and that annoying one with the minigun.)
---
 On first hit, the mutants typically declared "ow, my arm!" dropped arms to side, and stopped firing, which was long enough for me to get a 2nd hit in.
---
For ghouls that took more than 1 hit, some of them literally drop their weapon on the floor on the first hit.
---
What platform are you on. I just put up for sale a prime gatling laser receiver. On PS4.
---
I think we really just need fallout gucci
---
I agree with all of these.
---
That's why i have a skyscrapper, but my shop and workstations are all on the unlocked groundfloor, and only the higher floors are locked. And the moment you standin front of my house you are looking at my vendor. It's easy to find, safe to use and anyone can come and buy my stuff. Because unlike many companies nowadays, i don't care who gives me money as long as they give me money :)
---
I will pray to Mothman it is.  Had a run that was zero turrets and all level 48+ gutsies.  Worst experience ever.
---
Just giving my experience again. It's definitely a grind. This guy plays a Ton. I also played a ton. I used the white springs nuked glowing method back a few months. But they nerfed the XP . Don't know why this guy took it so personally. it a good idea to pick your build early of course.  it increases in xp needed each level. This guy is way too optimistic. Again he's claiming he can level and change a Single special point over a perk card. That simply isn't feasible imo.
---
I think its designed to be a road map sorta of where to go
---
I always check the map for a player icon at my camp before logging off.
---
True enough but it's hard to sell more crap if people don't even know you're there.
---
Thx your suggestions, but I only use it when I encounter a large enemy,like SB.
---
God! Only thing worse would’ve been cloaking assautrons.
---
Hi, yet again, I’m so sorry for bugging you here, but is it possible to find the plans for t-51 and t-60 power armour, it seems like no one knows. Or do you just get prices and keep repairing them?
---
Actually have things people want consistently and try to stick to one thing and something you like to sell. I like selling Junk and that's all I sell. Trying to sell everything is a nightmare. As soon as you get it loose it, unless you want to try to control the market. Find a wholesaler who can get you these things on damand in very large qauntities, know how to sell to people, know how to trade, keep a log of what goes out and what comes in, have multiple mules power leveled to hold as much wieght as possible, have multiple accts to be used as bank accts.
---
When you reach a point where it saves quest progress you'll see "Checkpointed" pop up on the top left of your screen
---
Did you miss the part where it is about BLOODIED shotgun and the TSE he just used it as a guiana pig since TSE's are so worthless now?
---
I love the world building. between mini events and some of short story lines. then others are untracked and hard to piece together. its the perfect mix. I just got my nuka-cola PA paint starting from the tip on the fallout locations app. does anyone know about black mountain ordinance door 7? is also requires a key like the other (#3). I cant find a lead to get started.
---
I just checked the trading/buy posts here on reddit it definitely exists with shotguns, not a bug. More likely to possible be duped though.
---
That reminds me of my single biggest blunder. I was buying plans I didn't have, and there was one called Power Plant for 1,000 caps. I guess I thought it was some next level generator or something. Yeah. Turns out it was just a note from a power plant quest tucked in there with the plans.
---
(of course it didn't say Plan, but I didn't make note of that)
---
Dude is probably just jealous he can't get a decent gun. Don't worry about it.
---
I would rather just have a 200lb global mailbox available to my whole account...
---
Yeah that's simply not true. You must have a very driven XP play style and a weird perception if time. If I wanted all Agility and intelligence when their both , that's 28 levels and 28 messed perk cards.
---
I have found 2/5 from harvesting from junk piles
---
Enclave vendor always has ithe gatling laser for 3k+, if you can't find it cheaper from a player. Check Watoga or Harpers for plasma and guass.
---
Your best bet is to find someone who can mod them for you, otherwise you're going to be running the farm mats/craft/scrap cycle to learn them all.
---
You can make them at camp but only if you have the broken ones in your inventory from your previous silo run. It takes 1 broken mainframe core, 2 circuits and I think 3 steel for each one.
---
Also super duper does not work on them, never has.
---
❓❓❓❓
---
Thanks! Not asking if I should come back and play, because I am. I'd just like to know what's new and worth working towards with my current level and loadout.
---
Which didn't? I know juicehead which most people complain about here does, hell he still plays it, and has numerous level 150+ characters. Same with LegacykillaHD.
---
I never use PA and my carry weight is 340 with the armor backpack and 430 with the high capacity. My strength is at 10 I think (I use 4 pieces unyielding armor though).. my friend with his high capacity backpack 15 strength points and 4 pieces Unyielding armor has close to 600 I think he said. There are some mutations adding carry weight and taking strength away. But yeah with Unyielding armor and a high capacity backpack you can get better DR/ER and carry weight just as good or better than having PA
---
A guy bitching for the sake of bitching.  I got about a minute and a half in before I couldn't take the guys voice anymore.
---
Thx for clarifying
---
What if they coded the machines to keep duped items...
---
I have it start almost every time I fast travel to VTU. Usually pops when I'm in or approaching the shop with the bot in it (I only occasionally go there when I need a couple of screws, just to supplement other screw/spring farming locations).
---
Right now I would not be wanting to get ANY skins for guns right now with how the skins are removing stars from legendary guns.
---
I took most of the advice you spoke of.  I did put in Bear Arms as I will most likely be running with multiple heavy weapons.  When I'm grouping with my clan that have bloodied members, I would swap out Rad Shield for Strange in Numbers.  I'm hoping I can find a Suppressor Gatling Laser since I believe AA doesn't apply to energy weapons (correct me if I'm wrong).  If I can find the Suppressor Gatling Laser, I would swap out the Suppressor Perk with either Team Medic or Friendly Fire as I want to carry a flamer as well since the ammo weight reduction would benefit from Batteries Included as well.  In either case, end game I'm looking to have 3 weapons I swap in or out depending on the situation.  A TS Gatling Laser w/ FFR, a Suppressor Gatling Laser w/ FFR, and a Suppressor Flamer (not sure which modifiers yet). The updated build is:

---
I've had a pop at the Legendary vendor and got a sweet 3* Gatling Gun. Does the quest for a backpack require a partner to unlock it? I read something along those lines, but that'd be me stumped if that's the case.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
check the minor modifiers section... ''will only show up on a 3* weapon''... can't get Bloodied 90 Redux Shotty without it being bugged.
---
Ok?... Cool...
---
Relogging will fix it.
---
Once I missed a misdion, relogged back and another one disappered. I had to do a secod relog to fix that.
---
Level 3 bloody mess is a 15% damage boost
---
Either one is good in my opinion
---
That isn't at all what the interview said. It's sort of taking one quote out of context.
---
Totally missing out the lesson learned takeaway that they should have let all fallout 4 players play it for a considerable time before putting it in a shop for money.
---
I'd have thought Sterling was a bit better than that.
---
I could help you if you're in distress. 😀
---
Oh ok, in that case you might want to check out:
---
I've never fought more than two assaultron devastators at the same time so I couldn't comment but I avoid gutsies like the plague if I dont have to kill them.  I have engaged 2 scorch beasts just to go around a gutsy patrol.  That little armor piercing gun they have hurts like hell when you get more than 5 or 6 of em.
---
I don’t bother with them, but I do love variety. Please do not take anything away that requires players to come together. This game is lonely enough.
---
That is an event that I forgot about, I haven't been to Morgantown for long time. Was near it joined the event and it is pretty good for easy grub and a real good event for lower levels.
---
No they aren't
---
Obviously I've never seen how you actually play but if I could offer some critique of my own:
---
**×** Sturdy Frame may be more beneficial just as you're leaving your camp and carrying just your essential Aid and no Junk, but within half hour once you start looting stuff you'll probably find Pack Rat and Travelling Pharmacy can lower your carry weight a lot more. 
---
**×** Tenderizer has diminishing returns after the first rank, I would use the last 2 points of that + scrap Travel Agent and put those 3 into Lone Wanderer (if you team up a lot then there's other options, I just don't think what you currently have in CHR to be worth the perk points)
---
**×** Drop a couple points of Gunsmith. As long as you use Weapons Artisan I found the 20% doesn't make much of a difference, and you can use the spare points to increase your damage/armor penetration/damage mitigation.
---
**×** Same thing with White Knight, but personally I only equip it when I need to repair my armor, which isn't often. Especially if you use sneak attacks, enemies won't be damaging you often and Fix It Good is like Weapons Artisan in that it makes it fairly redundant.
---
**×** Light Footed isn't really needed, bear traps and spike boards don't do much damage and mines, as rare as they are, give you plenty of warning to sprint out of the way.
---
This is just advice though man and with how you play the game some of this may be irrelevant, just my 2¢.
---
I've never really heard of Gatling Guns being in the "heavily duped" category, but I guess anything is possible. Purchased that one 3-4 months ago. Prior to the TSE nerf even iirc. Was told it was a one off WS drop, but who knows.
---
And your documented proof is where?
---
I shouldn't have said it's not too hard... It was a challenge to grind that many caps, but honestly what else am I going to do with 20 assault rifles and combat shotguns but sell them to the vendors. Once I stopped spending so many caps on plans the caps just kinda started building up.
---
It will be my 1st venture into the mode for the same reason (weapon), my plan is to stay on the outskirts of the map, steer clear of the train stations and stay off the leaderboard, I don’t have any god roll armour to protect me so that’s my survival strategy lol
---
I don't quite understand the legend, can you please explain for my dumb ass?
---
Just going to, late to the party, I use Full Charge, sprint everywhere, don’t use VATS, and only “power attack” on the Charge. 
---
Still haven’t cleared my stock that I built up in January.
---
I'd love to see them revamp it while retaining the 80s terminal aesthetic because imo, that adds a lot of flavor to the game. Maybe they should look at some best-of UI design from 80s software before GUIs came along and see what they can emulate.
---
There are 3-4 North of Huntersville all the way up the hill. Find the Lead deposit, they are right along the ridge by there. Usually there is someone's camp there on the lead deposit so might be easy to fast travel.
---
Oh. I'm on PC, bad luck. I hope you find someone who can help you.
---
Dump all your junk
---
Stay away from trainstations
---
Use events to fast travel
---
Don't wave at the "friendly" lvl 40 you see
---
If it worries you, suicide if you pop up in top 3
---
It's really not so bad
---
SUPPRESSING FIRE!!!!!!!!
---
Damn yeah just noticed that from checking out the other guys build. Think I might drop a couple points of STR and one off INT and give it a raz, cheers for the info.
---
Thanks man!
---
oh wow i have never once gone inside...always make it a point to blow up any bus i come across
---
For anyone that doesn’t want to click. Todd Howard basically admits that they knew the game wasn’t going to be well received but he said they released it anyway because it’s not about what the game is on release day but what the game grows into over the months after it’s release. Which I think is fucking nonsense.
---
I could help you if you're on PC.
---
Sounds like your one of them bunker dwellling free staters. 
---
Tips hat.
---
Are you on PC? I can help you.
---
Interesting that it specifically stripped explosive from each. Makes me wonder if they're planning on removing that affix from the loot tables.
---
As Cousin Eddie would say, “*She's a beaut*, *Clark*!” 
---
After countless pistols she finally hooked me up with a 3\* AAE Gatling gun. I'm still hunting for a boomtastic .50 to round out the heavy gun build
---
How do you get that much damage from a crossbow?
---
It works day or night brother
---
Are you on PC? I could help you.
---
I love that!
---
They already know (See: Dog skins in CC in FO4). It's probably a practical or technical limitation they havn't sorted yet
---
Definitely. Just shreds you. I absolutely despise  cloaking assautrons of any level. Worst part of the silo run for me.... besides constantly getting lost. :)
---
I’ve got \~300 hours in this game at level 119. I finally hit the point where there’s literally no reason to continue to play. There’s nothing to work for, nothing to explore, nothing…interesting. I just started my first ever play through with Skyrim and man I’m loving it. But, my point is it’s kind of refreshing to step away from this game and this community I’ll admit. It’s so toxic. There’s so many issues all the time and I just know how Beth responded to stuff like this now. So much that needs to be fixed but the Atom Shop receives so much attention and priority any times there’s an exploit or an issue. I’m also just tired of people finding some positive to nullify all this, for the lack of a better word, bullshit. I just feel bad for all the people fucked here and there. 
---
Todd literally just said the game did so well. Then where the hell is everyone’s canvas bad you douche?
---
Look another one of these videos.
---
Yeah, fuck that bus right in its Wang with a dump truck. I was running from some ghouls a little while back and ran inside, boom. Did get some decent xp for the horde of ghouls that died with me in the explosion.
---
i did mine solo, but if you want the aquatic badge you'll need to revive another player in water so you'll need someone else. Otherwise, solo is totally fine
---
Are you on PC? I can help.
---
I'd wager there is more content to be seen at the Crashed Station, as well as the Toxic Valley in general.
---
Just think how much got added through Wild Appalachia. There is potential for some meaty additions to that area.
---
That’s strange. Ok thanks. :)
---
You saved me time. Thanks
---
This!! It's not so bad. To be honest, it is lots of fun!
---
We will find a secrete magical elevator that shoots us up to space to explore the sister space station and the horror it brings.
---
Even know I'm just being silly, I wouldn't mind that at all at this point.  Gimmi more content!
---
If you take the MIRV launcher off of the Daiseycutter it weighs 2lbs - I used to carry it around to use whenever I found a mininuke, and I thought it was 2lbs well worth it. 
---
Cold Case in the Toxic Valley gives you an smg that has a unique effect that isn't on an other weapon (lights enemies on fire), and if you like named weapons and pistols you're given an anti-armour .44 pistol called the Summerset Special when you complete the Final Departure quest at the Morgentown Airport
---
What a strange advertisement for power armor jet packs...
---
I like this. Obviously it would need to be subtle enough to work in. Here are some ideas:
---
* Chameleon - No change, but I'd love to see this mutation reworked
---
* Bird Bones - No change
---
* Eagle Eyes - Player eyes given unique texture
---
* Egg Head - Slightly increased cranium size
---
* Electrically Charged - Occasional electrical sparks around hands
---
* Empath - No change
---
* Grounded - No change
---
* Healing Factor - No change
---
* Herbavore/Carnivore - I wanted to do something with the teeth, but I don't think the player ever opens their mouth.
---
* Marsupial - Leg bulk slightly increased
---
* Scaly Skin - subtle scale highlights
---
* Speed Demon - No change
---
* Talons - Claw-like fingernails
---
* Twisted Muscle - Slightly-altered normal map to have more defined muscle tone.
---
* Herd Mentality - No change
---
* Unstable Isotope - Subtle green glow similar to a glowing monster, but less pronounced.
---
* Plague Walker - Player eminates a gas-like aura
---
That happens when you try to charge the Gauss Rifle before getting a VATS lock.  Probably a deliberate design choice to distinguish the Gauss Rifle from the instant shot rifles.
---
Try entering VATS, *wait* for the 95% to display, *then* start charging.
---
I can help! What platform?
---
I forget about it most days.. wasn't sure how I triggered it before so couldn't repeat. I always remember when I go to flatwoods though!
---
I've got a Plan: Deep Pocketed Robot Armor Chest for sale. I'm on PC.
---
i miss those days
---
Lol you didnt read what I said right.  I said one or two mistakes is no big deal, not to worry about them.  Not set it up however you can fix your catastrophic mess ups later.  Big difference there.
---
And to level fast, get out of the whitespring, do some events while you grind, get your xp buffs, and you will be surprised how fast you level.  You do have to be committed though and not spend 2 hours shopping or server hopping for rare spawns.
---
When I saw you could load 500 rounds I was like ummm uh oh!
---
The devs knew exactly what was going on and added in pvp damage to CAMP's purposefully. It isn't greifing or being an asshole to PVP in a game with PVP. That would be like going and playing Rust and getting angry that someone destroys your base. It is literally part of the game, and one of the reason people play survival games. Remember fo76 was advertised as a survival game. So to act like playing the game within the game style it is, isn't being an asshole. Just because you don't like the PVP aspect of the game doesn't make it wrong.
---
Mabey take a screen shot of or video of a 200% overrepaired weapon before and after killing all supermutants at westek. Do it this week and mabey again in a couple weeks after another big patch and share results.
---
I dont disagree and am genuinely interested in results. Proof prevails over unverified beliefs on this reddit most* of the time.
---
Which bus is that?  There are several busses in Whitespring and I've never seen one trapped like that.
---
Happens to the best of us.
---
If your gun is away you cannot be targeted with VATS. So full Sprint and gun away is preferred travel method for Survival.
---
Keep your gun away to avoid being a red dot on others radar. If you sneak you have no dot. So sneak gun away most people won't see you.
---
Get a chameleon armor piece and be sure to take it off and put it back on once per fast travel cause it's bugged.
---
Leave your junk in your stash.
---
Watch where the fighting is happening on the map and avoid it.
---
Only carry some stimpacks and some food and water and radaway. 
---
If someone engages run away. It's hard to hit a moving target. If they are chasing you forever fight back. Just.to try it. You may like it.
---
It's terrible and you should sell it to me! /s but really thats a great combo, it would be my dream for any of my heavy builds!
---
Launch more nukes, harvest fluxes, nab serums recipes, collect legendaries for your build. Refine your character build, player vending, hit up Biv to learn the alcohol recipes, explore every inch of the map like a true Fallout junkie. PvP.
---
Very nice! Yeah I have quite the collection of TSE and other exploding weapons but I've yet to get an AAE.
---
Just outside the side entrance on the side of the building towards the golf club. There are two busses there, I think they are dark green.
---
I hate the screaming so much.
---
Deathclaw Wellington if you have the patience to hoard deathclaw eggs
---
2-3* Legendarys at 50?!
---
Not through natural playing you won’t, unless you’re truly favoured by RNGesus.
---
Hard to do when there's 3 people on the server total :P
---
Yup, and then everyone in here claims, "your just on the hate bandwagon of the game from Youtubers." 
---
Uh, no that isn't the case, I'm pissed because the game is a rushed money grab, nothing more. There is a reason why it was being given away with used controllers, and zip tied to xbox's because the stores couldn't even GIVE it away with how badly it does.
---
I've streamed the game on facebook so my friends could check it out and see if they wanted to try it. Lets just say after 20 minutes they all said "oh hell no", and I didn't say anything bad about the game, they got that feeling after watching me play it.
---
Hmmm...I found a floating base on PC that required running along a monorail track to get to it, followed by marsupial + jetpack jumps to get to the upper level...was that you?!
---
Maintains willful ignorance and proceeds to waste their own time posting on the thread.
---
I use the level 46 Assaultron in silo runs as my damage reference. Using my bloodied lever I can two shot it with 10% Bloody Mess, and it takes 3 shots without. In that case it makes a little difference. Shooting mole rats, it makes no difference. 
---
There are plenty of other ways to pick up 15 or 25% more and even more damage when you need it, such as drugs and alcohol. 
---
I occasionally have issues with looting, but eventually it will turn into a mush pile that I can loot. Nothing better than waiting 5 minutes to get a legendary wood left arm.
---
Todd Howard is patiently watching you to disconnect you right at that spot.
---
Don't remember where but that was my understanding as well. Maybe they would add more content to that mission since you never find a body.
---
"Do I have a moment to talk about your Queen? No I hav........ argh ack..... TOGETHER...ALWAYS"
---
Did we really need a repost after 30 minutes?
---
All Rise from Mayor far a day is one to watch out for. The Enclave item is a bit junk, though is unique.
---
Just yesterday I was contiplating spending 14K on a legendary rifle...and the camp dissolved around me.  His loss I suppose.  Upon relection it was overpriced and I wouldn't have used it much, but it was very cool.
---
10 hours is really not that long for a response :/
---
ooooooh thanks for this.
---
Todd there in his office looking at quest progress and kicking players off servers and giggling to himself
---
I had this same question before I realized it was coming from my unyielding armor. Every time I would get rid of rads, my carry weight dropped (healing factor mutation).
---
I've spent a lot of time in this mode, mostly just to grind XP. I really don't care to hunt other players down or instigate PvP, but I have pretty much seen it all.
---
 These are just a few tips off the top of my head. I'll edit in more when the ideas come to me;
---
-Be careful if your on the leader board and are at your base. Normally, bases are indestructible. But if another player damages you while your at your base, they are free to wreck havoc.
---
-I recommend building a walled off 4x4 panic room in your base and lock yourself in for crafting and stashing purposes.
---
-Marathoner perk is somewhat recommended, fast travel is limited you need to be constantly on the move whether if your on the leaderboard or not.
---
-Also, if you have a piece of chameleon armor, equip and bring that in with you. There will be moments when you need to check your inventory or map, and without that armor piece, your a sitting duck.
---
-Turning down the 'in game music' and turning up the 'footsteps' sfx can be a lifesaver. I wouldn't recommend running around in power armor, its noisy as shit and other players will be able to hear you a mile away.
---
-Never sprint near railroad stations, always sneak. When you sprint, your blip can show up on other players radar. 
---
-Most team invites are traps, especially if your on the leaderboard
---
-Everyone has a right to protect their crops! Unless you have decent Agility for sneaking, expect hostile turrets if you fast travel to someones vendor camp.
---
I swear Bethesda created the whole armor piercing vs damage reduction equation to make things complicated and then decided to say fuck it and gave the Gutsy infinite armor pen.
---
If you think the minigun goes through ammo fast, don't try the 50 cal.
---
they do
---
Agreed a good build will make things easier. My build kills everything ( not bloodied) and is versatile enough to cover heavy guns rifles mid melee.
---
Ahh, I think that was referring more to the recent dupes where it was hard to find a legitimate TSE
---
ability to purchase Mr handy with caps to repair CAMP stuff not fully broken. that would be awesome. it bothers my OCD
---
Wish that they did that for all the named items.
---
I honestly don't get the downvote brigades and bots on this sub...
---
That said, I have a keypad locked off area for no other reason than RP. My vendors are right by my spawn point and all crafting tables are similarly open to the public.
---
Okay*? I assume you meant okay and spelled incorrectly with ok
---
** I replied to you on accident. Downvote because you’re just a douche? Or?
---
Are explosive energy weapons saught after or just a novelty. Trying to gague the demand.
---
Welcome mate. Happy dwelling!
---
Don't know what perks affect crossbow damage, but max Nerd Rage + Bloody Mess + Adrenal Reaction (and Max Rifleman, Expert Rifleman and Master Rifleman if they buff crossbows)
---
The confetti got patched I think. My floating confetti floors after patch weren’t actual floors and u could fall through them :(
---
Yeah but they kind of have player vending now...? And it’s really not that hard to get a 1 Star bloodied melee weapon that outperforms the all rise.
---
I def had at least a few of my own by level 50 idk what kind of exploits you used to get your levels or if you didn’t fight monsters somehow. My girl is level 30 and gives me tons of legendaries she can’t use yet
---
And Im sure they wish they did. Itd be a hell of a lot easier to fix all of your problems then be called a grunt day in and out.
---
You can always try the placing power armor on the other side of a window trick. I usually get stuck in people's foundations and walls myself. If I get stuck in a locked base and have to pay to fast travel I usually won't buy anything from them.
---
Well then they'd have to give ya the Robot customizey thing from automatron, which would quite literally be far too overpowered.
---
I have been a Power Armor build since the BETA and I like it.  I do agree that Ghouls and some of the insects doing a lot of damage to you makes no sense.  How are they able to hit you through the armor and frame?  You are a walking tank.  The Fusion Core drain months ago was perfect.  It is almost nothing.  Power Armor is supposed to run for years, not hours.  It is not a big issue unless you use a Gatling Laser and Power Armor or a Jet Pack.  Durability is the only trait that is in a perfect spot right now apart from repair cost but that is mostly because of perk cards.
---
True the 50 with TSE is like a FLAMING EXPLOSIVE FIREHOSE lol.
---
To revive someone in the backpack challenges just requires a stimpack revival?  I thought it was cpr something?  I revive low levels at WS a couple of times a week.
---
and then i spent real $ on ATOMs for the first time...
---
Same for me, or my spawn point is a little weird sometimes but you always spawn close to the vending. Stash box next to them, 1 industrial water purifier open to take from and all open benches inside the camp.
---
Would love to see you playing rb6, battlefield, or cod. Lol. The skills are real.
---
I don't care if it's Verdant season, Todd. Put me back in the same world you just abruptly removed me from!!!
---
I don't understand I'm sorry. This is a three star and it's major major minor. BLoodied, explosive, reduced weight which is minor. If it was once bugged ok, but now there's so many it's kind of just a thing.
---
TSE with my build do 700+ dmg
---
Im pretty sure all you have to do is take a pic of their corpses and it will count for your challenges.
---
Your authority is not recognized in fort kick ass.
---
I think I need to put a purifier or two back up... then again the temptation to loot them would be too great (looking at the 350ish I'm carrying atm).
---
If only I could leave it open to the public and lock it to me!
---
Decided to upload it again after deleting the first post lol.
---
Blackbird power armor is on there at the moment.
---
Also I've had a TSE shotgun with reduced weight.
---
Well i guess i forgot because i was imagining Lana and Archer having INTERCOURSE!!
---
This looks over budget.  Is it cheating?
---
I AM on PC actually. my tag is LifeInAnalog. friend me up :)
---
This week I'm on a work shift that I can grab an hour or two in the mornings
---
I am, but I already got the water healing thing done (thanks to the Enryptid event). But thanks for the offer :)
---
This was more of a gripe about how these things are structured in general.
---
Aww man I was gonna get that how much longer until it goes away
---
If they are wanted then no apology needed imo
---
My first worth while 2* was All Rise that I got at lvl 68 
---
I got Steadfast from free states just after lvl 50, and still use it now at lvl 122.
---
Out of context my ass, i've given Todd the benefit of the doubt for too long, i've come to realize he's just as much of a bullshitter as Sean Murray and Peter Molyneux
---
Both, really. They no longer drop so everyone wants one but some people want one just to have one
---
It's ok you got 2 weeks.
---
Mixed feelings.  I think they are shooting themselves in the foot by bringing back limited time items.  No reason to buy them based on time anymore.
---
Didn't know someone posted it already, I wish this sub let you post links and not just text posts, that way it lets you know if someone already posted that video before.
---
Ok good thanks man
---
Be very careful with Atom shop skins, there is currently a bug with them that will remove stars from legendary items.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwjoxd/the_responders_pump_action_skin_removed_a_star_on/
---
Glad to be finally wearing this now!! ;)
---
thanks for that. appreciated. my tag is LifeInAnalog on PC.
---
Yeah I guess your right
---
Ive done that and Back on the Beat so many times trying to get the Fireman Outfit. I also used Morgantown to farm a bunch of Scorched Combat Challenges so i had enough Atoms for the Stalker Outfit.
---
I decided to take a break outfit farming as i got the Camo Jumpsuit from Project Beanstalk and was also beginning to hate the Forest Area and Morgantown.
---
If you only PVE, whatever you enjoy using. Nobody is out there counting your DPS or inspecting your build, and there isn't any solo content out there you can't handle with a non-optimal build/weapon. So just use what you have fun with, imo. I got a nice legendary gauss rifle the other week, but I opted to use my less powerful lever-action rifle instead because it's way more fun/satisfying for me to use than the gauss rifle is. 
---
Last week I decided to switch to heavy weapons because that seemed fun. My build is a wreck right now because it's half rifle, half heavy. But I'm having fun, so eh whatevs man.
---
Pictures!! For those of us at work?
---
It's a full set too, not just x-01 this time. Not much else of interest unless you like flight helmets.
---
My guess is events like ISS and SBQ would be unplayable on consoles at least with all the lag.  Already gets bad some night when more than 12 players show up for them.

I have my front door always locked and my power room locked, but my shop door and back door are always open. You can hit the shop, go through the backdoor for repairs, get rid of some rads, crafting and into the main room for a nice rest and some music. From my back porch you can sit, enjoy the view and if a certain nuke goes off you can watch it launch. I have seen some really great builds. I have seen some... interesting builds. I have been stuck in a locked room, spend more caps to leave and honestly I never went back. It would just be a waste of caps if I get stuck again.
---
You have shit luck I guess. You not ever farm the golf shop or west tek.. I get legendaries about half the time.. my luck is 15 though idk if you just didn’t level that
---
15
---
Same, both my characters. 
---
Also, to amuse myself occasionally with the “Dong” it makes when you hit something with it.
---
I disagree that soft serve is quicker. There is a guaranteed enemy spawn you have to swat away right when you load in and then there is another enemy spawn if the bot doesn't spawn. It takes longer to deal with all that than to just spawn at Charleston and run past the downed pole.
---
Chooses to participate in a community I enjoy being a part of. Also, only willing to contribute to useful, or helpful discussions. 
---
Anyone who plays the game is aware of the issues with the game. Whiny rants from people self-promoting their yootuub profiles, is neither constructive, nor useful, nor wanted.
---
Yeah, it's either referring to the attack on Morgantown airport or maybe a future storyline (which would be neat)
---
It's not hard to find, it's on a piece of paper in the area.
---
How dare they release a fun game with months of content additions complete and a lot more to come, new bosses and places to explore just for the cost of a single game!
---
That is so anti-consumer! These updates must stop!  Stop the fun!
---
REEEEEEEE!
---
Yeah I had half quest done by the time I got out off the silo lol
---
At what point?
---
It made perfect sense for me at levels 10 through 20. Area was levelled perfectly for me, it gave me a super close vendor for selling my bulk, and every day, I had a different chance at plans. Close to the landfill, close to Poseidon, central to a bunch of sidequests and buildings to farm.
---
I also play with friends, does that make legendaries spawn more often
---
Cool, I can't wait for dozens of angry YouTubers taking everything he says out of context to get those all-important outrage clicks!
---
I had a sandwich today.
---
ROFL, You consider Jim Sterling, just some "guy". Dude is one of the OG game reviewers that has been around for over 20+ years.
---
x2 - Pictures for the wage slaves
---
Did it twice yesterday.
---
So in a dorky way I actually kind of like the gutsies being such a pain.  It's like I'm a hideous mutated ass kicking wasteland freak and the only thing that scares me is a weaponized nanny bot.  Has a lot of flavor lol
---
How about just Color Paints, without it being locked behind the Atom Store?
---
I'm cool with special skins and such being on the Store, but it would be nice to be able to customize our gear a bit more without having to spend Atom.
---
Nope, just ammo, aid, maybe some low level weapons. Oh and a fortune in pre-war money!
---
At low level yeah, but not since about level 20
---
What new places and new bosses? You mean the sheepsquatch which was in the game from launch? Same with Barrows? Those aren't things they "added in" those are things they took out of the launch game to give out later to look better. 
---
It is why people were getting quests like "defend the workshop" with it listed the enemy type as sheepsquatches the first week of launch.
---
For me on PC there are no new items yet
---
All I've ever gotten from them is stuff useful for low levels.
---
Probably not. Mines easy to get to, and I put a tuba down for non marsups to jump up
---
They could at least port the Raider Handmade skins. They likely are in the game code already seeing as they ported over everything from F4.
---
I tryed going from sniper to melee... stupid ideia, I decided to create a new char... thats what Ill do when I want to use a new playstile. And ill wait for player prestiging to reset my first char...
---
Without that weapon though they are kind of a joke.  Their flame thrower hits like a safety lighter lol
---
Vendors too. 
---
I thought it was me the first couple times.
---
“Does Somebody need me to kick their ass?!” Lol
---
Don’t worry it’s just a bug, I’m on PlayStation I get it once in a while
---
RNG...I got 4 in a row yesterday.
---
Dude!  Spoiler alert!  /s
---
Must not be using a good weapon then. It is a well known issue that TSE's Bloodied explosives, AAE, etc are all degrading extremely fast even with gunsmith 5.
---
probably worth it for PvP then, once my sneak bonus is gone the only thing that truly shreds is my laser. 
---
Lol @ the last part, you know that shit dude. Hope the Purveyor finds it tasty.
---
Maybe... that's the point. Maybe it implies she's dead. Not like she'd make a "Well, time to die" holotape, right? 
---
It leaves the door open to future questlines, DLC.. or maybe... maybe she's just dead.
---
Carry only a few very small stacks of chems, food, etc, cause when you die you run the risk of dropping entire stacks. I looted 90 stimpacks off a guy from one kill last week and just sold it to a vendor for like 400 caps, and be prepared to lose all your junk at any moment. If you stay away from train stations, and out of the top 3 you'll be totally fine unless you randomly run into another player. 90% of people PVPing don't stray too far from train stations, or their workshops.
---
one of these days im gonna scream too on my mic
---
Well, that's what they do.  Might as well look forward to it if you can't wipe them from the face of the earth.
---
Huh. My gunsmith 4-5, and my BE lever action, handmade, BP rifle, and x-bow must be magical then.
---
And to me that's worse than "Cha cha cha, ah ah ah" at an abandoned summer camp lol
---
search more, they are EVERYWHERE, under things, on top of things, upside down so they look different.  
---
also, if you have the right junk, you can repair the cores you removed.  GL next run!
---
You say that but I hear, “I’m such a fanboy anyone who criticizes this game will be endlessly downvoted.” 
---
Look man I’m a level 250 with 700 hours into this game. I fucking love this game.
---
That doesn’t absolve game developers of their duty to sell a customer a finished product. 
---
Lastly, you don’t decide what’s constructive, useful or wanted. So piss off.
---
Now try it with a shotty, the degradation is taking effect for each shotgun pellet.
---
And reply if you want but I’m just gunna block you right now so I don’t have to hear your self righteous bullshit.
---
Did you know protons have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic!
---
Duping is not a minor issue. If it keeps happening, player vending will be moot anyway.
---
Not the repair, I'm talking about the previous step, the destruction of the cores.
---
Just checked as well, nothing yet : /
---
I just have one build, and I grabbed a poweruser/power smith cards for repairs on PA.  I dont like PA as a rule, so I only use a lvl 45 excavator set, and its fine.  
---
As far as doing good dmg or whatever, I would say the snipers are better off getting a few shots in on the queen, then handling adds while the heavy weapons/melee demolish her.
---
Are you waiting for the names to pop up in the viewfinder before snapping the pictures?
---
I usually just roam. I just don't get tired of roaming around and killing stuff. I do all side quests at this point. Go to my usual kill spots for a quick slaughtering. Daily quests that pop up. Xi
---
When your friends 'bout to drop the sickest beat ever.
---
Get your facts straight.
---
The Burrows and Arktos did not show up in the game files till an update or two before they were released. The sheepsquatch and imposter sheepsquatch are legit boss enemies and difficult to kill.
---
The bugs for defend the workshop from sheepsquatches did not occur till the update before the sheepsquatch went live.
---
Yes, there were some updates for DLC in the base game prior to launch. That is done so there is not a huge gap from launch to updates. 
---
Creating and modeling geometry, art work, quests and what not is not exactly quick, and the team doing that is different than the programmers working on the core backend systems and game client.
---
Here's a fact, I imagine that work for Nuclear Winter started prior to the Wild Appalachia DLC release. And that Wastelander DLC is in progress or about to be in progress.
---
Yeah, had no problems with it until this week.
---
OH!
---
Yeah search better.  Do you shoot them or manually remove them?
---
Rats...I'm xbox. Thanks anyway :)
---
I wouldn't trust people's words here you should go to game watchers website they are trust worthy and legit
---
Charlie silo is currently bugged and can't be completed past 75%
---
what does pre war minkies scrap to ?
---
what, along with acid, can you craft this to ?
---
add in all the charlston heralds and folders.
---
always a ray of sunshine.
---
I have a ridiculious amount of supply drops that ive never bothered with.
---
Classic!
---
Avoid Charlie silo as it is currently bugged and unable to be completed.
---
I completed the one from top of Watoga Muni Center last night.   PC
---
will certainly try it
---
It is a minor issue when it is only done by a small portion of the player base and we already have ways of dealing with it that don’t affect normal gameplay.
---
Dude are you ignoring the sentence? He said "The first half or even all of vanilla WoW". 
---
Also 1.12 is not the last available patch either lol so even if he didnt say ALL OF VANILLA I can still put an argument up. 
---
He said people seem to forget how bad the first half or even all of vanilla was. 
---
When if that was the case why is everyone enjoying vanilla WoW far more than current WoW?
---
That’s inaccurate. 
---
He says they learned they should have had a longer test period with more players. (Yes, they should have)
---
He said even the harshest critics are ones that love the game and want it to be better and he tries to look past the language and see the player that just wants a better game. 
---
I think the interview is very reasonable and you guys are being unfair and juvenile to reinterpret it and twist his words. Just watch the actual interview instead of reading what someone says he says.
---
Top 10 Anime Betrayals

Mind that pie. I'd buy it off you for that, if I saw it

Haha yeah I usually end up selling most of my water to vendors 😅 try to only keep 5-6 max so I lock 1 purifier at my camp just so I have some when I get back to camp. It gets waaay to heavy after a while with purified water and Stimpaks
---
I think it's because you basically craft them as part of the actual quest, whereas the others are just rewards. That questline is fairly unique in a number of ways.
---
oh no shit?
---
i am saying that the Bloodied / 90% redux shotgun cannot exist without it being bugged. 
---
you start off with:
---
Main prefix - Bloodied
---
Major prefix - Explosive
---
Minor - 90% Redux
---
can't just have a Bloodied 90% Redux Shotty as standard. i have never seen it advertised before this post?
---
Screw stimpacks! Cola Nut build is where it's at, friend! ;)
---
If you really understood how rediculous this is, you would find it just as funny as I do.
---
I've recently discovered how much serum recipes cost so I've turned into a greedy bastard lol. I'm probably going to put it up for 1k at least. 
---
I never understood why people were so worried about maxing caps at train vendors... what are the spending all the cash on? Now I know.
---
Still 1lb right? I don’t use weight reduction :P
---
Damn! Bought it and put it on my 3 stars Pump, but I did not see if that removed one, and I'm on Xbox too. But, the pink skinless silencer on top of it certainly looks off... another bug there! No image either, though :-(
---

What kind of weapon is it? Effects?
---
Regardless of your feelings towards the game (good or bad) Bethesda released the game far too early. I often wonder if the game was given 6-8 months more development time and was released with far less bugs would all the other drama (the bag, the Nuka-rum, etc) ever have gotten as much attention as they did.
---
Only a small portion actually dupe, but then they propagate those duped items to the entire player base. You’re wrong, it’s not a minor issue. The whole point of this game is to chase loot, if you flood the game with easily attainable dupes and everyone has everything, then the game will wither and die.
---
How about not punishing me for having explored and putting time into the game.
---
I’m hoping that when “Beta” for survival ends, that they force you to have new characters for the final version.
---
Ain't needed for the laser.
---
&gt;The sheepsquatch and imposter sheepsquatch are legit boss enemies and difficult to kill.
---
The real sheepsquatch can easily be soloed and there are tons of people showing videos of soloing 3 of them at a time.
---
the imposter is the only one slightly difficult and that isn't due to the enemy being difficult, it is due to the pylon damage. Not to mention there are plenty of videos of people soloing the imposter as well.
---
&gt;The bugs for defend the workshop from sheepsquatches did not occur till the update before the sheepsquatch went live.
---
Wrong, it started happening before they even released the roadmap for the updates. Same way zetans have been in the code since launch as well yet they still haven't "enabled" them yet. It is why the take a picture of an 'alien" challenge was unable to be completed until people complained enough to get them to add the flatwoods monsters creature type to "alien".
---
Going full in on Nuka products, I was able to drop Traveling Pharmacy and subsist on Through Hiker alone. Plus they're honestly superior to stims and radaway in every way possible
---
People leave my doors wide open like savages, that's why I had my doors locked.
---
Then I read tips on how to be a good shopkeeper and realized that while I had my shop and a Stash box outside, all my crafting benches were behind locked doors, so I unlocked the doors.
---
He might have gotten disconnected. That happens to me on the daily. That aside, yea fuck that guy.
---
Reach overseer level 17 (translation is bugged in at least German and French and that's what some challenges look like).
---
That whole area is awesome for new players.
---
Yup, stick with alpha and bravo if you are doing nuke runs.
---
For what it’s worth, putting the paint job on a 2 star does not seem to have this problem, at least in my experience. I would be pissed if it stole a star off my 3 star though :(
---
There are spares all over the storage room, plenty to cover the replacements without repairing/crafting any.
---
he's scaring noobies.
---
seriously. ran into him twice and hid, before i saw another survivior talking to him/trading, and realized he's friendly lol
---
Makes sense. Just trying to see if its worth hanging onto or selling the one I have.
---
If you haven't seen it already, check out the flat earther doc on Netflix. The ending is so fucking satisfying.
---
My CAMP would have been destroyed if I went afk that long. I spawn next to a deathclaw spawn area. He isn't the friendliest neighbor to have.
---
Love it
---
I was quite confused too, I was like.. so is that it?? Or have I missed something? Looked it up on here and nope, that's just what happens, haha. I hope they do add bits with future DLC.
---
“Ow my arm” is the crippled arm reaction for super mutants. They also complain their chest or head hurts if you concuss them or break their ribs... you monster.
---
thanks for the heads up
---
This happened to me the other day! Luckily I remembered a gamer tag who was battling it with me and found them in recent players so I could join that server again! Got back in before she was dead!
---
I don't usually bother with them, but I was in Harper's Ferry the other day and was prompted to take a picture of the Armory. Tried from all sides and tried taking a picture with the name on the building from different distances. No name popped up on the viewfinder no matter how long I waited or framed the shot. Wasn't annoyed by it, but it seemed odd.
---
Owww.
---
That’s a little too much, mayyybe just make the under over, ya know?
---
That's a cool idea. Don't know if a disembodied voice over a live radio signal still counts as an NPC, or not?
---
They wouldn't even fight. They'd start working together and come to the conclusion they need your help to finish the fight. Right now.
---
YOU have to kill one of them.
---
 Yes, I do.  A video game critic is probably the most useless of all critics.  if you can't determine on your own whether you like something or not i feel sorry for you.  It's honestly astounding to me that anyone cares what any of these blowhards say.
---
You could be correct, just surprised we are not seeing it happen more, and repeatedly to the same players if it was corruption limited to the characters.   
---
If it was server side corruption, what other ways would you think it could/would present?
---
I don't run heavy weapons so I don't really need the cloth to make gunpowder as much as some players. Lots of other junk has cloth as well, so pre-war money is kind of useless to me.
---
My little brother and I had where playing right next to each other. He moved his CAMP close to mine and couldn't place something on a flat ground due to the whole intersecting thing. 
---
He just said I'm not dealing with this shit anymore and hit uninstall right then. 
---
I went out a couple days later and got a different game. One with actual meaningful quests and lore - a story. Beth deserves 70% of this shit thrown their way. I'm sure there's some good folks on the dev team who have worked hard. Unfortunately Collateral damage as far as I'm concerned.
---
Right. It’s just a time saving thing I’m trying to do. If I have them, then I don’t have to search for them.
---
Sometimes i would have traded my kingdom for a stimpack at lower levels, so guess its all relatve.
---
yup, I was farming mutations at someone's camp in the mire using their radiation emitter and rad shower for about 30 mins and then poof.  it was gone.
---
Granted, I wasn't shopping but I was enjoying myself and I wasn't done lol!!
---
Is it just me or does Sanjay sound just a little bit Irish? Sometimes?
---
I know right! I wanted a nuka cola machine in the Grill house but it kept clipping to the roof of the tent. And steal away I'm just glad I could inspire
---
How should I go about looking for strangler blooms? I haven't had any luck finding any.
---
Wow such a shit thing to happen.  I don't buy for 1 second their argument that they can't replace the items, what about that 'secret' dev room that people duped from?  Of course this gets a Beth response, it affects their moneymaker Atom Shop Full of Crap.
---
Yeah I hate incompetence right up there with  hypocrisy .
---
It is because you can't tell if a game is going to be a buggy mess especially any more since demos are no longer a thing and renting games isn't either. So the only way to tell if a game is good or not now, is by listening to reviewers, or watching streams. Jim Sterling does both.
---
Does this really need to take up a perk spot for this? Why not just have it as an option players can toggle on or off?
---
This sounds like it'd be Battle Royale...
---
Bethesda has already shown that they are capable of both detecting duped items and quickly shutting down dupe exploits.
---
Don’t use a deathclaw gauntlet to try and complete the kill a human like enemy with melee. I killed supermutants, ghouls and scorched and it didn’t register. Super sledge did.
---
Can we get Feed the People Quest to actually do like it used to and give a can of food to everyone on server? Please.
---
It is why I won't move my CAMP, I built it back in patch like 4 I think, and if I were to try to move it, I'd never be able to rebuild it due to all the bugs they've added in to the CAMP system. They have basically made CAMPS worthless now and nearly impossible to build compared to how they were previously.
---
I really hope our next special merchant is a Deathclaw.
---
Pre war minkies = cloth for some reason.
---
I don't think he would have been born yet
---
I don't have those issues. Do you have an FPS (frames per second) overlay while you're playing? I use the overlay built into the nVidia drivers for my GTX 1060 3gb and it helps me understand if it's a network issue or a graphics issue. What you're experiencing sounds more network related than graphcis.
---
RIP the days the Queen dropped it a moment of silence, please!
---
Thanks for the tip dude! I’ll have to check it out :) do you still get the reduced benefit or not from having healing factor since it’s not a chem?
---
I run the graphics on high on my 1080 and get good frames.
---
There is a bug where if you have a metric shit ton of friend requests or something it can cause some micro stutter but nothing like 3-10 seconds.
---
Good point. I might rename something I want to scrap and see it I can confirm your idea.
---
Click\*  
---
Noice.
---
The first Elder Maxson. The Founder of the Brotherhood.
---
Yeah, I actually like that idea. It just isn't very clear within the game.
---
Bravo good sir, have an Ember. Oh sorry, Anthem refuge. I mean have an upvote.
---
•"Object" type: Lootable containers/corpses, sometimes with enemies nearby, and some with a chance to contain rare outfit crafting plans (Trick-or-Treater, Civil War Reenactor); lemonade stand, crashed satellite/military vehicles; fresh grave
---
•"Scene" type: Enemies or friendly NPCs that don't wander away Tameable animals/creatures; Treasure Hunter corpse; brahmin wrangler bot with sheepsquatch attack,
---
•"Travel" type: Vendor Bot Responder; groups of enemies fighting each other; enemies or friendly NPCs that can wander around the map
---
•"Assault" type: These always have enemies fighting each other.
---
Survival is very unbalanced. Something has to be done
---
There's a guy in the mire outside Harpers ferry who's Mothman church is over the top.
---
This is a great question.
---
I also accomplished yesterday's "Killing a Glowing Thing in a Nuke Zone/Storm" by killing a Scorched person in the Queen's nuke zone.
---
My suggestion would be to keep at least that section of your camp really simple and open. I couldn’t tell you how many times in the last week I’ve fast-traveled to a camp and ended up stuck between two objects or in a room that was locked so I couldn’t get out (no traps, I just ended up in their ‘private’ section), etc. I’ve seen some really well-done camps and people should totally feel proud of some of them, but if I can’t get to your vending machines, I can’t buy your crap. :)
---
Also, fast travel to your own camp a few times and fiddle with where you land. There aren’t welcome mats to target it exactly, but you *can* make rough adjustments by moving the CAMP gadget around within your build boundaries. If you’re near a cliff, make sure people aren’t arriving below it. If you’re around some water, try to make sure they don’t land in it and catch diseases trying to get to your store, etc.
---
Most of this is on BSG for not handling fast traveling to camps better, but there’s stuff you can do to work around it some.
---
also i found the light torso plan in one of the traincarts east of watoga train station
---
they seem to have a few spawn points around the map but they always share there spawn locations with other plans and most of the time someone already taken the plans i spent two days now server hopping and travelling between three to four locations were they are supposed to spawn but only saw the light torso plan wich is exactly one of the two plans i already have
---
Yeah, the random microfreezes are a known issue with the game. Where it will just lock up for a couple seconds every few minutes. I run a GTX 1080TI 4gb 16gig ram and an i7. Still get them, even on "low settings".
---
They really need to reactivate the damn punch bowls.
---
That I would agree with. Some balancing does need to occur -wrt- PvP
---
I "hope" this is an issue specifically with the new skins, and not a latent problem opened up for all the previous skins. Eveything I'm wearing/holding has an Atom skin.
---
on ps4? you selling it?
---
cloth = gunpowder
---
HOW you can make gunpowder from cloth is behond me.
---
poss. celullose and nitric acid to make nitrocelullose. Likely to blow up in your face, but , hey ho
---
X3 pics of new stuff for those about to get a tooth implant/removal as well?
---
Just google it like me and there are several that were sold in the past. I've looted several guns with a Major minor minor legendary.
---
LoL, "fun fact"!  We've learned so many lessons the hard way.  How many of us learned not to carry valuable loot into combat, or check your fusions cores before going to a scorchbeast queen event.  It hurts like a kick in the gut when it happens...but then we recover and continue on.
---
No reduction at all... I got healing mutation a couple weeks ago and Cola Nut a couple weeks before that. Life is glorious :)
---
Bog standard Nuka Cola is a stimpack without the downsides. No cast animation and no Hot (heal over time) component. And you get a cap back when you use it! Also a nice little hit of sweet AP recovery.
---
Nuka Cherry is a super stim, also without any of the downsides. Bigger AP recovery. 
---
Nuka Grape is the big daddy of all healing items. 600 health, *1200 RAD REMOVAL* and a huge AP recovery. None of the downsides of radaway or the like either. The only downside is how hard it is to get any reasonable supply short of lots of server hopping at Whitespring or TNT dome 7.
---
While wearing the inferno mk2 power armor (but still naked with a clown suit)
---
Wonderful, thank you!
---
All I can say is that's a damned good question I never thought of and would like the answer to! I didn't even associate 'glow sight' with creature attributes...I just thought it was referring to a regular gun's type of sight, like a Sig's painted tritium dot sight.
---
We already see it with the assaultron head from the vendor that does the same thing
---
These days it’s 50 missiles, 5 crews, and only 2 (3?) of the crews need to turn keys for all 50 to launch.
---
yeah, but the junkie's bonus caps out at 5 (+50% dmg)
---
If this ever happens..i will build a driving range ontop of seneca rocks..and go full Phil. Hitting BOMBS
---
I do not have a FPS overlay. I can see if I can get a 3rd party one. Network refers to the upload download speed right? I have never had an issue with this before. I just tested the speed and it’s 90 download 116 upload.
---
even in death he forces you to help settlements that don't even exist anymore
---
Ohhhh... I was not here when the Blackbird was first released. I see some pictures, a X-01 variant.
---
It looks cool...
---
But I do not use the X-01 (yet), I stick with my trusty t51b.
---
Had my wisdom teeth pulled last week. You should get free Atom points for your suffering you are about to endure.
---
what system are you one?
---
The never disabled the drinking from punchbowls, only putting new stuff into punchbowls.
---
SO post-patch, visitors could drink any alcohol still in there, but once it ran out it's done.
---
How can it be WORSE than F04? There's no way to fix it huh?
---
Holy shit dude. 
---
Let’s not even talk about the new events. Maybe I’ll log back in and do the imposter event for a fourth Fedora.
---
On your nokia smart condom
---
I'll have to keep an eye out for that! I hate the Mire but I've been patrolling that stretch of road lately trying to find a pet to tame.
---
They don’t do anything about the duped items, and the dupe exploits are shut down relatively quickly, but not so quick as to not flood the game with a fresh new tsunami of duped items. I’m not saying OPs solution is correct, but I’m saying you describing it as minor is incorrect.
---
Just one clarification, you said keep your gun away to avoid being a red dot but then you say if you sneak you have no dot. So is just putting the gun away enough to have no dot or do you have to sneak as well?
---
Aten_ra said in that thread it even effects armor skins. he lost a star on legendary armor just by switching servers. Also the responder skin isn't new. It is like 2 weeks old.
---
Almost level 300 and the fusion core one still gets me.
---
Gotcha, haha.
---
This is what keeps me up at night. Losing Señor Toady Frogface is my biggest nightmare.
---
PS4
---
Yikes.
---
99% is a made up number. There are plenty of legit examples too.
---
You make a fair point about not being able to rent games anymore. This guy just seems like a huge  jagoff and you couldn't pay me to watch anything else he's done.
---
Not fo4, patch 4, the one prior to the screw up where they released a "new" patch that was actually built on an old build of the game and brought back all the bugs they had patched out before it.
---
Survival is in beta still. They want people with full builds and max damage to stress the concept. 
---
When it gets out of beta I am expecting a season type setup where everyone starts the season at lvl 1 and each season having rule variations.
---
The poison goes bad eventually though, doesn't it? They're still composed of organic compounds
---
It's better if you can convince them using your vast powers of persuasion. Consider maxing your charisma. Maybe build a nice little enclosure for them to aimlessly mill about in.
---
Then you can advertise them as free range players
---

Is the Greaser Jacket and Jeans in the shop any different from what you find randomly in the game?
---
kk thanks for the heads up
---
damn i have a heavy robot chest plan in my vending but i'm on xbox
---
womp womp
---
It is because of how everyone acts when anyone dares criticize this game he figures if he is going to get hate either way, might as well have a laugh about it.
---
It is a very british style of humor, like old top gear.
---
I’m getting a tooth pulled and an implant put in as well as getting an upper wisdom tooth removed....
---
Not even gone in yet and I already want to die, at least they are knocking me out instead of forcing Novocain... I have a hyper metabolism and burn pain meds in minutes, Novocain lasts 10 seconds and nobody believed me when they removed my lower wisdom teeth...
---
Probably one of the dumbest ideas I’ve heard so far lol.
---
Only way to make sure is rejoining someone that was on that server. Chances are good you weren't, and if you logged back onto a different server of course your workshop wouldn't be there.
---
That was just a bug, but if people fast-travel to Morgan town when it is going on they would get it. Maybe they could even lend a hand to the poor lost newbies running around the plant...
---
There is a clean Responder Cop Cap that is only named "Cop Cap"
---
The outfit naming is very inconsistent in this game.
---
You say bug. I say feature.
---
I did google it, hence my source, that proves your statement wrong... 
---
You have provided zero source that supports your comments. I once got a Bloodied TSE with VATS crit 50 and swing speed lever action handmade...
---
Settlement building would still be junk. Fun game but I think they should have looked at what modders were doing with the engine and learn from that, but they put all their energy into online. Still fun though so...
---
It's like he's saying "Mama Dolce's" in quotes.  *I think he knows*.
---
Lucky on getting knocked out, my insurance would not pay for me to be knocked out. That should make the whole thing better for ya. Good luck buddy!
---
I've looted TWO dog helmets so far in-game. WHY BETHESDA?! Why get my hopes up with dog armor when it's borderline impossible to find a dog to tame and even if we DO find one, we can't put hats on it?!
---
I would definitely pay atoms for pet skins/gear.
---
Yeah Idc about karma people who do are weird lmao downvote me to pieces I won’t lose peace of mind😂  at this point my only issue with the game is maintenance it happens too often there’s no modern game that has maintenance this often just fix the issues the first time &amp; we’ll be good lmao
---
I’m saying FO4 Settlement building was more flexible than this. 
---
I wasn’t around for patch 4.  I hopped on around February I think. Since then there’s been two new events and the purveyor. Which they’re too late there. I hunted and hunted good guns but got sick of being the odd man out. I just bought my shit on the private market and now there’s not another “step up”. I have the good guns and the locations discovered. None of the events are for me. There’s just new event after event requiring 6 people on the same page.
---
The founding of the brotherhood if you listen to fallout 1, 2, 3, NV, and 4 they wouldn't have been founded yet, and won't be for another 30 years.
---
Sorry to be clear the glowsight perk:  60% damage to glowing creatures.  That is a pretty substantial boost.  Will edit the OP.
---
np 
---
btw i got the plans for sturdy legs and light torso from two different player vendors within five minutes so keep checking them too
---
Bring on the blackbird salt.
---
Totally excited to spend some cash on this set btw.
---
Yesterdays hot fix or whatever really bungled performance for me. Menus are super duper laggy, sketchy as hell scrapping/selling things. I'm getting tons more hitching just roaming around the world. But when its not doing that nonsense I was getting a decent FPS around 130s in most areas.

---
Great write up, does dodgy, blocker, lone wanderer work in PA.  If so,  that's 95% reduction,  i'm going to clear out my endurance and put those points elsewhere...
---
Please stop giving these guys clicks.
---
Added pictures for most of the new things (Couldn't find a clean render for the Corvega Generators, but they look just like the other Corvega Workshop items: Clean and a soft mint green color).
---
Thanks. I’m not a PA fan either—I’d like to avoid it if possible. I was just worried about a sneak/sniper’s viability end game. I just don’t want to handicap myself and lose out on end game stuff by not having PA incorporated into my build.
---
Trust me, everyone would still suck and complain about something... Also time put into it would be rewarded, so RIP casuals.
---
If your gun is away and your standing you be a white dot and cannot be targeted with VATS. If you are sneaked with or without gun you cannot be targeted in VATS and you won't be a dot on another's compass. If your gun is out in sneak you will not have a dot unless you engage in combat. Once in combat you will always be a red dot on the compass gun in or out. Until you get far enough away at least.
---
My go to travel method is gun stored and sprinting. I never get shot doing that. Then sneak when you want to hide.
---
No, no. My mistake. I use the glow perk only when I'm in WS myself.
---
&gt;There’s just new event after event requiring 6 people on the same page.
---
You could always just use OP armor and solo it. 5 sentinal pieces make you pretty much invincible as long as you don't move, even with the imposter sheepsquatch. Just got to utilize the bugs to your advantage.
---
Sounds like someone has never got an explosive weapon. The salt is strong with this one.
---
You brought up some good points. I do carry a lot of ionized meat and purfied water so I switched out white knight with thru hiker and that saved me almost 40lbs. I dont carry much chems with me so traveling pharmacy doesnt really save me much weight at all. Probably stick with sturdy frame since the heavy combat armor is quite heavy and Im not really a horder when I go out. Alway stop by stashes to drop stuff off. Anything else like strong back is just adding that to my max carry so Im not really saving anything in the end.  I do have lone wanderer but have moved away from ita while ago. Forgot it had the ap refresh too so probably going to use that again since that always helps. And TBH, I never really noticed a damage difference using tenderizer vs not using it.
---
Probably gonna drop a heavy duty pain killer PM addition and sleep the second I get home.
---
I hope your good my dude! With all these issues we don’t need more people hating the game.
---
That sounds like something else is your problem,  not your hardware.
---
I hoonestly was just scrolling right to the R's and didnt even think about variants.  I've prolly seen a bunch, lolz
---
Yeah if they are using cloth to make gunpowder, it isn't really gunpowder, it is guncotton.
---
Their next Inside the Vault should be an interview with the VA.
---
I don't know I could provide to prove my point really. I mean if you see an example you'll say it's bugged. I've owned one and I've seen many. The burden of proof would be one me if I really cared if you believe me or not.

Nope. gave up. Still scrap one every now and then, but no luck.
---
I'm running it on a 2080ti and have zero issues, graphic performance wise.
---
I like point #4. Makes me chuckle.
---
not to sure about that they are quite rare or always sold out i look for them for weeks now and only ever found the two i mentioned but yes they do come in different variants be aware
---
My friends and I love doing Feed the People because we laugh so hard at this voice read 😂. Many “Mama Dolce’s!” and “Sanjay!” shouts during our game sessions.
---
I've watched a molerat wreak 5 turrets all in range of each other and the turrets did nothing.  
---
Going to try the spotlight idea.
---
How come? Lol
---
This is news to me!
---
That was actually the only thing I haven't done. I had a nice set of unyielding but I haven't gotten a sentinel set yet. But, I was afraid it would make everything just not much of a challenge.
---
Take my down vote. As a community, we may not always agree on every aspect of the game; and we may get into some rather heated discussions and debates about game mechanics.  But I have never seen anyone on this sub purposefully be dishonest or try to lead people astray.  If u/ethanecksdee says site Charlie is bugged, that's good enough for me.
---
Not really, I've got extremely high end internet as I used to run servers out of my home for friends who played modded minecraft and other servers.
---
I even contacted bethesdas support, and tried everything they said. No change, and I am hardwired not running over wifi, my ping normally under 30 on most servers nearby. 
---
So I'm sure it isn't an issue on my end.
---
Thanks for the offer it’s appreciated I’m seriously thinking of getting rid of it but at the same time I do love that mutation!
---
I’ll have to put that card on and try it out for a bit :) thanks for the tip dude :)
---
Get off your phone and get back to work!!
---
GTX 1070, other specs are around that quality, still experiencing a good bit of lag. I'll admit I did change around some config files and play at a higher FoV without any depth of field, but even when the game used to default to regular settings I still experienced a good bit of stuttering from time to time
---
If you're on PC, you can get Perk Loadout Manager and have a specific setup just for such things! I have all of the extra loot ones (except for ammo boxes... meh) and also hacking and lockpicking. Absolutely a time and sanity saver.
---
I got a rare weapon plan
---
Please no.
---
At least, please no as far as having a Preston mechanic where we would have to defend whatever settlement or CAMP.
---
PC here too. IGN Kranth
---
I have a filthy casuals friendly base south west of vault 76 where I try and keep in stock some basic weapons. 
---
If I'm around I also take requests for levelled equipment up to around 20+, but I tend to need materials for anything  above 15ish.
---
One of my vendors is exclusively low level (1-10) stuff at 1 cap per level.
---
It's been a relief. I sell all chems now (except a couple of stims to revive others) and was able to free up 1 net perk point (3 fine from Traveling Pharmacy and 2 spend on Cola Nut) and reduce my weight to boot.
---
Glorious.
---
I always just google it.  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview)
---
nope no settlement defence needed im completely with you! they should just work like turrets in that regard so when they die you need to revive them with a stimpak thats it but no settlement defence mechanic for sure!
---
I just about quit when they slashed the explosive damage. Came back had some fun but it has started to get boring again. The camp bugs irritate me when I place a roof and it says no it’s floating. Or spawning inside someone’s floor and getting stuck. I mean the list goes on and on. They can’t possibly be telling the truth when they say they can’t get your gun back. It’s crazy to me how much Bethesda only cares about revenue and not the actual player base that brings them valid complaints and bugs. Oh duping is happening? All hand on deck!!!Boom patched in a few hours. Oh your loosing items and stars? PVP bases are broken and your camp is riddled with bugs? We will get around to it when we see fit because those things don’t directly hit our bank roll.
---
There really isn't much of a challenge in anything in this game anyways. I figured that out when I made a character with the limitation of now allowed to use any legendary items except for quest rewards. Needless to say, with a set of x01 and a combat shotgun you can pretty much do anything in the game without issue. I even tank the SBQ with the build.
---
The dog helmets showed up when they added the dog company perk in behind the scenes.  Dataminers found it a month or so ago.  I've gotten a few dog helmets myself.  Actually sold a few out of my machine for like 15 caps.  My guess is Beth is prepping for the addition of the fo76 version of Dogmeat.
---
Ohh lol.
---
I run a bloodied build with Really nice guns and decent armor. Like I die like really easily. Like three strikes from some High-level ghouls and I’m dead. It makes things really interesting and I felt like there was an actual sacrifice to my build. I have enough armor that have the perks necessary for the sentinel thing. But, that wouldn’t be fun for me personally.
---
Yes, you can choose between move a SPECIAL point or pick another perk.
---
I just said it wasn't your hardware.  Internet is only one other thing it could.  It could be soft software,  windows,  drivers,  among things.
---
Interesting, how are you taking out the SBQ so easily?
---
It doesn't matter what I do my BE Lever Action won't do more than 530 damage per shot.

I was deeeeeeeeeep in the top right of the mire pretty much at the edge of the map and I came across a camp like that before with a big throne at the top over looking a very culty base. The guy who owned it was in a skeleton costume and had a staff of some sort and was sitting on the throne. His area chat was on and it was playing some super creepy organ music!
---
That’s the guys camp I saw!! Creepy as shit
---
You think OP is Jim Sterling?!? ROFL
---
Yeah that's fair. I didn't actually think of the 'heavy' in heavy combat armor lol, heavy combat is what I prefer personally but chasing legendaries has ended up in a weird mix of that, metal and leather.
---
Lone Wanderer is great imo as it's pure damage mitigation rather than damage resistance, so iirc anything anti-armor won't just cut through it like Evasive or Barbarian, and an AP bonus is valuable in any build really. I've debated going for Tenderizer but like for me, my handmade is doing 176 dmg per shot so for an extra ~8 that will only affect enemies I don't just one shot isn't that great really. Weird that it's even under CHR as well, bit like Ammosmith being under AGI.
---
oohh that Corvega backpack looks nice and shiny
---
Buddy of mine got a tse gauss rifle a week ago from a drop
---
Thank you for the explanation! I have been selling thousands of bullets and have been panicking!
---
I made a locked room in my camp that's only one floor piece long with just a bed inside with the door frame labeled "AFK DUNGEON". As you can imagine it's where I go when I AFK for whatever reason and I lock the door to be sure no annoying ghouls rip my face off while I'm gone
---
It's because the Enclave used the Chinese spy factory downstairs to unleash the Liberators to see if it would trigger defcon and grant them access to the silos.
---
Who do you think had to deal with the problem when the auto defcon didn't trigger?
---
It's not a sensual tone, it's disdain.
---
When this happens for me I just go to the recent players tab on Xbox guide and join the most recent one and I’m back in. I don’t know if that’s an option for PC or PS4 though.
---
Farm caps and buy one then? 
---
I bought a Tse lever for like 1000 caps 
---
I don’t even use it makes the game less fun enemies don’t even spawn high enough anymore everything gets 1 shot
---
I mean...it wasn’t meant in an insulting manner. They *are* super low level employees so grunt is just an accurate descriptor.  Did I accidentally strike a nerve or something?
---
I think that Fallout 76 has made it clear that the Brotherhood of Steel was founded between November of 2077 and July 20th 2093.  
---
The group itself existed in 2077 but we don't know exactly when they took up the name.  What we do know is they took it up somewhere in that time period.  There are large gaps in the Brotherhood's history prior to when the Vault Dweller encountered them save for who was in charge when.
---
Same exact thing happened to my buddy, the last remaining group member I have in this game.  Same skin too, explosive was removed when he put on the responder skin to the pump action shotgun.  His build was based off this gun and it has killed his motivation to play.
---
Also pretty much confirms I will not purchase weapon or armor skins from the atom shop again.  This is game breaking for those that dont use 3rd party sites to get guns/ armor.
---
I'm not soloing her, I'm just tanking her and letting the heavy weapon builds do the lions share of the damage, as I've specced more into tankiness and crippling limbs to keep her on the ground for them.
---
I’m not gonna shit on the guy such as dingus here above did, but I’ll say this. I’ve played WoW for over 11 years, managing different characters per server with different amounts of money. When I need to know how much the other has I log onto that character, look at it, then log back over when I’m done doing whatever. If you want combined wealth system with in game mail go play ESO. 76 thrives on survival and limited or no access to all things a typical society would have. It’s not a thriving pre-established world you join into; it’s a fucked up, post apocolyptic version of a thriving pre-established world you would typically join into.
---
TL;DR: wrong game, don’t fix what isn’t broken.
---
Also inb4 “you’re just shitting on this guy cuz the dude above you was”. No I just don’t care for his suggestion and explained why. Thanks for playing.
---
What quest? I've just recently started playing again and haven't done any new quests
---
The Brotherhood was founded by soldiers who defected from the US military about a week before the Great War. I don’t know how soon after 2077 they had the names and the ranks, but Maxson I was alive in 2077. Fallout 1’s backstory has them schisming in 2134, and Maxson I dying in 2135. The basic system being in place by 2102 with the start of Fallout 76 doesn’t contradict canon.
---
I’m the same build but trust me it’s worth it. With three points in it you can basically have any mutations you want with practically zero drawback. Plus you don’t need EVERY perk for VATS, many have diminishing returns. I use 2/2 starched genes, 3/3 class freak, 3/3 bloody mess(it’s a 15% non-multiplicative bonus), 3/3 Grim Reaper’s Sprint, 3/3 critical savvy, and 1/3 better criticals. I crit every third shot and with high enough luck I can theoretically make it every other shot. If nothing else it’s worth a try.
---
Do you think would anyone care about you are turning this game into an economy game?
---
You can play Monopoly or something like that. Because you can see there how much money you have when you trying to load your save.
---
Nice!
---
Ya, that only lasts an hour, so unless you have the recipe,  which is God awful expensive,  that's not a real option
---
*great* place to hide from the skull radscorpion.
---
That's only if you need it right then and their. The challenge can still be completed through normal play without Reddit.
---
I don't even want to do that.
---
Yeah, I've had that work before, and I fired off 5 friend requests but nobody accepted until after they'd killed it
---
Woooooohooooo!
---
On showing caps in character selection.
---
I dont really need but wouldnt really mind it either. Could open a can of worms though. Ppl crying they cant see scrips, badges, carry weight, ammo, etc on log in.
---
All my drivers are up to date, my windows is up to date, and I did everything bethesda support said and it didn't change. Honestly I had already done everything support suggested(I work on computers for a living.) there is nothing wrong with my system or internet or hardware. The issue is the game and how it is poorly optimized. If it was just my computer then others wouldn't all be having the same issue. 
---
You can easily do a search in this sub for "stuttering" and you'll find tons of people complaining about the microfreezes.
---
well you wouldnt have to it would be optional
---
This guy and the mayor of grafton need to be deleted.
---
That's a good point.  I guess maybe they're not doing it for people who report missing items because they don't have a system that can tell what you had or not.

"Say cheese and Die!"
---
Lol I am almost this same😛
---
Currently on a Titan Xp - but I’ve played the game on a 1050 Ti and laptop 1060.  Both work just fine too.
---
Have you seen the prices for serums? They are dirt cheap in vending machines everywhere.
---
And it is a real option, you can opt to do it, and it works.
---
BBBBBBBBBBot stop.
---
They want you to form groups. They want you to rope in friends. It doesn't matter how inconvenient it is for the user base, if it slightly raises players (and potentially micro-sales) then it's all good to the company.
---
fair enough
---
The Maxson dying in fallout 1 is the grandson of the first Maxson. They didn't leave the military base or contact anyone outside of the base for 50 years, and didn't call themselves the brotherhood until then either.
---
Do you think it's punishing to have to make a new character for survival?
---
Were they just pointier back then?
---
good luck! across the road from dryer(sp?) chemicals there is a strangler pod spawn point.  i lost track of how many times i fast traveled there at night time before it bloomed.
---
Between that, the captured flying saucer in the great divide and the Alien in cold storage there has to be an alien DLC that's going to come out sometime.  Put on your tin foil hat and clinch those butt checks people!
---
I double checked, it's the one farther away from that side entrance, parked facing the cottage on the end.
---
Wifi warriors demand todd buys them a cable.. and probably better isp service! You heard them todd!

3k for mine but I’ve seen them ppl sell em for 7k b4
---
Just to put it out there: the station wasn't necessarily brought down. Object in low Earth orbit encounter miniscule, but still present, amounts of air resistance from the incredibly thin outermost layer of our atmosphere. Over time the orbits of satellites and space stations naturally decay until the orbit becomes a ballistic trajectory into the Earth's surface, unless they are given boosts from other space craft or have boosters/engines themselves.
---
I think that the tale of a space station crew counting the days until their food supplies run out or their calculations show they will stop orbiting and start crashing would be very much in line with FO76's trend.
---
Finally!! Now can I just get my money back for all these lesser skins I bought because I missed the Blackbird?
---
Why are they so expensive people sell em for almost 1000 caps not worth it.
---
Funny, I do the same thing sometimes.  I keep a locked porta potty in my camp for "bio breaks" and when I need to be AFK.  I play on PC, so I just put something heavy on my W key to keep walking into the wall...
---
Let's see, the lowest I've seen is around 300, times 9 mutations =2700 caps an hour. I'm pretty damn good grinding and flipping legendaries,  but I'm not so good I can do that hourly. So...is it theoretically possible,  sure. Realistically? Not so much.
---
Yes. You are taking away my ability to make a choice as to how I play the game.
---
Actually if you read back on the brotherhood, they didn't do any type of contact with the outside world for the first 50 years after the bombs dropped. They just hunkered down in the old military base they took over days before the bombs dropped. So there would be no way for them to have actually contacted Taggerdy during the time frame of fo76. 
---
That is why everyone who follows the lore called bethesda out for completely retconning the entire history of the BoS.
---
This - they've said this but people either ignore or forget.
---
Well, I can't complain because it's one of the few PA paints I wanted to have, but on the other hand, I kind of like how it was special and rare.  A sign of someone who had been playing from the early days.
---
Already had it, I would definitely recommend it, it looks awesome!
---
I dealt with a pretty large group of player-level super mutants when I discovered it, so it seems to be randomized a bit.

Huh. I’ll try that out. Thanks.
---
And take my downvote
---
Marsupial for jumping to high places, twisted muscles and adrenal mutations are all a must for my sniper build even if im bloody
---
I only think gun fu is good for switching enemies so only having it a 1 star is fine and put the other point in adrenalin for vats
---
If you’re a sniper an instigating rifle is usually always better for enemies if you’re solo.
---
I want a golf ball gun!

My game freezing 1-3 seconds very often too. I can't find solution neither.

Fallout 1 takes place in 2161. The leader of the BoS in Fallout 1 is indeed the grandson John Maxson, I’m talking about events taking place decades earlier.

Lmao I’m pretty sure I made this at like 2 am, cut me some slack XD

Me and the boys going out to get some Pickaxe Pilsner at 2am

Ok I downloaded FRAPS which gave me an insight to overlay. My average FPS is 40 when in game (60 in the map though if that means anything) it went to 50 for a bit too. But when it hiccuped it went to 0 and back to 30-40 quickly.
---
probably a therapy consult
---
I'ma let you in on a little secret - the real reason people farm West Tek isn't because of the legendary mutants. It's for the piece of perfectly preserved pie sitting on the roof.
---
I’d really like better criticals 3/3 but I’m terrified of accidentally losing(or gaining more) mutations!
---
Not real people no. Maybe do a sort of automotron dlc type thing where you can make robots. But no human npcs
---
I’ll try to move it to another HDD, thanks gamer...
---
Just posting for visibility. Not sure if it will work. 
---
But I once crashed while in the scrip scrap machine. I had a bunch of items in it. When I logged back in all the items were in my inventory. If this happens to anyone reading this try force closing the game.
---
With all due respect, that would solve nothing.  Eventually (probably less than a month in some cases), everyone who started at level 0 would become high level players and people fresh out of the vault would face the same problem.
---
It is also unrealistic that all nine of those mutations are causing you major stat losses as claimed. It is far more likely that only one or two of them are drastically hitting your special stats after considering other perk mitigations that are run by almost all mutant PCs.
---
PC :)
---
[What do you mean? Now we play the game.](https://i.imgur.com/VP0Htue.png)
---
Can you handle being swarmed by ghouls with this build? If so, then just keep a set of excavator around for when you want to go into a nuked Whitesprings.
---
Worth pointing out that something like 80% of nuke events take place at fissure site prime, and mostly, folks create nuke zones that allow the SBQ fight to take place outside the rad zone. 
---
Mostly, you're heading into nuke zones for the purpose of gathering the raw materials for flux, and sometimes (Whitesprings, mostly), also harvesting legendary ghouls.
---
Personally, I run a bloody, unyielding build. For adventuring, I'm fully healed, and do lots, but not crazy amounts of damage, but am pretty much unkillable. For SBQ, I take my rads up over 80%, my damage becomes really high, and am really a glass cannon. The only perk change I'd make would be to swap picklock x 3 for glow sight. In a nuke zone, I toss on Excavator, and have a not terrible one handed melee weapon, which gets me through most things.
---
It’s back looool
---
I am confused what you are getting at, since the google search shows 3* weapons? You literally cannot have a 2* weapon with 90% redux in weight. It cannot exist, without being bugged like OP's
---
But how do I put a ticket in for an atomic shop issue
---
Although I don't agree with your main point I see where you're coming from. 
---
Maybe when it's out of beta they'll do a different survival with just new characters so people don't feel jaded by that

Maybe we could come up with official emote codes for challenges to communicate with other players.  Like a master list.  For instance (thumbs down, thumbs up, help)...in that specific order, means “I need to revive a person for kindness tadpole completion”. 
---
The response can be thumbs up or thumbs down of course.  But suffice to say if a master list of emote combos for player requests to complete group challenges exist then with or without mics we can all know what the other person needs, (provided of course that they have reviewed said master lis)
---
I play with a Cable and have high quality ISP service, but I guess a legitamate complaint can't be a real thing, right?
---
Trump may push the big red button to give the order, but people carry out that order.  Those are failsafes.
---
I also thought that the point of Feed The People was that it gave everyone on the server food, until they fixed it. 
---
I liked it broken more, as it made the event seem like a bigger deal, since you were working to help everyone in the wasteland survive. 
---
I would like it if they would add more things like that to the game, and perhaps events that let you work against the overall well-being of the server as well, for evil people haha
---
That. Is.  Terrifying.  Thanks, I hate it.
---
Thanks, how many addictions do you need in order to reach the 50% though?
---
They only spawn around Dyer Chemical, as far as I can tell. In the water next to Dyer, you’ll see a bunch of strangler pods. These pods will bloom under the right circumstances. Typically, only some of them will bloom, so it can take a few passes before you get a ton. Keep in mind that if you take any strangler pods, they won’t bloom even if you server hop, at least until a day has passed. And of course, green thumb works here. 
---
As for how to get them to bloom... I’m not entirely sure. Obviously they bloom during the one-time quest, but otherwise it’s hard to tell. I’ve heard people say they bloom during the Heart of the Swamp event, and in general that seems true... but I’ve also seen a lot of instances where they bloom with no event, as well as no blooms when there is one. So who knows. 
---
Your best bet is to just server hop the Crevasse Dam, check the random event spawn nearby, then check for strangler bloom. That’s what I do, and I always eventually get some, and I tend to get a handful of rare plans in the process.
---
It would actually be a spoiler for me cuz I felt sad when I saw his corpse :(
---
I like the above build...I might add getting a Fixer for mid-range combat. The sneak and sneak attack bonuses help a great deal...and find something other than 2 Shot for your sniper. The second bullet loses so much accuracy at long range, so at long range you waste that second two shot.
---
It’s a bloodied death claw gauntlet  that does 40% more damage with power attacks and you take 40% less damage while blocking
---
Thank god.
---
1070 and no issue.
---
And my axe!
---
I also love the way you told your story!  I remember back when people would turn on their mic and thank the player that launched the nuke.  The fight does feel like team work, if you want it to.  Or it can be seen as a grab-what-you-can event.  All in how you choose to see it, and I love your optimism!!
---
Can't you move your CAMP object over an inch and reconstruct the CAMP using the blueprint? You can replace it for just the cost of moving your CAMP.  It doesn't always work, but considering the resource expense of the other method, it's worth a shot.
---
Very well written. And in the end I miss Prince Hoppity too.
---
True. I doubt he’s aware there’s a robot factory downstairs, but he does know robots emerge from the general area when he tries to make stew for people. Poor guy.
---
Kind of makes you wonder what the process is for choosing the key holders.  What kind of rigorous psych exams they go through, what kind of support systems are in place for them.
---
Cause i dont have a great isp and i legit have ctd 3 times total playing this game. 100% your making this up or your playing on a antique console of some kind. Problem is on your end.
---
Lol, the only thing I didn't try. Thanks, for mentioning it though. Maybe it will help others in the future!
---
If you're getting "overwhelmed by tons of baddies" with a rifle then that's largely tactical. Either maintain distance (Speed Demon helps) and/or stealth, or hop up onto unreachable terrain with Marsupial.
---
Not using Concentrated Fire with a VATS build is weird though.
---
Click on Support home, the game, and submit ticket. It's near the bottom.
---
Stopped reading after I saw bioshock because my head exploded with WELCOME TO THE CIRCUS OF VALUES over and over.
---
Dewd, do you run mutations at all? They ALL have negative affects. Class freak reduces it for most and eliminates it only on 1 or 2. Those with the biggest hit are the most important,  marsupial,  twisted muscles,  healing factor. 
---
If I'd do as you suggest,  I'd have no Choice but to do it for all, you can't selectively remove them. They have negative affects,  even with using max perks, that's enough of a hit.
---
I used a gauss rifle for the first time last night.
---
The good - it worked.
---
the bad: took a fair number of shots. (I'm a melee build w/ no energy weapon perks)
---
the ugly: it was my first mothman kill.  and it was a L45 vengeful mothman.  
---
But since the gauss reduced him to a pile of smoking dust - No photo op :(
---
Why would you use twisted muscles in a sniper build? It's base negative effect is -50% gun accuracy? Even with class freak, you're still losing a little over 12% accuracy.
---
Beth has done this before just not to this scale
---
You sure it's bugged consistently? I mean, someone determined the Charlie code yesterday...
---
that was great---\^
---
My friend bought this when it first came out and his son figured out how to trade Atom paints (don't know if that even works anymore) so ive had it this whole time. I've kinda wanted another chance to buy it but it's up for two weeks? We won't look special anymore!
---
Is it really retconning if they are shown to be cut off from contact in wv? The whole point of this story is to show the futility imo
---
I'll try to answer the ones I can answer for you.
---
1 It is easy to get if you have max luck and use party boy and alcohol and boost your luck to over 30. You'll be able to get one pretty much every other try, then just got to server hop for more.
---
2. That is actually really common for long time players, as you can buy all the recipes to create serums from Modus. Not to mention they used to drop from the SBQ fight.
---
3. The reason camps look like crap now and some have weird little rooms added on for vending is due to the bugs they've added in to placing items in CAMPS causing it to be extremely hard to build new CAMPS after a few patches ago without having the "item is intersecting" or "item is unsupported" on everything you try to place. So people give up and just drop a couple foundations and throw everything on it, or will just add a crappy little room to their old CAMP for the vending machines.
---
4. That is just the bug that has been part of that quest since it was added in. Some have luck using a camera to scan for the body and wait for it to turn into a pile instead of the body.
---
5. Don't know about this one, I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that melee characters couldn't hit flying enemies at all with VATS.
---
6. That isn't a question!
---
7. Yeah Arktos has been a buggy mess since it was added in. Nearly half the player base can't even access it. Even the guide for it mentions to be as quick as possible so that you can finish before you crash.
---
8. This also isn't a question!!!
---
I would love to read one of these where things are made right....
---
ign? I need to mute you  :P
---
I mean it is a non playable character since you cant play as them
---
I dont get kicked frequently. But there were about 10 players fighting the sbq, and I lost connection to the server. Pretty sure it's not on my end
---
At this rate a year will go by and nobody will receive their bag.
---
Didn't they get ahold of here by way of HAM/ CB radio thought? The fort might have one. why not?
---
Where at? I've only seen the kaleidoscope stuff
---
Yes it is retconning when the original story was that they didn't contact anyone after the great war outside of their base for the first 50 years after the bombs dropped. So the retcon is them contacting anyone at all.
---
This! If your camp ever gets demo'd and you don't want to sacrifice the resources to fix it, pay the cap fee to move it and you will get everything back!
---
(Also funny story, my condolences for your frog)
---
Speaking about it.. Somehow all my improved repair kits which I got from killing the SBQ are suddenly gone.
---
Contacted support.. They said they cannot restore items.
---
Hope you got more luck!
---
For anybody not willing to skip through the whole thing:
---
Around 32 minutes is an interesting discussion on horse armor that some might find relevant to today's practices
---
Around 35:30 the discussion on Fallout (in general) begins
---
50:40 Fallout 76 discussion
---
Store most of it. Take just a few stims and food/water. Carry spoiled food so if ya get killed, it drops a good bit of spoiled stuff to avoid potentially losing all your aid. About the only thing you can do to negate losing aid in survival. Healing factor perk helps with healing between engagements
---
I have a few suggestions as I started playing a similar build.  You say this is a sniper build yet you are missing several key perks like Escape Artist/Concentrated Fire/Bloody Mess.  This leans more toward a scavenging build.  Invest in mutations.  Marsupial alone would give you the ability to reach high ground quickly, which is essential for a sniper or a Jedi.    Speed Demon would give better reloads and you are using high damage slow reloading weapons.  Also consider Adrenal Reaction.  As a sniper you want to be as accurate as possible.  Two shot weapons are much less accurate.  Think about alternatives like Bloodied or Instigating for your Hunting Rifle.  Make sure you have silencers on all your weapons.  You should be able to get off a few sneak shots at a time if you don’t one shot an enemy.
---
S- you can afford to loose 3 points here.  Look at Blocker, if you are getting overwhelmed by melee enemies this may help.  Shitcan expert slugger
---
P- Take Concentrated Fire, atleast one rank.  Dump Night Person.  If you want more stats use unyielding armor.
---
E- Personal preference, I like Fireproof, some don’t.  No need for thirst perks as water is plentiful and free.
---
C-
---
I- I like Gunsmith 5, personal preference.  Take atleast one in Demo if you are using explosive weapons.  Also nerd rage if you go bloodied/adrenal reaction
---
A- Take Escape Artist.  AP refresh on armor is more efficient than Action Boy
---
L- Take Bloody Mess.  You are missing out on a lot of damage here.  I would loose the scrounging perks they are unnecessary.
---
Hope this was helpful, best of luck out there.
---
Oh yeah. I forgot about that. I think I saw it there maybe once and then just forgot it existed. Thanks for reminding me. Lol.
---
Yes, go look at the post where the codes are all listed, that is where I learned that the charlie silo is bugged from the discord group that found all the codes.
---
You can just hear how much he hates the stupid machines for constantly breaking down.
---
Yeah same here. I still rock my blackbird x-01. Guess I’ll be seeing them more often now
---
I know it does but when im in vats im rarely below 75% and i am rarely missing shots not sure if its bugged or not but i waver for a quick second to like 30% but then everything goes back to normal?
---
Yeah but I played since the Beta, just not the like 3 days in the middle of Christmas shopping that this skin was available... so I'm glad I could get it now
---
If you have Action Boy, you can consider dropping Grim Reaper's Sprint. This way you can load your weapon while your AP is refreshing.
---
I know, i play all the time thats just the excuse i always hear from friends
---
It's not just you mate, it's completely broken for me too. Glad I'm not that much of a builder.
---
Well, if THIS doesn't make Cletus want to exact his revenge on the world and everyone in it... then I don't know my paint-by-numbers revenge tales very well.
---
Go get 'em Cletus, make them pay, Make them ALL pay.
---
When it was fixed there was an outcry to put it back but no dice. It was much better before. Most of the time it just sits there unvisited now.
---
Oh ok, that explains things, I thought the Maxson in FO4 was just a synth replacement of the one here in 76. Like no one had questioned why this guy was still alive 200+ years later.
---
What? Do you even know the lore on the brotherhood? They specifically avoided all contact with the outside world for the first 50 years after the bombs dropped. It is why in NV they were so against showing up outside of their bunker because they wanted to go back to how they were when they were formed.
---
I recently got all my mules scripped out..so i had 10 mules with no purpose. I decided to split my inventory. I have a junk mule, a guy i only give steel lead gunpowder acid and ores..hes my ammo shmuck..a mule that holds my weapon collectio. And another for my armor sets. One guy that holds all my mutation mats and made serums.  It was all possible after i gave my son an xbox for his birthday..and i only play after the kids go to sleep..so..it works out. But it allowed me to never have to worry about stash space anymore. My whole stash on my main is forsale. This was a super upgrade. I have all 4 vending machines maxed. I was able to max out 5 mules with caps and still spend on whatever i want. Its really wild. I still remember when fallout 76 was a game of chasings ammo for my 50 cal for w weeks to do one simple quest lol.
---
We should all be reverted to fresh lvl 50s. All released simultaneously. Via season's. Scoreboards wiped clean. No legendary effects. Have one season to compete, say 3-4 months. Make a competitive multiplayer experience. Tweak from there. Oh and permanent death. Make the deaths hurt.
---
Same with the one Always Vigilant line "Repair me, DAMNIT! ...what, too harsh? I'll take it out later."
---
Sanjay gave zero fucks.
---
"Repair me, DAMNIT! ...what, too harsh? I'll take it out later."
---
Unless the other 9 ppl droped also then ya it is your end.
---
I don’t lock anything.  I have a modest camp with all the benches and several purifiers open to anyone that wants them.  
---
Help yerself 
---
As for the tools that set booby traps or overprice or overcharge for basic stuff or lock everything up good luck with that.  I’ll spend 50 caps to fast travel to a vendor that is actually reasonable and accommodating.  And I spent a lot of caps.  Constantly at 25K limit and have all the good weapons and armor I need.  Still need ammo and a few other things.
---
Because they stated that they purposefully avoided all contact with the outside world as they were isolationists. It is why they were acting that way in NV because the leader was trying to mimic the original way Maxson ran it when they were first created. So it would go completely against their ideals to contact others.
---
Ok. Fair enough. But what benefit does the mutation add to your sniper character? The+25% melee damage wouldn't seem help...
---
given what parts are where, I would hope that special bug is known.
---
Otherwise you might get snot ear....or worse
---
We are discussing 3 star weapons like the OP has. This isn't what you initially said. You said you've never even seen it on a ranged weapon. Dude seriously are you trolling?
---
Cool! Hum... I dont think that's a church for the devil, it must be about the tree god or something.
---
Yup, me too
---
I jumped in today and it was a lot of fun
---
I keep a set of Stealth Boy PA specifically for survival mode. Not perfect, but still better than not having stabilized. There are a lot of specialist PVP builds that will beat this, but I still manage to surprise a few of them when The Mr. Clonk Clonk they were getting ready to insta-spam up and vanishes after stepping behind a tree... Then we find out if their build can handle 100+ Staggers at once when One Gun Army + Stabilized kicks in on the Furious Minigun or Instigating Explosive LMG ;)
---
Thanks for post !
---
I hope that's what happened, I was quite annoyed haha
---
I like the paint scheme, but 18$ is way too expensive.
---
It's an rpg that's why lol
---
Repair what?
---
Those with the biggest hits are probably the ones you use the serums on. You don't have to use serums on all mutations to nullify the effects of the worst offenders.
---
Most of the negative affects are negligable and don't hit special stats anyway. These goalposts are moving further and further here.
---
The Maxson in fo4 is a distant relative of the Maxson from FO1. Also, depending on how you take some of the things you find in terminals about the Maxson in fo4, he isn't a synth, but he is likely "enhanced" like Kellogg with cybernetics after his fight with a deathclaw at 15.
---
Oh forgot to include that when you’re in proximity using a quick melee helps when you’re overwhelmed i use a bloodied death tambo mostly when you’re in buildings cant stay invisible forever
---
Assautron head is the widely know example, but unlike the Wood Armor problem there doesn't seem to be a clear cause...  
---
     
---
The question I've left with is why is it the secondary AP?  
---
I've personally seen the Secondary AP **change** after modifying armor (Int to CHA in one case, luck to CHA in another) and weapons are flat out dropping that attach point (I didn't see any unnamed legendary effects that could be getting subbed in like on the armor).
---
Love at first bite.....
---
For example, take [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov).  In 1983, Soviet early warning systems mistakenly reported a Minuteman ICBM was launched.  One person stood between orders from superior officers to launch and total annihilation.
---
For anyone else who wants to lose sleep over how many close calls we've had, see:
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_nuclear\_close\_calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls)
---
Oh damn. Won't be buying any weapon skins then. (not that they have anything worthwhile yet anyways)
---
I just hate charging the gun to have it fail to take a shot.
---
The devs also were trying to keep people who liked single player and didn't like PvP interested in the game so they were tryign to stop shit like that (they were tryign to encourage fair fights). It was never (well at least not until they put a survival mode) a pure survival game. More like survival light.
---
Japan was isolationist as well and avoided contact with the West but still had Dutch trading ports. I think everyone takes this term to an extreme degree. There's wiggle room in all things.
---
Hazmat suits, they start at Level 1, I just stayed back and tagged enemies so I didn't die.
---
Had question I anyone notice if you put everything away it brings 1-3 items out of your stash when u die or is that me had nothing on me and I dropped a bag of whiskey and nuka dark???
---
That sounds like you could turn that into an amazing quest line and future quest/daily/event point.
---
Heretic! May Mothman exterminate you!
---
I'm inclined to agree with you for sure, it is pricey.
---
But to OP's question- This was less of an issue before I got the backpacks... now I have MORE carrying capacity OUT of most of my good "Combat" PA (and about the same in fully calibrated/motivated Excavator). So I spend a bit more time not in the armor...
---
Ooh. Get any pics of it?
---
Watch out - Karen will be asking for a manager to complain about the noise soon...
---
Yea that hasent happened to me that ive noticed
---
I'm going by what the brotherhood themselves said, go play NV again or fo1 they clearly state they avoided ALL contact with the outside world, which is why no one even knew they existed until they stepped out of their military base 50 years after the bombs dropped.
---
I enjoy it
---
The Interloper? Or he might be a Druid.
---
Coo may have picked it up off another but was weird at first...
---
Ok. A few question ya need to answer
---
1. What type of weapon?
---
2. Are you running the correct perk cards for is ie gunsmith or makeshift warrior?
---
As it stands been playing since January. And I have see no decrease is the durability of any weapons but since I run gunsmith/makeshift @5 depending on weapon used, even my ta shotty or take Gatling breaks the same speed as it did in January.
---
Overwolf does all that as well. Perhaps try disabling it and see if that clears things up.
---
I would love a "tamed" insult bot for my camp. Get insulted while you shop!
---
Oh, my.. running across the wasteland looking for parts for the ham radio.. and the last part was swallowed by the glowing level 91 death claw that spawns at thunder mountain sub station. better take the TSE Gatling!
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/) 
---
Updated all the time! All three silo launch codes!
---
It can only be a server side storage issue or the server code manipulating it somehow on retrieval. Something is wrong on the back end which really sucks
---
I said they were observations and questions lol
---
If they would up the cap limit id love a bank system. Would be alot easier than mules. If we could ha e like a 125k limited account but only able tohold 25k..yea thats whats up. Thats what it is now with max mules out there. Honestly though ever since player vending came out..my value of a cap is differebt. 25k used to be alot..but i can burn throuvh that in a few camp visits now lol
---
Where do you get this information from? Because every talk given prior to the games release they said the game was a survival game based on the fallout universe. The completely expected people to attack each others CAMP's it is why perk cards like "wrecking ball" and "home defense" are in the game.
---
How does this get negitive karma
---
RX 560 seems like a weak card for Fallout 76, it's about as powerful as a Nvidia 1050ti. 
---
Try tweaking settings, certain settings will have drastic impact on performance. Put your game on low, and put it in the native resolution (probably 1080p).
---
Start bumping settings up and experimenting - you can also take a look at this thread - the OP goes into a lot of detail about the various settings:

Vampires, Quad, and any aiming buffs.
---
The Atomic Shop version is always a "clean version" of something if it already exists in the game world.
---
I was thinking about the gatling plasma, but i just dont like how it looks. If once they fix the penetration issue, and the plasma can actually outdps the .50cal, i would stay even then on the .50cal and not change the weapon. Im using unarmed melee nowadays, because sometimes even the .50cal get boring. :)
---
Ooff dah!
---
Fair enough, I was just trying to be funny and didn't really know what to say to those. LOL
---
I think they need to emulate GW2s approach to events.  Have event chains that change based upon how successful the event went and that if completed well unlock temporary vendors or a new area for a limited time.  Just would be cool to see more impact in the world based upon the players activity (or lack thereof).
---
I feel like I never find anything special or random, but I've found the corpse of the Deathclaw Trader about three times now.  Still trying to find the damn tourist to get my camera and grind away for that sweet sweet atoms.  Ugh.

---
ever step out of your power armor by mistake, in the middle of a nuke zone?  And think, "why didn't I put on my hazmat suit Before getting in power armor?"  Some days you feel like a pro, then, others, just a duffus.
---
Maybe they could have ranks. One star for legendary enemies, two for all corpses.
---
I'm 1H melee. solo most of the time.  15 str, bloodymess3, incisor3, tenderizer1, martial artist, gladiator.  Mostly for WS farming - glowsight3.
---
  Before I started carrying too much stuff and needed excavator, and before I had the weapons/skills to take them out - chameleon armor and a sniper rifle for those PITA higher level mutants.  Now I either slash or stab my way through them.
---
If you are on PS4, I've got a few low level melees that may help you out.
---
I'm on PC.
---
For real, I’m on Xbox but I hope Bethesda does something like that.
---
Yeah it seems more consistent with green footlockers (found 3), found one in a dark metal box also, still looking for #5.
---
BTW I killed 12 gulpers yesterday, 4 today so far and nothing, just weird stuff including handmades &amp; levers lol
---
Nice job! For some reason, she makes me think of Vera Keyes from Dead Money? No idea why though.
---
Yup, the ballistic perks affect crossbow damage.
---
Kind of disappointed, though, that my bloodied crossbow does as much damage as my bloodied combat rifle and handmade rifles.  Not complaining because knowing the balance team, instead of buffing the CR and HR, they'll nerf the crossbow instead.
---
As reward for the event
---
Absolutely, I run a bloodied build so the moment I hear the sound of getting out of the power armor in a nuke zone, my hearts drops lol.
---
You can join the pioneer scouts and to finish the quest you have to revive another player (and to complete the swimming merit badge you have to revive someone in water).  It encourages cooperation, but also encourages bad play (follow a lowbie until they inevitably die and revive them or get someone to intentionally die so you can save them).
---
To be fair, U.S. paper money has more in common with cloth than paper given that it's  composed of 75% cotton and 25% linen.
---
No information doesnt mean they did nothing, it just means theres no information on that time, i have no information on what you have done with your life, doesnt mean you didnt exist until you spoke here on reddit
---
From the fact they tried a slap system and tried to make it so that you had to agree to PvP or you got punished for shooting some one who didn't agree. Actions speak a lot more than words. It was very obvious they were trying to appeal to people who didn't really want PvP as well. You really think a full survival game is going to punish some one for shooting first and keeping shooting even though the other person doesn't shoot back.  And the fact htey listened when the people who didn't want PvP complained about the slap system not working well and their camps being destroyed and just got rid of that entirely. If they truly wanted a full survival they would have just said it's a survival game. They obviously wanted and still want to keep those of us who don't want to deal with these shenanigans interested in the game.  
---
And as I said, just cause the game allows it doesn't mean you're not an asshole for doing it. (It's one thing if the game rewarded you for it and actively encouraged it. But the game really doesn't, there's not much reward for it other than wanting to piss off the other player. The fact some one gets their  enjoyment by pissing off the other player makes them an asshole regardless of if the game allows it).  
---
Oh, and because home defense is still needed against NPCs who damage your camp.
---
Thanks!!
---
Are you kidding me? I literally was right about to complete my newest build today :(
---
Go downvote yourself.
---
he could be a place able object that collects items from a farm or something at the cost that you have to escort him to your camp. if he does, caps wasted. also I feel like the ones in watoga should be pre war money, or if they are the ones that modus owns, caps.
---
One of the vaults open and its two people and 1000 dogs, on a real note though i hope that you can select the breed of dog and such
---
I tok have a filled store. I usually give it a few days and if nothings sellin ill drop the price. If still not selling it goes to scrip. Junk aid and ammo i just set it and forget it. Its pretty circumstantial. Soetimes i have 200 stims other times i have 3 and need to buy more.  Depends where im at at the time.  But i do wish we had a refridgerated machine for fhe food. Thatd be sweet. I feast queen meat for no reason..alot
---
Things like the mole miner gauntlet, deathclaw gauntlet (both high damage), especially when modded for extra blades, and even the death tambo (mid level damage) and the legendary versions thereof, cannot be used when you are in power armor.
---
5
---
Launch a nuke
---
My guess is that encrypted costs 2k to launch, after people got burned out of it people don't run it so much AND lack of teamwork leads to it failing has started people trying to recoup some of the investment cost. 
---
I have like 8+ and value them at nothing since 9/10 it's what I get for encrypted and I run it with a good group that works together.
---
Yea, they would need to fix that too. Been happening to me less lately than it used to. Last time I thought this happened, I found the ghoul half sunk in the ground. The time before that, I crouched and looked down over the spot where the imposter sheepsquach body vanished and was able to loot it.

What? there IS information in FO1 and NV about the start of the brotherhood. That is where I'm getting this info from. Directly from the games.

I agree on that and I hope they group you in with people roughly the same level as you each time you log in.

I ran the Queen twice this morning everything but violet

I don't dare trust this CAMP to a blueprint. It was a massive pain just to get the original positioning to work. It's a 3 story building starting at a cliff top overlooking a pond, with the 2nd floor lowering down over the river feeding the pond, then the lowest floor shooting off over the pond. I'd like to reposition it a bit, as there's an acid deposit just outside the edge. But it's not worth the headache right now.

How about just disabling all legendary effects (armor AND weapons) when on the Survival servers?
---
A true test of how "good you think you are" the true "grit" will rise to the top.. others will be lowered to the ground....
---
Maybe you will find out if that Handmade was a good choice or not. I personally think it's a crummy weapon without the legendary effects.
---
Very cool my GT is el ttsunami, I'll add when I get home. Thanks in advance!
---
Yussss
---
Why does everyone have that ancient outfit  .
---
Nice that they're giving people two weeks to get it this time. Wasn't it like 4 days when it first dropped? Or was it a full week?
---
I am not trolling, i said i have never seen 90 redux on a 2 star weapon ffs... read back through previous comments. You said you have seen it plenty of times on 2 star weapons... WOW
---
Nah. If I head back to camp and see Marcy Long’s sour face, I’m deleting the game forever
---
The all-in VATS builds crit every third or so shot, use weapons with low AP consumption and mods that lower it further(you’ll have to do your research on this because it isn’t stated anywhere in-game). You generally can’t use power armor in a VATS build and they generally not great for SBQ compared to a heavy build. I just go zdps for SBQ and use a cryolator when she’s grounded to keep her there and let the others dps.
---
MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS FLAVORED ICE CREAM!
---
Do you have the HC backpack? What about the other backpack mods? Where are you with the achievements? 
---
Do you have all the available wall-mounted head items in your camp? (Not all the of the mounted head plans that you can see in the camp menu are available in the game, so you can look ahead at what will be out in the future) Do you have the Arktos skin for your backpack? Bear-Arm weapon? Any TSE weapons? Do you have any rare outfits that would give you some clout amongst other players? Have you completed Project Paradise?
---
What's your gear like? Can you solo scorchbeasts and squatches with ease? How many Stimpacks do you have? Are you struggling to keep yourself alive out in the wastes?
---
Does your CAMP perform all the basic functions and remain visually appealing or are stuff just scattered every where? 
---
Farming legendaries or rare gear in the same place over and over in every game will burn you out. 76 is unique in that looking for collectibles and plans is actually fun because your camp and character become a showcase for your accomplishments.
---
The scripts are one of my favorite things about this game, and they let me repeat event after event. "Why did it have to be honey? Why couldn't it be sticks or rocks?"
---
"...the patriotic patriots act..."; all the vendors, each with their own personality and spiel. The attention to detail is just fantastic, and has me playing far too much.
---
The issue is balancing gear and perks better and having MM group up people by level ranges. Maybe better damage scaling.
---
Do that don't constrain player choice.
---
This wouldnt surprise me in the least.  The other vault experiments range from bizarre like this to absolutely horrifying.  Being surrounded by dogs for 25 years instead of people sounds like heaven until you have actually have to live it and theres 999 of them lol
---
If you want your current build optimized you'll need to post dome more information, such as what your perspective mentor is working with in terms of playstyle, perks, SPECIAL points, and gear
---
Pair that with a gas mask for the chic Chernobyl look
---
Still, spinning circles on the ground would make it easier to find them. But seriously, they could just go by name rather than loot but unfortunately that would bypass all those diseased enemies that sometimes have legendary items.
---
Does “satisfying” an addiction lower your damage?  That is you have booze addiction, drink a beer, what happens?  You don’t have the penalty but still are technically addicted.
---
Is there an addiction link around?  Like mutations perhaps one can work around addictions that don’t impact your special too harshly.
---
Please tell me your reddit user name is your gaming user name as well.

If you feal that u have missed a way of testing, or you have another way you want tried out. Reply to this post.
---
That's helpful. Thanks for it.
---
&gt; From the fact they tried a slap system and tried to make it so that you had to agree to PvP or you got punished for shooting some one who didn't agree. Actions speak a lot more than words. It was very obvious they were trying to appeal to people who didn't really want PvP as well. You really think a full survival game is going to punish some one for shooting first and keeping shooting even though the other person doesn't shoot back. And the fact htey listened when the people who didn't want PvP complained about the slap system not working well and their camps being destroyed and just got rid of that entirely. If they truly wanted a full survival they would have just said it's a survival game. They obviously wanted and still want to keep those of us who don't want to deal with these shenanigans interested in the game.
---
They did say it was a survival game, just because they went back on it because lots of people complained doesn't mean they didn't plan for it to be a survival game. Why do you think they have survival now and the next thing they are adding is ALSO pvp based? If you haven't noticed most of the stuff they are adding is PVP based, because they planned for this game to be a PVP game.
---
&gt;And as I said, just cause the game allows it doesn't mean you're not an asshole for doing it. (It's one thing if the game rewarded you for it and actively encouraged it. But the game really doesn't, there's not much reward for it other than wanting to piss off the other player. The fact some one gets their enjoyment by pissing off the other player makes them an asshole regardless of if the game allows it. PUre and simple, if you get your enjoyment by making other people unhappy, you're a fucking asshole).
---
You were rewarded for it, it was one of the best ways to farm caps after you hit the 1400 cap limit for the day prior to them also changing the amount of caps you'd drop on death to pvp. Used to be able to get 200+caps a kill in adventure. On top of the junk you'd get from people who died, especially back when the stash was only 400lbs limit.
---
So you absolutely got rewarded for doing it.
---
&gt;Oh, and because home defense is still needed against NPCs who damage your camp.
---
Notice how you ignored the "wrecking ball" perk? That is purely for PVP damage to CAMPS.
---
I don't want seasons, but I do like the idea of starting from lvl 1. I also like the idea of not being able to move items from adventure to survival.
---
You have no respect for girls , girl hater
---
Do they have those cute little pods they sleep in too?
---
If I could build an EyeBot to follow me around and play E-DE's battle music I'd lose my irradiated little mind!!!
---
Nice. Guess this will be my first time venturing into Survival ...(gulp)
---
Got a link for the recent tests on the shotgun not degrading faster? Because recently with the shotgun nerf where they changed how the pellets work on TSE's it changed how fast durability goes down.
---
Only if you also turn in your experiences of having used or owned them, as well
---
Nice try, game watchers website guy
---
Definitely not you, they done mucked it up again.
---
I’m also curious regarding this subject.... the hunting cap comes with flaps up/down option. I can’t imagine it would take too much more effort to offer hood up/down option for the Stalker set
---
Ask yourself a simple question, if you were in a bunker with military comms gear wouldn't you try to find out if anyone else from the military was alive.  
---
We do know that Maxon did make contact with Taggerdy shortly after the war according to he tape that is dated August 29th 2077(tape is definitely misnamed, as it references things that happened between October 20th and October 27th 2077 and raises a minor lore issue of a scientist being alive but that could be a member of his unit, a scientist at wasn't part of the experiments, or a civilian scientist that lived outside the base.  My guess is the tape was meant to be named October 26 2077).  He made contact again on November 3rd or 4th right after they made it to Lost Hills most likely as they made it to Lost Hills in November 2077.  Check Spruce Knob Lake for the notes and holotape. 
---
What we know for sure is they didn't leave the bunker very much after they arrived, just patrols really, until after the events of Fallout.
---
Why would that even be in the discussion when we are talking about the op
---
2 star legendary with a primary and tertiary effect? I really need to see pictures of that.
---
I'll look you up when I get on. Glad to help a fellow wastelander out.
---
Yeah, you'll get "item is intersecting another" or "item isn't supported" or "can't remove this part of camp will be inaccessable" ETC. CAMP builds are completely broken right now.
---
Is the station at your CAMP? Try moving it slightly, if the animation can't go through the game seems to just say "meh fudge it"
---
Cool idea. That would be more useful and way more help when those corpses sink below the ground. I don't know if that would be on perception. Maybe agility?
---
Well F76 defiantly has NPC's just in the form of robots
---
Lol the Indian accent throws me off every time.
---
I'm kind of just looking for someone who knows stuff about melee builds. Once I'm in front of my Xbox I can tell them all that other stuff.
---
Wow, I'm like level 205 and I'm thinking... I don't think I ever stuck my head in that bus either.... Why? I don't know..I'm sure I've looked at every other bus on the map else where. why is it that both of the buses at White Springs never said "look inside of me..." ??? Is it because this is a busy area?
---
It will also depend some on what melee weapon and it's stars is it one handed two handed bloodied mutant. There are alot of variables that are hard to plan for unless you put alot of caps into trading.
---
That test was preformed by me on saturday.
---
There’s also the issue with wood armor, I’ve lost so many scrips to the wood armor bug
---
I can sink some caps into trading. As far as which melee weapon, I haven't really decided anything concrete yet. I would like it to be one handed though.
---
WOW AGAIN... because the OP has said his 3* weapon (BE Pump shotty / 90 redux) has gone to a 2* (B / 90 redux), that is why... to which my response was amazement, that it has actually happened, since it has removed the 2nd prefix (explosive). Jesus christ.
---
that's the stupidest thing I've every heard.
---
bethesda should make the damn game able to be played offline.
---
I don't want to have to deal with cunts stealing all my shit, I can mod away the repair kit issue, fix all the stupid little shit, add actual fucking npcs, not have to deal with little shit stains nuking my camp, this whole game is s shit show without offline.
---
bethesda need to stop trying to shove multiplayer and microtransactions down peoples thoughts or they'll end up like that other piece of shit company trying to make a piece of shit game covered in the gold sprinkles that is star wars.
---
the only thing close to multiplayer that I want is co-op bethesda knows that and thats why they put the kibash on skyrim online steam intigration cuz they know that once someone made it a thing then they would be forced to add it into their piece of shit games in the future
---
I swear to god it's companies like this that are the real cause of all these shootings here in america.
---
I got lucky and found one on a super mutant behemoth.
---
&gt;Ask yourself a simple question, if you were in a bunker with military comms gear wouldn't you try to find out if anyone else from the military was alive. 
---
When they went and killed their superiors and all the scientists of the military they were "part" of? No, that is literally why they went silent, because Maxson snapped and killed off the majority of the military on the base with his group over the tests they were running on civilians and soldiers.
---
&gt;We do know that Maxon did make contact with Taggerdy shortly after the war according to he tape that is dated August 29th 2077(tape is definitely misnamed, as it references things that happened between October 20th and October 27th 2077 and raises a minor lore issue of a scientist being alive but that could be a member of his unit, a scientist at wasn't part of the experiments, or a civilian scientist that lived outside the base.

---
That is post retcon in fo76, if you read and listen to the lore in fallout 1 and NV they state that for the first 50 years the brotherhood HID in the military base to protect their families from the outside world.
---
It has nothing to do with what You or I would do, it has to do with what they actually DID do, which is just like in NV they hid in their bunker avoiding all contact with the outside world.
---
Definitely this. It might look like you have room to enter the PA station, but you probably don't. Move it away from anything else.
---
Wow.  I just re-did my camp and placed it in a new spot. 
---
So I moved it and it  worked. Thanks for the snappy reply
---
Honestly I’ve considered that. I only have one point in action boy right now because my agility perks are a mess. I’m not even maxed on agility in the perk screen but have plenty from gear and mutations. I have dumb shit like Fireproof because I don’t wear power armor and like to fight scorchbeasts(it’s also essential in survival). It’s like I’m all in on VATS but I can’t figure out what else I want to do.
---
Im just glad i got mine built how i want it, not re doing for a long time
---
ooh didn't know. Thanks for noticing!
---
And of course they cannot reimbursed lost items...
---
I'll say with my limited knowledge and someone that is smarter on this may say differently but pick the weapon you want first then building your perks will be easier
---
Lol. I gotcha. A lot of my post was just trying to be funny too. or just point out silly stuff. I forgot to mention the "how do robots keep getting diseases and dropping blood" part but o well lol
---
Do you have any screenshots or even posts showing your tests and results?
---
If you’re getting 40 just walking around then your settings are too high for the card. Any firefight or heavy texture area is going to bring your card to its knees. How much graphics memory does that card have?
---
I figured the same
---
Much obliged, u can charge me caps  if needed friend.
---
Exist yet.
---
1000% that gun is great.
---
Help us, can you get a little more specific. Did they screw up placing of auto created blueprints? just walls, just floors, etc???? is it bad enough that we should stay where we are until fixed?
---
if so can you please update this thread when you see it fixed too..
---
I would do it.
---
Fallout 3 also says in regards to Vault 101 "no on ever enters, and no one ever leaves"  
---
This is clearly not true since obviously not only do you and your dad leave, but you dad actually came into the vault with you when you were born, another dweller says the vault used to be open years earlier but they sealed it off again
---
Makes sense. 
---
Although I highly doubt that was intended. 
---
Otherwise there would have been a load screen blurb about it.  
---
But even if that was the case, it still doesnt explain all the other glitches.
---
Yes further tinkering of my now 2*guns with the skins removed nothing else
---
But the difference is this is info coming directly from Maxson. So if you believe him in fo76, then why would you not believe him in fallout 1?
---
Did you paint it somehow?
---
This. If I recall, there is at least one sealed and completely unable to open door up there. I suspect it'll get added to eventually.
---
I have to head back to work, but I'll come back later tonight to elaborate a bit.
---
All I know is some jackwagon came up to me, started smacking the back of my head, and I promptly collected the 25 cap bounty.
---
I Love You - both of you :)
---
I see this as an opportunity! Xbox only, anyone looking to buy a junkies AGL with +50% limb damage and +1 agility?
---
Mayne he was keeping it secret so as to not let the others know hed been talking to his personal friend and theyd all lost contact
---
To be fair it said limited time, not exclusive.
---
I'd not buy from the Atomic shop right now anyways due to the skins causing legendaries to lose stars...
---
Maxon isn't even alive yet... Fallout 4 takes place 200 years later..
---
Why would he lie to the vault dweller in fallout 1 about that when he told him things that would have destroyed the BoS if the info got out on other things? That doesn't even make sense.
---
The white tuxedo is the best outfit for wandering the wasteland.  
---
playtime paints are the literal worst.
---
NV takes place over a century after Fallout 1, and over two centuries after Roger Maxson founded the Brotherhood. Even if all of the records are intact, the attitude expressed by Brotherhood leaders in 2181 about the situation in the early days is not necessarily the exact truth. For officials sufficiently motivated to engage in isolationism, “talked to a handful of pre-war buddies over satcom” is not completely inconsistent with what they said happened.
---
Rule 34
---
Well dude, you should ONLY be pulling out the cannon in the porta-potty..
---
LOVE IT
---
Making camps have the option to be untargetable has only improved the game
---
I found ones as well, on Tangara Town. In a box in a crib.  [https://i.imgur.com/g9nhKAK.png](https://i.imgur.com/g9nhKAK.png)
---
Well, I try my best to make my CAMP look like an actual building... like I moved in and took it over. 
---
I AM seeing a lot of the "little house with a big deck" CAMPs now, though. Come on, people... have some fun with it at least.
---
I started running bloodied a few weeks ago but don't do it all the time - just when I'm doing an XP evening.  Still don't go to nuke zones bloodied as I just have too much trouble balancing the radiation.  Is that an issue for you?
---
Its just an excuse as in general survival sucks.
---
Its deathmatch, nothing more
---
I like survival strictly for pvp. It’s not adventure mode the added bonus Xp isn’t anything worth while. I love through it should be new characters only with non transferable gear as well. It would make grinding for survival awarded weapons worth while. Fast traveling to players camps with turrets should only attack you if you have a weapon drawn and have a timer if you pull Your weapon out like a warning. I go to the survival mode strictly for pvp and that’s all I do there. I don’t spend time trying to collect junk or farm for anything I need. Sure if I see a legendary I’ll kill it and loot it and maybe if I kill a player and they have junk I need I’ll take what I want and leave the rest. But starting it fresh would be great. It would make the mode a lot more difficult and a lot more exciting being low level and stumbling upon some one in mid trade or something. I think the idea of being a raider is way more fun or if i want to do the whole role playing at all shit you could have a team of people just for protecting certain areas for people trying to trade or craft, etc.
---
I had my wife run into my gaming room and ask wtf is going on the first time I did that event and the screaming starts.
---
FO1 has this info, NV just shows that they are still isolationist. FO1 wasn't long after they decided to step out of their bunker.
---
Idk why you calling me a guy but they really do help me .  The codes are real why are you so rude
---
Maybe he feels it didnt matter, personal reasons, you know when someone asks what youve done today and you say "nothing much" when in reality youve done stuff, but you dont tell them every little detail.  
---
What reason would he have had to tell the vault dweller he had briefly spoken to a friend of his on radio years earlier
---
Well i like it anyway, i like deathmatch so it fits my style
---
Build your home in the ash heap. No one nukes there.
---
I just want to drive the carts
---
Take the paint off.
---
Because their whole isolationism is a major part of their storyline. So why would they not include info about it when it is pertinent to the story?
---
Then no one still play it.
---
Builds don't really come to fruition till level 60+.
---
Is it even possible to have reduced weight as a second star legendary? Or is the game just so broken that it’s breaking it’s own legendary rules?
---
One of my vending machines and a "blocking potty" I put up where wrecked and there were a half dozen mole miner corpses around.
---
Is definitely true, but it's a much lower chance than most weapon mods. I'm level 190 something and I still occasionally learn new mods from scrapping armor.
---
Yeah Hardened will always deal more damage than Refined. Ammo type may increase/decrease damage as well. In your case, higher caliber will still deal less damage than Hardened .38
---
FO1 says that 20 years prior they had accepted outside recruits into the organization. How long is “wasn’t long”?
---
Nonetheless:   I am only buying things from now on only if I am certain I want to continually use them.   I will never buy again based on the prospect that I may desire to use them at some point in the future.    Bethesda made its choice.   I have made mine.  I won’t criticize its choice but will instead change my buying model.
---
Why did you feel the need to shill for a website and say these ones posted here aren’t trustworthy? If you stop and think about it a little bit, your comment was just as rude as mine.
---
I just started so I don't know but if I can add a question here, can you store more than 800lbs of stuff in a storage chest?
---
I don't need any caps, I have more than enough.
---
It's worth paying attention to Jim including a lot of context for Todd's statements, and the video isn't "Jim reacts to whole IGN interview"
---
Even with what he provided, I also was inclined to be annoyed with Jim for going quite so hard on Todd given that Todd, in what we know of him publicly, is clearly largely invested in making games people like to play.
---
But at the end of the day, the point is valid - even if before launch they said it would be WIP, they did not make promotional material for an early access game, and they did not price it like an early access game.
---
They promoted and priced a full release, which... You could argue it is, maybe, now, after months of fixes close to being.
---
Using largely retouched assets from an existing game, and still with significant issues and rough edges around the core of its gameplay (Multiplayer-focused explorative story), I'd argue it's still a hard sell at 60$.
---
Which, really, is what the video was about. Selling an incomplete product as  a full price one, at full price, knowing it wasn't.
---
1. scrip can be used at the berkley station to buy legendary armor/weapons.
---
2. bulking acid, aluminum, copper, cork, fertilizer, gears, lead, oil and springs. anything else is not worth bulking.
---
3. you do it yourself and set your prices.
---
4. you can move it around as much as you want, however the camp system is not 100% so I would suggest finding a nice spot and just leaving it there for now.
---
still havent seen it, was it a timed thing like faschnacht parade?
---
I've said it before, but whoever decided that "invite to team" and "exit your PA" should share a key bind needs to have their CS degree revoked.
---
I'm not saying anyone is wrong it's just I been following game watchers before I joined Reddit so I'm more used to it and they never failed me before people are so rude to me. At least where I'm from people respect girls and their thoughts many online don't I guess :/
---
Hey, the responders had SOMETHING going.
---
"TED! JERRY! GET BACK HERE THIS INSTANT AND CLEAN UP YOUR MESS, OR SO HELP ME, I'LL YEET YOU ACROSS THE MAP!"
---
Exactly, and FO1 was 70~ years after the bombs dropped. So 20 years prior would be the 50 years I stated.
---
For Agility? There's Adrenaline. Most people consider that a must pick. Born Survivor for a more automated stimpak, Gun-Fu for better damage which is VATS related.
---
Yeah, I'm considering it.  It's hard to tell how wide it is though.  I'd like something a bit narrower than the standard backpack.
---
i know they were supposed to "fix" things like floating crops because so many people complained about it, but i found now its actually HARDER to plant crops in the same spot they were before, its like the ground level you see is superficial, the game only registers an object being placed it it reached the hidden ground that is lower than the ground we see in game
---
sometimes when you first load into an area, you see the ground as all flat, then as the game loads, you can see there are the various hills and bumps and things that get placed over the base ...  
---
we used to be able to attach items to the hills and bumps, but now we can only attach things to that lower ground level
---
it is frustrating for sure
---
Well in FO1 your not talking to the same maxon as communicates with the bos in WV, so again, if he had kept it secret at the time, the ne you speak to in FO1 wouldnt have ever known about the contact made
---
There's never a good reason to only have 1-2 in combat perk card. Either go full 3 or nothing. One Gun Army isn't that great unless you PvP.
---
change my mind
---
Honestly it's just another week of stuff I don't like and can't bring myself to even consider purchasing.
---
Now that would be awesome!
---
Footlockers for the win! I also found one (I didn't need) in a footlocker and gave it to a person in need of one.
---
The VHS effect is a bit too aggressive.
---
Seems like I’ve underminded the whole armor-piercing/crippling thing. 
---
Partial reason being is take an anti-armor gun for example. I have a few of them in my stash. I don’t know how to quantify how much “armor” each enemy has.
---
Long pew is pretty good, best upgrade for energy weapons IMHO.  😉
---
I think it looks awful and sounds like a fuckin chore, but I do run 3/3 thru hiker because I like to sell Glowing Meat Steaks so maybe I should do this too. I saw a guy with them all up on his roof somehow. I thought they had to be on the ground  and in water for the bigger ones.
---
This happens if you move the mouse over another item while your bringing it over to hit the confirm button. Only seems to happen if you're rushing. Kinda like the whole "scrap option jumps half a mile on your list" issue.
---
Buying Scrip or Caps with Atoms ... Yes
---
But buying Atoms with Scrip or Caps, or Scrip and Caps being interchangeable .... No
---
Explain.
---
1. You get Scrip by scrapping unwanted Legendary Items at a special machine located at Train Station, Scrip is a currency taken by the "Legendary Vendor", she allows you to exchange Scrip for a Legendary (random) weapon or armor of either 1,2 or three stars. She's in Berkley Springs.
---
2. Yes, both in weight reduction for Aluminum and Lead, possibly Steel also? as well as selling bulk junk to vendors for caps if you're out of inventory space as NPC vendors will not buy most unbulked junk.
---
3. You store stuff in your stash. You put stuff in your vending machines to sell to other players, but it is still technically stored in your stash.
---
4. Either.
---
***What is dead may never die*** 💦
---
Any tips on pricing?  I typically sell plans, recipes, magazines, bobble heads and spare ammo.  I looked up the vendor prices of the plans and then knocked the price back depending on the plan.
---
(Bethesda) How can we make people play more after they get the items they want and we don't have more dlc yet, I know lets remove stars
---
Seriously though bad news is they unlikely keep records of all the weapons you have backed up so it may be lost along with the players who also lost stars after redeeming scrips for 3 star items that lost a star after relogin.
---
The Enclave disagrees
---
Nah
---
Can't change a mind your missing
---
If you dont like it leave. We aren't forcing you to play this game.
---
What's the mothman festival? I really like the sound of it :)
---
its alright

What? The Maxson you talk to in FO1 is the one who created the name Brotherhood of Steel. The Maxson they are talking about in fo76 is the original Maxson, who was LONG DEAD prior to the name BoS being used.
---
Any regrets? :)
---
I just joined this site not very long ago so really anyone could be wrong but not saying they are.  I don't think I was being rude I was just giving my honest opinion what I think .  Swrry if you took it wrong not trying to say people are wrong.  Just be careful is all :/
---
oh man im sorry that happened, i had a teammate lose a whole excavator armor after we painted with the x-01 nukashine paint
---
did you happen to rename it as well?
---
Im trying to figure what makes it so these things disappear, so far having paints on them seem t be a factor
---
2 days. Sucks its back, I thought it would be the only thing never coming back but weep...
---
I’ve been back maybe a week and haven’t been actively looking for it, but for all this Scout stuff I’m gonna need to find it eventually.
---
It is OP as hell with shotguns as each pellet has the chance to cripple, so each shot gives you 8 chances to cripple. So you have nearly a 100% chance to cripple with each shot with max rank enforcer.
---
No way man :) I plan on giving away any and all that I may find in the future!
---
he spawned for me and no one else was around. I thought the same thing as the cost was higher than I've ever seen for it. So the price was what the clean one should have been... but sadly, was exactly the same once it ended up in my inventory.
---
Yes it was painted and renamed.
---
No and that is your only storage chest. It may increase in the future, but if you really need more than that I’d suggest a mule character
---
Has this extended beyond the Responder’s shotgun skin?
---
This is a different Maxson, the one who actually founded the Brotherhood of Steel. The Maxson in Fallout 4 is a long descendant of his.
---
Supernatants too
---
Run every "defend X workshop" event you see in the forest, even if you have to spend 20 caps to get there. The cap reward will pay for the travel cost, and you'll unlock new camp plans every time.
---
Also, claim workshops for plans and rewards. It will open you up for PvP, but all you have to do is build a stash box as soon as you claim it and drop all your junk. If someone attacks they won't get anything, and you can either ignore them and let them have the workshop or just server hop and claim it again.
---
$18 for a paint job?!?!?!?!
---
eighteen dollars....
---
wow
---
I agree, I noticed how muddy it was after the YouTube compression. I'll be sure to use a lighter hand on the next video. Thank you for the feedback.
---
Aten_ra said it also happened to him with a legendary armor piece just by switching servers with a skin on it, so yes.
---
1.  Scrip is basically the new currency use to trade a new npc called the purveyor who in returns can give you a new legendary weapon or armor
---
2. I personally bulk junks when I have too many of that same item and want to sell it off real quick to the vendor bot (some junks can't be sold as mere scraps)
---
3. You have to manually add stuff to your vending machine
---
4. It depends on the person, I moved around at least a couple times now cause I wanted a new location for my camp. My wife moves maybe a couple time too to find a place she think her camp would look nice in. Some people place their camp at spot they travel a lot cause it acts as a free fast travel (vault 76 and your team's camps are also free fast travels)
---
When you move your camp, stuff that is already snap together or have stuff sitting on it will be group together in the "stored" section so when you moved, you can place the entire grouped together stuff down without having to rebuild it all. For example, your entire house and everything in it should still be intact when moved or a table with a turret sitting on it will be grouped together. 
---
If you got any questions you can always pm me, and I'll answer anything to the best of my ability
---
Damn.
---
Swrry if you took it wrong way but I'm just giving my honest opinion not being rude, I been with game watchers way before I joined this site and they never failed me.  I'm just saying to be careful not saying anyone wrong :/
---
Oh okay I didn't knew that thank you for the answer
---
I don't buy from it at all since they broke their promise to only have cosmetics. I'm worried with this, and Blades that they may be going down a dark route, and the only way to show our dislike of these practices is to no longer let them in our wallets.
---
I believe the disease you are looking for is naughty naughty rad rash.
---
I avoid power armor at all costs, basically only use strictly for nuke zones.
---
This has nothing to do with you being a girl.  In fact, until just now I didn't even know you *were* a girl.  You literally said "I wouldn't trust people's words here" and said that game watchers are "trustyworthy and legit", the implication being that the people on this sub aren't.
---
I understand that you're more comfortable with the gamewatchers site, but the way you phrased your initial comment came off as an insult.
---
I can hear this post
---
Double-also Rad-Shield doesn't suppress mutations.
---
May I suggest a Pipe Revolver-Rifle instead? It uses .45 ammo, has the Hardened Receiver,  and Suppressor, and benefits from both Rifleman, and Gunslinger Perks?
---
ugh... how can you tell the difference?
---
Fallout 4's Maxon is a direct descendant of the original founder of the brotherhood Roger Maxon
---
Sadly, no.  However, my pee sac is also frequently full while gaming so at least there is symmetry.
---
How did you reach such a high level?
---
Looks like it isn't just Atom shop skins either: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwrshv/my_whole_t51b_power_armor_set_is_gone/
---
Well that's such a well thought out opening statement I don't feel like there's anything to be discussed.
---
I think it would have been a nice gesture if they made a few BETA exclusive items for those who've played since the beginning, but it's also *a bit* naive to think they're not going to continue to monetize something like the Blackbird skins.
---
They're probably the most well known, most requested, "limited time" item in the game.
---
&gt;In November 2077, after a few weeks in the Wasteland, the soldiers and their families arrived at the Lost Hills bunker, suffering many casualties along the way from the terrible conditions of the Wasteland, including Maxson's wife (but not his teenage son). The Lost Hills bunker became the headquarters of the newly formed paramilitary organization that *Maxson created and named the Brotherhood of Steel*, intending to use its resources to eventually rebuild human civilization—no matter the cost.  
---
I pulld this strait from the wiki and is all i can find about when the BoS was named
---
Mama Murphy! 👋🏻
---
If I pick up a piece of code, how do I contribute ( not a big discord user)
---
I like it for creepy situations and pictures.
---
Civil war suit outfit does not count as formal wear? Anyone know what does?
---
Nukacrypt is updated with this week's code already.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/home
---
It alright.
---
It not subtle or nuanced. It boring and lukewarm, but it alright
---
It remind me of me RPG, which I like better, but same RPG more or less.
---
Yeah I’m using 2 weapons, so I have AAE pipe rifle, and also looking for IE pipe revolver
---
Is this the pond with the boat and the underwater acid deposit? If so I don't blame you. That spot is awesome but so difficult to get built properly
---
I was just giving my opinion though.  Not trying to start a raid
---
The key words are "in the bunker"  they weren't in the bunker until November 2077.  Taggerdy was clearly on his side on or before October 27th 2077 when they left the base for the bunker.  That would make her an insider by the time they reached Lost Hills.  Hiding in the bunker doesn't preclude communication with Taggerdy.  
---
The events of Fallout 76 do fit in with the lore of Fallout as we don't have a day by day, hour by hour record of what they did in that week before they left for Lost Hills.  
---
We know they moved the civilians inside the base on October 21st, sent out Paltner on the 25th and left on the 27th.  He could have made contact with Taggerdy on the 24th, 25th, 26th, or the 27th before they sealed the base.  There is little known from that week beyond that.  Nothing in how it started directly contradicts the lore of Fallout.  Using the known history of the Brotherhood it all dovetails in pretty well.  The only issue is a mislabeled holotape.
---
Not me. Not only will I probably not scrap it for the challenge, I might beg Bethesda to allow my character to sew it onto her own skin for all the trouble it was to find.  Lol
---
I was just trying to give my opinion not trying to start a raid
---
You might want to tag this as a suggestion.  At first I thought it was a pro Fallout tip and got excited.
---
It's not as good as banging ants, but I enjoy it.
---
Its a known bug with skins, sometimes it will cause a loss of a star on a legendary, or with PA it will cause them to just completely disappear. Mainly used to happen with PA when it has a skin on it and then it gets damaged to the point of breaking, and when it breaks it just disappears instead of showing up "broken" and being able to be repaired.
---
Basically only use the default paint and skins for the items until this all gets fixed.
---
Isn't that actually the most efficient way to sub-class? The first star gives 10% and the next two only give 5%.
---
well I have 1300 hours but after that hot argument you made i might have to reconsider
---
So they accepted outside recruits for one year? Unless there’s a story about how the very first outside recruits almost destroyed the organization I’m skeptical of that. I do not believe that, even if the “50 years” is true, that the isolation was absolute. Especially if pre-war Maxson contacts could be considered Brotherhood of Steel and not “outsiders”.
---
I h
---
Oh well I just got that outfit last week in a player vendor  and im seeing more Nd more people with it thought it was a rare outfit but I love it no doubt
---
Exactly my thoughts. I still don't understand the overwhelming rejection of battle royale though. Couldn't a player simply just not play it?
---
You may be able to double dip with that one too if you are able to throw a Forceful stock on it
---
I need a laymen explanation from someone on anti-armor effects.
---
I understand bloodied. 1 point of damage for for every 1 HP lost up to x total. TSE +45% additional damage. BUT AA confuses the living fuck out of me.
---
Why?
---
People doing shit like this is why they should just make an account cap limit and be done with it.
---
I did not feel bliss while I was there, haha.
---
You are missing the fact that in FO76 they are calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel. While taggerdy is talking to the original Maxson. Yet if you follow the lore prior to this game the name "Brotherhood of Steel" wasn't thought of until his grandson, the Maxson you talk to in FO1.
---
It wasn’t just X-01 last time, I have a T-60 set painted with it.
---
Lmfao, make some kind of power armor skin with it or maybe an elegant bathrobe.
---
If they reset the season every month thus won't be a problem
---
Man, not even trying. Troll level sub-par.
---
Love shit like this, haha.
---
Eat my ass OP
---
I hope to see the red rocket sign again.  Was a bit short on atoms first time but after seeing it in person it’s a must buy to me now.
---
Just shows they need a better way to view things in-game.
---
I don't mind. It's nice enough by itself, I'm not interested in flexing the fact that I happened to be lucky enough to log in during that short period of time with enough atoms saved up to get it
---
DOGS PLEEAAASSEEE
---
Yes, they are talking about the Maxson you talk to in FO1 the grandson of the Maxson in fo76.
---
I’m sayin’ lol
---
If you're going full damage you want it maxed. No half measures.
---
For swapping weapons you might as well use Perk Loadout mod to swap cards on the fly.
---
She gave me a vampire faster fire rate .50 cal :) I'm in team 2 stars too :) heavy build.
---
I have been desperately waiting for new feminine hairstyles and Bethesda has *not been delivering for over half a year*.
---
Please BGS, I just want to look pretty.
---
Too much stuff that u want to buy this time! Great update
---
I'd be inclined to agreeif they didn't from the stage on E3 say there would be huge issues and problems and if they didn't send out that email that they were expecting huge issues and problems many of which they didn't know yet. People forget those.
---
They didn't try and hide from the issues and had a coherent plan to move forward.
---
The issues in game mostly revolved around multiplayer issues updating shared stores for quests, syncing AI to the server state, etc...
---
But at $60 for N-years of new Fallout content delivered every 3 months in coherent packages it's quite a good deal.
---
When I preordered I knew it would be busted to hell. But I also knew that they would stand by it and create something as awesome as ESO.
---
And even when it was busted I got over a hundred hours of exploring so it already paid for itself without any new content.
---
Now for Jim he focused on a rearward looking statement because it fit the narrative that he wanted to push "We knew it was broke." They did know it was broke and admitted it at the time publicly prior to launch.
---
Jim did not focus on the forward looking statement the whole have run it longer at scale for free for Fallout 4 users.
---
2 down, 3 to go.
---
What are the mods?  Pistols are hard to find Bc so many scrap them.  You may can make good caps with good mods.
---
That's badass, finding something rare on a rare enemy. Live for shit like this.
---
The repair kits don’t bother me—although I have no plans to ever buy them.
---
It was pretty cool, I rock a sweet multi story overlook. Camp on top of Seneca rocks. Best part is being able to see a nuke blow up anywhere on the map. Not to mention the near constant vertibot flyovers.
---
It's not super rare. There are at least 2 places that spawn is consistently that I've found, basement areas with the mothman shrines.
---
Try waiting for like 5 minutes outside the area before entering (that's how I fix this problem when I have it.)
---
Seems to be a new feature added with the arktos content, you are not alone.
---
This is *Grafton's mayor speaking.* Can anybody hear me? Helloo^ooooo
---
I see that card now. So max rank gives you 30%, per shot with 8 total opportunities per shot? Holy shit!
---
Cool!
---
I will. Do they show up at the dame spot for each location or do they randomly appear all overc5he place?
---
Hmmm. XBoner here... have never had this issue. That sucks, man, Sounds frustrating as hell.
---
What? I don't even understand what you are trying to say. Nowhere did I say they didn't take outside recruits. The issue is that only 25 years after the bombs dropped the brotherhood of steel didn't exist yet. The maxson that was in the military that killed the scientists and such at the base didn't call them the brotherhood of steel. That wasn't their name until his grandson took charge. So the fact that in fo76 the original Maxson is refering to themselves as the brotherhood of steel is a complete retcon as he was long dead before that became their name.
---
I may myself buy the flamed power armor frame as I missed it the first time.  There are plusses and minuses to their decision.
---
I had the same issue. Clearing my cache didn't really help. I finally just upgrade to an One X and it doesn't happen as often now.
---
I thought herpatologist was pretty easy too.
---
Great information, thank you!!
---
I was getting 40 while fighting some protections. Idk if I was in a heavy texture area though. I was in a canyon near a boat and some water. The graphics card has 4 GB to it. I guess it may be time for an upgrade, huh!
---
Given thar morgantown has about 9 caps stash spawns, some unique cola spawns, and Biv, I'm pretty much there daily.
---
There's a mod for that!? Nice... is that a rule break?
---
I tested this on my tse ap cost one and i cant get it to lose the effect? Not sure what im doing wrong
---
Will that tourist spawn at that same spot in the Waterpark or no?
---
Grabs some cans of dehydrated beef stock
---
Are you having this problem with any other games? How old is your Xbox one? Do you have spotty/intermittent internet connection?
---
I’ve had a few CTDs over the last 2 weeks but not as often as you seem to be having.
---
However, I did have A LOT of CTDs on my older XB1 due to poor ventilation and dust buildup.
---
Exactly. Taking Rad X while mutated is worse than being "over encumbered" if you are used to playing as a mutant character.
---
Yeah, I'm level 170ish... never given it a 2nd thought.
---
Right? Maneuverability is life for a bloodied build. If they don't touch you, you shouldn't take much damage.
---
It's all good.  Sounds like it was all just a big misunderstanding. :)
---
Revenge of the Cletus.
---
Watch your back wastlanders Cletus is coming for you. 
---
You killed his frog. Now he kills you.
---
As we say in tech support, a bug is just an undocumented feature.
---
If you dont mind me asking.. do you know where to get that squirrel mask that's smiling and has blood on it ? That one looks pretty rare considering I got most of the faschnat masks except owl and some others I think
---
Got one in the Whitespring gold club locker room yesterday!
---
Cletus Wick
---
Either that, or they create something *like* that.  Just a big marquee sign.
---
It has obvious utility now that player vending is a thing, but who could foresee that back when it was available?
---
That's the original price for PA skins. They're 1200-1400 now, but they obviously used the original price here as to not upset anyone. Also on the Hot-Todder paints too they used the original price.
---
Not bad. But wouldn't you rather swamp Grim Reaper's Sprint for Class Freak?
---
Yup, same with 4 leaf clover, grim reapers, and the other luck perks. They are based on each pellet that hits, not each "shot". So if you use VATS and use a crit that makes every single pellet hit with 100% accuracy. So basically you get unlimited crits with shotguns, ontop of pretty much guaranteed crippling.
---
If you want to see how broken it is, go watch ManyaTrueNerds playthrough when he goes to sugar grove at like level 20 and just wrecks the assaultrons by crippling their legs and then just stands outside of their range and kills them with a knife to save ammo.
---
&gt;Despite that, under the leadership of Roger Maxson, the Brotherhood grew in strength, further developing their technology, and the orders of Knights, Scribes, and Paladins were formed. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer, and his son took over as the new High Elder of the Brotherhood.  
---
Further down it says they were the Brotherhood long before Roger Maxon died and had orders of knights, scribes and paladins, so must have been using the name before the Maxon you meet in Fallout 1 took over
---
Pretty. Sure it happened to my Combat Knife (When I bought it, I’m almost positive it had a third star).  The third star was irrelevant to me, so I didn’t look that close, so i can not verify.
---
Charlie being bugged new? I had no issue launching from there last night.
---
Just like ESO, all premium shop content should return on rotation, was just a matter of time. And a much more reasonable time frame, too.
---
Yes it’s bug. U have to charge in vats, not before
---
Not happening with other games and is probably down to my xbox being really old. Got it day 1 so its probably down to that. Ill clean it and see if that does anything.
---
I think we’re gonna see something to this effect from the 3rd DLC “Wastelanders”
---
There would be no incentive to play for me and many others then. I want progression and without getting resets just because others are weak.
---
Does it offer a seperate hat/hood in the headwear crafting option?
---
lol I think this same shit all the time in this game!
---
This is the best option I'm aware of at the moment:
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
The one from the Responder quests has a red band around it.
---
Nope, getter better or keep dying.
---
I’m rockin the plague doctor mask and civil war top hat
---
It depends on your individual play style. Everyone is different on how they play the game so your build should be tailored to that. Finding an op weapon of your choice is pretty easy. Once you reach a certain threshold most enemies go down in one or two hits so past that point it’s about having fun. I can share my build with you if you’d like, I went with a fast melee, sprint in and slice n dice so a lot of DR perks and mutations.
---
pretty stupid tho should work either way tbh
---
Double check everything in your inventory, I saw in another post that someone's PA got randomly renamed.
---
Blades is mobile though, and like it or not, that's simply how that market operates.  If mobile gamers were more likely to open their wallets and pay $10 for a complete game, things would be different.  But they won't.
---
ROFL, dude look at the year they state. That is nearly 100 years after the bombs dropped. That isn't the original Maxson. That would make him roughly 130 years old. They are talking about his grandson and great grandson.
---
x3 items. Outfit, mask, goggles.
---
I believe the mark 1 2, 3 etc was referring to a new power armor set being introduced in the Nuclear Winter updates. It might not be just a single set, but I don't think it had anything related to legendary effects. I think that was briefly mentioned in the datamining  video that Juicehead did, which was also about the 400+ voice lines that pretty much confirm that Nuclear Winter is going to be heavily pvp based.
---
I know everyone wants dogs but I want a snallygaster or better yet a Radtoad something fierce.  The radtoad skins are soooo cool. And not to guard my camp and eat up all my budget but as a traveling companion.
---
Yum Yum Deviled Eggs Minigun
---
"Mama Dolce" means "Sweet Mother."  When I first saw the sign I expected a link to the Dark Brotherhood...
---
Many people use it without any issues. It's one of the "must-have" mods
---
I felt cool, but I just logged in and changed my skin but of this. :(
---
I'm not sure you understand how they work. I cannot selectively add and remove mutations,  it all or nothing. If I take starched genes off, I dont only take it off for the worst offenders, I take it off for all of them.
---
If you mean use them like a potion in skyrim? If so, you'd still be looking at 1200 caps an Hour...that is not sustainable nor should it be. I'm already taking a hit on caps and perks to have the mutations, that is more than a big enough hit
---
"dis game ***da*** shit" fixed that for you
---
If you claim the abandoned munitions factory workshop, the Defend events usually give ballastic fiber as one of the rewards for completing them.  Plus you get to manufacture the ammunition of your choice at the same time.  It's a win-win.
---
There's a bus that yields the clean space helmet randomly.. On the WS property i learned. A happy accidental discovery
---
If it was a vending machine that you could do the exchange for and not an actual trading currency between players ill be all for it.
---
I always loved arming up a camp, decking out the settlers to look like an army, or a high society gala, or whatever the theme of the camp was.
---
Considering how much of a strain autonomous movement/action (lights, turrets, Brahmin) appear to be at a camp for how much budget they take, I don’t expect to see settlers in 76.
---
I DO expect a robot helper just based on the one icon for wastelanders.  Hope we get more info at E3.
---
I wish mama dolce would leave me alone
---
I usually just run around in power armor with a ton of radaways on me and In the favorites wheel. No other way really to get around it, well there is one other trick you can find on YouTube. It’s not patched yet. Take 0 rads in a nuke zone without power armor on.
---
Overall, it's BOS Combat Armor.
---
But, of course, it depends on what you're going for.  Most armor is serviceable, at least in PvE.
---
Well I got rid of all my TSE shotguns. However, I have a good ole 1 star Bloodied Combat shotgun I can pull out. If I ever decide to play again I can swap a few cards around in about 10 levels or so and have this on the backburner.
---
Ahh makes sense, I think I was only level 25 at the time. Sorry for the false info!
---
I don't get the hype for this skin.
---
i did get 10+ replies sooooo...

what can i say it's a gift
---
Just did this for the first time on my level 6 character, big thanks to the guy who showed up and helped out because there is no way I could've kept all three machines save by myself. Afterwards I ran around for an hour with that ID card from the office until I found the door for it and was surprised at the things Mama Dolce was up to in her free time.
---
That sucks, I've had a cal-shocked leg a reg arm and a helmet disappear. If you were on PC I would farm you a set real quick :( Watoga has 3 easy spawns and 1 spawn to the south that isn't too bad.
---
who said i played it?
---
I mean, you won't know unless you try.  They relaxed the foundation requirement for replacing CAMPs.
---
ROFL, dude, so you are saying that the first Maxson who was in his 40's when the bombs dropped lived for nearly another 100 years after they dropped?
---
It's because you're lulled into a false sense of security at Whitespring, for the most part. Mr. Gutsys and Assaultrons abound, and they'll take care of the myriad of ghouls and Scorched you might see about the place, assuming you don't. The last thing you expect in an alleged "safe zone" is a grenade trap.
---
You don't even need a legendary shotgun, My level 50 no legendary build just uses a combat shotgun because the damage output doesn't really matter if you are constantly critting.
---
Charlie is mah silo, thanks for the heads up
---
Also in WS Presidential Suite upstairs kids room white hamper ...... first in 24 days of looking, giving up, then there it was while normally farming.
---
Im not saying that, the lore of Fallout is saying that, it has been pointed out many times before that je seems a little old but hey ho, thats just how it is, maybe the medical advances coupled with crazy good luck got him that far
---
Beautiful collection! Thank you for sharing.
---
i thought the enclave was disbanded by the time fallout 4 came out
---
I found a reaponders fireman outfit for 28 caps lol a few days ago. Sometimes i feel bad about buying things like that. They just dont know.
---
&gt; What are your thoughts?
---
You are correct.
---
The T-51B is the best all around combat armor in my opinion because it's so cheap to repair.
---
Excavator -w- calibrated shocks is the best to junk/mine in.
---
But that's my opinion.
---
RTX 2060 all good
---
I do like your idea  but it's  only usable for ppl that have and care for the backpack mods, also we have been asking for simple perk card presents for months now and it hasn't happened and you want them to do this way more complicated presents. Don't hold your breath waiting , 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
No the lore isn't saying that, the wiki is saying that. The wiki is notoriously wrong often. The fact of the matter is in FO1 you are talking to the grandson of the first Maxson, which means that wiki date is wrong as that would literally go against FO1's lore.
---
dis a good argument successfully changed my mind.
---
here's a puppy

At least theres that
---
what about modus
---
Sures. I really don't care either way, PVP isn't my goal in this game, though I'd prefer they maybe fix some of the stuff on the very long list of broken crap or give us some more (and improved) content than a new mode.
---
Yeah, it's kinda sad. The 2 best power amor types are t-51b (best physical and energy defence but low radiation resistance, which is ironic considering ultracite armor is an "upgrade" of t-51b) and X-01 (best radiation resistance and similar energy defence to t-51b but low physical defence compared to other armor types).
---
Holy shit just like we lock our purifiers you can pay caps for different levels of weight increase.

banging ants is da good shit

You don't Say the Magic word...

Take of the paint job, if you put paint jobs from the atom store of items, you are the only one who can have it, if you drop it or sell it would allow other players to obtain it, which bethesda doesn't want, they want people to bye it.

&gt; from the stage on E3 say there would be huge issues and problems and if they didn't send out that email that they were expecting huge issues and problems many of which they didn't know yet. People forget those.
---
I didn't forget those.
---
I also didn't forget the launch price, the promotional materials, or the initial attitude they had with the playerbase's issues (Which has, thankfully, improved)
---
Stating ahead of time it would be, effectively, an early access game and to expect that *is halfway there*. Charging for what you're offering and then filling out the final or "1.0" product is the other half.
---
On the subject of not forgetting, let's not forget 76 is not a charity either, it's a store. I'm not going to try to use buzzwords to describe it, but they're making plenty more than just the box price.
---
&gt; Jim did not focus on the forward looking statement the whole have run it longer at scale for free for Fallout 4 users.
---
But Fallout 4, for the same priced, launched with a far more finished game.
---
And you could have bought it later, for the same price, and also gotten more than launch from it.
---
And, you can play with tons of player's mods that improve and expand the game in huge ways. (Which 76 *may eventually* get)
---
It's still not a good value proposition.
---
It's something I want to succeed, but even if I do, even if I have faith that Bethesda will eventually both improve the game systems up to a "Good" level *and* add content that makes it a better value proposition, I'm not onboard with making this the acceptable way to launch games.
---
Putting it on sale early for the appropriate early access price of 30$ was, from a selfish perspective, almost fine (And I did buy it at that price). But that also means it suckerpunched you and anyone else who paid full price or more.
---
As far as getting 60$ of exploration out of it, I'm not sure I've gotten my 30$ out yet. The inventory issues have made it very unpleasant for me for a large portion of the moderate time I've played.
---
X-01 plus full Fireproof perk FTW against any explosions.
---
That’s where my camp is and it’s a pain to get everything positioned properly whenever I adjust anything. I need to redo my whole camp one day. I didn’t think many people placed their camps in that spot until I tried to join the other night multiple times and kept getting a message saying that my camp can’t be placed so I had to jump servers a few times. I’ve also never had a nuke launched while online here yet. Usually people nuke white springs.

Go and edit the wiki then i dont write that
---
oh ok.
---
That’s one of my biggest complaint about power armor is the ground slam effect. It seems like the smallest drops cause the ground slam effect.
---
I charge 100$ and enough money to cover travel expenses
---
Sure, but nobody is playing your game... so it's a total fail.
---
good point
---
Please?
---
yes
---
i'm bored
---
I don't care about the wiki as no one even reads it because how wrong it is. Why do you think like 90% of fo76 stuff isn't even listed on the wiki?
---
I believe he means “please”.
---
Has happened to me with weapons, armor, and plans. Used to think I traded or bought duped stuff but a couple weeks ago I picked up a quad explosive combat shotgun. Played for about another hour maybe and logged off for the night. Next day I log in and it's totally gone. Didn't even get to mod it yet either. Just gone.

Red dress, Enclave uniform, suits, and I think the outfit with suspenders counts as well. I know that the red dress 100% counts.

I appreciate the effort. here's  a participation award
---
are you sure?
---
My favorite case of "huh. i never noticed that" at Whitespring is all the easy-plastic golf balls everywhere. 
---
First, there's a pickup truck near the tennis court club house. Then they're in the trophy case within the club house. Then there's a lost and found basket in the laundry room of the maintenance building. Then you can find them on every fairway near the tee. It's actually a nice little route, along the way of which you can farm legendaries.
---
I want them to be separate because im tiered of PVP influencing the market for PVE items.
---
Thanks for the heads up dude, now tagged!
---
Yes, obviously. Seems my request however was not clear.
---
Edited.
---
Maybe, I remember I found a really awesome spot to put my camp so I moved my little house, problem was it deconstructed my ENTIRE house into just foundations and walls in my stored tab instead of the usual blueprint of my whole house.
---
Oh well, gave me an excuse to rebuild.
---
Well thank you
---
Ah, I was just going off comments I'd seen. I never saw it the first time around.
---
Not working that way on PC right now
---
I'm at 3/5. No idea where i got most of them. Think one was at the Kiddie Cabins in the Toxic Valley. I think it was the locked footlocker in the Cabin you spawn by.
---
i did that already though
---
So you expect someone to live well past the age of the longest living person ever to have lived while being in an irradiated post apocalypse? Hell, do you not remember how crazy it was for them to find out Kellogg was almost 90? They basically considered that immortal, so I don't see how you think someone could live an additional 40 years over that and people wouldn't have mentioned that their first leader was a near immortal god?!?
---
I hate Sanjay with a cold passion, he makes me dislike the responders...
---
He has a lot of perks for vats, so I assume he wants a vats build. Also, concentrated fire let's him shoot weak points for double damage.
---
He also may want the sprint as single shot rifles will have high AP costs.
---
I visit it still, if it's not too inconvenient to travel too, since the canned stew no longer spoils and it has an exp buff on it.  This way I can stockpile them and use them when I'm ready to go on XP grinds.
---
ye but I did manage to slightly annoy you though so that's a win in my book
---
My plans - Weapons 1/2 the assumed value Max - Camp Plans from 25-100 Max, Bulk of ammo is @ 1 but there are some priced at 2, I try to put in guns that are modded at 1/2 value, same with Armor (I make those pocketed), AID is anywhere from 1/2 the value to 10 less then the value, BULK Junk 5-10 lower than value and Regular Junk is at a max of 10. I try to sell my stuff and not have an Item for an outlandish price. Most expensive Items I sold: Telsa Plan for 600 and a 1* Bloodied Plasma Gat for 600 (Level 45 I think)
---
That's not an excuse for making a game with nothing but mechanics designed to force you to spend. "It's a mobile game." Is akin to saying "It's a live service game." Guess what else was a mobile game, that didn't milk your wallet with mechanics that would be nearly impossible to pass if you didn't? Also, spoilers, it's a Bethesda game. Fallout Shelter. It had a shop, but you never felt forced to use it. You got PLENTY of free loot, and could eventually MAKE the best gear yourself. Take your Bethesda apologizing bullshit out of here, because letting it slide is just as bad as doing it, becauae they will just keep doing it if folks like you just turn a blind eye to it.
---
I also have made a SkyMaze to my vending machines complete with obstacle course climbing wall and jumping puzzle! Glad to see there are more!
---
We will be happy to HEAR the E3 FO76 update, but will we be happy when we SEE it...stay tuned. ;)
---
Ho :) and i don't know the Price, Im just here becaus i'v lost  my connection with the server. :)
---
I still have not found it on either of my chars.....
---
I've always wanted to nuke a camp. Just gotta find the perfect victim...
---
interesting variation on the pLz GiVe uS PerK LoaDOutS theme..
---
This
---
If you have the Tricentennial paint on it it wont allow you to scrap or sell. Take the paint off and you can then do whatever you like with it.
---
Finally!
---
Scrap it. Sell it to someone directly (minus atom shop paints). Or just drop it
---
I've also seen the Clean helmet on the side of the building past the bunker service entrance.
---
Btw it's time to power up thunder mountain and every other power plant you pass
---
Said this forever ago and got downvoted to all hell... proceed with caution my friend... the no lifesaver and people with hacked stuff are very ornery....
---
would buy it if it was offline tbh as it is currenty i find it very unfriendly to skinny white guys lime me who are afraid if human contact and have tiny dix.
---
You are correct about AA and energy damage. But, I would keep an eye on things. There's no telling how or when they will be "fixed" until it happens.
---
Good idea about the Suppressors Gatling. It will prove most difficult to find but it is worth three perk points so I think it is worth seeking out. Another prefix that might be useful for you is furious but it won't free up perk points.
---
It looks to me like things will work out nicely. I'm still torn between a couple points myself but there is no doubt in my mind it will perform very well as-is.
---
I hate how selling something to a vendor will cause the selection to jump back up to a previous item in the list, making it tedious to try and methodically sell stuff throughout your inventory.
---
I mean the game doesnt break if 12 enemies spawn? How would dogs be any different. 
---
They arent players
---
More a mix of John Wick and Hannibal Lecter.
---
How do I drop it so that it doesn’t come back? And can I scrap the power armor frames
---
Are you using the heavy gunner perks? I have a Bloodied LMG and use all the heavy gunner perks. It eats everything up. Also, there are no mods for it, that I know of.
---
So stupid question, but the items on discount are leaving the shop and headinv into the vault?
---
Not sure about regular ones but my heavy has a Zealot's Explosive LMG that will shred a scorchbeast in a second. I've found it pretty good for shooting other stuff too. I've also got a non-explosive one with faster fire rate but I don't really bother with that as, let's be honest, those things don't need to fire faster.
---
Always good know. Thanks for your time.
---
Kellogg was 108, and yes its entirely beliveable people can live to be 130 because several peopke have already lived close to that age like i just said, then add 70 more years of medical advancements, then add the fact that radiation was a part of daily life and so were radiation treatments like radaway and radiation arches.
---
You might be screwed. Take it on alone and there’s no way to do it in 15 minutes. Recruit an ton of ppl, queen buffs and there’s no way to do it in 15 minutes.
---
Traps are annoying too at some camps. If you have vending machines don’t have traps littered everywhere.
---
Yet the corpse flower stamen is still bugged and is given to people who didn't help whenever Heart of the Swap event is completed.
---
But those are not useful to anyone so it's still not fixed.
---
Three bob and six.
---
Appalachia, a simple dweller.... and a crate full of puppets...
---
Is this a troll post? The LMG has the highest sustained damage of any gun in the game?  It’s borderline over powered and only kept in check by the difficulty of crafting 308 ammo in large quantity.  It will receive a nerf before it ever got a buff.
---
Just one?  Can I eat them too?
---
John Cletus 3
---
Bethesda actually listens to you.. and puts the price at 26 000 caps
---
Ooooh, that's why the legendaries I keep never show up
---
They should. It goes to show the mindset of Bethesda atm. They no longer seem to care about making the content that made them legends in the game community. Instead they are going down a lazy, cash grabby road, filled with shitty, half built games, that milk you dry with a cash shop like every other "live service" game. We don't need to let this shit slide, because if we do then Bethesda will be no better than EA in no time. I love this company, and this game, but I'll be damned if I watch them kill this franchise, and company while saying  nothing, or acting like it's ok.
---
Yeah you can scrap the frames, but you don’t get much out of it. On PS4 you place the PA with the X button and drop it with the square button. Not sure what they are on Xbox or pc but it should tell you at the bottom when covering over your PA
---
They haven't lived that long in the fallout universe. The only people you will find that live that long in the fallout universe are ghouls. Not to mention even in the wiki it states he died of cancer, so obviously they didn't have an answer for radiation that worked all that well. Just had radaway which only took care of acute radiation sickness, much like Iodine does in our universe, but it doesn't stop the actual cellular damage it causes which leads to cancers.
---
Hopefully its on ps4
---
Do you mean Paladin Danse?
---
Awesome
---
The Purveyor will unmask herself to reveal the Overseer at some point...
---
Thank you!
---
No one nukes the northern part of the savage divide, either. The guy/group was probably targeting camps. The first nuke to drop was down on the ash heap and there were a couple camps in the blast radius. The second was up in the toxic valley on top of hemlock holes and someone's camp. Then finally mine south of paradise station.
---
You can run around the enemies at the soft serve location. I run directly left from where you load in because there's another random encounter spawn on the road there and then go to the spot where the vendor spawns. The enemies never know I'm there.
---
Thank you for the confirmation that I’m not a whacko nut job , was it Xbox as well?
---
Because in highly dangerous world so many people are like, "I'm just going to travel all this distance by myself."
---
Loads of people are playing Diablo 3 seasons under the same circumstances.  
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with leveling the playing field a bit for people who don't have as much time to grind.  I, too, could become a great player by quitting my job and ignoring all my other hobbies for a few months.  But there is no skill and no joy in that.  On the other hand, if you can maximize your playing time better than anyone else, more power to you.
---
Remember kids. 
---
People who use high end gear will always be dupers and anyone who is better is a cheater.
---
This thread is a good idea but sounds so much like whining.
---
I'm hoping that shows up again. Didn't think much of it when it was in the store but saw one in game and it was glorious.
---
Totally true didn't even cross my mind. Kill them slowly.
---
Code is 111418
---
Yesssss they do
---
I ran around the last days and whenever a under lvl 50 player walks trough my way I give him one of my PA's for free course I don't use them anymore and they took 70 stash space that I now can use for other stuff
---
If you don’t want a matching set I like 3 metal limbs, 1 leather, metal chest, the dr/er is pretty good, heavy leather limbs is better than combat if you ask me 32/77 where BOS is 35/45
---
But, you haven't... at all. 
---
I am simply shaking my head at the low effort and transparency, you should feel bad. Not for annoying me... just for general.... suckitude.
---
so maybe use the stash?
---
Yes but those mobs only have like 2 or 3 skins.  12 players with different gear and skins, 12 pets with different skins, and in the case of ISS a bagillion robots.  Adds up quick unless all the dogs look the same.  Like I said, I'm sure modern gaming rigs can handle it.  Consoles, not so much.  Sucks.
---
I’m saving some for friends, but that’s what I’d like to do
---
He gave us a quest. Don't use the nukes. Sorry, static, all I got was use nukes, over and out.
---
I don't think it should be necessary to require a perk card be equipped for either of our ideas.
---
The more I think about it the more I think that your idea might be better. Simply highlighting a corpse that contains a legendary item in some manner would go a long way by itself (sort of like how some quest objectives glow).
---
Wouldn't waste the ammo
---
For real? You can see his body?
---
I know. I was up by twin lakes until I saw someone else's camp on that pond and thought it was a nice looking place. Lots of plants for resources and a brahmin herd downstream. But it's a pain to build on and it seems a lot of people like the camp. But I've got mine looking pretty nice, now.
---
Turn your textures to medium and see if that helps. You can't go higher than that with framerate issues (I should know because my gtx 970 4gb can only do medium textures; discovered the solution via a youtube video). That one setting alone might fix things for you, although I have the very occasional hitch or rubberbanding issue.
---
How did you get the mask?
---
Assholes.
---
If you’d been hooked up as a player vendor, your camp takes no damage though (or am I wrong)? Or is that a way to just target people?
---
I like my hidden “You ain’t never gonna find me” camp. Obscure, near nothing, no resources.
---
It might be understandable if he's shooting super mutants without using Stabilized.
---
Sooooo, it would be a shorter, more repetitive loop of songs! Just what we needed! Appalachia Radio, with LESS content!
---
&gt;The AP regen from ***Lone Wander*** and Nerd Rage don’t really stack with ***action boy***
---
Cripes. I did not know that.
---
Oh. I’m on right now.. :)
---
We. Thought. You. Was. A. Toad.
---
Bit of a necro, but I just had to state this is incorrect, I've seen people in power armor, thus ZERO unyielding effects, one shotting lvl 65 glowing ones all day long, it's the bloodied effect above all else thats to blame, the rest just compound it.
---
Heck, give it a .308 and let us make a DMR
---
Well, I saw someone completely *wreck* the SBQ this morning based on stealth crit melee.  And most proficient gun builds rely on VATS crits to some extent.  So, no, I don't think they are neglected.  If anything, they might be a bit over-represented because it seems like a player who is better with shooting mechanics should outpace the one who relies on an aimbot.
---
&gt; 76 something I want to succeed, but even if I do, even if I have faith that Bethesda will eventually both improve the game systems up to a "Good" level and add content that makes it a better value proposition, I'm not onboard with making this the acceptable way to launch games.
---
That's my point. The past is the past, and the learned lesson from the past was to beta it harder and a lot longer for free to players of the current generation game.
---
The launch has been harped on to tedium. No one is noticing the real nugget that the lesson was learned.
---
It's a good lesson and a good way to move forward.
---
It's more for Bloodied builds, you can radiate yourself to get your health to whe you want it
---
It is a cutting edge advance in power armor protection that was developed with certain parameters in mind, obviously ballistic damage was the priority.  It was not given time to mature and that is reflected in the difficulty of maintenance, especially compared to the T60.  Had those who created it had time to develop it further you have been able to get something better in some ways, but as it is I think it is a product of its time and the devs captured that aspect very well.  
---
Not everything new is going to be the obvious goto choice over what already exists.  Energy weapons are a case in point, you can see they have some promise but the technology is not mature, like it is for gunpowder weapons, so they don't work quite as well or for as long as we want them to, but they can be awesomely powerful in the right circumstances  and that is one of the things that keeps me trying different things in the game be it weapons/armor/perks/mods  to see what works best for me.
---
In a game like this there should not be one dominant build/weapon/armor because not all players are going to go for the same thing.  If there is one dominant meta then everyone will eventually have it and look alike and play alike and that is just boring.  They have more work to do in that respect (looking at mutations) but at least for power armor they got it right in my view.
---

Fairly sure I had my vendors on and was in pacifist mode. Don't think either stops a nuke. I think he was targeting camps by looking for vendor camps.
---

---
I'm not sure what aspect of it would lend itself to interesting gameplay, but it's fun to attend in real life.  I went to it last year.
---
I have an LOL moment related to that. I was in the bed of the pickup trying to pick up those golf balls, and a few were somehow covered up by the basket and I couldn't get to them, so I stupidly shot my shotgun at the basket trying to get it to move and KA-BLOOEY! Oops.
---
Good point.
---
Just exit building mode and wait a few seconds before going back into building mode. This worked for me on Xbox.
---
Thanks, sounds like what a real junkie would do lol
---
No but when I was doing SBQ yesterday I died and didn't auto spawn, like in any event, rather had to manually choose location and when I didn't spawn it spawned me a far distance. To top it off the SBQ would always go attack me and avoid everyone
---
yep, always gets my attention.
---
Great info, thanks!
---
Is it because both pistol and rifleman perks can apply to them simultaneously?
---
Its not only radiation that causes cancer, and there are people in the fallout universe who have lived that long... Roger Maxon being 1 of them, obviously your gonna say no to that because despite everything being shown to you you are dead set on this fanatical belief that for 50 years the brotherhood just sat quietly waiting to come out of a bunker, that a military organisation wouldnt try to contact anyone if 50 years.  
---
Kellogg had an enhanced age but nothing suggested he was even close to expiring even at 108.  
---
If you entire theory lands on Maxon not possibly being able to live until 130 is everything to go on then your theory has very little ground to stand on.  
---
At the end of the day, its a game, not real life, people live as long as they live for because thats just how it is.  
---
Your other point saying that his son tells you he named the brotherhood (which i havent been able to find anything on but im willing to take your word for this on) have you ever considered maybe he was a bit of a liar and tried to take credit for forming the BoS?
---
Long shot is trash.  
---
I do agree that class freak is important and worth sacrificing something else to obtain but I also agree /u/giant_key did a good job trying to fix the build assuming the op wants VATS to be a focus.
---
I'm pretty sure I built it under the current foundation requirements. Problem is the area has some water that interferes with a lot of building. Even when you're not building on water.
---
Where's the bloodbug *probosis*?
---
*sigh*
---
When will people realize that it's not as simple as Bethesda just waving a wand and going "Hey, you have infinite stash now!"?
---
The servers have to keep track of each and every item in your stash box. Each item's stats, mods etc. To allow you to store more items, they need to do more improvements server side to allow the game to track more items being stored.
---
Therefore, making post after post going "We need more stash" "It's about time you increased the stash" "Make the stash upgradable" isn't going to help. Bethesda know we want more stash space. They don't need to be told. If/when they can increase the stash space, they will.
---
I'm female and I don't respect a person just because they're female. I respect those who deserve respect. The people who don't deserve my respect come in all genders and colors
---
Should be .308 instead.
---
Tbh I don't know. Pretty sure someone has info on this.
---
I have a rifleman/commando stealth build and a heavy weapons p/a build on the same character, I swap the heavy weapons cards for carry weight and weight reduction and swap out a couple of p/a perks out in intelligence (can’t remember which, will update later lol).
---
It actually balances out really well and I enjoy the versatility to completely change my play style depending on what I fancy doing. (Level 150+)
---
sure but when does twisted muscles actually come in handy as a ranged sniper?  If you are meleeing stuff you are doing something wrong...
---
If ur level 50 you can use the portable power perk to lower parts and chassis weight while it's in ur inv. Level 3 makes them 75% lighter. That's how I walk around with 50+ chassis constantly, I can't store them or they go back to 10lbs and eat stash space
---
Right after that they will unnerf the .50 and .308 and 10mm.
---
If you want to sell it, you have to do it piece-by-piece.
---
And make Assault rifles 7.62
---
Praise the lamp!
---
They benefit from both.
---
I disagree, I am being very accurate. He said with these types of games “It’s not how you launch, it’s what the game becomes” as in you can launch a shitty game and it’s ok with them as long as it eventually becomes a good one.
---
Nifty!
---
This is awesome! Where might this place be?
---
Agreed.
---
Let's face it Fo76 broke BoS lore just so Bethesda could squeeze in their favorite son.
---
That would only affect two of these items, the candy cane walking stick skin and the slicked metal armor skin.
---
pipe rifle/pistol: collecting item or low level ammo burning, only stacking perk is gunsmith+licenced plumber
---
pipe revolver/bolt action: a rifle stock will stack pistol and rifle perks, along with gunsmith+licenced
---
No problem!
---
FU bethasdea we had a deal, now I'm a commoner again

I was thinking along the lines of customising our own holotapes, not just looping specific songs on the Appalachian radios.

&gt; No one is noticing the real nugget that the lesson was learned.

"Test more" is not some underrated conclusion, it's entirely correct and it's *obvious*. It's implied as part of the "The game was broken at launch" complaint.

I say this every week.

This is why I’m afraid to hook up a vending machine. In true ‘too much Nukashine’ fashion, I’m paranoid the commies are out to get me.

Has it ever been confirmed if that is [James P Connolly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUiN8A5WlKc) voicing that character?
---
Well from my understanding crit basically means aimbot, minimum user effort required, so it makes sense if they don’t want everyone to spam it. It should be used as a help for reflex-challenged, not something everyone use as top choice.
---
Ahhh....good to know. Thank you for the response.
---
Seems like it. They clear inventory every so often. I think the last time they did this was when Wild Appalachia started?
---
Consider the following: buffing the Hunting rifle
---
It's true.  Unfortunately, there is no valid reason to have it applied to the legendary shredder.  :(  Vendors, sure - as you can always buy it back.  There is no such luck with these.

They need to stop updating the single [blog post](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/440xkbWi5YJKr6XyN2YAMW/atomic-shop-patch-9-items-and-sales). It get buried from the new posts.

Nice clickbait. Didnt confirm a single thing. Timestamp is completely irrelivent

I should've snapshotted the map. But it was in the Mire, right on the highway. I want to say South of Abandoned Bog Town. Pretty much right across the street from a pond where a Mireluke Queen lives.

Just an idea to use current assets without the need for new menus. By the amount of down votes I got it seems the majority prefer to stay without perk presets. I would be ok even with only 2 presets with pa and non pa.

Ah, Wadsworth, the first Mr. Handy I fell in love with. Platonically.

It's sad.  The .45 smg is just appallingly bad.

Long Shot allows you to deal more damage over longer distances. Damage drops off the farther away you are from the target, so increased range  = more damage

Ever tried detonating the nuke over there?

you can't say I haven't left a bad taste in your mouth i mean im not saying i ruined your day or anything, at least I hope I didn't.  I mean I honestly don't like the game but like I was also hoping to rustle some jimmies  with this opinion of mine or something.  also you do realize that by engaging with a troll at all you are in fact feeding said troll. the best way to deal with people like me is to ignore them the only reason I'm posting things like this is because i'm bored af and by replying to me your just giving me things to not be bored about.

1.  Dual Yield pistols
---
2.  Legendary Effect:  Solar Powered (to balance or offset Nocturnal)
---
3.  Overall. - Best Weapons and Gear available to ALL without so much RNG (Video Lottery Terminal BS). Fixer should have aiming bonus, Perfect Storm a fire rate improvement, Stand Fast 3 stars ...including Sentinel, for you know, standing fast.
---
4. Game Play - Quest Line to earn plans for vending machines and a business licence .... this would be dope (ie awesome).
---
7.62 is Battle Rifle
---
That or somewhere between Fort Defiance and Watoga Station. I spent all night in that area, so I'm not positive.
---
That's true, the recent removal of spoiling was a bit of a help. But it's still not nearly as populated as it used to be. :(
---
Hmm. Not sure if I have the heavy gunner perk equipped. Also sounds like I need to find a better one.
---
Give us CAMP robots and pets! Also more CAMP space for them.
---
That wasn't a confirmation of anything.
---
But even if it was, if you didn't like the mode keep playing how you want and chose what of the new content to do.
---
I'm sure some folks will enjoy playing that and some won't.
---
There's nothing wrong in letting players chose to play the way they want to.
---
Nuclear winter is known to be more than just the new mode. There will be raids and other things as well as the data mined stuff.
---
He kinda does brush off the question , and replied that hopefully whatever damage it does it’s not that much hahaha so yeah he’s aware people that are fans of the game won’t like it but he said on a business point of view they’re gonna jump in the band wagon to try to make a buck
---
Yeah in New Vegas fam. There are real world rifles and LMG’s chambered in 7.62 mm
---
Yeah crafting lots of 308 is a bit of a challenge, even with the ammo Smith perk, although it helps a lot
---
Ya, no. They aren't talking about fallout, or nuclear winter, they're talking about how gaming as a whole is going and how he deals with large scale projects. You're the one that found pieces from 2 different puzzles that happen to fit together
---
&gt;Its not only radiation that causes cancer, and there are people in the fallout universe who have lived that long... Roger Maxon being 1 of them, obviously your gonna say no to that because despite everything being shown to you you are dead set on this fanatical belief that for 50 years the brotherhood just sat quietly waiting to come out of a bunker, that a military organisation wouldnt try to contact anyone if 50 years.
---
Correct they didn't try to contact anyone for 50 years because they didn't want to contact anyone, who were they going to contact the government they turned against? The military they rioted against and killed prior to the bombs dropping? It doesn't make any sense for them to try to reach out to anyone after the bombs dropped as they didn't want to include outsiders. That is literally one of their biggest founding tenants was no outsiders.
---
&gt;Kellogg had an enhanced age but nothing suggested he was even close to expiring even at 108.
---
Exactly, it required many cybernetics that were created in the institute a science based community that created teleportation. Even with that even they were blown away at his ability to survive for that long. If it were so common for people to live for over 100 years it wouldn't have been such a big deal that kellogg lived as long as he did and Sean wouldn't have died of cancer at 50, with all these supposed medical advances they had. ESPECIALLY in the institute with their ability to create teleporters and synthetic humans.
---
&gt;If you entire theory lands on Maxon not possibly being able to live until 130 is everything to go on then your theory has very little ground to stand on.
---
Likewise your entire theory lands on him being able to live to be over 140 years old.  Which is even more flimsy than me saying there is no way he lived that long.
---
&gt;Your other point saying that his son tells you he named the brotherhood (which i havent been able to find anything on but im willing to take your word for this on) have you ever considered maybe he was a bit of a liar and tried to take credit for forming the BoS?
---
Uh, you realize it was a huge group of people, not just him and his grandfather right? So how exactly would he be able to lie and trick all those people into just forgetting they've been using the "brotherhood of steel" name for roughly 30 years prior to him thinking it up? 
---
You are literally not even making sense at this point just to try to find a reason for the retcon in the BoS lore to not be a retcon. You are trying to claim people are running around in the post apocolypse at 140 years old, hundreds of people forgetting the name of their group for the previous 30 years, and claiming, "Oh, all the history and lore that states and shows how isolationist they were and avoided all contact with the outside world even to their own detriment are just lies."
---
You just aren't even making sense at this point. Seriously go back and play FO1 and side with the brotherhood, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about, there is no way what is going on in FO76 isn't a retcon. 
---
I mean hell, even the scumbag oxhorn that is a huge fo76 fanboy admits they retconned the hell out of the brotherhood of steel to shoe horn them into this game.
---
They need to have a star next to their name. I killed one without a star and it gave no credit. Killed 3 with stars so far and they all gave credit.
---
Not angry. Just tired of lazy people. 
---
If you noticed, there was an OR in my sentence. Just search this sub for "should I" and see how many times people have asked if they should buy the game, or if they should come back. 
---
Then read some of the responses and you should be able to make an informed decision.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rifle
---
They're talking about gaming cycles.. And what's popular now, battle royale is popular now and over saturated. The interviewer points that out and Todd's reaction speaks volumes.
---
Pretty sure it’s just the revolver if nodded with a stick and barrel. Regular pipe rifle and bolt action only count in one category.
---
Yes, it *is* an excuse.  Just because you find it onerous, as do I, doesn't mean it doesn't make business sense.
---
I'd want nothing more than a proper TES on mobile.  But it just won't happen because mobile gamers are a weird bunch.  Take-Two tried it with Civilization 6 on the iPad.  Players balked at the price.  It wasn't their first go either, as they had tried it with XCOM in the past.
---
The other problem is that the mobile market is immature and keeps moving.  It's not like you release a game and call it done.  Apple and Google constantly make new demands.  In Take-Two's case, they simlly gave up on supporting a number of premium titles.
---
And the traditional console/PC dev doesn't operate like that.  If something requires long term support, it needs a way to make long term profit.
---
They never went anywhere.  You can get +60% damage from 6 perks instead of 9 and you can get +120% damage from perks if you go all in.  People are sheep, so once a few people learn that it's good everyone else gloms on but pops have been top tier since launch.
---
Is it a big, goofy mascot head?  If it's the one I'm thinking of, it's a cartoon mole head, and you can find it along with the outfit behind an upstairs locked door at Dolly Sods Wilderness.
---
There's Raider Leathers, Road Leathers, Harness, and Long Johns. I can show you each before you buy and you can choose one. Also, you can just Google those. They are the same items with the same appearance as Fallout 4. I should be able to jump on and look for you in a bit. I'll look for your friend invite. IGN: jchamlin
---
I had a radtoad for a while. Lived happily until Vendor trading brought travellers and enemies.
---
Annoying because he was ALWAYS standing in the door to my camp. Kept the door open and blocked, lol.
---
No raccoons in game but I would happily tame a fox or gulper if I could find one. 
---
I just got hyped for dogs because dog armor already exists, but if we could get gear for other pets... omg. One of the mods I used in FO4 was Deathclaw Hats. Served no purpose aside from letting you equip hats on docile deathclaws XD
---
That's one of the ways the bug manifests
---
Nowhere did I say it was a bad thing.
---
Absolutely appreciated all the feedback.  This build definitely changed lol.
---
We need to keep at it.
---
Torn wings for everyone!
---
Agreed, it's a little annoying that a skull popping 50 should barely dent one of the muties. Knight Captain Dusk would be disappointed.
---
Yeah totally agree with their reasoning for doing it.
---
Click bait would be linking to one of those 12 minutes or 20 minute videos from you tubers reading and speculating things and stretching and adding millions of filling words and random closing 5 minute plug
---
Fuck no, Jim Sterling is a damn good content creator and I see zero reason not to.
---
But if you start as level 1 today, and three months from now I start a survival character, and you're level 150 with endgame gear, its the same problem.  Seasons means that survival is always viable for everyone.
---
Lol thanks man my bad.
---
I saw the tourist Anne at the top of the landview light house. Psn is wakoagemaki I'm probably going to get off in like 30 mins or so.
---
I prefer Marine, others will say BOS.  All have trade offs, you decide what is best for you/your situation/your aesthetic.
---
I'm not sure the body is literally called out as Sanjay, but it's next to a holotape of his, where he explained that he was investigating problems at the aforementioned water plant.
---
Was that ever in doubt?
---
You need them now to craft stimpack diffusers
---
... they are all dark green.
---
that was nice of them, just hope the 6 month wait didn't begin at the end of the extended deadline.
---
&gt;I mean hell, even the scumbag oxhorn that is
---
I mean, at least we agree on something
---
Oh you just made my day!
---
Poor old Bearsie.  I give him trouble, but he's fun to have around.
---
Skins have absolutely nothing to do with performance.
---
If skins cause server instability then there is a serious problem and the game should not be for sale.
---
And im pretty sure a ps4 can handle 40 different skins.. i mean almost all mp games have skins and the have no problems
---
Do it again.
---
You can Max out on these.  I cant remember what the MAX was ... I disposed of them back in the Blue Suitcase at Watoga Station days ...currently try to get back up to it so I know what it is.
---
I just want robots at my camp
---
Clickbait is a misleading title that will get the video more clicks, like how he did here. Nothing was confirmed or even relevant to the title he posted. Making it clickbait
---
Just wait for the nuclear winter battle royale mode. It's rumored to be like that...
---
"Fun game" LOL that's a good one! thanks I needed a laugh today!  I had more fun with Ride to Hell Retribution then i ever did with 76.
---
It is anti-consumer to release a buggy unfinished product, but i'm sure a fanboy like you is happy to get exploited.  
---
Nobody is calling for the game not to get updated, that's a false dichomotmy, what we are ACTUALLY saying is that those "updates" that fixed glitches should've been in the game in the first place.  You want to get fucked up the ass by Bethesda?  Fine, but don't expect the rest of us to blindly suck them off.
---
Also nice ableism with the tiresome "reee" meme.
---
LOL. Of course it isnt on PS4. No mod support on consoles. But hes right, you are severely limiting the output of all three weapon classes by not focusing on one of them and building around it. Its alright to save ammo with a melee weapon that you are using "unbuffed" and focus on heavies for your perk cards. In fact, I would say you are likely *wasting* more ammo than you are saving with this setup by not buffing your guns because you are leaving so much damage on the table spreading yourself so thin. 
---
Maybe something like this to boost your melee weapons a bit while still focusing on heavies?
---

---
I mostly look for reasonably priced Sentinel gear, Bloodied melee weapons, and cheap dog food.
---
But my title doesn't say battle royale is confirmed? And its also not my video.... So why would I click bait?
---
The rainbow of mono-color PA and Pip-Boy skins from the Creation Club store in Fallout 4 would be nice additions.
---
Maybe have a standard and season survival mode? When a season ends your character is now a standard survival character, kinda like Diablo 3
---
What system
---
You should work for JuiceHead or YongYea or the others of their ilk.
---
Who gives a s*** if it's clickbait and what business is it of yours anyway?
---
This increases the damage. I've got an explosive one and it melts people in 3-5 shots.
---
Yeah, despite having no living human NPCs we can see the voice lines of yhe deceased, missing, or nonhuman have more emotion than previous games.
---
im renawana but im on xbox. you wouldn't dare mute my high quality screaming
---
Not yet.  I would gladly buy it from you.  Let me know when you want to meet online.
---
Sure but a good stealth sniper will one shot all the things.  overkill at the expense of other more important perks is suboptimal imo, but ymmv.
---
enjoyment is a subjective thing some people enjoy Risk but I hate it that's just a thing y'feel me i get ya puttin down bait here but lbr ya wanna argue about pineapple on pizza while i aint into it doesnt mean there aint seven people in the room who dont. sometimes you might want it. sometimes you might not. what mood strikes ya. what doesn't.
---
your experiences aren't universal and that's really the only thing i can say so despite the flaws and errors this game might have and i will acknowledge them because you can be critical of something and enjoy it all the same, i still have fun with it
---
i hope your sex with ants goes good
---
Maybe they became isolationists because of 76 and West Virginia. Stating they did absolutely nothing, when they were/are the most highly trained outfit, besides the enclave, in the wastelands is just ludicrous. Reconnaissance and information are the life blood of an army. Well a good one anyway. And yes I'm aware of "military intelligence".
---
I agree with your points. I play this as an RPG of sorts, and hate the idea of losing all my stuff every season. I don't see myself playing more than one season if they go that route. I'm not playing survival to kill other players, I'm playing to develop a character in a more hostile and challenging world.
---
Does anyone know of any links that discuss the differences of each kind of armor/mods to save me the time?
---
Lies! All lies! lol..... jk
---
I don't think it's tangential, I think it's perfectly valid.  People got rightfully pissed at No Man's Sky for being a barebones game with almost none of the promised features in it, and most that payed full price for that game don't care if it's "good now" because they're terrible first impression turned them off from ever playing it again, and same deal with 76, lots of people had such a poor experience that no amount of updates is going to make a difference, you only get one launch these days and if you blow that it's highly unlikely you'll be getting people back.
---
Sounds like a good compromise to me.
---
 "Incase we didnt have enough battle royale confirmation", "nuclear winter confirmed as battle royale".. u sure u didnt say its confirmed? U sure u aren't clickbating for reddit karma?
---
Lucky Hole Mine for lead, ammosmith, super duper.  Craft anything you need.
---
Oh, cool , thanks
---
I'm melee, so I'm looking for particular legendary Super Sledges, just getting into refining my armor. I'm only visiting those types of vendors. It's hard to determine what someone has. I could go to a level 5 who has great items, because it's an alt character. I can go to a level 250, and they're selling costumes/masks, non-legendary weapons/armor. For my machines, I have a little of just about everything.
---
Sorry can't am pc
---
Who cares about reddit karma? Only karma I care about is the karma on the fallout market place.
---
Cool, fr sent 👍🏻
---
Crafting is your best bet, use the ammosmith and super duper perk cards
---
Give us a perk called Chamber Master where you get a 5%, 15% and 25% faster reload ok bolt action weapons
---
So I already had it on medium, so I switched it to low. Still have the same 40 average FPS, but I seemed to get less hiccups, I don’t have time to play now, but I will definitely have to do a longer trial with the low settings.
---
okay daddy
---
Captured flying saucer and an alien in cold storage??? I'm afraid I haven't heard of either og these before. Mind elaborating a bit?
---
Wow....that much damage? I had no idea. I didn't really pay any attention to that, or ranged weapons in general since I use melee. I'm always hearing about tse's , then bloodied, and now legacy weapons...so I was just curious. I thought pipe rifles were the new flavor of the month so to speak..lol.  Anyway, thanks for the response.
---
I didn’t even know about Super Duper, I’ll definitely get that.
---
Aaah very cool, thanks.
---
Crap I just started a stealth sniper like 3 hours ago. hahahaha.
---
Like it so far.
---
Any specific type?
---
THIS!!
---
Thanks for wasting 3 minutes of my time listening to Todd ramble on aimlessly, saying nothing.
---
I wouldn't call it a good deal for 60 bucks considering how blatantly broken the game was(and still is in a number of areas) and considering the massive price drops it got after only one week(that has to be a record, i've NEVER seen a full-priced game get such a massive price drop THAT quickly after release, it speaks volumes as to what a major flop it was).
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda(or should I say Bugthesda) did in fact know the game was a broken piece of shit on launch but didn't give a fuck and release it anyways.
---
But with concentrated fire, he will gain something like 20 accuracy per shot. The issue is how many shots he will get with an AP expensive semi auto rifle. He may be able to low it to something workable by using red dot sights, aligned barrels and grip, and quick eject magazines. Those all reduce AP costs. I am unfamiliar with weapon mods for the hunting rifle or level action rifle though. I assume they have some aligned mods though.
---
Still, vats accuracy legendaries can be exceptional useful for this situation.
---
I'm still hesitant to buy any backpacks right now. I feel like the second I do something better will come out. That being said the corvega does look slick.
---
Thaats gold! Hahaha
---
That would be great. People would actually play the objective instead of killing the sheepsquatch or whatever.
---
I believe the only "lesson" that publishers learned is "people will willingly throw money at a broken piece of shit game if you hype it and lie enough"
---
Sounds to me like you need that crutch and are scared to lose it.  I have most of the explosive lasers and I don’t need to use them to be the kill leader nearly all of the time.  If I pull out the lasers well sucks to be you.  I don’t even need to know where you are to kill you. Just a general area.  I can miss you by 20 feet and still kill you.  You can have 1000 energy resistance - guess what?  Doesn’t make a difference.  That’s not fun for me.  I like my enemies to have a chance but that’s just me.
---
I look for cheap stims, vanguard armor, and plans I don't know,
---
Are the diffusers in the game now?
---
Aten_ra also had it happen to legendary armor he was wearing, and another person had a whole suit of t-51b power armor disappear on him with a nuka cola skin (https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwrshv/my_whole_t51b_power_armor_set_is_gone/) . So it seems to be an issue with any skins, not just atom shop ones. :(
---
Just be wary, cause beth refuses to replace any items lost even due to bugs they create.
---
I have decent weapons for most ballistic ammo types, but I could use .308, .50 cal, 10mm, and plasma cores.
---
This nonsense placebo came out after every patch. Doesnt need even maths to know it's all bogus. For every patch where condition "breaks so much faster wtf bethesda!!" Every weapon should break after 3 bullets by this point. 
---
Wait another 5 years for patch 50 and i swear to good this shit will still come up. Same with thirst and hunger.
---
Instigating/Bloodied/Unyielding/Bolstering as far as legendary goes.
---
Always got an eye out for stable flux, at a decent price at least, or any of its components.   
---
Unknown plans for sure.
---
Nice that is the one thank you so much kind sir or madame
---
The title of the video does specify what realistically was talked
---
I'm low level and I have been buying up any unknown plans or recipes that are 50 caps or less.
---
3 minutes? You only needed to watch about 10 seconds.... It should have been obvious which bit I'm on about.
---
I look for cheap PA mod/parts plans.
---
I thought you were talking about Real World brands, like Red Bull power armor
---
No offense bud but have you not noticed the way your graphics constantly downgrade while you move around the game world?  It's most noticable in first person on your armor on ps4 but its definately done on purpose.  Also, sbq and iss are a lag show right now if too many people show up for it with all the adds and spell effects.  More skins wont help that especially if its animating 12 more pets.
---
Cool, I’ll have a look
---
The video, yes. The post, which I'm referring to, no.
---
I've found 4 so far and never even really been looking for them. One more for the leatherworking badge.
---
ppl need to learn from dis guy right here. 
---
he gets me.
---
I hope he has fun doing whatever his username is supposed to mean
---
he deserves actual puppies 
---

---
Doubt it , implied during the latest interview that it’s really not profitable for at least the next 5 years or so
---
If you use events to fast travel, can’t people just camp those travel points like they do trainstations?
---
Survival is already viable for everyone who actually engages in it and understands it.
---
&gt; I wouldn't call it a good deal for 60 buck 
---
I'd consider it a hell of a deal. I'm 250 hours in and still haven't gotten around to the end quest of the original game let alone the new DLC.
---
$ per play time is the only way to measure value objectively and for me and a hell of a lot of other people it is a game of huge value.
---
Please tell me thats a real disease! If not.. Bethesda?, this right here ^´^´ cause this should be in game. Let us sleep with other creatures. Lol
---
Wasn't the handmade rifle in Nuka World chambered for 7.62mm?  That would make sense considering the original AK-47 was chambered in that round.
---
I was giving you the benefit of the doubt that something, hell, ANYTHING, substantial would be said... and I also thought you f'ed up the timestamp so I watched along a little further.
---
There's nothing obvious in this, other than clickbaiting people into watching Todd's meaningless babble is a douchebag move.
---
Why do you hate robots so much? Did an Assaultron Dominator get a little too dominant? Did Mr. Handy get too Handy or did a Sentry Bot make you feel insecure?
---
oohhh, if you just restarted your character, you've got lots of time to toy with different weapons and builds.  In previous iterations of FO, I was always a gunner.  
---
This is my first melee.  Felt really weird at first.  
---
No planning, I just picked perks that worked with the weapons I had on my at the time....ended up melee.  L94 now, and I really enjoy it.
---
I‘m on your server, thanks!
---
For five atoms
---
5.56 ammo, rare outfits, legendaries, and a neat camp design.
---
Well, it is rated M.  If the kids are around, it's their own damn fault. XP
---
Sshhh...
---
I've even added the exact time to stop watching now, To me his reaction to what the interviewer says gives away so much.
---
New mission: date an assaultron.
---
Seriously though, I heard from someone this was cut content.
---
You need [one of these](https://imgur.com/TJ9EqmA).  It'll kill anything that's not a boss or scorchbeast with one sneak attack headshot.
---
now you got the hang of it u/blakthumb ignoring a troll is the only way to get the troll to stop. if i didnt already know what i did annoyed you I wouldn't have bothered but now that i do i will give you puppies 
---
It would be anti consumer to deliver a broken game and not fix it.
---
Fixing a game that was actually quite playable at release, despite big issues, is not anti-consumer.
---
Maybe they should have waited the 7 weeks to release and rolled all the patches in. But a lot of those issues discovered were uncovered from people playing it.
---
Maybe they should have beta'd it longer. 
---
Yep. That's what they learned.
---
For me $60 for almost a decade of Fallout content is a steal.
---
Might have to do with the servers being player based. Most other MMORPGs have dedicated servers allowing them to go back in that servers logs and repair or enter code that would restore or generate an item to a player registered to that "realm" (for lack of a better term) your data is most likely stored client side and authenticated when you log into a "player" server. That could make it difficult to edit or restore linked to that player. But would save tons on server farms and ensure we don't have to pay monthly fees.
---
7.62 millimeters approximates to 300 thousandths of an inch (30 caliber)
---
&gt;Nuclear winter confirmed as battle Royale
---
No, just the text of your post says it's confirmed.
---
Having issues with this now, can not find a server with 3 or more people
---
To generous make it 1/5 of a atom
---
.50 was buffed for hunting rifles :)
---
Yeah we're actually past the click bait bit now. What you're doing now is wasting more of your time moaning about click bait than the actual "click bait" wasted.
---
Yes it is, we do lose any caps over 25,000.
---
I'm usually looking for plans, but I'll typically grab anything else that's reasonably or cheaply priced. 
---
It's like when you go to store in real life. You go for some milk, but see the chips near the cash register and grab them too.
---
I knew what it was, my comment was somewhat misleading, but it was supposed to mock how rare random events are, creating the "what mr. bandit"... effect.
---
Sure thing. Can you wait till about 7pm eastern time? Currently working
---
I have all those weapons you just listed off and then some.  Actually, many people do lol.  They are not broken like the explosive laser.  You can’t kill somebody from halfway across the map while they’re hiding behind a building with any of those.  You pretty much can with a laser.
---
Yeah that's why I clarified which one I was talking about.
---
Unfortunately Bethesda seems to have difficulty getting their priorities right. I would never want to experience their concept of  VR
---
its amazing for ammo crafting, just found out about it myself a few weeks ago
---
Oooooft disaster bro
---
"Bethesda finally fulfills promise to ship canvas bags" is not going to generate sales, and I suspect they know that. Assuming that the news hits the media anyhow. I somehow doubt "They finally finished" is going to draw the attention that the original Canvasgate did, so I suspect first we'll know about it will be on this sub, if anything.
---
Not as much as stations, and there's a bit more leeway in where you spawn in.
---
Putting a specific randomly generated item in a specific clients inventory is a lot more difficult than creating a reward system for a specific item.
---
Sadness
---
I had 21K caps and someone bought my 15K lmg 😥
---
The LMG as a standalone gun is a complete POS. I have never gotten a decent legendary drop for it but it seems it becomes usable with explosive or two shot or bloodied.
---
The assaultron masseuses at the Whitesprings have shown us that they lack the... fine motor skills... necessary for more intimate encounters.
---
Heavy and 2h work, sort of, but trying to throw pistols in there is just gimping. As many have said it's pretty much all or nothing with weapon perks else everything will seem extra bullet spongey. I'd recommend rolling another toon to try different weapons.
---
Well with so many RL men's playing female toons, you never know who you're embracing ;)
---
I am not wasting time now. I am using my time as I choose to continue pointing out what a d-bag move doing this is...
---
Seconding what /u/EdoSeventh said. Was told about Lucky Hole Mine recently (also a returning launch player). Going in with Excavator armor got me an insane amount of lead.  Between that, steel farm runs at Big Bends Tunnel, and the Super Duper+Ammosmith perks, I haven't really been hurting for ammo.
---
This usually occurs when someone is over encumbered. I don't know the reasoning behind it but that's what's been happening.
---
You'll be limper than a senator's handshake once you realize just how insane the cost of using the lmg is.
---
At this point, player vending machines are also a good bet. Most people sell bullets at a cap a piece.
---
What I’m NOT looking for is Weapons and armor that aren’t legendary
---
FBI! OPEN UP!
---
It's not my fault you can't see the glaring clues in his body language to the battle royale comment. I thought it was obvious, obviously I was wrong. I don't feel anymore needs to be said between me and you. Let's agree to disagree and just move on.
---
You're better off grabbing what you can and jumping worlds. I've known some people to lose some stuff when these things shut down.
---
Put your base near hemlock holes, get the workshop locked down when  you get online, then you do breach and clear every time you see it. 
---
Smelt down the ore with the acid, then Smith the Bullets you need
---
No, "engaging" with a troll is not "being trolled".
---
Falling for their initial bait, and getting riled up about it... is being trolled.
---
A transparent troll if no kind of troll at all. And trying to convince yourself that you somehow succeeded here... is just … sad.
---
Maybe they could implement an invisible reserve that would automatically replenish your caps as you spend. I guess I'm missing the point of the stash cap in the first place. Maybe it keeps capsploitation from getting out of hand.
---
Personal preference and taste
---
 Get rid of VATS. Problem solved. ;)
---
But yet you were talking to them......
---
So what you are saying is that you want to be a sneaky sniper, but you don't have the patience to be a true sneaky sniper because it can be boring.  When you get mobbed you have to be able to heal through the encounter which often means mitigating the damage so you can heal either by using better armor or getting away from some of the mobs (marsupial since you do not like the PA/jet pack option to jump on something high).  You might also consider a splody automatic rifle of some kind if you do not have one, maybe TS, Furious or something along that line, and maybe adjust your perks to make you more survivable in mob situations.  Your call.
---
get off the roof, coward
---
They've got plenty of time to work on it for a september release.
---
Some cult inspired gear would be really cool.
---
Honestly, I find it confusing.  The plague mask, for example - I figured that would be a typical addition I could buy later. No, it was a one week deal and now it's gone.
---
Maybe they explain that in their formal blog, but as far as the in-store text goes, it says nothing beyond "limited time," which is also used to describe anything on sale.
---
Yeah, in FO1 which is well over 50 years they were hunkered down in their bunker. Hell do you remember all the hoops you had to jump through to even get them to talk to you? LOL
---
Is it worth the 1800 caps?
---
I look for rare stuff that you don't often see. It's also what I stock in my machines. Holotape games, syringer barrels, rare plans, rare uniforms, and glitched items
---
That makes it easy since you know where everyone is.
---
I'd think so, as it has a really cool looking design, but thats just my opinion
---
You do not queue up shots in FO76. That is clearly in reference to one of the other games in the series. I easily empty 20 rounds in vats, reload, then continue shooting.
---
Right, can you do me shielded road leathers?
---
I’ve got the ballistic scrap and stable flux, working on the cork now :)
---
So for that you’re better off making it. Ammo Smith and Super Duper will be your friend with that. As far as materials, I farm tin can alarms for lead and steel. You can look up online where they all are. There’s a few in the Whitesprings pro shop and some in the Dam building by the mire but they’re all over. For gun powder, wherever there are super Mutants. Westek, Generals Steakhouse and that dam I mentioned are good places for that. Also at  westek on the roof there are a bunch of paint cans for more lead and steal.
---
i appreciate you and i love these puppies
---
Mine wasn't that bad but I hit the cap and someone started buying all my ammo and stable flux so I was like F*** and just started buying three-star armor from the camp I was at to try to 'save' some of the money. I ended up losing about 2k caps but I sold some of the armor back. The 'reserve' is cool.
---
But it shows some level of accessibility.  You are stating complete isolationist. Which if that was the case, those turrets would've shredded you for looking at the gate.
---
I agree but I wasn’t sure on the price!
---
I usually drop the frames at a station. You can leave the bits in it if you want to have another player be pleasantly surprised when they come across it.
---
Yes. I even bought the plan off someone (for a lot of caps and a trade)
---
The alien in cold storage is near the ammo dump near tyler county fairgrounds.  You have to have a key to get in and don't ask me where i found the key, I truly don't remember  key is called something like TNT2 key or something.  Sorry not in front of my xbox right now.  The flying is outside in the southern mountain range in the savage divide.  My friend and I were trying to do the weekly one week of taking a picture of an alien.  After several beers IRL we set off and of course did not find one but did actually and hilariously find the the flying saucer.  if you look down it is easy to see from one of the overlooks.  You can't actually interact with it and it's not particularly interesting looking but it is there with a fence around it.
---
i blame kotaku
---
I dropped so many legendaries..loot..scrap..meds..everythibgg to maintain weight. I had enough. I have a secobd xbox (my sons) that i "borrow" when they go to sleep. It has my mules. A maxed junk account, one for my personal collection (rare outfits, legacies, dope guns i dont wanna lose) one soecificallt i dump steel, ores, lead and acid into so when i need ammo hes right there homding my stuff..a second vendor with stuff i only buy from others camps and track the profit/loss...and one that holds all the mats needed to make serums as well as serums i craft. I use him in a punch for extra cappage if i ever need it..its rare but those times do come around...
---
No duping..ever. But i build alot for me abd others..mod anything and everything i can..build and mod  power armor..and hoard like a mother. It also allows me to max my camp vendors out..as anythibg in mystash is for sale.  So somepeople dont agree with it..but its how i play. And when you get all these guys inventories right how you want it..and everhthibgs working well..the game is so much more fun. I pick up everythibg. I save everything. And i have EVERYTHING whenever i need it. Someone popsup abd wants a camp built? Done? Need your handmade modded? Yea i have 600 screws..an excavator left leg? Sure thing bud. Haha this game is dope.
---
I'm pretty sure Sanjay and the guy from Always Vigilant are still alive
---
Same here, back to work after being off for a week, so 7:00pm works for me.   
---
I keep hoping to win the lottery, but it’s a lot like trying to find this mask....  . grin.
---
I’m looking for legendary mole miner gauntlets
---
Yeahh, bit overpriced but I'm definitely wanting this for my Enclave character
---
&gt;It's not my fault you can't see the glaring clues in his body language to the battle royale comment
---
LOL. I wish you all the enjoyment in the world in your tin foil hat...
---
FUUUUUUCKK YEEEEEAAAAAHHHH, I was waiting ages for it, insta buy for me!
---
Bethesda died the day they cut Obsidian out. It would not surprise me if one day I go to turn on the game and it is no longer there.
---
I have really good legendary gear but still wish there was a survival mode with 0 legendary effects on. I dont think you need to start at 0 to keep it fair but turning the legendaries off for survival would really even the playing ground between everyone
---
OMG.  Genius.  Liked and subscribed without even being asked three times per video.
---
Same bro!
---
It is good, and you can apply on T51b, T60 too, not just on X-01
---
Or we just wait until E3 and see what he says then?
---
I stated complete isolationist for the first 50 years after the bombs dropped. By the time fo1 comes around they quit that absolute complete isolationism.
---
nono i never said engaging with trolls is being trolled i said engagment is what trolls are looking for when they mess with ppl
---
Yeah this was more of a jokey post trying to point out his reaction to a battle royale comment....kinda wish I hadn't bothered now.
---
Yes! I always think of that character when I hear him.
---
r/oopsdidntmeantoo
---
Yes for the XP...
---
There's a screenshot of it in the blog post someone linked in this thread. It looks like it's at least as wide as the standard one, if not a little wider. I'm not a fan of the look, personally.
---
This is why I’m scared to set up a player shop. My camp is in an obscure part of the mire where no one will find it. The people who build near the whitespring have more courage than I.
---
As someone who has a camp beside TMPP, I wanna smack that scribe with my power fist
---
As a shop owner, sure check out my house.  BUT CLOSE THE GOD DAMN DOORS!  Seriously this bothers me.
---
I bet this guy is great at parties...
---
Probably the usual "debut at 8pm EST" for PC.
---
But holy monkeys I'm super happy they're re-releasing Blackbird! As one who fell in love with the SR-71 back in the late 80s (stumbled across it in a book at the elementary-school's library), I was super bummed to discover the skin while datamining and come to find it had came-and-went already. Been having my fingers crossed for so long that they'll re-release it.... so YAY!!
---
I have light laminate floors and I really love them. Depends on the theme you are going for. My camp has light laminate floors and the orange carpet when it was free and a Bunch of small other items to make it look like a small set of cabins with a bar however I constantly get attacked by mongrels (was good at first but as soon as I log on boom there go my crops) but now I’m getting annoyed. I’m only level 47 BECAUSE I’ve spent so much time on my camp.
---
But going back to the topic like the first comment said, preference and taste is important. What catches your eye when you scroll past? How much are you willing to spend in total? What theme do you want your camp? Is your camp going to be open to everyone or closed off? Questions like these will help you get a picture
---
I think setting up some sort of outside communication should have been the goal from the start. not having NPCs is ok, but I HATE that every quest and event is given to us by some oddly sentient prerecorded messages.
---
This makes me want to murder people.  Just close the door behind you.
---
Maybe lose the old-style VHS tracking effect.  It's kinda distracting.  Other than that...[A+++](https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWEucmJsLm1zL2ltYWdlP3U9JTJGZmlsZXMlMkYyMDE2JTJGMTIlMkYxNyUyRjYzNjE3NTM1NjEzNjU4MTA1Mzc1NDI3NTQxMF9kMWYxNjJjOS1jZDQ3LTQzZTAtODI0Mi02ZmEzNTQzYjdlNTguZ2lmJmFtcDtobz1odHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRmF6NjE2NTc4LnZvLm1zZWNuZC5uZXQmYW1wO3M9MTk1JmFtcDtoPTFkN2I5ZmI3MzEwMTFlZGQ2YTM5ZDY5Y2RjMzJkODE4OWU5MzhmODc1NjI4ZjNkYjJhYTc2NDJlOWQ5YjRmZjQmYW1wO3NpemU9OTgweCZhbXA7Yz0zODIxMzkyNzU1IiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTU1OTk0NzI0OH0.1tS4RYMaSIq7VTwMWtQ412y-9RfJbR3hmqTJe7MFK6g/img.jpg)
---
I don't get killed instantly by them, any faster than any other BE weapon. Before the sent/ass nerf, I could even react and kill them, just knowing where they're shooting from.
---
That is bs. Hope they fix it!
---
Ultracite get included or did those of us who use it get shafted yet again?
---
What power armors can you paint with this??  Can I put this on excavator or ultracite??
---
Deep Pocketed Studded Heavy Leather alllll daaaaaaay!
---
Until legendaries. Then I prefer whatever I can get to reduce gun and ammo weights to not have to waste perk cards on them.
---
Sure. 1,000 caps with your materials, or 1,500 caps if we use mine.
---
I just want the Lumberjack outfit to complete my character is that so much to ask? I unfortunately wasn't playing at the time.
---
I've killed just as many with the aoe from my handmade...
---
I got a really good pipe revolver from the purveyor and I love it. It does 340ish damage and thats with rifleman perks only. 
---
Sure CaptainNoob's bloodied one was pushing the 1000's with all the perk cards and Max adrenaline. Could be wrong though.
---
My point is that it is a great weapon and deserves more love!
---
I appreciate it!! And I will be sure to use less of the effect on the future!
---
Use mine, I’m a bit low on caps at the mo :)
---
Sounds like they didn’t know what they were doing to me.
---
this is my merchants nightmare
---
That’s a long time lol
---
I can't wait to see a new one.  I'd love to assist, but I play on PC.
---
So 90% of people I've fought with don't know what they're doing? Yes the sentinel assassin nerf makes it so now you die to them, but you die to everything else just as quick...
---
Light laminate floors are a must. Also I bought paint for the large water purifiers as they are a huge ugly eyesore in their rusted original form. That’s about it for the atom shop that’s a must for me. Then I’d go to the whitesprings train station and buy all the brick and barn building sets
---
Wanna know you troll a shitty troll?
---
Tell them they're a shitty troll. It's the one thing they can't stand.
---
Cheap plans I don't know and all the Disease Cures you have (freaking rad worms).
---
Nope. Sanjay can be found dead in Tygart water plant, and Niraj Singh is notably deceased from Parkinson's Disease.
---
Cletus Wicklecter
---
$18 dollars
---
EIGHTEEN
---
ima nope out on this
---
The ones that stoke your imagination and make you shit yourself with excitement over a new build or concept.
---
Sorta glad sanjay is dead. The guy seems like a wackbag
---
My CAMP got obliterated by a scorch beast and I was unable to repair all because I didn’t have a frog jar. I had to rebuild everything individually and I still didn’t get to replace froggy :(
---
I dropped 11k on a BE railway rifle and the dude quickly logged out after lol
---
You need to hit us with either a BUNCH of tour photos or a video tour.
---
Hello, just like to mention some bugs I have been experiencing on Xbox one X, Ive noticed hard crashes of the game when trying to play in The Burrows area and also an invisible staircase object when trying to acess the secret keypad in Overlook Cabin (the keypad used to open the next secret wall to obtain the TNT dome key). Thanks and im loving the game as usual and just want to see it become better and better.
---
Yep, all the T and the X series of PA get the paint job :) 
---
T-45, T-51, T-60 and X-01 each have their own and keep their models.  
---
Unlike Four Horsemen, which had I known they converted any PA to look that way, would've not gotten War Rider... Love the Black Rider, though!
---
All is forgiven now that I CAN GET BLACKBIRDDDDDD!!!!  
---
\*happy dance\*
---
Hey man, I completely agree, but it still looks fucking boss
---
brown chicken brown cow!
---
I usually just sleep with the female mannequins, the wasteland made my character snap
---
Similar but different issue.... i bought the imposter sheepsquach skin,  for the assultron head, from the atom store...thinking just that,  it was a skin.... but it turns out its not a skin but instead gives you the ability to craft useless un-legendary assultron heads with the sheepsquach skin on it. After reading your issue,  i suppose i got the better deal from the atom shop.
---
I have bought quite a few higher priced items from vendors. I make it a habbit to msg them before i do abd ask if they have room or id they need a minute to transfer.  Last  time i get a discoubt..because they had 18k and it was a 10k purchase..gave it to me dor 7k. 
---
We cant let bsg win. If im gonna spend 10k for them to only get 7 and the other 3 dissappear? Pft. Send a messgae guys
---
Are the flight helmets going to remain in the store?
---
Yeah I can kill a Sheepsquatch of any level in about 10 seconds with my combat knife, 45 minutes is insanity....
---
happy endings end up with a broken member
---
I mean, hook the vendor up, and whenever you hear an alert you check to see if your camp is gonna get nuclear buttplugged and if it is just server hop.
---
I just have a question. The queen has extreme energy resistance and explosive resistance right? More than ballistic?
---
Sorry to hijack your post, but you sound like you will have the answers I seek.
---
At work and curious what the challenges were if you could help a fellow dweller out.
---
Just get a brahmin pen.
---
I'm afraid not :(
---
I would drop the Two shot seriously. As you have less/no control over where the second shot hits - from what I've read from other posts.
---
As a Sniper, Instigating is your friend.
---
Hunting Rifles are good but are overall, low DPS, decent DPS pre shot but a slow fire rate. I still use a Level 50 instigating Sniper Rifle myself, but have also acquired an Instigating Handmade, an Instigating Gauss, and a Furious Handmade. 
---
An instigating The Dragon offers high per shot DPS, but I don't know off hand if you can add a suppressor to it.
---
You prefer sneaks, just as I do, that means less VATS use and more Aiming. Stock up on Ballistic Bock and Calmex
---
This is what my build looks like:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f356e8&amp;d=pd2pk2pl2pe2pp2an2ar2ao0l71lt2lu2ic4c72sv0cr0sb0sa0s01a71a04e20i30&amp;w=c52a51l92lj2lm2ii0i60ia0i70if0s10ik0i50iq2cu0p02p10pa0p80p90&amp;n=&amp;m=15398c6f] 
---
My playstyle leans more towards not being seen, and moving mostly in sneak mode, using Strength and carry weight foods to offset the low carry weight.
---
For me, Bandolier is a most in order to make my .308 rounds and 5.56 rounds weigh near nothing. Strong Back, Travelling Pharmacy and Pack Rat are at one because I can't spare more points, I opted to decrease weight across all three rather than just one maxed. I only carry what I need as far as supplies, and have a set of excavator armor with it's extra weight mods installed.
---
All three rifleman perks are required, Tank Killer is a good idea and Glow sight stays up unless I know I'm going to be in a situation where I know I will be stealthed and having to VATS specific parts...like a SB's wing or when farming Sugar Grove, I target the thrusters of the Mr. Gutsys.
---
If you opt to use Ballistic Bock as I do, professional drinker is a most so that you don't become addicted. Your choice here. 
---
Lone Wanderer should be up followed by travel agent if you're hopping the map, otherwise you could use tenderizer. Though if you're one shooting stuff, tenderizer isn't needed.
---
Gunsmith at 5 means your gun breaks slower, it also helps offset Ballistic Bock use, paired with maxed Weapon Artisan, you'll repair less often, allowing you to get more life out of your weapons before they need repair. All those other Intelligence perks as needed.
---
The way my agility perks are set up I almost never get detected as long as I'm careful and don't rush into a pack of Super Mutants or make a rash move. I've even managed to go nose to nose with a Scorch Beast while in a Hazmat Suit and got away without being attacked.
---
Class Freak is a damage boost, you should run that. If you decide to run mutations like the bulk of players, then max starched genes and Class Freak.
---
I strongly recommend at least Marsupial, it will allow you to reach higher perches to snipe from. Big bonus, especially in a nuked Whitesprings.
---
Also recommend:
---
Carnivore, Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes &amp; Speed Demon mutations as a core setup. 
---
The others like I have would be a choice.
---
Some points on armor:
---
Chameleon Armor. I've seen posts suggesting wearing a full set and I've seen posts suggesting only one piece is needed. Supposedly more pieces stack, I've run a full Chameleion Set and have been right in front of a Super Mutant in caution mode with them looking for me and haven't been discovered as long as I don't move and don't shoot.
---
So I'm leaning towards suggesting whole set, though I'm also thinking of running one Chameleon piece along with Vanguards/Bolstering Pieces. I also run stabilized mods on my arms to offset the having to hold your breath to aim mechanic. Using Stabilize don both arms causes your arms to not move when aiming.
---
Some closing comments:
---
unfortunately I don't have anything with Explosive on it but for the most part I one shot kill most mobs without a problem. The Sniper Rifle works fine against pretty much anything that I encounter while farming Whitesprings or Westek, but even though the handmade is a lower DPS per shot, it has a higher fire rate, I can still one shot most things with a well aimed shot or quick VATS attack, bit when I have to shoot a single target multiple times...the Handmade outclasses my trusty sniper rifle. 
---
If its going to be a long fight (SB, Encrypted Event, for example), I might open with my Sniper Rifle or Gauss for damage then switch to my Furious Handmade for the duration. Sometimes I can solo something like The Sheepsquatch with only my Instigating Sniper Rifle and Furious Handmade, the key is staying at range and out of sight. It took me a few minutes but I wore down a Legendary Three Star Sheepsquatch in this manner.
---
I have the base armor and weapon types I want, now I'm playing the long game of looking for 3 star versions of the same with  the secondary and tertiary modifiers I want.
---
Hope I've helped a bit.
---
$18
---
let that sink in
---
im sure whales will love it and so will bethesda
---
Boooo! I got it when it FIRST came out so I'm an OG and y'all posin'
---
Any chance on providing some pictures?
---
According to that, the first sightings took place near the TNT Domes (til those are real), maybe the event will involve the domes we can't get into yet.
---
Does the same apply to laser guns, too, then?
---
I am a vats crit stealth commando build with a two-shot 1-star automatic and it's typically a 5 minute affair from somewhere it can't reach if I stay in stealth. Definitely way way harder than any other mob excluding the SBQ.
---
I don't waste the ammo anymore but go for the three-star legendary events like AWOL Armaments, One Violent Night or Uranium fever. Same time spent but better loot and less bullets even.
---
Neat. Thanks for the laffs, beth.
---
good stuff!
---
Bethesda set up a booth at last year's festival, so it's definitely on their radar.
---
Is that where that came from? I saw that in my inventory but didn't know what it was or where it came from
---
Exactly this. The parents knew the risk, and it's all just roleplaying anyway.
---
How do I get a frog in a jar?! I need a friend!
---
Hey! In my defense when it first came out I was still a wee young level 12 who thought that atoms were useless and spent some on those fo76 glasses. THE GLASSES.
---
Black bird paint. Everyone is upset they missed it the first time. 
---
Only slightly less upset than those who bought it and thought it be theirs alone forever.
---
Yeah something strange must have been going on, prob a bug or glitch out of your control.
---
You need the broken prosnap deluxe camera found on the tourist bodies
---
What you got to trade for it? If you've got a marine combat helmet I'll give all of them and a lvl 50 stalkers Gatling gun. Or caps could work too.
---
im regretting not getting the simply shiny chrome excavator armor myself...  also waiting for those mosaic tile floors to return
---
Shit....I'm almost down to 600lb after scrapping down most of my excess \*\*\* gear.  I'm even dumping extra boiled water and sugar bombs/spices/sugar for making sweet rolls in my stash now.
---
You have to find the Tourist, it'll give you all of the required items for making the camera. I found him at Wavy Willard's Water Park quite a few times, but he spawns in certain random locations.
---
Damn that's nice!
---
So ez. Im sure a lvl 2 could do them all ina few min.
---
Eat raw meat
---
Cook a meal while drunk
---
Kill a critter (non hostile animal) while starving
---
Kill human like with melee
---
Claim a workshop while mutated
---
No specific for any of these! Did them all in the forest in about 20 min and most of that was just waiting to starve lol.
---
Yeah, I need to set it up to show off on r/fallout76settlements
---
I agree with this. Likewhen they made all plans available...i missed the first wave of blackbird..totally butthurt about it. But now its like all rare shit is just becoming ehh not oooo. When i bust out my oooo shit i expect oooos. Not eh.
---
Its just killing some enemies in survival, nothing too bad
---
Why twisted Muscles?
---
it drops gun accuracy by 50%
---
Is it just for X-01 or all suits?
---
I (somehow) keep a pretty light build, so I see no need in excavator. But same tho
---
I might be wrong but where did you find the camera? Because you only get the recipe if you find it on the dead tourist, I find broken cameras in the world all the time but they’re junk items so don’t work for the quest. If you did pick it up if the tourist then sorry not sure why it’s not working
---
Considering the negative reaction to the early flash sales, I am guessing it might be wiser to have things come out once every 6 months+ rather than never come back at all. Still pressure to buy, but without the matching "I'll never see it again" dread when you can't.
---
I have no idea on the FO76 VR support, but...
---
I’ve had psvr for almost a year now and I have mixed feelings about it.  Tbh I don’t use it nearly as much as I thought I would.
---
I was also really excited about Skyrim in vr and I was definitely let down by it.  It would be fun for 45 minutes or an hour but just didn’t lend itself to the longer, fully immersed play sessions I would usually get into in an rpg.  It didn’t help that it had some of the worst graphics I’ve seen on a vr game.  
---
Overall, since psvr support is confirmed for the PS5(or whatever they end up calling it) I would personally wait and see they have a good VR/PS5 bundle.  I just really don’t think you’re missing out on anything right now.
---
That would be awesome!  And now I have to convince my boyfriend to go to WV in September!!
---
It's been ~6 months. Any news?
---
I miss Preston and our little "romance" lol. Seriously, he was a good shot and always had my back. 😭
---
Sheepsquatches are bullet sponges, my super sledge does 2k damage and takes 8 or 9 hits to kill one
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Oh good this one has started, been looking forward too it 😎 I do love a good deathclaw gauntlet
---
It's been ~6 months now. Any news?
---
I never have any issue with weapon accuracy in the few months ive been running it, just vats and shoot 95% instantly
---
Ah that must be the case! I found it on a table.
---
If you don't see your canvas bag ticket in the "RECENT TICKETS" tab of "MY SUPPORT" then you should click onto the "ALL TICKETS" tab and you should see it there.
---
&gt; Hot-Todder
---
I assume that's a typo but it's an amazing one.
---
This is absurd
---
maybe not.. :P
---
Any God tier (3* Bloodied, AA, Instigating, furious and explosive or firerate, with good 3rd perks) weapons for price below reddit value. And any rare outfits to flip for profit.
---
I will sometimes purchase "good" rolled weapons (anything decent+explosive) if I think I can make at least double in profit.
---
Hahaha the imposter outfit would take on a new meaning. 
---
 "You've contracted limp worm"
---
How much is the Blackbird PA atom cost?
---
Took a bit of digging but IMDB lists [Brett Elliot](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10261871/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t16) as the voice actor.
---
Build the jar with glass and a bloodleaf under science projects at the chemistry bench. Then catch a frog (the little blue ones) by pressing A/X/whatever your interact button is. They can spawn in several locations like most critters, but there's a pretty reliable spawn at the pool at the Whitesprings. Then just select it in your camp. Under flood decorations, I think.
---
 You missed the sale on the red Cooking Stove skin. Its still one I would buy at full price although I got lucky.
---
 Mine is sitting on the Light Laminate. Looks real good.
---
No it’s not there either unfortunately I contacted them and they said they don’t see a record of it so there’s nothing they can do
---
I think you’re going to need 3 star Incisor as it’s amazing, 3 star iron fist and at least 4 stars into gladiator
---
This explains what happened to my Excavator armor. I got lucky and I only lost the chassis not the armor pieces.
---
I use a ~ to put stuff at the bottom. Z or zzz to me in IT means "not in use" when I can't delete or archive something.
---
Worth noting you get double ore from the nodes with excavator armor. 
---
Past that, tag acid, you'll need a fair bit, but most bugs drop parts that have acid, lots of other things do. I never have an issue with it, but if you do, consider taking your camp to a location with an acid node for a little passive bump. I personally can't recommend workshops due to the high risk of griefing compared to the fairly low reward, but acid's possibly actually worth doing it for. Just...never walk around with any junk on you while you're in control of a workshop. 
---
For steel, look at what type of ammo you tend to use. I run through a lot of 5.56, and shells, so I tend to farm super mutants and mole miner locations for weapons to scrap with the scrapper perk for lots of steel, because that way I'm getting back most if not more of the ammo i'm spending to gather that steel off the enemies. 
---
If you do a lot of 308 or 45, scortched or super mutants are your best bets.
---
1800
---
$18 or 1800 ATOMS
---
which is kinda crazy imo
---
Every...Single...Time I go to Morgantown.
---
Preston! ::sniff sniff::  I miss you 😭. You wouldn't let punky griefers harass me. ❤
---
You die to a handcrafted non legendary handmade quickly If somebody has a good build.   How fast you die is not the point.  The point is there is no damage drop off is minimal and the splash damage is devastating.   They’re going to get nerfed so enjoy them while you can.  I had my fun until it wasn’t fun anymore.
---
No, sadly.
---
the sat crashed back to earth...cant be done
---
My point made.. there is a physic reason behind these 2 buses.
---
Agreed, hope to mosaic comes back.
---
I haven't had any issues because my camp had been in the same place for a while, but I've read everyone's comments about what a nightmare it's become.  The problem is that I have the itch to move so bad, but I'm afraid that nothing is going to work right!!
---
Bethesda was asked about this months ago, and they said it's fine.
---
Hannawick Lectus.
---
I got a new PA chassis and it auto named itself to a copy of one I had.
---
special deal just for you.. 2995 caps!
---
Bethesda was asked about this months ago, and gave their blessing to at least one user.
---
All of em it looks like
---
It's worth it for the time savings alone, believe me. Been running a mule account for months.
---
I have 3* now (75%). AA is 50% already so the 1* would bump it up to 75% and then I can gain the 2* Iron Fist increase.
---
The cost of Power Armor skin is too damn high! I’m prepared to run for political office on this platform alone. Who’s with me?! ;)
---
Nice!!!!
---
I do like that the ones for the Free States all sound a bit unsure and hypothetical. I think there’s a few holotapes where she says she doesn’t know why she’s doing this, it’s not like anyone will find these.
---
All together I have purchased from machines;
---
 FE handmade 2* 1700 caps
---
AAE gatling gun 2* 1000 caps
---
BE Combat rifle 2* 500 caps
---
BE Railway rifle 2* 11000 caps
---
QE Pipe bolt action 3* 1000 caps
---
AAE Railway rifle 2* 300 caps
---
With the cap prices to fasttravel my visiting habits changed. At first i had caps out the wazzoo and would spebd the 48 to travel across the map..but now i weigh the options..a camo that has 5 armors and 7 weapons id travsl to for under 15. If you have 30 and 30 id pay to get tgere..however..im gettin burned far more lately. Show up and have 30 wetsuits and 30 machetes. Asshats.
---
All of them except excavator
---
This was in fallout 4
---
I guess that is a start.
---
I'm with you. Damn near every time I've tried to move a complete build... I've had to start from scratch.
---
I currently need to find a good location with an acid seep... well, I know of a good done, but it's way too far away from where I need to be... and I damn well KNOW I'm gonna have to rebuild.
---
Good buys damn
---
ok, thanks.. I'm too scared to move base now.. near Arktos Pharma
---
Except raider and excavator
---
Yep;

Going online now add me rams_man
---
 LOL. My Knives after a few stabs will reach that damage, and they do it 3 times a second.
---
All power to the lamp
---
If I go over 20k, I buy a new serum recipe or a ton of Power Armor plans.
---
I agree the beam splitter and making automatic is pretty powerful on an explosive weapon with hitscan, but it's a laser so it functions how it does, and I cannot see any way they change the beam splitter or such, and avoid fucking over non-legacy energy weapons.
---
We havent even talked about the tesla shotgun, or the AAE gatling plasma now have we?
---
Ah yeah, I forget raider/excavator has its own sets and ultracite is just ignored, whooops :p
---
Dang it looks a lot like my camp. I might have to change mine up if everyone is doing a spooky church thing.
---
Damn, I'm impressed.  6 months. 
---
I see complaints on the subreddit but not many, but I also don't see a bunch of people talking about getting theirs.
---
Underpromising and underdelivering is  absolutely horrible. But everyone seems to have moved on from the bag scandal, so I doubt they'll get much flack for it.
---
Which means they will try to do it again.  I swear I love this game and I'm very generous towards it but Bethesda needs to really needs to stop taking advantage.
---
...why so many?
---
Heavy BOS combat chest and heavy leather limbs seems to be the meat right now
---
Also Brahm and the Purveyor? I could be wrong about the mole rat legendary selling lady (purveyor right?) haven’t played since she was released.
---
Yeah, I've honestly been making out like a bandit these last couple weeks lol, just server hopping and scanning camps, while selling on the market to fuel fast travel expense etc...
---
ha jokes on you I already know i'm a shitty troll
---
Hilarious :)
---
Did they remove this picture?
---
I can’t find it
---
Not sure, I tested with an explosive revolver the other day, its name literally changed to ‘revolver rifle’ after I put in a stabilized full stock, no wonder both perks apply. But laser changes its name to ‘laser rifle’, no longer pistol, so I don’t think it applies to laser guns.
---
I'd suggest moving your camp during the story. 
---
Many quests have you going back and forth across at least portions of the map. Putting it by the quest giver for the duration for a free fast travel point would be wise. 
---
Keep the camp small and simple until you're ready to permanently place down roots.
---
Well if the game engine is so ancient that 12 creatures would cause massive lag then they should have scrapped the game.
---
.38 pls.. I need some buyers for my crap .38 ammo! :P
---
I gotta say, finding my way into locked buildings is actually one of my favorite things to do at people's camps. Scoping out all sides, using photomode to see tricky angles to get jumps and falls right to grab at the workstations near the windows or to get to secret balconies. My favorite is when the person uses those glitched windows in the brick building set that you can just jump right through right next to their locked door.
---
I have not heard anything back or seen updates on my ticket for the canvas bag for a while now. The status has been "Investigation Ongoing" for months. Irritated at Bethesda simply because, "Hey, you got my money, now give me my shit."
---
I posted this elsewhere also but since it may help some I'll do it here as well: If you don't see your canvas bag ticket in the "RECENT TICKETS" tab of "MY SUPPORT" then you should click onto the "ALL TICKETS" tab and you should see it there.
---
It was the data mined pic for the outfit
---
I might take mine out for a video. It's a be if you want to see scorchbeast explode.
---
Thanks for update!
---
I finally went for that event last night and was the only person there. I was running around like crazy looking for the ingredients and killing off those stupid little flying robot thingy's. Only 1 more ingredient left and I ran out of time. Argh!
---
I actually had to remove most of them (Store/Place Again) as they were ignoring some creatures like 5 feet away from them... I changed one of them to a spotlight just in case and worked again, dunno what happened, but it was like that for 5 days (I fixed it yesterday).
---
Makes sense now...
---
I bought the outfit right away and someone asked me about the hood
---
Typically, I look for plans I don't know at reasonable prices.  I'll even buy plans I don't care about if they are cheap enough.  I'll typically buy 5.56 ammo if it is for sale at 1 cap each.  I used to buy shotgun shells the same way, but for the moment, I'm pretty stocked up.  I'm also always looking for weapons better than what I have at reasonable prices.  Sometimes, I'm shopping for junk - like recently I had run out of circuitry (which had never happened to me before.)  If lead and steel are cheap, I might pick some up as well.
---
What junk do you sell? Mine does not sell "well" but it definitely sells.
---
Hahaha we play the same way. I have been collecting habdmades..only need a couple more..but mostlt looking for stuff to flip to keep up my habit. I got a responder fireman outfif a couple days ago for 28 caps. Best was a radium rifle i sold for 20k got for 350 i think
---
Sanjay and Grafton Mayor are tied
---
Are they like the ones in fo4 or just reskins of the flight helmet, also how many atoms?
---
well hell I just learned something I really had no idea that is what it meant!
---
Up Voted because I learned something from you today. Not like you can make a wall plaque from this up-vote.. but..
---
What he said, on the bolt action, and now the new revolvers, you can get obscene damage with a BE variant.
---
That pic is with me at full health.  With a 2.5x sneak attack during the day, the actual damage is 1360.  At night it's 1904.  I have no idea what a VATS crit headshot with three ranks of Better Criticals perk at night is, but it'll fuck up a scorchbeast pretty bad.
---
Bolt action gets both
---
Limited time and no price discount is what I go off.
---
Ah, yes, my favorite thing to do in Fallout, killing and eating people because they're annoying.
---
It’s honestly pretty sad to see how low Bethesda has fallen. They knew the game was going to be shit at launch and didn’t care. Just because it’s the “norm” in AAA development now apparently. They’ve gone from being trend setters in the open world RPG genre to trend followers chasing the live service model for a quick buck.
---
I run a bloodied build. Unyielding armor and a bloodied mole miner gauntlet. I get about 1500+ dmg at low health and can solo Free Range no problem, killing sheepsquatch in 2 hits (if I can get him before the health regen) or 5 hits total if he regens
---
Not the same with lasers/teslas. They change the scaling properly. It is assumed that bugs are causing the double dipping here.
---
You can get lemonade from a mr handy in Appalachia. He has a lemonade.stand that moves around.
---
This is the most heartbreaking and riveting thing I've read on the internet all month.
---
Thanks man! If you wouldn’t mind posting both your setups whenever you get home and get the chance. This is exactly what I’m looking for. Appreciate it!
---
I think I’ll have to check
---
Really!?! I could have sworn it was just the revolver. Sweet. That furious bolt action isn’t worthless after all. Not the best effect on a slow weapon but still
---
Yao guai drop acid (usually 5 or 6). I spent some time recently server hopping, bouncing between site alpha (always spawns a bear) and middle cabins (spawns 3 bears about 1/3-1/4 of the time - honey beasts or radscorpions usually if it’s not bears) in each server and got a whole lot of acid after only 20min or so.
---
Pvp’ing others is also pretty fun.
---
I’ve done a few....
---
It takes me about 15 minutes with a double barrel Furious shotgun, about 10 minutes with a Furious Sledge, and about 5 minutes with a .50 cal explosive.  
---
But, yeah, I could see it taking a long time with my .50 cal TSE hunting rifle.   The big buff for it is the sneak attack, which stops being effective once the enemy detects you.  
---
Bloodied, of course, could melt it pretty quickly but I just can’t get into that style of play.
---
What all are you running in your strength tree for cards at the moment?
---
Thank you someone who relates to my completionist OCD
---
I have them but I won’t be on until 6:00 CT about three hours
---
Pay them in exposure not in caps!
---
Are you sure gladiator perk affects your meat hook? 
---
I have a deathclaw gauntlet and it doesn't affect it. Only Iron Fist does. Apparently doesn't count as 1 handed weapon. Seems to only apply to swords and items like it.
---
That sexy backpack will look so nice with my Vintage Green Coat.
---
Why do you have to trade??
---
Every time I hear that message makes me so fucking glad Sanjay is dead..I hope it was a slow and painful demise.
---
I randomly allied with a lower player. Gave them some gear and was trying to convey through emotes that I needed them to die for me to advance my quests and I didn't think they'd be cool like that so I resigned myself to helping them do there's.  Well they didn't get that point either so I just randomly picked places with high level enemies to power level them and legitimately not trying to get them killed.  Eventually get to the cabins just north west of whitesprings station and encounter rad scorpions. I think "oh crap dudes gonna die!" honestly forgetting that I wanted this scenario. So I manage to kill the scorpions while keeping my buddy alive and tagged into the kills.  Turn around to check my new found level 20ish bro was busy being eviscerated by Yao gao. And THAT'S how I got my revive an ally!
---
TL;DR: Accidentally led an allied lower level player to their death but I got a back pack so it's alright.
---
Awww I really liked Sanjay, it's too bad they didn't want to use him for later content.
---
I don't agree
---
I thought he said cancer stew.
---
Yeah if you have a friend you can just team up and then kick to get the kill for the weapon
---
Got one from a footlocker at Emmet Mountain disposal site, the shack in the back
---
how do you know?
---
You can find broken prosnap cameras in the wild as misc items, which can be fixed and used to take pictures, but you only get the quest and recipe when you find it on the tourist.
---
Meat Hook is both Unarmed and 1-Handed.
---
Buy a serum recipe from enclave when you’re at max. Thats what I do.
---
Its a revolver rifle because of two things. And real life applies. It has a stock to be fired from the shoulder, making it a rifle. And having a revolving cylinder makes it a revolver. Revolvers are not exclusive to a handgun. Pistol is the wrong word. Pistol means semi auto/auto magazine fed handgun. Revolver is it's own category.
---
Revolvers being functional as rifles has something to do with how the mechanism works, it loses velocity because of the gap between the cylinder and the breach.
---
Magazine fed rifles are much tighter, and more accurate than they would be with a revolver round, due to the tight seal in the breach, and small amount of wiggle room, opposed to a revolver.
---
 Oh I'm sure. Its just the DPS and the Damage made me laugh. 
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat knife goes out at 200+ at night, and we see 300 right away in any crowd situation. I get Stealth bonus all the time.
---
 And as said 3 times a sec ... till the mouse breaks. So entertaining. ;)
---
Human like creature, wouldn't that imply ghouls and scorched? Sounds way easier to kill one of them imo.
---
It's the first one I've seen, so I don't think it's super widespread.
---
Ive been trying to replicate in and cant
---
I just watched and interview with Todd. And he said it needs to become more affordable still. 
---
So when the tech gets to the point that its affordable for consumers probably. 
---
In the near future, probably not.
---
Ok its a human like creature? Havent been on just browsing thought he meant a pvp kill
---
This please. I love the mosaic floors, and I missed the opportunity to buy them. I'm planning to make my next house a spanish style courtyard, and that will be the perfect flooring.

---
Cool idea you got here. I mean, this Idea is cool under every circumstances, like even if you have to pay 10000 caps for an extra 100 slots, I'm willing to pay that, plus lots of other junk to upgrade it.
---
Ah okay didn’t know this, I thought you could do that but only once you find the tourist one first
---
That's a win - win... If you got your junk back.
---
Omg how do you even loot bro that’s my question
---
Part of why I started this discussion was to have a store that favored quality over quantity. I'm never going to be one of those CAMPs that has 200 plans (of which only 5 are ones you don't already know.)
---
Il help you out send me a message and when i get on i can gt cl88t
---
Not sure why this got hit. I totally agree. I want my limited edition shit to BE limited edition. I like a little "flex on em" in my game. But now you cant. I missed this the first time around..bought all the hirseman skins BECAUSE of it..and now its back. Dont get me wrong..i copped this bastard instantly..But still..
---
Their nefarious plot to make atoms increasingly difficult to obtain paired with them releasing some interesting stuff might finally pay off.  
---
Alternatively, if anyone seeing this wants to team up on PC to knock some dailies/weeklies out, hit me up.
---
Haha nice, yes it's very addicting, and almost a gamble what's going to be in their machine lol.
---
I've been able to almost fully complete my BE rifle collection, I only need a lever action now, then I'm gonna work on matching Unyielding sentinel agility set, because why not? lol
---
Well that doesn't make sense... deathclaw gauntlet is essentially same type of weapon as meat hook.... why would one handed apply to meat hook and not deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
Ridiculous....
---
Holy crap, I didn’t know the double ore thing!  Guess I’ll be busting the excavator armor out again...
---
lol it was a typo but I decided not to correct it
---
Rifle damage is pretty misleading, because all the big bonuses come from sneak and adrenaline perks.  Melee got a big buff in 76.  My alt uses two handed weapons and his AA super sledge creeps up to 500-ish after taking out the Whitespring Golf Club.
---
Yep. I hit my cap last night (lost 800 caps luckily) and immediately left the server. Logged on latter and closed up shop until I can unload some caps.
---
Dont talk to me. This is your fault. Lmao
---
Bloodied weps and unyielding armour. Recipes and plans I dont know already
---
And hot damn, that dude must have had no idea about that outfit haha
---
The 10mm smg is better than the .45 smg, and this makes me sad.
---
The only change is that I swapped Evasive for Dodgy.
---
I feel for you buddy...
---
I'd be down to see a scorch beast explode
---
There’s a robot factory downstairs? Where the heck have I been..
---
It means youll lose the no paint mod, happens when modding anything
---
Yeah, I sold a Quad explosive bolt action and a BE bolt action, both for over 15k, and people were offering like mad.
---
I don't much care for the asthetics of them, and I'm certain one day they will be "fixed" to scale appropriately, but for now they are, besides legacy weapons, literally top tier
---
Are you on PS4? I may know who did this then because I got nuked last night (my camp was the center of the explosion)
---
Xbox.
---
Why not?
---
I won't buy the Nuka cooler for that reason. Looks far too wide... I'm running with the Keep Out one. It's so narrow. I'm waiting (hoping) for a teddy bear backpack, surely they can't mess up the width of that!
---
Ah, sorry for your loss.
---
We're talking about Sanjay.  Preston's ain't even born yet.
---
I would say luck is not my strong point right now 😂
---
By the way I'm on xbone
---
And yes, 7-7 shifts for me, off 4 days... kinda nice
---
Yes, like you pop a serum, like a potion in skyrim and it negates the negative effects of a mutation you already have.
---
So who doesn't understand how this works exactly?
---
My Mutants explosive revolver rifle does right under 300 DPS and it is my best gun. Love it.
---
Yea plans ill only really buy if theyre dirt cheap and i dont know em. But i fins gold everywhere. 3 weapons and 27 weapons. Mostly duds but there are some good deals out there. 
---
I have my camp set up with weapons store..misc..junk..and ammo. I only have 2-3 dtar good shit in my camp. And bulk junk. Everythibg usually sella good if its priced ok. Ammo..almost never. I have all my ammo set at 1 c and it sits. Im thinkin of droppin ammo and making a second weapon spot. I sell tona of guns. If its something over 1k i sell it on reddit or fbook. But i anythibg else..between 500 and 900 will sell pretty quick
---
its outrageously op when properly specced.  i hope it stays that way.
---
Good comment. Thanks for keeping us updated.
---
The combo of portable power level 3 and excavator armor with calibrated shocks makes it so I still have +80 on top of my normal carry weight. They cancel each other out so that i stay positive
---
I'm sorry, but where are you even getting the info that Maxson's grandson started the brotherhood from- in Fallout 1 even?
---
Because the grandson himself has this to say:
---
&gt; {1118}{Gen\_70}{Roger Maxson huh? Well he led our people here in the  great Exodus, started the Brotherhood from scratch. Quite a leader.}  
---
 {1119}{Gen\_71}{Well that was when my granddad, Roger Maxson, led his  soldiers here and started the Brotherhood. He never mentioned where they  came from, but it  doesn't really matter, 'cause...well, this is our  home now.} 
---
Sophia's holotape is full of religious mumbo jumbo, and only mentions the Exodus and a group of people who wanted to scavenge the Glow. Roger Maxson told them not to go because it was destroyed, not because they were bunkering down.
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Sophia%27s\_tape](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Sophia%27s_tape)
---
...there's no dates, also, and religious mumbo jumbo is hardly accurate. It also doesn't mention isolationism.
---
The other NPCs don't seem interested in talking about history with the Vault Dweller. 
---
The story about Maxson II, in the Bible, says he joins the order of Paladins-   [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Maxson\_II](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Maxson_II) \- and that's where the isolationism kicks off (according to the wiki's description I cannot find a source of, at least).
---
&gt;"2135 *Elder Roger Maxson dies of  cancer, and his son, already an accomplished soldier, takes up the role  of "General" (Elder) within the Brotherhood of Steel. John Maxson  becomes a member of the Paladins, showing tremendous promise as a  soldier."* 
---
Then we have this history of the Maxson line on the Citadel: [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Citadel\_terminals#Roger\_Maxson](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Citadel_terminals#Roger_Maxson)
---
...and Maxson is listed as the founder of the Brotherhood and all that jazz.
---
Seems to me that there was no actual lore on the Brotherhood's founding - just a big The Exodus / Paladins go to the Glow and die / Fallout 1 begins - and Bethesda just put something in the gap.
---
And hang out in Big Bend Tunnel
---
I’m on PS4.  So that’s not going to work.  I really appreciate it, though.
---
After all my runs of the queen/normals. I gotten probably close to 100 ultracite paterns. Now I'm not sure if I even seen one. I believe they exist but now not so sure. Will have to log into my main and check. I'll let ya know if I have the plans/learned them. Or whatever.
---
Definitely an interesting build. What kind of heavy weapon do you run? I'd assume something anti-armor. I prefer white knight but have never run 3 points in lucky break with high luck.
---
You've got about a 166 year wait for that...
---
if you still need 1 i put 1 in a of mine vender for 10 caps
---
General, we have another settlement that needs your help. 
---
No I got this game to meet real people that loves Fallout as much as I do and want to play it with other people.
---
Want Fallout with NPC’s go play FO4 for a while only to realise the same dialogue over and over doesnt really make it feel anymore ‘’alive’’.
---
I'd be very curious to know and would certainly appreciate it!
---
Well idk. Some people eat papern, some like gettin their nards kicked for sex..some people like hauling 50+ pa frames. Its all gravey. Its not for me..but who am i? F it lol
---
Do you sell power armor sets? That would make sense. But ..50??
---
If you have a 15 in luck you only need 1 crit chance perk. Choose EITHER Four leaf clover or Critical savy. Having both has diminishing returns. You can free up 6 ranks this way.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0o6ly/luck\_critical\_perks\_and\_diminishing\_returns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0o6ly/luck_critical_perks_and_diminishing_returns/) 
---
Problem solved.
---
Hey, I’m just as worried that they’ll mess it all up as you are , believe me lol.  
---
And don’t even get me started on the Tesla!  
---
Anyways all those weapons are fair game at this point because they’re in the game - but cheese is cheese any which way you slice it.  So I’m going to tough it out anti cheese for now and take my lumps from time to time to keep my self respect intact.  Everybody else is free to do as they wish which is what I said in my original comment.
---
I'll pay caps for a level 50. On xbox.
---
Tunnel Snakes Rule!
---
The updated MG42 was designated the MG3
---
Ha thanks, that's a good deal!
---
Oh yeah, that'll be a nice weapon right there.
---
I'll sell one here and there but I try to keep my numbers the same. It's just a collection so that I always have something to do
---
24
---
Same here.  As soon as I hit 21K it’s time to buy a serum recipe or PA mod plans.
---
If your on Xbox your welcome to view my recent screen captures
---
I'm good with that, I'll take 5 of them;
---
* 2 for Defense (My Camps in a rough neighborhood)
---
* 1 for Repair Duty
---
* 1 for Farming
---
* And a Butler, with an attitude, that calls visitors Freeloading Hillbilly's
---
sure whats your ign
---
No but the next time I have a few days off I can duplicate it quite quickly.
---
Or kill them before they lay eggs.
---
Heavy combat armor is good, however, each has it's own capabilities. So go online, and see what kind of dmg each of them, keeps you safe from.
---
It's for X01, T60, T51 and T45. Not sure about raider, although I think it isn't for that.
---
Do uranium fever every time it pops up.

I've been trying to focus more on stocking better ammo. 5.56 and shotgun shells seem obvious. Probably some 45, 2mm EC, and Fusion/Plasma Cores. Maybe .308, and .50 caliber balls. Not sure about Mini-nukes, missiles, and railway spikes. Everything else I don't know if people actually use it.
---
Right..i ran around in my underwear shootin my flare gun off for a few minutes.  Hahaha this game is cool.
---
This is good, but they won't do it, because it takes alot of server space.
---
I don't use power armor pretty much ever on my main character, but it's always nice to link up with someone at the Whitespring, or an event, talk about how good a certain mod is and be able to make it for them to play around with at a moment's notice.
---
I bought two serum recipes from someone last night and my buddy did the same right after. The person started buying up all his flux and took down their machine after. I usually always ask before spending 10k or more if the person is around.
---
Perhaps it’s platform specific
---
😂😂😂
---
Do you build them? Or just the frames? I have a collection of 6 or 7 all modded and atom shop painted..that i understand. I thought you meant you just like frames
---
Nope you are wrong. Or your game is borked. I MAIN a shotgun. And come no where close to what you are describing. I can and have done all 3 silos and 3 queen fights (kills at each one) back to back and still had 75-125% durability left after the last fight.
---
No sorry I traded it.
---
Appreciate it.
---
I was never able to proc a crit off of a crit.
---
ah that sounds awesome! i can almost see it now...
---
i like the pipe pistol for how fast i can fire it
---
Where is your proof. Show us.
---
Oh no they're all full level matching sets. Some have mods. A lot have paints. I just like power armor lol. If u check my posts I have a pic and video of it posted
---
True. 
---
Germany knows how to make weapons for sure. Epic weapon!
---
Unlikely but maybe, nothing has been platform specific afaik so far. Do you not have any way of uploading a pic? You dont need an imgur account to upload an img, you could take a pic of your screen and upload it or something?
---
Basedamage vs other weapon types has always been worse.   
---
The op (hopefully nerfed soon) mechanics of bloodied can make them decent but still less than a comparable top tier gun .
---
mattola69
---
Ohhhh ok yea thats fair game. Live in my power armor. Whats your favorite?
---
You figure they would have learned with the nuka girl helmet..
---
That sounds horrible
---
Was just lookin at the BGS Post about it, at least there it just says "human like creature" so I'm guessing. Hopefully its that, cause those challenges are ridiculously easy.
---
Unfortunately no raccoons but we do have some very unruly looking beavers XD
---
Do they look like the original flight helmet found in the wild but colored?
---
I've noticed that a lot of regular hats do that too.
---
Lol I'll pop you on or off the roof boy, I just like the view

---
T-60 with nukashine paint. I love the compass star on the chest
---
Scrap the frame, then sell the parts
---
Well that's an unfortunate opinion as there are hundreds of thousands of us really enjoying this game as well as a whole slew of modders who really enjoy working in this ancient engine.  Huh.
---

All, but not excavator
---
good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I got very lucky, my dentist was an ace who pulled all 4 of my wisdoms int he same visit, with little or no pain at all afterwards!!!!!! 
---
He also goes to africa every year and does tons of work there helping the people there do free dental work
---
Yeah. Every so often I get asked if I can add a mod.   Helped a player out the other day by adding the jet pack mod to his T-60 power armor.    They were really happy.  
---
Same with weapons.  Every so often I will craft a fully modded weapon for a low level player to help them on their way.  They are always happy to leave with a decent weapon vs the crap that you usually get with drops.
---
thank you!
---
ugh im busted!!!!
---
Perhaps you misspelled "hug." Would you like one? 🤗
---
I'm a bot, and I like to give hugs. [source](https://github.com/as-com/reddit-hug-bot) | [contact](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=as-com)
---
Is there a pic of the T-51b version anywhere?  Couldn't find one with a google search.
---
Yes agreed 100%. The game allows both perks to work for one item is probably because by default it takes revolver as a pistol. This should be fixed probably soon.
---
Wait you can refund your legendary weapons and armor?
---
I like to think that the idea of the Tunnels Snakes exists outside of time.
---
Funnel Cakes droll
---
Don’t listen to these guys. I couldn’t place my one foundation camp from blueprint at 2 different locations. But I was able to rebuild it at the same location just fine after I broke up the blueprint. They have a long way to go to make it work like it is supposed to. 
---
Your best bet is to get the construction perk card under intelligence to reduce material costs
---
Why would they ever take away a flooring type? I want that too!
---
Someone already converted the lead, so here's my digression for steel. Go to places like Summerville, Lewisburg, and other spots with large numbers of low level mutants. Kill them, equip Scrapper, and break down all their guns. Depending on the gun you'll get somewhere between 9-20 steel each, so it shouldn't take long to get what you need.
---
Haha I know, but a couple of peeps had mentioned Preston too.
---
Darn :( haha it's all good, thanks for letting me know, and have a good day!
---
They could set it up so each season has like a few cosmetic paints for reaching certain milestones within each season and a atom reward scale for kill ranking
---
The game is just about unplayable for me unless I use a frame limiter, vsync, pre-rendered frames to 1, etc. Without those tweaks, the game freezes/hiccups CONSTANTLY.
---
We already know how to lauch a ballistic missle. Just have a quest to reprogram one of the silos to launch a telecommunications satellite instead. 
---
Um more worried about is the elder would accept the vault dwellers. His only stipulation about fughiting the queen was no nukes, and we used the nukes. We are also non military, would he allow us to join the Brotherhood at all?
---
Eh, materials weren't too big of an issue. Just needed a bit more steel and wood than I usually kept on hand. Though the flux for my radiation shower was annoying.
---
No in hindsight I wish I did, he had vendors set up too and prices set at 666 it was cool.
---
Haha maybe.. mmm... guess I should have added that I was talking about living non artificial beings
---
\*Germany knows how to melt barrels for sure. Those things burn through them. The germans have adopted a few other HK weapons to help fill that LMG/MMG role but tbh nothing is ever gonna replace that MG42 roller system for pure volume of fire
---
The fact that this is returning gives me hope that the Res Rocket Mega sign will too
---
Yes two of the three share the same basic shape but take away the giggles and add glass.
---
Someone locked all their workbenches, and I was desperately overburdened. Used the glitch just to get inc then left. Still, I don’t get it.
---
I don't have any of my current location, but I could take some.
---
If your using a firearm against the queen it needs to be primed. Otherwise you are wasting lead and steel. For me it is being willing to die at her feet.  When death no longer scares you then you can really do damage.
---
bro story cool
---
I think it's slightly underpowered when compared to the ease of dumping .50 cal. But I also think the .50 is underpowered...
---
What I do know is that if you gave it a 25% damage buff it would become the ranged meta, so maybe it's ok how it is.
---
I think I got that outfit from the Fertile Soil event.
---
yeah i guess im not understanding why they do that either...  they are kinda missing out on purchases really, if its not in the store, we cant buy it!
---
I want all the crap that is used to make ambient decoration in-game to be available for building CAMPs.
---
Rubble strewn floors, destroyed furniture, barely-there walls, and junk all over the floor.
---
Right now though, my main character is on the hunt for the cleanest, space-age-iest, "hospital clean" pristine plans he can find.
---
I mostly agree with you but it can be worked around to some extent. If you find a legendary with +50% VATS crit damage you can remove Better Criticals since they don't stack. 
---
I also think Psychopath and Four Leaf Clover are kind of redundant. Four Leaf Clover gives an "excellent" chance to refill your crit with any hit in VATS, while Psychopath only gives a 15% chance to refill it and only works on kills.
---
Critical Savvy seems to be the most important one for crit builds, imo. With high enough luck you can be spamming crits on every other shot.
---
Lol crap sorry
---
I don’t see why not. Character customization usually takes me way too long, but outside of that just team up and go do stuff.
---
Sigh. My wife won’t let me grow facial hair. Not even in the game.
---
Wait and get lvl 50 all rise.  No reason not to, as watago isn’t even needed as a hub until later and all rise is a damn fine melee placeholder for non melee builds.  
---
Why waste thousands of caps to get a few dps more on an item type your not built for?
---
All rise weight reduction is key and it does the job it needs to do.
---
The rest are mostly crap tbh.
---
*cuddling intensifies*
---
Super easy. One person joins a server, and everyone else joins on their profile or from an invite.
---
You won. Game over.
---
I will try to make an account and provide an image
---
Thank you for the quick response! That is exactly what I was looking for :-)
---
It needs to be a starred legendary. BTW enclave events are simpler and easier tbh.
---
Bought that recipe in player vending for 400 caps last night.
---
O, these people short selling themselves...
---
By design. Gotta shed some caps somehow. Game economy 101
---
If your on ps4 I'm a buyer...
---
yeah once you get out of the vault, where you create your character, the game is open and free to do what you want... team up and take on the wasteland!
---
Move your camp , free repairs
---
YESSSSSSS!  BlackBird paint back in stock!!!  I missed it the one day it was up, not missing it again!!!
---
Talk about a post back from the dead. :P
---
It's easier to use toxic goo or even a gamma gun. The trap is pointless. :\
---
Selling anything that expensive without room for the caps is not the buyers fault. Just sayin.
---
Yes. Grab the machete near vault 76 and walk down the road to the first lvl 1 scorched you see. Ez Pz
---
That sounds terrifying, glad I didn't buy it now if true. (I use a TSE reduced weight shotgun) 
---
But I guess I'll have to test weapon skins on scrip trash for now on in future.
---
I know the one you are talking about. It's a random encounter and I've killed it many times. My railway takes it down in around 2 magazines.
---
Got it!  Wasn't going to miss it a second time!
---
This is good news
---
Diablo seasons in Hardcore.  You die, you lose your shit and start from level 1.
---
I will back your original post 100%.  The same skin for the same weapon too... no one should buy the responder pump action shotgun skin.  Me and my buddy are on PC and it happened there. 
---
I feel bad, I knew he had that weapon and thought the skin looked great, and told him he should get it.  Now he doesnt even want to play.
---
If there's 4 of you, you can team up at the main menu then join a world so all 4 of you are guaranteed to get in.
---
This is a common misconception. Her health is constant across the board.
---
Sometimes scrapped items in the CAMP are removed but visually still appear. They will also lose collision.
---
The Brotherhood Statue is constantly marked as used when it's not, preventing me from moving it around at all.
---
Server hop and farm Whitesprings and you will have it done in no time.
---
I also managed to get a B/25 Ultracite Gatling Laser,
---
UCG (primed) / 177 damage / 227 fire rate
---
B/25 .50cal (primed) / 331 damage / 114 fire rate
---
So the UCG should be outdps the .50cal with a little difference, but definetly feels weaker in the SBQ fights it lacks the armor penetration. I hope this one gets fixed eventually, because really like this weapon.
---
aushawitz
---
Only reason i started fo76 was because friends had it. Definitely more fun with a team...
---
However i will say this. With no npc or cutscenes, all the storylines are told via notes, terminals and holotapes. 
---
This can be difficult to keep up with, while in a team. Unless you're all equally invested in the story or don't mind waiting for each other to finish reading or listening. If you have friends who tend to rush things and just care about the objectives, you might miss out on the story if they are constantly rushing you to move on to next objective.
---
Does it have to be exactly 4? We have 3 right now, possibly 4. Do you have to join off each other if it's less than 4?
---
What?
---
Up to 4*
---
The least used one is the best one, because they ALWAYS get taken. I’d go to the corners of the map and find one that has flat space.
---
As long as it's cosmetic and not some loot box gambling crap, they can charge whatever
---
Your yellow and brown flight helmets are mixed in the linked images.
---
Agreed. 
---
You should see how a Barrett .50 cal barrel looks after maybe 10-15 shots. 
---
Gets completely bended and in-accurate AF!
---
Omg should I laugh or cry?  😂😭

last time someone claimed an area where i was in the zone the progress bar was stalled, and they where hostile, none of us where on a team

about 100\~200 caps.

And this is probably why LMG users are told to burst fire nowadays 😂
---
This helped a LOT. Thanks. Lot to take in.
---
I literally stand in front of her face and just hack away.
---
Lmao. Yeah right. They are super easy to get.
---
Ok where is that?
---
This is why I live up in the mountains in isolation with my pet Brahmin
---
Ooooo you mean when they only start inaccurately shooting the lvl 5 mole rats after they've destroyed my crops, water pumps, and have made their way to my crafting benches??
---
She has 300 energy and ballistic armor. Theres no such thing as enemies having explosive resistance unless you count players with the fireproof perk. Explosives are just used for AoE and lack in the dps department since its hard to pierce the Queens armor without power armor and stabalized perk. 
---
Melee is the best means of killing the Queen due to the insane 75% armor piercing perk tied with the fact it costs 0 ammo. 
---
Ive killed her 100s of times. I could offer the same service as the OP but just havent done it since the whole adding people to your friendlist thing is a chore just to join the lobby. 
---
If you got questions i got answers.
---
Upvote even though those words make me rage.
---
Foes anyone know if these are a permanent addition to the store ir will they be taken off?
---
Sneaky sneaky. Best hit I’ve got was a crit that was a third her health.
---
Question on marsupial and others - how long does it last? 1 session? Forever?

Is this a reference to the concentration camp? If so, you're so ignorant you didn't even spell it correctly.

That was me when the Hotter Rod came in and will be me when I get home for these...
---
What system are you on?
---
Great, thank you for the heads up!
---
I tried joining the other night 3 or 4 times and kept getting that same message. Finally after server jumping for the 5th time I got in.

I’d offer to build them in your camp, but I probably can’t with atom shop items?

I might still have an explosive 3 star for sale. PS4
---
Any camp that doesn’t spawn me into the wall, the ground, a rock, a cliff, this here tree, that fusion reactor, and the door isn’t locked with some intricate design as how to get in to see the vendor machine and that have actual items that I can’t just hop down the road a travel point or two and get myself.
---
I think if they have berry mentats which highlights living creatures will allow them to spot you regardless of stealth.
---
Oh man if you were on Xbox...

Here's the best resource I'm aware of:

did you ever get the coal picture?

If only it was cross platform

where did you find a coal deposit tht worked?

After 2 weeks.. still doing it :/

Yes. . . Well, usually. As long as you don't exit the machine. Or I guess in my case, unless it really really wants to keep your weapon lol.
---
Just sayin'. Those small letters are too hard to read!
---
Not a vegan-friendly challenge, lol
---
How could someone else steal from your stash boxes? Or do you mean containers that are not actually stash boxes?

Most people don't want to farm them consistently and are willing to pay for the convenience
---
Why is the top comment not "There is no N in Turret" ?
---
I appreciate it, my main questions lie in the fact, I too have killed her many times, my BE gauss rifle seems to be my best choice for it in the past, then I've played months without ever doing the queen. I recently picked up a BE laser rifle and it literally melts every other enemy in the game. I mean 10-15 seconds on the Project paradise boss, 5 seconds on a sheepsquatch or about 20 on imposter. But when I used it against the queen, it literally did nothing, like an entire clip for a smidgen of health bar movement, she also was super buffed at this time due to the amount of participants, but I am wondering if she straight resists the weapon somehow.
---
You pretty much answered my question though, lasers lack any kind of armor pen. I'm pretty sure tank killer dosen't even apply to the BE laser. So essentially my Gauss has loads more armor penetration, therefore is what I should use? How about BE railway, BE radium, BE handmade, BFFR plasma etc? 
---
I guess I just need to do some testing, I would assume railway and gauss are the best, and the handmade actually did pretty well when I used it, I just ran out of ammo really fast...
---
Hi, can you take out Elizabeth?
---
The difference. You can't jack off with a meat hook, despite its name, the Death Claw however doesn't need hands to accomplish 'the necessary' just jam the claws into the Princess Bed's mattress... it's hollow O.o
---
Needs must and all that.
---
I wound up stumbling upon a random event at the pioneer scouts camp, the one with the several waves of mirelurks and ending with a queen. Thankfully, a level 110 player had showed up and revived me near the end. I got XP and loot, he got his needed revive. He then sacrificed himself for me to bring him back. Been playing together ever since.
---
If you are playing on xbox, you can create a post looking for people to play and specify what you need help with. Makes things a lot easier.
---
I use the one up north to the right of crashed space station...has 2  extractors, one junk and I believe one lead. If u drop ur base right u get both
---
Thank for your support I hope it doesn’t demoralize your buddy,.. it’s a great game,... I’m trying to look at it this way now ,... we have new legacy weapons 😅
---
Impressive. Would you be willing to share your build/weapon of choice or is that a trade secret? I want to pull those kind of numbers.
---
Fire and Blood begs to differ
---
I get 2-5 second freezes and is correlated with the game trying to play some audio not recently played. For example, running on grass and then stepping onto pavement, the game freezes for 2 seconds. No enemies around, looking at the ground the whole time. The CPU usage skyrockets; my i7 4770K with 8 hyperthreads goes 100%. I suspect my 16 GB is not enough and this is a windows paging problem or the game waits for the server to acknowledge the need to play a new sound in case some other player is nearby (but there is nobody there) and the server is simply too busy to answer quickly (500/22 MBits). Running from SATA SSD (500 MByte/s).
---
Instead of a mailbox and a bigger stash, just make an account based stash that all your Alts and Mules can access.
---
If only you were on xbox... *sigh*
---
Alright, I'm probably going to have to do that tomorrow because I work until late today. My xbox username is Nettleleaf

I bought a few dozen for 12 caps apiece and I was super happy. First time I seen them for sale.

Excavator had Coal Dust a while back which is black. Ultracite and raider don't have black paints yet though

And done. But I'll hang out for another 20 min for anyone else who needs it

Steel?  Yes please!
---
Lol I honestly had no idea you could do so, I'm sorry about you losing your weapon
---
I’ll agree it was a bit much, but overall LOVE the effect.
---
Another satisfied customer.
---
ALL
---
I started this exact same build. I had a legendary meat hook, and wanted to take advantage of both gladiator and iron fist. What I discovered was that with just three points in Iron Fist, I could do more damage with a generic mole miner's gauntlet, power fist, death claw or death tambo, than with the fully perked meat hook. 
---
Here's my take on the rest of the build:
---
I think martial artist x 3 is a must for any melee build; 
---
 if you're not going to be wearing power armor, you probably want adamantium skeleton. If you don't have dense or asbesto, you may want fireproof (nullifies scorch beasts).
---
Iron Stomach - You get most of the benefits from iron stomach x 3, with sun-kissed x 1, and it has the advantage of dealing with all radiation, not just that from food. 
---
Good Doggy - I've played with this, it's nice being able to just hot key food and water, so I could see if for a sniper build, but there's many melee bonuses to eating food that you cook, not sure about it with your build.
---
Suppressor - I'm rarely spending so much time killing something, that I want to reduce the damage it's doing to me. I think these points would be better spent on dodgy or serendipity.
---
Makeshift warrior - when repaired with weapons artisan x 3, weapons don't break that fast, and when they do, they're not that hard to repair. I'm not sure which mods require this MW 5.  I might save this for camp, and run around with nerd rage x 3.
---
Evasive - I love born survivor x 1; yes, I could just hit the key, but in the heat of battle you can lose track. I really like Dodgy here, and all the adrenaline you can afford.
---
Lucky Break - I play way too much, and with white knight and fix it good, I probably repair my armor once or twice a week. I would recommend serendipity here.
---
Sent you a request if you still have it
---
You get 15 a day so you are telling me that people are willing to pay someone else 1500 caps a day for doing a 5 minute side quest for them? Also the mister fuzzy outfit takes 450 tokens to get so are you also telling me that the mister fuzzy outfit is worth 45,000 caps?! The answer... no it isnt worth that much so your proce is way off.
---
it would cost development ressources that are needed on other parts.
---
Eh, I'm over it. But glad to make everyone aware of it, as to not have it happen to them too.
---
Sometimes we arent all at the camp at the same time and will just leave stuff in paper bags for each other.  We have the stashboxes there for when we are transferring lots of things to each other at the same time.
---
Not true. If they are worth 100 caps a peoce then that would put the mr fuzzy outfit at 45,000 caps which it is no where near.
---
Normal reaction on first encounter lol
---
I mean pre-war stew from there was probably likely to get you sick. Iirc there was a terminal entry which said a sewage line from the spy facility dumped into the food...
---
So dramatic.
---
I'm hopeful when the mode goes out of Beta (the new game-mode teased?), characters will be locked to the mode they were created for.
---
Until then, I have no interest in playing Survival.
---
&lt;puts on old man hat&gt; Back in the day in roguelikes we used to call that NORMAL MODE&lt;takes off old man hat&gt;
---
Dick Shale would be proud.
---
It can happen quick enough when you go AFK for a bio break
---
Yeah these days I'm doing one of four things...
---
Fiddling at my camp.
---
Fiddling and shopping at other camps.
---
Abusing the hell out of Super Duper, Chemist and Ammosmith (and Butcher's Bounty for extra tick blood). 
---
Going to nuke zones just for flux and the stuff to make them stable.
---
I honestly did not think that would be what I loved most about this game.
---
As far as inflation goes, it doesn't just hurt the casual players. It will hit everyone. The real problem currently is the max caps per day in my opinion. That would help out casual players and high level players the same.
---
I think instead of raising the total cap limit, they should raise the amount of vendor caps, and raise taxes! That way the economy would be boosted with more money flowing out and prevent inflation, while making it easier to get save up for what you really want.
---
I mean, I have a steady supply of Serum I can get 480 caps for with 9 charisma from the vendor bots. So each day I log in and get my 1400 caps. I'm saving up to complete my collection of PA plans, and it would be nice to only have to sell two days worth of stuff to get them.
---
I run healing factor, carnivore, bird bones, and now I added eagle eye too.
---
I didn't notice a bug with healing factor. It only heals when you're out of combat though, so if you do something that bugs your stealth and keeps you from entering "Hidden" then you don't heal. I quit using the perk Evasive because it was messing with my stealth and I was in "Danger" almost all the time.
---
Good job 👌
---
Personally, I'm such a casual player that the prospect of starting new every 3-4 months would completely turn me off. I'd just start from scratch in Adventure.
---
Ugh, Track Suit is underarmor only? almost bought it, phew.
---
I don't understand the lack of "why not both?" with Bethesda here.
---
Yep! The Chinese had a base devoted to manufacturing and deploying Liberators. The Enclave reactivated it after the war to try to raise the DEFCON level.
---
didn't know you can get 15 a day, my token quest is broken maybe.  Only 1 of 3 token quest pops up everyday for me, and it cycles.
---
They drop, had the gun a few times with good stats but usually low level. I had a max level exploding one from the purveyor my first time there with mutant slayer, couldn't sell it! So it went back in =|
---
This. It's really not that hard.
---
I might be wrong but I sold 10 tokens for 299 caps each before.
---
I’m not going to be on for a bit but I’m always looking for partners to kill the queen, sheepsquatch, or run aktos. Psn is the same as here
---
Eh, I had two wisdom teeth pulled and the worst part of it was hearing the gross crush sound when she cracked them.
---
Yep, if you do all of the little tasks you get 15.
---
im on Ps4!
---
Thanks! And we are playing around with the idea of a Rick and Morty style video!
---
Make your own post?
---
Glow sight is overrated imo. It's basically only useful for nuke zones. By the way, what's your plan for that? Hazmat suit? Good luck, remember you won't get your life saving armor in a Hazmat. Or PA? In which case, why not just take stabilised? 
---
I really hope you can make them work without PA, the recoil is significant without stabilised, making sustained fire difficult, which is basically the entire point of heavy weapons.
---
Interestingly you might be planning on the energy weapons so you don't suffer from the lack of armor pen, but both of those have spin up times which makes low recoil for sustained fire important, the Gatling plasma in particular has atrocious recoil.
---
Between the second and third floor of the Garrahan Estate is a locked door which requires Hacking 3 to open which leads to the range.
---
Thanks man! Guess ill keep hoping for a drop and just getting hunter lead pipes :/
---
ah, that is super cool of you!!! unfortunately,  we cant build ATOM store stuff in other people CAMPS...but seriously i really appreciate your kind offer
---
I'm a little thrown off by the water ... tears? ... you're doing that wrong.
---
Skill is not a factor in survival it is purely gear based right now. Winning a fight has nothing to do with skill just who has better gear. I say this as someone that runs around two shotting ppl with gear I grinded out for a billion hours.
---
Fallout 76 is the most welcoming game, people line up to give newcomers free shit sometimes, it's a great community full of fun and generous people. This isn't always the case, most people won't take notice of you but shine will and will be especially kind
---
How so?
---
my secondary account has same problem tho, how does your token dailies work?
---
The more you talk about them, the more likely they will get nerfed/fixed. Don't you learn anything reddit lol.
---
That’s what I was thinking. And I’m on PS4 too
---
Fix me damnit!
---
If you're also in a team, the quest will only complete for the leader I think?
---
You may have sold them for that much to some absolute idiot but at that price the Mr. Fuzzy outfit would be worth 134,550 caps. You can buy the suit for 10-15k easy so again they arent worth that much.
---
There’s a key in one of the offices, get it and go around the outside to the big pipes, there’s an opening in one of them that leads to a locked entrance
---
I have the same problem!
---
“stew”
---
I go to the park, it gives me different little tasks and I'm awarded tokens for each that I complete.
---
I'd take an opossum over a beaver.
---
I hate that. Especially when you’re trying to join a server with friends on it.
---
There's one challenge that requires you to revive someone.
---
There's one challenge that requires you to revive someone in water.
---
I wish they would fix the issues instead of adding more buyable content. Revenue zombies!
---
Same here, worst part of being awake for it.
---
Sounds like my both accounts and those quest activation are fully broken.
---
I always get one of token daily.
---
Nope, It's for T-45, T-51, T-60 &amp; X-01.
---
What??? 1 token???? Yes, either it's broken or you are doing something wrong.
---
Yeah basically all energy weapons lack that armor pen. Even explsoive energy weapons lack. My BE gatling plasma does decent but its nothing compared to my Minigun or 50 cal. 
---
The Guass is really good but lacks due to the charge up time for pure dps output. 
---
Anything that has a perforating mag is very op due to the 40% armor piercing without considering tank killer or anti-armor legendarys. 
---
BE handmade would be your best bet in the assault rifle category. 
---
The bigger the damage number you can deal the less of an effect her armor has on reducing your damage. So stealth is a big factor. So is trying to retain stealth if you want some big damage.
---
How do you deal with scorched beasts as melee if they stay in the air?
---
With maxed starched genes equipped, they last forever. Even if you die. Multiple sessions.
---
The fine points:
---
There are two ways to acquire mutations, either via Serum or Random Exposure to radiation.
---
Serums grant the named mutation permanently and suppress the negative effects for one hour. You can take a mutation serum again and again to suppress the negative effects for one hour.
---
Mutations granted from radiation exposure are random. So if you want say five specific mutations, getting the five exact ones you want is going to be tricky. What you would do is go to a place like Black Water Mind and purposely expose yourself to radiation via the pool outside or the barrels inside just before then entrance. If you mutate and get what you want, put up starched genes. You then go inside blackwater mine and use the decontamination shower to both clear the rads off you and if desired via removing starched genes...remove undesired mutations. Removal is random too. Theres always a chance of getting a desired mutation removed and you will get mutations you don't want.
---
Going back to serums, serums are the smarter and safer way of mutating. Craft or acquire the serums you need, plenty of people on Reddit sell them as reasonable prices. Then make sure you have starched genes off (go jump in a decontamination shower if you need to remove rads, or use radaway full strength), once cleared, use your serums. Re apply starched genes once you have gained the mutations you want. Sidenote: apparently there has been (possibly still is?) a bug with applying serums and the carnivore serum, apparently having carnivore already effective can or did cause further mutation serums to fail, suggest consuming the other serums and carnivore last. Reapply Starched Genes and always keep it up.
---
Max out Class Freak and run that too, it lessens the negative effects of mutations. Side note on Healing factor: From what I've noticed with my own use of healing factor, even with Class Freak maxed out, the negative hit on the healing that Stimpaks seems unchanged regardless of having class freak in use.
---
Radaway has a chance to cure a mutation unless you have starched genes up.
---
Rad X at full strength with suppress all mutations for 5 minutes, I have mine diluted as do many others.
---
So:
---
1. Max Starched Genes is a must, never in-equip this.
---
2. Acquire desired mutations, use Carnivore serum last.
---
3. Class Freak at max is a good thing
---
4. Be careful using full strength Radaways if you know you're going to be out in combat soon, like farming Whitesprings in a Nuke Zone.
---
5. Mutations are forever if starched, last through death, from session to session and cannot be shared.
---
6. Carnivore and Herbivore are exclusive - meaning you can only have one or the other.
---
7. As to serums, the suppressing of negative effects expire after an hour but you keep the mutation with it's negative effects. You can take another serum of a specific type and it will suppress the negative effects of that particular mutation for another hour. They don't stack in the sense that you can get two hours or more of suppressed negative effects via chugging the same serum type.
---
right out of the vault?  I would stick with the Overseer and Responder missions first.  From Flatwoods up to Morgantown Airport then outwards as the story encourages you.  The Tadpole quests result in a backpack for increased carry weight...you don't really need that as the game starts.
---
Not mandatory, but you might look into what weapons class you like and come up with a plan for specials points.  Keeps from having to respec as much later.
---
And don't be afraid to ask around here.  Great place for info and strategy ideas.
---
Correction - it's 40% less damage while power attacking.
---
If your couched you can not be targeted in vats.
---
Only top 3 players are on the world map.
---
If your gun is drawn then you show up as red dot on compass.
---
If your gun is away you show up as a yellow dot on compass.
---
At least until your attacking... The way to move is crouched and weapon away. Completely off map and compass (unless your top 3 of course)
---
I play survival all the time. Check your map for the top guys... There will often be a pvp match going on there. Everybody else is sneaking around for that 20% xp bump.
---
Also if you go to an event pvp is off for the duration... Be ready to run away after just in case but iv had no trouble so far. Possibility is there so if your nervous get moving right before its completed.
---
And yes berry mentats work on players with stealth on.
---
Well to be fair, you did spend a night with a robobrain in FO4..
---
Thanks for the help!
---
People don’t read jack shit and like to complain.
---
It's not punishing us, it's providing us with different options. The option that you think looks the best weighs more I guess, and that's something that you have to take into consideration with your build
---
Had to move off there, just got too popular. When I first moved there about three months ago had no problems. I used the long memorial day weekend to reposition my camp because I was sick of having to login four five six times to get my vendors out. I'm just south of West Tek in the information center. Nice spot has its own nuka cola machine that responds cola when people come and buy stuff for my vending machines. Not quite as much traffic for my vendors but I get in first try.
---
I have that skin on my instigating combat knife and it works fine.
---
When you have never been over 7000 caps....feels bad
---
Thanks for the fast reply, I’ll keep that in mind!
---
i'm sorry but i meant one of three daily token quest.  
---
I do get three token after finish one of the quest.
---
No. Problem is the game had so much exploits at launch that everyone have everything by now in the amounts they should never have. Survival mode with new charactees is a chance for a new start, without game breaking exploits. The only reason most of my friends don't even wanna try the game is because of all the crap that was happening after launch. They all wanted to buy the game for the survival mode, until they've learned people will just join with their thousands of duplicated legendary items.
---
The more complex ones biochemically yes, the less complex will take much longer. This is also hoping that anything else doesnt break down into toxic intermediates. ;) *sips the kool-aid*
---
Wow, what a month to be away from home
---
I've had all my quests complete in a team. The only thing that "might" make a difference is if you only have the leader do the objectives. 
---
When i did them, we all did each step separately but together. Which is fairly easy. Leader picks up note, then i pick up, then another team member and so on. So if you somehow missed a step, i can see it only counting for team leader.
---
Note some objectives can only be done by one person, in which case it counts for all of you on the team. For example I am Become Death - quest to launch nuke. Only one person actually targets and launches the nuke, but it updates quest for everyone on the team. You don't each have to go through entire process of launching it.
---
Yes, I did - thanks :)
---
No please don't let them butcher the brotherhood lore anymore.

My psn is the same as here. Send me a request when you’re available.

This is why I cosplay as Preston.  Everyone hates me, and yet loves me at the same time.  It's great.

No. I've said it before and I'll say it again and again...the problem is the game had so much exploits at launch that everyone have everything by now in the amounts they should never have. Survival mode with new characters is a chance for a new start, without game breaking exploits. The only reason most of my friends don't even wanna try the game is because of all the crap that was happening after launch.

I cant speak for pc but im on xbox and the times iv come across other players has always been positive
---
And in the end, isn't that the only goal that matters?
---
And done. See ya out in Appalachia
---
You cAn buy a suit in a vendor for 500 caps each part (head and suit so 1k caps)
---
I bought 3 at 300 caps for each part.
---
Lots of differing prices
---
Hold out and search player vendors for the best deal.
---
Buying tokens... You'll spend waaaay more than you need too.
---
I can't pay to win 76 because I haven't figured out how to beat and win the game.
---
There were, however we know our pc was not one based on the Brotherhood quesyline and rlthe fact we had to join the military (amd register wiith the dmv) to gain access to fort defiance.
---
Options should be based on logic, not aesthetic.  Carry weight and stash space are precious in this game, if you give people the choice between two weapons around the same power level except one weighs three times as much AND does less damage does that make any sense?
---
The first time you're at the park, you get all 3 tasks. It's only one of the three daily after that.
---
You on PC?
---
You from the standpoint of that's 1200 caps an hour, minimum,  assuming I get them for the lowest they've been in vending...not sustainable. My entire point is that the mutations already give big enough penalties
---
I like serendipity myself but depends on your play style. I'd put at least on point in Iron Fist since you get 10% for the first point on each card. You'd get 5 percent more damage without changing much. I personally like Radicool for anything melee as it boosts your strength. It would increase the buff from Barbarian as well. Solar Powered and Party Boy are also ways to boost your strength and are easy to swap out.
---
Yes I am
---
Weird, I've been watching mysteries at the museum lately and the in the past few eps I caught were either mothman segments or flatwoods monster segments.
---
It's a sign!

I had one of my resource nodes move last night the machine was in its original spot and the wood pile was now a wild murfruit and the wood pile moved into my foundation.

I wish I could dual wield Deathclaw or Mole Miner Gauntlets.

Only the first time you're there. Go there tomorrow, 3 tokens.

No special thing. Just math. And where multipliers apply. Any one can do it, Bethesda knows reddit doesn’t seems to get it tho. Circle jerk I guess.

I play a couple nights a week and on weekends.

I just put on the required gear and go there and server hop till I find another person doing the same. Usually within five hops I find someone.
---
The main thing I've noticed changed is the placement restrictions on building parts (floors, walls, roofs, stairs) have been made stricter. I had an awesome camp built before the patch, and had to put an upper floor into storage to place some stairs. The floor was clipoing slightly into a rock before, but now the rock is intersecting and I can't replace it.

I have them for sale at my shop.  \*wink wink\*
---
Class freak almost wipes them out entirely, and serums selectively wipe them out completely. 
---
This isn't even remotely enough penalty compared to the super human performance you gain from a tweaked mutations build and there is almost no motivation or incentive to stay unmutated. 
---
They absolutely need more penalties applied.

Mine is current Soksprings, it’s a mansion on the Whitespring golf course.
---
Yeah but please don't sit and just watch because it makes a difficult event even more difficult because more stuff spawns because you're sitting there. At least shoot the eyebombs before they enter the area.

I refer to mine as Sinni’s Shit Shack but I don’t have it on my shop lol

What system are you on? I know for a fact I have a 3\* ffr furious gatling chilling in my stash. Yours if you're on PC.

She’s an NPC but she also just...grunts. She doesn’t say anything.
---
Survival has been underwhelming for me, I thought it'd make your hunger and thirst more relevant but it didn't seem to even touch that aspect of the game. And imo this game works better as PVE instead of PVP
---
Ok tomorrow is better for me too my gt is cl88t

I hope it works that was but it seems many of people having same issue like mine.

Only few or none of dailies can be activated somehow.

Ok so a quick update from my post last night (thanks for all your responses). One player responded offering to help (wont name them so they dont get spammed for requests for help) and it was awesome. Other than helping me finish the quest, we had a good chat, I learnt a few things and checked out his amazing camp. So, while needing another player for a solo player can be frustrating, at the same time it forced me to friend another player and I feel it was a really positive experience, and someone I can call on in future.
---
It is pretty expensive Check the market sub. 30 days of farming tokens is not worth it for most. Easier to make 45k in a week or so and buy it.
---
Yep one ghoul was breaking down my door and not one weapon shot him.. but when there mules away they get shredded
---
Why?  It only had the .45 and .308 receiver in Fallout 4.
---
Use the assault or handmade if you want the 5.56 (even if in the aforementioned game the handmade chambered the 7.62mm round).

ah, the wrapped cap effect
---
It really hits home how flawed the system is in a game based off capitalism when it literally forces you to give things away for free because of an artificial limit on how much money you can have.
---
Grinding that event, my wife complains too. I told her though if you hear the screaming that's a good sign it means I have the good ending of the quest not the one with the never-ending waves of bugs. She doesn't agree.
---
"I can certainly see why other players would see it as being on the other side of the cosmetic" well no shit, it's not a cosmetic and it provides an advantage, no matter how minor or dressed up as "convenient" 
---
It goes against their original statement about cosmetics in the atom shop, and people are justifiably miffed about it. 
---
Usually don't deploy slippery slope arguments, but what's to stop them from adding an ammo or caps kit for "convenience"
---
GamerMOMover50 on yt made a couple videos about setting up camp there.

It is a shoddy design for any game and for an mmo almost unforgivable to control the in game econony in this particular fashion (meaning the extremely low cap limit)
---
You know what bud? You get an upvote for owning it rather than doing the beta thing I've seen a lot and deleting the post or doubling down on what you said. Good on you. No sarcasm.
---
I literally sent them a ticket about this like 5min ago lmao
---
Yea I have all the serum recipes, never wear power armor so I just spaced buying the plans .. now I will thanks for the reminder.
---
Eventually you are going to run out of plans and recipes to buy. All you are doing is putting off the inevitable.
---
You forgot heads on a pike.

...or you play with other people or you don't really care to explore new content or so on.

I think all the requests on Reddit makes it pretty clear what the majority wanted.

Repair kits

Ah shit, here we go again!

Yeah they really dont. I mean, they were called hitlers buzz saw for a reason.
---
The worst is when you spawn inside the locked building and have to fast travel to get out. Actually worse than that is getting stuck in a wall/floor. Oh wait, trap houses...
---
     Utility is one ethos, aesthetic another, game dynamics another and player base another. It seems like there's often someone arguing their modus operandi is better than everyone else's and why aren't the people in charge doing what you want.
---
On the other hand.
---
     I thank you for the insight and I'll definitely check out bloody pole hook. Tbh I am just happy to have another fo76 based topic that isn't just "what is there to do next."
---
     I wouldn't mind some new weapon types like the ones now dropped by the legendary vendor and or new legendary effects, not because I think they'll fix any issue but I think they'd expand the discussion including things like extra weighted but popular weapons like the death claw gauntlet.
---
Tldr;
---
     It creates variety and autonomy allowing people to make decisions based on more than utility.
---
I made a suggestion where you could invest in your vending and when you hit certain levels of investment you get a bonus that has x amount of weight in your vending machine not count against your stash limit.
---
It was an extremely short timeline
---
But also I dont buy much from the shops I like buying from players to keep our economy going I really enjoy the interacting with others
---
I'm distressed all the time but I have the backpack now. Thanks all the same though! :)
---
It pops up when you're on the west side of the map, you're stuck doing it else it resets for the next day. If you hop servers, it resets. Sometimes it will trigger twice in a day, haven't had that happen often.
---
Is the 50% reduction in stimpak effectiveness a hindrance when in combat?
---
Don't they have different swing speeds?
---
Thanks for the tips. Question about Carnivore: I know that it makes it so that you don’t satisfy hunger or thirst with plants. Does this mean that you don’t get the secondary benefits from eating/drinking plant-based foods as well?
---
"Well look at me go!"
---
Perfect. Too funny.
---
I felt exactly the same. I don't socialize in this game, or any other. I got mine during Encryptid as others have. I actually didn't even realize I was triggering the event (I'd been irrationally putting it off for a while) because I thought I had to buy a keycard first (didn't know it gives you the first one). So I was there, with 30 seconds to get ready and my best weapons were in stash. I forgot to even swap to combat perks; I was on my travel loadout. About 15 people showed up though within a few seconds, everything from level 39 to level 325. I was doing the pylons as much as possible and so were two or three other people, and along the way I got revived two or three times and I revived two other people so I got my basic backpack AND we beat the event. What a blast! I think I used about 800rds of 5.56 in a level 35 junkies limb damage +50DR handmade and 20 stims and a dose of medx and a nuka grape. I ended up getting a bloodied 40%/40% baseball bat from the boss then too, which seems pretty decent even though I'm not a melee build.
---
&gt; it's the griefer's fault he is salty.
---
No, actually it's not. That kind of statement is akin to "you made me angry" or "you made me hit you".
---
You have very little influence on what other people do you to. You do however have 100% control over your own reaction to that. I understand it but let's not pretend that he didn't choose to be salty.
---
500 for a set of 3 skins
---
Cant Answer the first part
---
I’m on Xbox. Purchased the Responder skin last night for my TSE pump shotgun. Definitely won’t be using it untilI know this gets resolved. Thanks for the heads up.
---
There used to be silo running services. Not sure if those guys are still around.
---
Yeah. Eventually. Maybe. 
---
I'm not good at asking for help, so I'll probably just hope it accidentally happens in the next six months or so.
---
There just shouldn't be a limit at all or at least it should be ridiculous like five hundred thousand or something.
---
If you need to drain people's wallets that badly add in more reasons to spend caps like expensive legendaries in vendors or the ability to pay caps to remove a legendary effect from a piece of gear and put it on something else.
---
The story seems worth at least as much as the backpack though, lol.
---
One of my favourite camp items ever
---
Question is would you want 2000 if it affects server performance? It's very rarely a consideration when people make a more stash/more camp budget post.
---
I'm all for more of whatever so long as server performance isn't impacted, not some arbitrary number.
---
Its no longer ptw because they removed the buff you used to get from repairing certain items.  
---
So I agree with them now but at the time they announced the repair kits it WAS pay to win because you got better stats from items based on their condition at the time.
---
Because
---
 "How about a suggestion that increases server stability? "
---
combining all stashes would effectively have the server strain of 800 x # of characters-- that is unless you want the same 800 stash limit for all characters?  
---
The idea isn't to have a larger stash anywhere but where there is a severely pared down world n the "marketplace" (to free  up resources to allow it)- this is why I said "as a game mode" and on their own servers- heck i would be ok if they implemented something like this and reduced adventure and survival mode stashes to increase performance!
---
and the mention of mailbox is to indicate that it can be used to transfer between characters instead of actually implementing a mailbox
---
Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiits GRAFTON DAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY

Are u on xbox?

Jeezy peezy!!  I have like 150 caps.  How do you guys get so many?
---
That’s what I was saying. My wording made it confusing. The part that no one knows about is buried in the middle.
---
Gonna keep an eye around here myself im trying to find a grind spot also near a junk pile
---
I think the main reason for having to start a new character and not being able to switch between modes is to make survival mode less about testing out your high level adventure mode character in PVP, it's largely a mentality shift towards survival and less towards PVP death match. I don't think it matters so much that there will be big level discrepancies eventually, it's still an important and beneficial change in my view.

My fallout 76 camp https://imgur.com/gallery/B61nmOs

Servers seem to have a good amount of people in them &amp; all but one interaction I've had since November has been positive.
---
This is exactly what happened to my 2 star bloodied, exploding shotgun. I've been in contact with customer support and as will ALL items in game they say they can do nothing, which is in fact not true. Either to this I paid cash to buy atoms to purchase the responder shotgun skin, they owe me a refund on those caps for selling a faulty product, guess what NO response at all. This occurred on the day of release of the skin and I put in a ticket within an hour of buying/applying/using the skin and weapon.  Zero customer service!!!
---
Wait, were you inbetween Top of the world and Site Alpha?
---
Gotcha, would have been helpful if the /s was included from the beginning

Got her down to below 10% health myself. 20 mins then server stopped.

Braxton's Quality Medical Supplies is a spawn point for a Sheepsquatch. From where you fast travel spawn-in, run up the hill a bit to where the truck is, in the lot there you might get a squatch or a place holder mob, good to high chance of legendaries.
---
Few people would buy them because of -2 perception and they couldn't give it Veil of Mysteries quality because then there would be yells of p2w

What are looking to trade for? Or just caps?

Only match i have is a tse lever

It was probably Karen

Comes with matching coffee pot?
---
So, er, like a jukebox then?
---
I would not risk that!
---
&gt; Yes it's a cash grab 
---
You know what, good on you to owning up to prices being inflated just for the sake of profiteering. So we know the real price is at least below 500.
---
Once again, not saying YOU have to lower your price beyond 500. Though, by your own admission you're price gouging the consumer.
---
&gt; I'll go further. If people are still selling serums on the website that shall not be named for 300 caps they are IDIOTS. 
---
People who sell their product 166% above a fair market price, admit to it being a cash grab on a public forum and expect that to be good business are morons.
---
It fits with the premise that our purpose is to fix the wasteland though.
---
I meant that instead of a mailbox and larger stash on this "Marketplace", just have a **separate** account stash on this "Marketplace" server that you can use to swap items with other characters or use as "off-site" storage. So you don't need a mailbox or have to worry about. This wouldn't be accessible on the other game modes, only in the marketplace. I'm actually in favor of your idea.
---
You likely will be on another server. So no unless you you have a friend stay there and you rejoin. But if you do that you’d be better off giving it to them to hold and then get it back. I think dropped stuff despawns when you leave the server.
---
Yes, 100%
---
The #1 reason for me to get the pestilence skin was to be able to make the ultracite cosmetic much nicer. Also since I dont give a RIP about jetpacks (other mods are useful more often) it's a viable option. I really feel it should have some better stats or at least a passive bonus to reduce damage from scorched.

Yellow one yes, the other two are different models an look pretty sweet. Kinda surprised they didn't add the different color versions of the old ones.

We're the tunnel snakes! And we rule!

Thanks for the tip.  I'll show him just what I think of his "messages".
---
Nope. Don’t try it.
---
No idea but the Camp Venture one was the one I was alluding to.
---
Its possible but not easy as you aren't guaranteed to spawn into the same world.
---
If you have any friend that are online you can try going on to the world that that friend is on, asking them to stay logged in and on that world, then stash plans in a container, change characters and re join friends world and then retrieve plans from said container.
---
It's not 100% safe as someone can find the plans you stashed and take them or they can disconnect and you lose the plans.
---
Best way is to transfer with a trusted friend, or run a second copy of the game if you have that capability and self trade.
---
That sucks! Nice username BTW!
---
*Sarcasm is difficult to detect in the written form*
---
Something to note. The deathclaw gauntlet is alot quieter. So in survival swinging that around wont reveal your position with audio compared to the power fist.
---
This is what’s missing!!!!!!
---
After witnessing [bottlecap mines](https://streamable.com/68ikt) in-game for first time recently they should just make your character burst caps all over the place when you receive them when at max. I mean they gotta go somewhere if you can't hold'em all.
---
I have eight buildings, five with names. I'm at the light placement cap (50) but I named them pretty generically: Armorer, Smith, Doc's, and the Soda Saloon. You can guess the kinds of stuff we sell here at Floopwood. Though I did use like fifteen letters to spell out Floopwood Police

Happy that I can now get it, but this tells me that nothing in the store will truly ever be limited time. I feel they may be sacrificing one time cash grab for the long term exclusivity sell for future "limited" items.
---
Oh damn, i kinda wish i could recreate that tbf
---
That would be.... Handy!
---
You can put items in a world container and then if you can get back to the same server with your other character you can then have them get the items. It's risky though and you'll probably want to find people on that same server you can befriend so you can get back more easily. If you do that, you'd want to use a container that is remote and doesn't see a lot of traffic. Otherwise, someone else may have a nice surprise when they check that toolbox you used...
---
I would be disappointed if the Devs haven't been working on this already.  Its really getting annoying to ask friends to trade with you and switch characters.  The game caters to create more than one character to have fun with different builds.  I'm surprised we don't have one yet, and at the same time I'm not surprised at all.  Upvoting for visibility.
---
I literally never thought about this but a lot of MMOs where you can have alts have an account bank. Why is this missing? If they really wanted to be bitchy about it they could have it take up 200 of your camp stash, but I know a ton of people this would help tremendously.
---
Seriously? I swear she gets tougher the more people show up.

Moving your CAMP will fix all your items, Cletus. About the incest and other problems though, ehh, dunno. Glancing at the map occasionally may also assist you.

Link for the lazy, although I'd recommend checking it out anyway because they brought up previously released items that I'd completely missed:

---
Risky. Get a mule.
---
Kind of like when I kill a legendary and it doesn't drop a legendary item.  I can be upset about it or I can keep grinding.  I suggest just keep at it.  As said above, Enclave events are easier.
---
I pick up and sell every weapon I come by and I grind horde missions for legendaries I do t really know how much things should cost, so I usually put the good ones on a message board and do an auction of sorts
---
Still no response to my ticket 
---
Lol we all know you still bought it
---
New to the game, can you give me a load down on what stuff is worth or point me in the direction to find out?

Between this and the dog food perk I have not needed to use a stimpack outside emergencies in a long time. I genuinely do not understand why anyone bothers to cook or carry spoilable food on them when dog food is fucking everywhere for free.
---
I think it's insane, but someone told me that they see them go for a max of 466/each. The way they arrived at it is based on 3 per day limit vs 1400c per day limit. That's nuts to me, but I see the logic. If you've got caps to burn, then be my guest (he does). I'd be happy to pay someone 3k for the whole suit and be done with it. (someone msg me if you're on pc and we can deal)
---
I am fin sir
---
If you're on tonight when I get off work, then the queen will die. The queen is dead, ling live the queen.
---
chems, junk, mods, components - any of the miscellaneous stuff.
---
I like the idea but I imagine the logistics of getting it working would prove an issue. I'd at least like it if we could have different jukeboxes like the Sons of Dane or frathouse ones.
---
Fair enough.
---
I decided I wasn't going to use much of the junk that I have so I reduced all but the rarest/most expensive items to 100 each. I dropped about 300lbs doing that. Then I normally drop around 100lbs each time I do an ammo crafting run. 
---
I was managing my stash fine until I forgot to account for the space my legendaries were going to take up waiting to turn them in for scrip. You buy five 3 stars, you can't turn em all back in.
---
I just found this place on my own on the weekend and the dearhclaw trader was there but it was fighting amongst another deathclaw and some other random mobs and they were all dead before I realized one of them had the special name. Is the trader one hostile like any other deathclaw normally? Or are they indifferent to you?
---
Bruh you find out who dropped it and call me up. Got a .50 cal waitin for an excuse. VENGEANCE FOR THE FALLEN FROGS!
---
I owned both hot rodder and blackbird and they just released them both again on the shop, now the only thing exclusive I have is the Northern Lights T-51 paintjob lol
---
I commented on another post about this a few days ago. I'm having this issue with an xbox one x. My wife plays on a regular xbox one and hasn't had the issue. I don't have similar issues with other games. I cleared my save data from the cloud and xbox, even uninstalled and reinstalled but still have the issue. Tried using alts, same issue. I asked in the fo76 discord and no one had any idea. The other post about this was someone using 2 different xbox one s consoles. I'm just hoping the next patch fixes it, it wasn't an issue before the last patch that introduced the arktos pharma event.
---
Just a heads up here’s the proof 
---
the future was too soon
---
Same. I have hundreds of dog food stashed on an alt since I reflexively (and some might say obsessively) search trash cans and the like.
---
Good Doggy and Cola Nut are must haves for me.
---
People buy junk/meds/food/plans when it's cheap and you're in an area where they don't have to pay a lot to travel to you to check what you have. I'm center on the map and I can sell pretty much anything for more than a vendor bot will give me. Legendary stuff gets priced at 18-20 caps per scrip though.
---
I find that not selling crappy plans helps you sell the good plans though. If people see you're selling metal bed plans and other super common stuff it seems like they leave faster. Since I cut my plans down to only armor and weapon and mods plans and desirable camp plans I sell a lot more. Since I can't sell plans to bots I put them all out for pretty cheap. I don't think I have a plan over 99 caps.
---
I stand corrected ... GOT ... you are indeed doing it right ... 👍
---
Hahahaa just seen it came back
---
Stealth. Sniper. Rifleman. I’d start there.
---
Sanjay here my skin is finnaly rotten enough to fall of my bones. It makes a hell of a stink so it may be full of some unwanted guests.
---
Ive got a deatg maze of punji boards and radiatuon emitters! Hope those locked doors dont take too long! (Laughs in ghoul)
---
You can do it if you have a friend to hold the world open for you.  
---
Basically join server with friend, drop plans in container.  quit to menu, switch characters, join server with same friend.  The plans will be in the same container unless someone loots it in the meantime.  
---
Better to just give the item to said friend but if the idea is dropping an item to pick up with another character without bugging your friends then there ya go.   
---
I'd suggest you get both characters to the same location before you do all of this to minimize the time between dropping the item with the one character and picking it up with the other.  Also a good idea to do it in an out of the way location so it's less likely to get looted by some random.
---
If you are going to be an asshole to some one don’t expect them to be nice back.
---
right! I’m glad others will get to enjoy it now but I feel Bethesda should’ve put more context behind their “Limited Item” meaning lol
---
That's cool then, so as long as each team member all follow each quest marker and pickup each item etc. Sorted! Be shite if you were bumped from getting that sweet Excavator armour and some of your team did.
---
All ranks in the rifleman cards+tank killer are must haves. After that you can do whatever you feel like. Stealth works great with sniping, you could also use VATS. Bloody mess is always a nice perk to have too
---
I personally prefer marine overall. The complete lack of rad resist on most common “best” armors turns me off. Marine has good DR, fair energy ( and with how little danger you are in from energy damage in this game, I’d call it “good”) resist, and good rad resist. It’s the best balance imo. People drooling over BoS or heavy leather are kind of silly imo. Your most dangerous sources of damage are not energy, they are ballistic/physical, and radiation. BoS has higher DR than marine, but with zero RR, it falls short IMO.
---
Heavy robot is also good, but really rare. Trapper just doesn’t have the right balance.
---
And let’s be real, refusing to sell some items is nowhere near assaulting some one or even griefing some one.
---
Technically, if there is no body or some type of physical object that contains the character as a physical entity that's rendered in the game, it may not be considered an "NPC" by some. That's a specific industry term that's used in the game's coding to determine a character's attributes (hair color, skin, outfits, spawning conditions, weaknesses to damage types, combat behavior, etc.)
---
black bird sniping in the dead of niiiiight!
---
I heard someone say it doesn't affect anything but I'm just playing it safe. But I would suggest an increase or I might have to get rid of alot of stuff that I can move freely. I like to horde stuff that can help me and others around me. Especially if you need plenty of crafting material.
---
I gotta go to bed, how about tomorrow?

It's from earlier today, lots of useful comments.
---
I’d be okay with taking someone else’s loot bag having the same effect as shooting someone with pacifist off (and maybe even make it so if pacifist is on, you can’t take someone else’s loot bag?).  It’s not a “true” bounty, since no one but that player sees it, but it does allow the person who’s stuff you just jacked to make a choice about retaliating or moving on.
---
They just released Blackbird again on the shop, I’m sorry comrade
---
It was a joke. I've lost tons of weapons and armor to bugs, I fully sympathize.
---
more bones
---
I thought I'd lost a set of power armor last week but eventually realized that it was still there but had it's name changed back to default. The same day I looted a legendary weapon and it immediately renamed itself the same thing as one of my favorited weapons.
---
I won't be launching a nuke any time soon, but can I add you so I can watch when you do fight a queen? I'll stand faaaaar away and use my binoculars so my presence doesn't mess with her health.
---
Not underestimating your abilities, I'm a trash player and I'd like to spectate a good player!
---
I kinda like how there is some form of punishment for death. I was on a low level alt during encrypted mostly running around stimpaking people. One dude died before I could get to him and left me 70lbs of much needed scrap. That seems fair for being a combat medic.
---
I also may have found someone's mule trekking through Whitesprings. The guy was level 30 and dropped 300lbs of scrap. I don't know why or how he had that much on him at such a level, but again, it was much needed on my low level alt.
---
For some reason calling them cowards made me laugh.
---
Upvote

I play alot of eso so I'm hoping to play fo76 every other day. Lol I'm risking n buying it on PC. Thank yall for answers.

Just launch it so I didn’t have to use power armor. I hate power armor loud lumber stupid things.

You tell me ,... https://imgur.com/gallery/KPZeGtt

Kinda crazy no one took a 19k bet that they could only win from.
---
I think right out of the vault is too soon, but I could see the advantage of starting them early...if you don't pay attention, you're likely to complete a lot of the tasks just incidentally along the way (like hacking various types of terminals)...if you do pay attention, you can work on other tasks along the way, like collecting teddy bears or deathclaw hides.
---
I’m sorrrrry lol . By the sounds of it, it’s only back for a brief time then it’s gone again. Won’t be as rare but atleast, by the sounds of it won’t be here forever again.
---
2 days later on youtube , 'Fallout 76 goes PAY TO WIN' :(
---
Hmm, that's certainly an idea :)
---
The joke was that they wont change the cap limit.
---
So you cant buy one
---
Mae sure you highlight the item you're wanting to connect to and not something behind it or open air, you'll jump instead. Happens to me as well.
---
If you're trying to wire something to a node it helps to put your targeting dot on the node so it highlights, then press triangle.
---
Also if you're trying to connect one device to another wait till it highlights, you don't have to connect exactly with the little power node on devices either, just mouse target over the machine or whatever you're connecting to.
---
Sometimes moving close helps as it cuts down your field of view.
---
It gets frustrating I have the same issue on Xbox at times. I usually leave the build menu and try it again if that doesn’t work I leave the build menu and leave my camp green circle area. If it still doesn’t work I take my disc and huss it out the window.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
Ask her nicely?
---
I really didnt say i dont enjoy the game.
---
I said the performance isn’t tied to 12 mobs.
---
People here are armchair developers when in reality they have no idea ehat they are talking about.
---
Thank you, but mostly I’ve gotten down votes and questions on build.
---
A few days ago I was 24 caps short of buying a new serum recipe, while trying to raise said caps (I'd already tapped out the vendors) someone bought all my 5.56 rounds for 12,500. Ok so I didn't lose as much but man, 24 caps and I'd have been able to buy the serum recipe and get all 12,500 caps from the ammo, instead I got about 7.5k
---
It just sucks man. That power armor is the only thing i kept from when i originally hit lvl 50. My most prized  possession really. I hate that its back. I still love it and will still keep it. I just know once my friends see it they gonna be talking shit lmao.
---
Yeah, I used to have a camp very close to that area. I loved the spot but eventually I moved because so many other people built nearby camps that it became a pain to play with anyone else and be able to have my CAMP on the same server.
---
I'm finally getting into the habit of attempting to spread my camps out into multiple blueprints, but it's a major pain. It's often not clear which pieces won't be able to snap together until after I attempt to reconstruct them, or why some of the pieces won't work together. Sigh.
---
Ah - paper bags - gotcha.
---
You're tempting me to reignite my petition for Bethesda to implement a piggy back ride function on power armor users!
---
I think my spare junk 3 star pieces are clogging up what would be a 400 lb stash.  I keep 50 units of very common junk like cloth and leather, 100 rubber, wood, plastic, etc and only store lead and steel in quantities of over 200 for the purpose if my weekly ammosmith/super duper when making more 5.56mm.  Lately I've just been making 5.56 as I acquire more lead and keep my steel stash around 100 for CAMP repairs.  Without a pile of lead and steel, my stash can get down to 550 lb.  I always say ugh when I get a 3* heavy gun from the purveyor, because 40 scrip is too much to waste and I now have a 20lb block of shit sitting in my stash until tomorrow.  I wish I could specifically put 150 scrip down and roll the dice on just rifles.  I've got a perfect *** Instigating/10% aim/reload hunting rifle, and I'm just looking to improve on my AA/E handmade with a third star and upgrade armor pieces to the perfect forest scout unyielding/AP/sneak set.  It's good to have tall mountains to climb and white whales to chase.
---
Escape Artist is a must.
---
Agreed fully, there are better ways to control an economy
---
NEW META: never buy anything new/limited. everything WILL go on sale for cheaper. limited items all come back eventually.
---
How do we know that the Zetans or possibly the Flatwoods monster isn't behind the satellite going silent?

Maybe that's why Flatty is here as a scout to see the threat of the survivors, particularly the BOS.
---
Thunder mountain substation TM-02 has a junk spot, a lv91 deathclaw and about 4 lv20-30 glowing ants the deathclaw and one of the ants can rarely be 3✨
---
You should just do your crafting and modding on one character and get a friend to help you move weapons and armor to the character you want
---
just wait until "we found a glitch with the nuke silos" Betheda: \*disables nuke silos\*
---
Ok ,so the short of it is that when building say you place a foundation and a set of stairs and you decide you want to move said foundation over a bit. normally you would remove the stairs, which would then allow you to move the foundation. What I've found is that most times the stairs are not removable, so you are stuck working with what you have or scrapping everything and starting over. Same goes for random wall or roof pieces, some just refuse to be removed/replaced or stored.  In addition to that, I constantly get the "cannot place, intersects with another object" every other piece I place and the only fix is backing out of the build menu and reentering.  
---
If you go to someones camp and see and odd foundation or a wall piece stuck in mid air for no apparent reason, it's actually because the game simply refuses to allow you to get rid of them.
---
Just got a Bloodied Explosive Mini Gun from the purveyor I am going to light the SBQ up.
---
I think you still can to guard your camp but dont hold me to that.  I know you used to be able to with the right perks and charisma score and it had to be specific spawns.  I'm sure theres a YouTube video or 14 on the hows and wheres.
---
Not holding out hope on having one as a companion though.  Think I remember reading in some terminal  they either are actually humans who were given a form of the FEV virus or they have human DNA mutated with the FEV virus to make a weapon for the military.  Would expect animals before humanoid companions.
---
There is a ton of area to the left they could use.
---
I just like them running around and bumping into each other.  My first fave is someone in power armor trying to kill a rad roach.
---
What I’ve done before is find an in game container that would be near my side character but before I store items in there and log I make sure there is someone in my “recent” tap on social menu I can join back off who is in same lobby. Simply store item, log to side char, join the person, pick up, done. THIS CAN BE RISKY THOUGH.
---
A better way is getting a close friend to hold the item for you while you log to your side char.
---
should for that price
---
Theres one south of point pleasant on a nice concrete transmission tower foundation
---
Yeah, most of the above sounds good.  .45 caliber seems popular (I have tons of it right now, but if I were out, I would buy)  And I am always in the market for reasonably priced Fusion cores.  .308 does also seem pretty popular.  Missiles tend to sell well (in my experience), but I sell them cheaply since I don't use them.  Not sure on Mini-nukes.  2mm EC tends to go fast, but I put those in my "free" vending machine when I pick some up.
---
Yeah that's on my list had some luck there, not a bad spot the sheepsquatch is always lv80 and always 1✨
---
Just play the game bro you meet people along the journey
---
Get it. Cheapest ammo you can get. Doesn’t come close to bone and adhesive tho. Not talking shit. Just invite me. And then you too can accuse me of cheating
---
I always wondered why my left arm was 12 the rest is 25 you sir are the holy grail 😂
---
Ive just bought the plans and also the shocks in the bunker mobus production i think it had a load of plans on there 
---
I went to build them and then realised it needed fluxes to make 
---
I wouldmt have botheres if i knew that esp as im getting into not wearing the power armor and was selling a heep of cores i had 😀😀😀
---
There's one just north of Fort Defiance, that also has a monorail stand nearby. A little to the north is a meadow that spawns chickens, fireflies, foxes, rabbits, possums, etc.
---
It’s all organic... check your map see if anyone is near... reach out and meet someone.
---
Asking the serious questions!
---
Thanks. I've already reached about level 30, but I kind of quit playing bc it's not much fun after that. So many of the quests require multiple people and when I was playing, everyone was really high level.
---
Low health stealth build + bloody lever action = haven't crafted ammo in months
---
I know this wasn’t a “looking for friend” post, but if you’re on PC I’ll friend you. I’m always looking for someone to complete those missions with you.
---
So true
---
I would absolutely love a decent sized new map area to explore, it felt genuinely thrilling leaving the vault with so much to explore but 150+ levels later everywhere feels familiar and I miss exploring lol.
---
I have no idea why but posts about the scout left arm get dislike bombed.
---
Shouldn't give up bro I played the whole main quest line on my own I didn't have to but I was stuck in the fallout 4 single player thing haha, I didn't play with anyone till at least level 90 there's plenty to do out there man if you enjoy farming and stuff
---
It's perpetually october, so it's not ramp season.
---
Can you PM me your gamer tag if you're on Xbox? All my friends are PS 4. :(
---
Put your system on there for more coverage
---
I have no clue bro it needs to be out there so they can fix it
---
Thx man but I’m PS4.
---
Because it takes a developer to realize it takes more resources to animate skin and shade more creatures in already very hectic fights with a lot of spell effects explosions and adds.  I wasnt talking about just 12 mobs.  Reading comprehension is fundamental.
---
And btw it's obvious from your tone and attitude you're just a troll who doesn't enjoy the game.  I was being polite but not inclusive.  Good luck in whatever it is you do.
---
I'll usually buy at least something from a player's camp, even if it's just water or a magazine.  I saw a lvl 35 instigating/+10% aim damage lever rifle at a camp today for 1076 caps, went for a smoke while playing a banjo in their camp to roll it over in my head, and came back to my PC with the decision to just buy it for the idea of prestige leveling.  16 lb in my stash doesn't feel great, but that's going to be a beast of a sniper rifle at lvl 35.  I also have a lvl 5 quad/vats crit/reload automatic pipe rifle that's going to be great to have fresh out of the vault at the end of the summer.
---
Its rough it was enough for me to shit the game off for the rest of the day.. but I be on tomarow looking for somthing to spend my caps on real fast
---
It's also close to quarry X3 which has a mirelurk queen I like to artillery strike and a few horde events often appear there
---
A fridge and a freezer set would be great. The fridge for storing drinks and cooked foods to reduce spoiling, while the freezer would be long term storage with a freeze stat that would require you to defrost the item at a cooking station to obtain the full benefit. Or even make freezer burn a debuff for the consumables that reduce their effect. 
---
We can have a gun that shoots ice, but a cold storage for food and drinks is lost technology. Right?
---
Then I get to watch a Mr handy AND my turrets ignore the mole rats destroying my camp.
---
Nope, isn't it quack seasion?
---
Fixing the duping issue fixes all the other problems, a legacy weapon should be the rarest and most expensive item you'll ever pay for, when the value on those legacy items drops, you'll know duping is out of control for real. Right now PvP'ers who have dupe gear don't want a level playing field, they want to be the only ones to benefit from exploits after all is said and done, "patch the duping" says the one with duped gear...is usually the case, but not the rule.
---
Reddit is only a fraction of a fraction of a fraction the audience. This is only English speaking with some venturing into the territory with limited English. Then it's fractioned further with the grievances. There could very well be a 95 to 5% ratio where the 5% don't like a thing but what happens is the content 95% won't make noise and the 5% will. No one every makes noise to praise something. It's always when something is a bother then someone makes noise. With that, it only sounds loud because there's no counter noise. Then fraction that further with casual gamers that don't even use Reddit.
---
This is already coming as per an inside the vault
---
On Xbox I’ve had a nice experience coming into the game. A few people helped me understand the basics , pointed me in the right direction and even given me free stuff!
---
I now do it whenever I can to new players I find and I’m always leaving things like low level weps , armour, ammo, water and food in the overseers cache at the camp! 👍🏼
---
I have a few low level explosive weapons I was gonna pass down to a new charecter.. i ha e a 1star bloodied pipe pistol, a level 10 explosive 44, level 15 explosive smg.. be a rockin start lol
---
AGAAAAAAIN!
---
Wait. You offered them, set a price and then they made the purchase soooooooo?
---
sanjay here! s t e e l  h a  r  t   i s r e a d  y
---
That can be hand waved away as "oh, the PC's credentials and ID got lost/were left behind in the frantic rush to get to shelter."
---
I don’t think I’ve ever been over 5k. I don’t even think I’ve been over 4K. I just never get anyone buying my stuff :(
---
Strength has a passive ability to add +5lbs carry weight per point.
---
Do you have perks or chems that boost strength? That would account for the extra weight from time to time.
---
Also of you get a disease that remove a strength point, you'll lose that weight as well
---
They bought it? I don’t understand the scam?
---
Well since there is no Old Longfellow... Yeah pretty much.
---
If your on pc I’ll give you a frog jar in exchange for your story
---
Yeah I was about to say I’m almost positive they said this was coming just not sure when
---
I felt the same months ago. Then I found out about the rest of the stuff you can do. Build legendary sets, farm and trade for legendary weapons, end game bosses! Even collecting outfits, roleplaying and much more!
---
Could it be something you eat?
---
Don’t all tameable creatures get decreased to a maximum level, so for Deathclaw taming their Max level is 21
---
Not sure if they're still tameable but there's a level 91 glowing deathclaw that can appear near the rest stop just east of the investigators shack it's usually along the road or at the edge of the trees there, or it could be a level 40 mega sloth or level 80 sheepsquatch
---
Idk why people don’t just set a price. For example if you have a tse shotgun  for trade for something else. Set the price as 4K or whatever you feel item is worth. Then buy the other traders item for 4K or whatever. So no one loses anything.
---
This kinda thing happens to me a lot as well...
---
Hardest thing about this challenge was waiting for my hunger meter to bottom out. I like these challenges that are doable in a day.
---
I checked and I never use chems, I went to my strength perks and I have weight of all junk down by 75% and chems by 30%. I also have the perks that make my weapons weigh less so I am at a loss. The only disease I’ve gotten has been bone worms and snot ear but I’ve used disease cures so idk!
---
Do you have a code for the silo?
---
Grab a flare gun and shoot a few up, someone should come running.
---
Drink a nukashine
---
7.62x51 is a battle rifle, 7.62x39 (what the assault rifle should take/took in 4) is more of an assault rifle cartridge.
---
That would work. I sell pemmican only and it goes fast. Right now good with salt is decent for storing food for the caps, but it would be nice to get rid of extra glowing meat steaks in our vendor sometimes.
---
The backpack has a bug where food becomes unspoilable stacked with good with salt 2. I don't use that bug, using salt 3 instead. The refrigerated backpack is not even usable for my build.
---
I got it for six so yeah that’s a good six Dollar game.
---
I bought it for full price and got plenty of enjoyment out of it. I’d say it’s definitely worth 7$
---
Sure. But ideally user researchers &amp; market researchers would use feedback from reddit and other sources to help guide user research to determine what fraction of the audience feels this way. Some grievances expressed here are likely edge cases, but there are also many that affect a large group too.
---
You can’t do item for item trades. So for some odd reason when people trade them agree to both set the value to there items as zero. The guy took the item for zero caps without giving the other item in return.
---
A lot of players live in power armor, my alt included.  I only get out of it to make food, sleep while afk or repair a sledgehammer.  I saw a plan for a T-51b helmet and bought it immediately.  Sat in a pond until my health was a sliver with a full suit of one star unyielding armor, ate a cooked scorchbeast brain, a pack of berry mentats and crafted a new helmet and more than doubled the durability of the one I was wearing.
---
dirty suit and three patch suit works as well. Enclave uniforms also count.
---
Yes.
---
Feel free to add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) for this or other similar challenges... but remind me over the mic or via a message that I said this, cuz I have a bad memory ;)
---
TYVM for the TLDR
---
The power of a sneaky headshot... Thats around 200 hp damage with the lvl 5 pistol everyone gets for free! Oh and its AA... So 2 maybe 3 follow up shots and any player is dead lol.
---
We all got our appalachian hobbies didn't we? lol
---
Some are curious burglar, others are fever blossom/royal jelly collector and i... Well i like to drop goody bags and keep my lawn nice and tidy.
---
(really would pay some atoms on a "get off my lawn" sign for the lols)
---
I gathered a bunch of steel to make ammo out of habit, then realized I swapped to a melee-centric build and I didn't need 5k 5mm ammo any more. Hope someone found it there.
---
Do you have any unyeilding gear or perks that add to strength when low hp/high rads?
---
Sounds like a Retaliatory Strike on the offender is in order.
---
I made a brand new character for survival. If you didn't, that's why you're getting your ass kicked. You need to be PvP optimized. Your PvE perks are killing you.
---
I've been trying to help out with these when I can. The other day I was doing an online class while I left fallout open as I stood in front of the white springs main entrance in a suit.
---
Unfortunately, many aren't super specific on the location so it's hard to idly help.
---
I do agree with you though. I don't have any in game friends because I prefer to go solo due to my build and I really don't want some person constantly trying to group with me.
---
Yea get it
---
This leads to bait bags though
---
Where did they say this? Out of the loop
---
 *You're here, there's nothing I fear!!!*  
---
*And I know that my heart will go on*  
---
*We'll stay forever this way*  
---
*You are safe in my heart and*  
---
*My heart will go on and on*
---
What did the rest of the interview cover?
---
If i visit you - my pricing tip would be all on 1 cap ;)
---
Sorry I done it around 6 hours ago. When im on later ill get the new code
---
Yeah I think it can drop on any event it just has a higher chance with Certain Events - [Outfit Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/htmlview)
---
I'm sure he knows that. He's just being pedantic.
---
I have a cliffside camp and if I notice someone browsing, I always make sure to wait until after they FT before leaving.
---
Very true.  If someone is selling an instigating fire axe  or lever gun for 100 caps, or other really good weapon for cheap, I just leave it alone.  Lvl 45 Joe can actually use that thing to start farming his own gear.
---
Readily available for purchase at WS bunker
---
Can't remember his name, unfortunately.
---
Go to your C.A.M.P and go on repair all. That's all
---
Thanks! So it usable whole week right? I can get Q’s to find the codes but when I find a ghoul that’s supposed to have the code it’s lying on the floor but I can’t pick it up. Went to other servers but all the same problem
---
Iv never been nuked but is that an option when you go to the camp? It is for other damage.
---
He he he.
---
I did it at level 27ish and it was fine... take some grenades.
---
It does have a repair all option, at your C.A.M.P.
---
Not really it's hit and miss what mutation you lose bro
---
Take Radaway and it will get rid of it eventually, but if you have any other mutation it will possibly get rid of that instead/as well.
---
Gotta take that gamble
---
This might be a bit controversial, and maybe a stupid idea, but maybe (along with reverting people to level 0 characters) they should remove Legendary items from Survival Mode altogether - not only would it make the mode feel more “survivally,” it would make some other weapons more popular/viable (like Fatmans and Missile Launchers, which I haven’t seen very frequently among players) and it would eradicate the issue of overpowered, duped weapons dominating PvP. Or, as an alternative, to remove certain OP effects (or just the combination of those effects; e.g. Bloodied + Explosive, but not each effect individually), like Explosive, Bloodied, Two-Shot, and so on.
---
After someone stealing my junk the last time I tried to help with Encryptid, a different approach popped into my head.
---
What if our dropped loot were locked? If dropped during an event, it could be a level 1-3 lock. Outside of event, level 0 if killed by enemy or environment. If in PvP, no lock at all.
---
This wouldn't prevent other players from taking it, but slow them down. Lock picking during Encryptid or Scorched Earth would be a high level of risk.
---
Wasteland AirBnB
---
“We’ll help you get that disease achievement!”
---
Use a diluted radaway and hope you get lucky!
---
Got it brother thanks
---
Alright
---
The "flying saucer" might actually be the missle silos that the nukes come out of, they look a lot like a 50's flying saucer on the ground and there is nothing about them.

“Most reliable post-apocalyptic corner store this side of the Mason-Dixon line!”
---
Plenty of junk in the world... If you fall for the bait bag then thats just Darwinism.☺
---
Thanks any place to farm grenades?
---
They changed their mind and said right before they released the backpacks that they wouldn't work with power armor.
---
Caps 4 Chaps
---
“Cowboys come here! We got stuff for rootin, tootin, and shootin!”
---
Does a bear shit in the woods?
---
That could work, we would need to be able to see the contents though so we have that decision whether to take or leave. I would totally take a 10cap bounty for a hoarder's bag.
---
Anyone who wastes nukes on peoples camps are onoy the kind of person who thinks they're tough, but in reality, they couldn't hurt a fly without the fly ripping their eyeballs out
---
Not sure why you can't I had issue with the vendors not showing last night. 
---
Ill update my post later with Silo Charlie.
---
I’m looking for a good AA hunting rifle, but I’m not willing to bite the pillow and let someone go in dry over it.
---
And perk up rifle and pistol cards
---
I didnt even think about having it trigger the bounty. I was just thinking about slowing people down.
---
On the one hand, if you die, it isn't your loot anymore.  By design, its the penalty for dieing.
---
However, I still agree with you.  I've lost my loot to a level 10 player that I stopped to help!  Seriously dude?!
---
Picking up a loot bag that wasn't yours should place you in pvp.  After all, how bad do you want those screws?
---
There aren’t really any shortcuts but the fastest way to the power armor station is to enter, go down the stairs, take an immediate left. Go straight until you have to go down another set of stairs... you’re in the main area. Terminal should be in the room with the armor stations. 
---
There’s an ‘alpha’ that always spawns on the right side in the adjacent room so be prepared. Depending on your build, you can pick the mobs off one at a time and stay covered (harder if you’re melee). 
---
There are a couple plan spawns here as well. A couple bench plans if you don’t have them and a random spawn on one of the desks near where you came in. 
---
I’d recommend bringing lots of screws and black titanium so you can make your armor right away and avoid another trip or two down. Don’t forget to register your completed excavator armor to unlock the power armor station.
---
Thanks for the suggestion
---
Which vendor because Ive never seen them. Lining plans arent hit and miss like actual armor plans are.  They only sold the operative underamor at whitesprings unless this was a super recent change. These plans were only available through the free states quests which you never got as a reward.
---
ya if u got nuthin else to spend it on.
---
Happens to me all the time. Only thing that works is exiting the build menu and reopening it. It’s always fine after that.
---
where did you find it?  I cant get them to register.
---
just coal, all other pictures work
---
Wander the wasteland every day it’s a different experience
---
I leave the water purifiers and junk extractors out in the open, we must help each other and, surely, I won't die because you took three purified waters from me
---
You go through this a few times and you become very careful as to new mutations. ;)
---
That's the protective and shielded lining for Enclave Underarmor. OP is talking about the ones for "casual" and "raider," both of which seem to not actually be dropping. Casual is a popular underarmor style for atom shop underarmors, so it's bad for business to have these be unavailable.
---
It does bud
---
They stated the original statement was a mistake.
---
Never meant to work with PA 
---
Excavator already gives 100lbs if weight itself. (It's the only one that has it built in)
---
FYI - calibrated shocks on both legs gives all PA an extra 100lbs carry weight 
---
But 
---
Gives excavator armor 200 carry weight. (+50 with each calibrated leg and a full set gives +100 so 100+50+50=20lbs of extra carry weight)
---
Really dont get how there isnt a chat window for anything. Would love to actually talk to the few characters in the game that are interesting.
---
I bought it for 65 so
---
I’m using a pipe rifle only to get rid of all my .38 ammo. The pipe rifle is shit lol
---
Yeah, I kinda gave up after the 100th 'object cannot be placed in water' message I got building 10 feet off the ground. Also switched from a normal flamer to the plasma flamer, so the acid was far less important than the copper deposit I moved to
---
Heh, haven't read this for at least a month, thanks for the link :)
---
Shut your mouth, I came here for PORN.
---
No pedant here. OP just said they set the price and the other person bailed on the trade menu you. I was a little ignorant I suppose and didn’t realize they were just attempting to trade. I should have been more presumptuous
---
Wait for bethesda to fix it.
---
It's bugged for a lot of people.
---
i spent almost 200 and im still having lots of fun
---
I know this has been done to death, but personally I think they need to add NPCs back into the game if they're going to expand. There's just something crazy impersonal about only finding holotapes or diary entries about people. It feels really disconnecting. I want to see some survivors!
---
What system u on?
---
Already does. Go to your camp device. You can repair all broken structures, crops and deco.
---
Tamed pets not included.
---
I do this and sell all the drugs and alcohol I come across too, as I never use them. If you've got the Hard Bargain perk, you'll get a bit more too.
---
What armor are you wearing? Unyielding will add strength points based on health. So your carry weight will tend to fluctuate. 
---
Do you have radicool perk card? Increases strength based on rads. If you cure rads from time to time, will also fluctuate your carry weight.
---
Certain foods like radstag or booze will add increased carry weight for a few minutes.
---
I visit 2-3 camps per server, more if closer together.  What I look for is a number of plans above 40, then weapons/armor.  I also try to find the white dots of those players to see their level.  If they are at my level or higher (150), I will also be more inclined to check out their stuff.
---
I’m very inclined to visit out of the way camps too.  You have your “flea market” guys that set up near whitespring.  I tend to avoid those, as many are selling stuff at way to high of a price.  It sound cliche, but think about the customer.  I set up at site alpha, and will sell purified water for 1 cap each, and stimpaks for like 20.  People stop by before making a nuke run to stock up.
---
With how fast it came back, it's kinda crazy.
---
Saw an instigating pipe revolver for 1500 caps didn’t have close to the required amount so sadly had to say darn wish I didn’t but that instigating 3* powder rifle 😢 but there’s always another day
---
uhh click the link?
---
It does. My only complaint is it won't build anything if you don't have all the resources. So you have to get all the junk necessary to rebuild before you can rebuild all. Problematic when you don't have rarer or less used materials like flux or a frog jar/frog. Rest in peace, Hippity. May Hops carry on your frogging legacy.
---
If you go in through the underground parking area you can skip most of the BS going in through the front door. Once inside don't dilly dally or you will be attacked. If you can try not to carry any junk going in. Get the plans run like hell build it someplace else then go back and register it, you'll need to be wearing it.
---
Both have "medium" swing speed and this comparison was with both of them modded.
---
I want the TLDR ;) like the whole point of your post
---
Yea and let us know its under armor. I wasted cash money on that tactical under armor i thought was an outfit, which ive never used since like your saying cant figure out how to mod it
---
I have been having crashing problem only within last week or so. One of the big ones was if I go to 76 and farm steel from the liberators it crashes every time. I did it 3 times including reinstalling to do it another 3 times. But it does happen elsewhere too like travelling to an event. Also not a crashing problem but last 2 sbq fights went to I got in a lot of hits and did decent damage but no loot drops or event rewards even when completed show up.
---
Lol, there ya go! Nice.
---
Ended up getting my Atoms back.
---
Thought you were referring to Preston.
---
If you say so
---
The legendary enemies may need to have stars next to their names. Only the ones with stars counted for me, I was wearing an atom shop tuxedo as well.
---
The OP wanted to trade items not sell for caps. Fallout 76 doesn't have a system for an item to item trade.
---
no you shouldnt buy it
---
The bathrobe surprisingly counts as formal wear lol I completed it with out even knowing
---
No. You should pay at least $20.
---
Glowsight isn't required but is a useful perk to have over lockpicking when in a nuke zone or fighting glowing enemies.
---
I've always used a Hazmat suit for all my builds and never use PA for anything, so it's more than usable in a Nuke Zone. If I'm terribly worried about dying I can augment Lucky Break towards Mysterious Savior instead. There are downsides to all " fun " builds.
---
Putting in a bit more effort to aim isn't such a terrible thing, I've never had issue hitting things with any of these weapons.
---
If your camp unit will not repair everything just scroll down the list you'll see what you need to gather up and then you'll have it.
---
Yea I sell a lot of chems.. in my vending bufftats and calmed do real well.. I drink whiskey and some times do a little fury but not to much usually just during scorched earth and now the arktos stuff
---
Legendary melee weapons and weapon plans
---
The natual spawn for the wild murfruit swaped with the resource node
---
All of them outside explosive. (and Flamer until they introduce a reasonable method of making the ammo.)
---
Yeah, I want to give my shop a name, but my budget's maxed. Need more CAMP space!
---
Nope. Just a pocketed leather arm
---
PS4.
---
I already have a AA hunting rifle, but it’s just 1 Star.
---
I could use a hand with the Tadpole swimmer one
---
Back out of the camp build screen then go back in it will work
---
Your best bet is to use diluted radaway and cross your fingers. It's random but eventually you'll lose herbivore. Then go buy back the mutations you lost.
---
On that note... i can craft all but empath, electrically charged and herbivore.... If you dont mind spending some caps, come find me. Alternatively I can potentially craft it for free if provided the materials.
---
It counted for me and I’ve already competed it with the only the tuxedo.
---
Maybe he will send vertibots packed with west coast firepower to sell to the survivors to deal with the Scorched Plague?
---
7 dollars. Who doesn't have 7 dollars. I wipe my ass with seven dollars
---
Plus if you log out and back in wearing your excavator you end up with another 100. I usually can carry 545
---
Buffout can help to increase your carry  weight. It's only temporary so if you're going to fast travel don't hesitate. Just a power armor frame can also help increase your carry weight.
---
I don’t lock mine either, always carrying far too many already.
---
 Sure once you have assembled a nice set and pick up something you don't actually like, getting rid of it sometimes requires redoing the lot. 
---
 Do that a few times and .... well maybe i'm just slow. ;)
---
Ok dog
---
I only keep high quantities of aluminum (PA repair), acid, lead, springs and screws. Oh and plastic. But my issue with the vending is that I kinda already have my white whale. I got a god roll in harpers ferry and since then I haven't found anything really comparable. I got a nice 2 star 10mm smg as a sidearm, but I'm basically only looking for a specific 3 star minigun. Not having a lot of favor with RNGesus though.
---
Yup.  That's the way to do it.  They should really, really, really, really, get psycho on dupers in Survival (everywhere really) because give it a month and you'll have 60% of the server wearing the same OP armor/weapons.  You know the Chinese dupe farms will go into overdrive once Survival hits 'live' status and any OP gear will fetch $$$ online.
---
Grushnak, aka 90smemelord is a well known scammer and generally just a shitty, pathetic, waste of human potential and an insult to his entire family line reaching back generations.  Watch out for that one
---
I just have a pocketed leather arm. Thanks for the tips!
---
Once you have the plan, you can build excavator pa at any pa station (if you don't have enough materials to build straight away). But you'll need to go back to hq to register it once built.
---
It used to happen all the time, but I haven't had trouble with the SBQ in a long time. I've gotten loot everytime for more than a month now. I'm on PC. What platform are you on?
---
There’s a little coal deposit going east of the Charleston Landfill ... where the road crosses the train tracks with an overpass. It’s off to the side there. Took me a few tries but it finally worked.
---
I hear you.....
---
when you have 1000 caps and no one buys anything from your vendor.  I like your problem better.
---
This.
---
Same. I just have to exit the camp editor and go back in. Also PS4. I want to move my camp but that is so annoying I haven't.
---
For that price point, yes. Esp if you like this style of game. Does it bug occasionally, yes. But it has come a long way.
---
What about weapons? Some weapons have +1 strength... even the armor does too.
---
Also does your armor break at any point? If for example you have pocketed armor, it adds carry weight and when it breaks, you'd lose that benefit until it's repaired.
---
Nice 👍
---
Same as this for me on PS4.
---
I believe I read somewhere that Bethesda    is thinking of initiating a three to five minute timer on a drop bag so it cannot be picked up by someone else to give the player a chance to get back to their loot. We'll see.
---
You jest, but I wish they'd have more named named ghouls like J47 from the DMV.
---
Red dress and bowler (not bowler hat). You can buy both from the clothes vendor in WS.
---
Mmmm I miss fresh Ramps
---
Not any place I know of really except around Top of the World pretty much every dead raider has a frag on them
---
I wonder if its a certain amout of damage or at least hits. Im 50/50 but i am low lvl.
---
The 2 times i did get it i broke both my rifles dumping ammo in to it... Then yolo right up to it with a bat! 
---
The other times i was dinking around taking pictures or mostly shooting scorched running all around so that would be my guess.
---
I haven't checked but in the past if you scrolled over her but did not pick up your loot it leaves it so some one else can.
---
When I kill her and I see loot pop up now I spam X to make sure I pick it up.
---
Cobat Rifle defenitely needs a buff with better receivers.  Either that, or re-introduce the Chinese Assult Rife (Xuanlong assult rifle please) and make that even better than the handmade.  I loved the Xuanlong in FO3...
---
Spread the news and it'll get fixed quicker. 🤨
---
Maybe Charlie's code has a typo?
---
you're awesome.  thanks
---
I look for low priced reruns, then vendor them with Hard Bargain, Grape Mentats, and beer. I stock them in my vendor machines  at a slightly raised price then what I vendor them for while waiting for cap pools to refresh.
---
I've always been able to loot the sbq. Never had this problem. 
---
I've seen complaints by others, so either I'm incredibly lucky or you might not be part of the event or doing enough damage maybe?
---
Good luck!
---
Once you do it enough you learn where the ingredients are and then its a cake walk.
---
Or after its over pick them all up so you can do it again.
---
Real MVP right there
---
Yea like why the hell would they care about Boston synths when in west virginia theres unguarded nuke silos capable of making more nukes lmao
---
I know, I'm sad. Funny that it hasn't been that long lol. Fuck it, they won't be getting my monies anymore
---
A market price set by cheaters, I'm devastated. I'm a moron getting 500 caps guaranteed and you're a sad little loser without any serums, so sad
---
😂
---
I move my camp once a week because I get bored of starting at the same tree
---
This is funny in doing the event right now
---
Sounds cool, but dont forget the raiders were the previous greedy rich people, who went ham when they didnt have what they want
---
Sounds like a bot tryin to promote a different website...
---
If it has a star, it should have registered. Could be a bug, or sometimes it can take a bit of time for a kill to register. As someone else suggested, enclave events should be fairly easy to do to get commendations, and you'll get decent amount of xp from enemy kills and event completion reward.
---
Event where you have to activate 5-6 lures for orbital strike gives 2 commendations instead of 1.
---
&gt;There could very well be a 95 to 5% ratio where the 5% don't like a thing but what happens is the content 95% won't make noise and the 5% will. 
---
Look, if you're going to make up numbers wholecloth to the point of it being meaningless, what's the point of bringing it up at all?
---
I was specifically referring to the majority of the Reddit player base but let's follow where you're taking it.
---
Let's not pretend that Reddit isn't somewhat representative of the player base. Representative of the WHOLE player base, of course not. However, it's not a bad rule of thumb given how many people are on here.
---
Have you looked at other sources online? A couple of the Discords I frequent are much the same with people requesting help with the revive challenges regularly.
---
You see it on the official forums:
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/346198/revive-an-ally?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/346198/revive-an-ally?language%5B%5D=en)
---
You see it on twitter:
---
[https://twitter.com/Freezevortex/status/1126306075324637184](https://twitter.com/Freezevortex/status/1126306075324637184)
---
These are just a couple of examples. There are a ton out there if you bother to look. Same too here on Reddit.
---
Now, even all of these are represent the whole player base. However, if you hear it a lot from a lot of different sources, odds are it's a problem a decent proportion of the player base. Perhaps even the majority.
---
That's just speculation but the evidence is compelling.
---
You might want to look into whether or not your case is sound before writing off this specific issue as noise.
---
If you feel that this is just a storm in a tea cup, please, grace us with all the evidence that the broader player base overall is perfectly fine with this.
---
I think they messed it up with the recent update that was supposed to fix some of the restrictions of camp building with floating foundations so only the first foundation had to be on ground
---
I’m dumping shotgun shells into her legs like no tomorrow.  When she goes down I run to her and it just displays the circular arrow icon in the loot box.  I do get an automatic piece of armor.  I don’t know it sucks.
---
Took me about an hour to do this one, thanks to speed demon :)
---
Its description in the shop says it's under armor..
---
I figured they would release it again, but I hadn’t figured it would be so soon, I figured they would wait around a year and release it limited time again around the same time they did the first time. I feel like they are planning on releasing a bunch of limited items again weekly starting from hot rodder, blackbird and leading up to the others. 
---
I’m kind of bummed out by this, it’s great that others get a chance at having them as well but I feel like this will lead to others bashing people claiming they aren’t “original buyers” or something or the sort.
---
I wish Bethesda added more context on what they meant by “Limited Time” before hand, I was under the impression they meant limited time as being exclusive.
---
Happened a couple of times for me as well. Of course this time I start the miner miracles quest carrying some select, tough to get items that are needed, get killed getting there and zero respawn options. Have to log out of the game and voila! I’m back in with no recoverable items so back to square one. Yay :/
---
Lol well i didnt notice
---
5 from eBay.
---
Enjoyed it enough to justify spending cash om atoms to support the devs.
---
not upset anyone and milk the high demand that arose after it was taken out of the Atomshop
---
How would you get survival quest weapons on adventure characters then?
---
Yeah I just found it right before I read the posts thank you mate!
---
Not if it's done right.  
---
death bags have a quest marker so the big B has a way to differentiate between bag types (dropped items vs death junk).  
---
Simply enable the PVP trigger if the bag comes from a player death.   
---
As for baiting, if someone really wants to drop team, die, then join team to bait someone into picking it up. they deserve to get baited.  
---

 "Originally, the Atomic Shop was intended only for cosmetic items, but repair kits have an actual use in the game: "
---
"As a filthy casual I find them pretty useful. "
---
As a filthy casual I find them intrusive since the Atomic Shop is suppose to be only for cosmetic items and it's not hard to use other weapons/armor in the meantime, which adds to the survival aspect/appeal of fo76
---
I had to yell at some dude last night over my mic and beg him not to buy anymore stuff because he was about to max me out on caps. Seems ridiculous that we have to do this.
---
&gt; you're a sad little loser without any serums, so sad 
---
I know it's obnoxious to quote myself but umm...
---
"The most I've paid for them was 400 and that's because I wasn't willing to shop around."

Helps to pay attention. Both with people's comments and to what a fair market price is, price gouger.

Hang on guys, I died.

Let me put a padlock on my paper bag.

GOD DAMN IT LET US RIDE SCORCHBEASTS TO EXPLORE THE WASTELAND!!!!!!
---
If you like starting at level 1 but dislike seasons then what you REALLY like is having an advantage.  Even if they forced everyone to start survival with a fresh character without seasonal resets the early adopters would get to build up their characters and feed off all of the late coming level 1's.
---
Lol this got intense really quickly
---
Are they on PC or another platform? Thanks!
---
Great idea. Let that greedy noob think twice before picking up the higher level's loot.
---
I mean i assume that all the automation shit around the region broke down and became unusable during the next hundred and seventy five years.
---
Mabey, but we do know military records did survive both in modus recognizing military personal coming down from dc and the miliary bots in fallout 4 on the ship recognizing nate and his rank.
---
Eat their livers with some cans of beans and a nice Nukashine
---
I have experienced this in the past when I just got off a few shots on the queen before she died.  Spoke to some more experienced individuals who had an explanation involving minimum damage done to the SBQ.  One of them said that you need to have enough damage to round _up_to_ 1%.  The explanation aligned with my experience, but I cannot confirm.
---
Hush leave my 10mm baby out of this
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
---
I really didnt think it did when i got it
---
Stable flux
---
*Definitely*
---
This is most likely due to a lack of damage. If you are in a party and you have a heavy damage dealer you should get loot from the body. But you may only get a 2 star piece and no flux/super stimpaks/repair kits from the event. If you are alone and don't do enough damage all you will get is the 2 star piece and no loot from the body.
---
Huh.
---
The best part about this story is that it's all true. I can tell this really happened to you. And kudos to you for giving into the ethereal alter reality that is role playing. You may have just coaxed me one step closer to the Appalachian wasteland.
---
I may have seen your camp yesterday. Did you build it open with brick walls? And lock your acid?
---
Thanks for not telling me that at the creamery!
---
I paid full price.  It's been a bumpy ride, but I think it's a decent game at this time.  Beth has made some great improvements.  No regerts here.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m getting.  I guess that explains it.   Kinda sucks because I’m chasing that bitch around and using tons of ammo.
---
I found it near the shopping plaza in the Mire once, and then it got attacked by a Deathclaw.
---
FFS... Even more content ripped from FO4, but now cash-only.
---
I don't think you bothered reading what I wrote. However, I did read what you wrote.
---
You're trying to diminish this issue. I'm saying there's evidence that it's not a small thing.
---
I call BS, if you’re within the nuke zone you get a warning on your screen
---
All but nocturnal.
---
Depends on what kind of support role you're looking to fill. If it's against something like the SBQ I'd say Suppressor's (reduces targets damage output by 20%).
---
I've been pretty successful as a vendor selling oddities. Not always super rare stuff, but thing people needs for badges, magazines, bobbleheads, uncommon mods, rare junk or apparel. Uncommon plans are a great seller when you come across them. Also noticed an uptick in sales after designing my shop area a little better. Bear arms, formula p, craftables in general that maybe not everyone has... I also rotate and reprice if some items aren't selling.
---
Also a word on pricing: you want to make money, but too high of prices means your stock will stagnate. Too low prices can also make so done think it may not be worth buying (especially in the case of cosmetic clothes).
---
Lastly, location.. try to pick somewhere will people will end up anyhow. Probably pretty obvious but you'd be surprised how much people seem to appreciate a little thought being put into camp placement, such as not building over your spawn point, or building someplace convenient yet unique.
---
QUAAAAAD!
---
No, mine's mostly wood except the main hallway, which is brick, and garage, which is warehouse. And I screwed up and set my camp just a little too far from the acid to set up an extractor.
---
oh yes... absolutely one of the coolest armors fallout has ever had IMO!  
---
I would love to learn some plans for this armor and see it turn black with the shadow mod!   
---
I have been wandering around with this armor forever despite it not being one of the best armors at all, purely of its looks.    
---
UPVOTE from me! needs love indeed
---
It Is He Who Walks beneath the roads!
---
while we are at it can we give them purchasable and or findable plans so we can build them ourselves instead of having to randomly find the pieces in vendors and event rewards? 
---
honestly every outfit and armor in the game should have plans you can find somewhere, it is super weird that only some of them do.
---
I'm saying the ratio is an unknown because the total people that don't complain are the unknown.
---
After your set up later in the game, repair kids are not really as useful as I'm already buffed out and have like 6 weapons on hand. Plus perks to increase durability.
---
Have you tried going to the workshop by the same name?
---
True
---
*Laughs in Power Armor*
---
Like the holotapes? Yea, they have a yellow glow. Legendary enemy corpses/meatpiles can have a red glow... 'cause they're hot.
---
It would be a cool ambient feature but It'd still be worth it to flip this onto my perk spread at certain times.
---
It would be so easy. Set up camp in some bushes, die with some good junk maybe bulked xD Spawn right back close and wait for the sucker.
---
eeeey cool!
---
Meh, I’m happy with my purchase. Played for 900+ hours since beta, never rage quit
---
Easy to not get new ones if your genes are starched.
---
Vendors are a thing. Trade menus allow you to view items now. Prices are easy to set.  
---
perhaps stupidity should remain painful. It is the only way some people learn anything.
---
Looks like the mood police say only positive comments are welcome when Bethesda tries reaching into our wallets for stuff that should have been included in a full-price, developer-admitted *unfinished, broken* "AAA" game.
---
Yesterday got a 3* suppressor cryo and a 3* instigating version
---
How much do you sell those for, if you don't mind my asking?  I usually sell my spare drugs to NPC vendors, but if players buy them, I can find something else to get my 1400 daily caps.
---
Mods?
---
Temp on could and gpu?
---
And what version of the driver are you running.
---
Also diable gforce experience. It is know to degrade games on what it thinks is a good fps. Not what the card can run
---
everywhere. Literally, every phase of going in to survival mode says beta.
---
What's the stats on weapon??
---
Are you selling this one?
---
Which perks increase durability?
---
I dunno but staircases frighten me atm.
---
I built a foundation and stacked two staircases on it to make a long staircase. It was uneven with the tower I was aiming it towards so I wanted to move it but picking up the foundation wouldn't take the stairs attached to it with it. So I stored the top staircase... but it refused saying it was connected to something that wouldn't be accessible... Which was the stairs below it... I relogged and did some other things but the 1 foundation + 2 stairs structure was completely unmodifiable. So I moved my whole Camp placement an inch to force store it.
---
I also accidentally placed a staircase inside a finished house against the wall and it wouldn't let me remove it (would make an object inaccessible which is a lie) or the floor it was attached or do anything with the roof.
---
A very common bug that happens when I'm building is the game suddenly telling me every item I select in UI and try to place is "not found" and I have to exit and re-enter the building menu.
---
Jumping instead of attaching a wire DRIVES ME INSANE.
---
I've had items I've tried to relocate just turn invisible/cease to exist forever till I relog and when I load back in it's where I moved it.
---
Turrets that get destroyed while siting on top of something, like a large purifier or roof will remain invisible and inactive when repaired till I store the item it was sitting on and place them back down.
---
Probably yes or a trade I’m in ps4
---
I just got my address confirmed so I assume after e3
---
I also have the high capacity, I know it doesn't carry over to the PA, but I would disagree on the consequence (-50 rads and -50 ER(?)) part of that. Since I have put it on, and run a nuke zone in my X-01 PA, my rads are through the roof, constantly having to pop radaway, wasn't like that prior to my backpack.
---
Weapon artisan for guns, and another one for melee. Getting them up to lvl 5 and weapon takes forever to break.
---
Damn, Xbox here, but thanks
---
Sooooo..... seems not a matter of stability. It's more they want you to have limited space so that you make choices on what's essential to survival. While it sucks, i do sort of see their point.
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/amp/bethesda-on-fallout-76-mods-selling-non-cosmetic-items-and-community-feedback/?__twitter_impression=true
---
I’ve never been over 4000 caps so this isn’t a problem for me
---
I would like an instigating hunter rifle to trade it with but can’t seem to find that weapon
---
Haven't played that much but played $60 worth for sure!
---
Spoiler alert everyone in the game is dead
---
This so much lol
---
Suddenly? No. Since release? Definitely.
---
Lmao you won't claim any workshops ever?
---
But yes if you want it I’ll be in later psn anthonybundy71
---
What vendor did he get those plans from?
---
Gunsmith for ranged weapons.
---
Makeshift warrior for melee weapons.
---
Both are int. Perks with 5 ranks.
---
Doesn't mean they did it right, you know? Without accountability, these are the garbage releases we get. Why is everyone ok with giving hard-earned cash for total crap-shoots that even the producer admits was broken from the start? There are literally laws in place to prevent that from happening.
---
I'm level 76 and for the first time today I got over 1300 caps
---
Same here. Crashes almost daily and tons of other “issues”, but I love it.
---
I usually put the regular psycho,buffout,mentats at 5-10 caps and the bufftatts ,calmex,fury,dad to stuff like that 15-20 if some ones wants a lot I do 5caps.. you can make more at a vender but I usually have a lot to sell anyway
---
Yes, yellow flight helmet, brown flight helmet, and red flight helmet
---
Same here. Probably 600 plus hours of play. Sure, sometimes it gets frustrating but overall I've enjoyed it. I don't think I've ever played a game as much
---
That’s true, however, I’m more pissy at another game that doesnt work at all barely, also by Bethesda... ESO, I guess that takes up all my rage at busted unplayable games
---
Yup I agree. Add more skins in the shop rather than bring old shit out. I think that nothing is exclusive in the game. So limited time means only for a brief moment and not ever again. The players like us that played since the beginning and even through all the bugs and glitches dont get to keep anything that will be recognized as fo76 veterans lol. Bets players didnt even get shit from playing. Bethesda is only looking for more ways to get money out of our wallets. But I'm done with spending. I'll still play but ain't buying shot from them anymore
---
Oh I was gonna check if I had one for you but I'm on xbox sorry dude
---
lol they discuss stash sizes,why it's the number it currently as, along with the fact that they do read the forums
---
If you read the Fallout Bible Maxson the 2nd was calling it the Brotherhood of Steel in a holotape that seems to have been cut but was intended to be in the game.  In the transcript that Chris Avellone provided of the holotape it was clear that it was the second Elder Maxson talking to his son the Elder in Fallout about his father and states that the Brotherhood of Steel is justly named.  This clearly implies that he didn't name it but his father, the original Elder Maxson did.  The tape also implies that there were scientists that survived.  
---
This tape may have been cut due to it causing a lore conflict as the first Elder Maxson died of cancer, not staying at the base to seal it as the tape implies but the implication as to who came up with the name of the Brotherhood is very clear, Chris Avellone himself had it as Roger Maxson naming the survivors the Brotherhood of Steel.  I will take the word of Chris Avellone as to who named it and who survived.  
---
If you need an "in-game" lore friendly reason I would say it's simple.  The Brotherhood in Fallout 1 didn't care as much about the preservation of knowledge and history in general as they did to preserve the knowledge of their armor and weapons, just look at Head Scribe Vree.  Just look at Sophia's tape as an example of how much they cared about general knowledge and history, by 2161 how they arrived at Lost Hills was more a myth and story then historical account. Not even 100 years after they arrived at Lost Hills they don't remember or know what really happened.  We can't really trust the records of the early Brotherhood of Steel unless they pertain to weapons and armor.
---
Well, as someone who has taken to nuking people, you can avoid being nuked by testing your spawn point to make sure it isn't in a foundation or under water. You can also avoid nuking if you don't sell anything over 2000 caps. Price gougers get nuked. Shitty spawn points get nuked. You've all been warned.
---
Beta*
---
I seen plenty of weird bugs but that one just takes the cake I didn't know they could ever move resource spawns around.
---
Xbox

I’d like to see an alien invasion or a synth invasion from the commonwealth.

I think that's better than my Poodle Skirt and glasses. That's my only claim to fame now besides the Easter Bunny mask!

---
Hey was making Chems. How the fuck was he suppose to know his camp was gonna be nuked if the pop-up doesn't appear while in the Chem menu? 🤔
---
Leave Cletus alone! :D
---
You need to deal at least 2% of anythings health to loot it. I saw that on a reliable source but cant find it.
---
Tldr do more damage to the queen
---
I imagine while i got to my camp and click on fix all. It's magic.
---
Yeah, and there's that.
---
Lucky. My game goes solid 60 until I go to any town where it drops to -2-5FPS such as Morgantown, Charleston, Whitespring, watoga... (-2 fps means it takes like 2 seconds before image changes)
---
It's worth $7.  
---
There are still bugs but nothing game breaking.  It's fun with friends but then again, pretty much anything is :P
---
$150 here, but 930hrs in so I’ve definitely got my money’s worth
---
Does a Yao Guai stagger in the mire?
---
Dang - I've been running defiance every time I get online - still no deathclaw hides for me. 
---
Sad thing is I remember finding some in the past before the badge challenges were a thing....
---
Not really needed imo. Legendary effects are already op for what they do. Yes quite a few could be reworked to make them viable against the,aa, bloody, exploding. But not to give free perk cards.
---
I've done this a few times when I was holding ledgendaries. Just make sure to write down 2 or three peoples gamerttags from your server
---
Best daily day in a long while!
---
That is basically what I do the entire game...
---
I actually completed yesterday's challenge of killing a glowing enemy in a nuke,by killing a random scorched in a nuke.
---
Now i remember that glowing behemoth is a nuke only enemy,so i'm starting to believe that every enemy inside a nuke is technically a glowing one,even if its name and appearance aren't.
---
If it’s any consolation, this is like my thousandth time through (possible hyperbole). :)
---
Ive bought games for 60 bucks that had zero bugs/glitches that were way worse than FO76.  No one forced anyone to buy the game.  Ive been playing this game and no others from the beginning, i love every aspect of it.  The bugs and glitches sometimes work for me, so its win-win
---
4 from footlockers(pioneer camp, under Larry's meat and go, don't remember the rest) 1 from a "netal box" in whitespring laundry building.
---
Nah. I've had too much fun
---
What weapon are you using? Improvised weapons don't count towards it.
---
As I recall, the US government knew about that facility and utilized them as well, to drum up additional fear about impending Chinese invasion; propaganda basically, since they posed minimal threat.
---
I think the gov't had discovered that facility and shut it down, but then reactivated it for said Liberator purposes. Which is also more than likely how MODUS knew about it in the first place. 
---
*\[I'm 97% certain all I've said is accurate, I just can't remember where the terminal was that I read it. Might've been somewhere during the entrance quest to the Enclave, or perhaps inside the Enclave bunker. Either way, if I could remember I'd have double-checked first heh\]*
---
DONT TREAD ON ME!!
---
No not the giggles!!!
---
Accidental buy, wanted love kill laugh, so I'm rocking them now, meh.
---
Death claw. Got the critter one sorted, my mistake there. Trying a sword now
---
The two spawn points are right by the front door and in knee deep water right in front of stairs to the pond dock. Only a couple 3 star items with a couple decent perks are being sold for over 1k caps. The rest is mostly plans sold at or below initial price.
---
Did they fix the bug finally?
---
no problem :)
---
What a missed opportunity should have had the insult bot note
---
No giggles allowed, only sighs
---
Love the scout armor but yeah. I have four mods sitting in my inventory because I have no idea which part they go on.
---
""We read the forums," Gardiner says, "we read the comments, we understand there's been disappointment with the game, and there's also been problems. So we're trying our best to react in smart and fast enough ways, both smart and quickly, to those concerns.""
---
...By ignoring those comments and suggestions.
---
Still no Queue crafting (have to craft one item at a time)
---
Tab is (menu) Escape, except when it is not.
---
Multiple actions are tied to one key, and the actions can't separately be changed.
---
A and D to cycle menu left and right, except when it is Z and C, and sometimes only arrow keys.
---
Want to join a team invite from a friend?  Open Social Menu, Click on Friend, Move mouse over to... OOPS, you moved the mouse up or down a couple of pixels! Start over...  Click Friend, move mouse over to... OOPS! you moved the mouse a couple pixels again.  Start Over...
---
Hold E to trade.  (Other player backs away a pixel)  Suddenly, you are now exiting your Power Armor...  Real fun when in a nuke zone...
---
Stash Box has 20 left in space.  Attempt to put in heavy gun weighing "18" in Stash, get "Stash is full" message.  Gun really weighs more, Perk or such lowers weight of Gun while in inventory.  Is it too difficult to list both weights all the time to player?  Weight and Weight after bonuses?
---
In every other game, the base stats of items is displayed, and then bonuses are shown separately, usually as a total.  In Fallout76, its a mystery the customers get to try to figure out. 
---
It is clear to me that the developers are not gamers.  The Developers are baffled as to why many players complain about not wanting to conform to the limited view of how the developers think the game should be played. "We wanted the players to worry about what to carry with them and to keep little in their Stashes" (paraphrased badly).
---
Or, as Bill Gates once famously said, "No one will need more than 640K RAM".
---
Having a background in programming, I fail to see why many issues are not easily addressed.  The only reason I can think of is that the Executives think that paying to fix Fallout76 is not worth the investment.  Fixing the game will not bring in a lot of new players to purchase the game.  They will only do the bare minimum to fulfill whatever contracts or road maps they have, because they do not want to be sued for producing and abandoning a "lemon" product too soon.
---
I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the Fallout games (except that awful console game for Playstation).   Fallout76 could have been spectacular but the Execs fucked it all up.
---
If this were a meal from McDonald's, the Fries would be warm, mushy, and way over salted; the Big Mac barely cooked with way too much sauce or lettuce, the bottom bun would be in the middle, the middle bun on the bottom (or Top!); and the soda they handed you was the wrong flavor, way too much ice, and also flat.  
---
Does Bethesda even do any Q.A.?
---
Wholesome af. Thanks for sharing!

Synths haven’t been created yet, nor the Institute.
---
&gt;  he is essentially someone with massive ptsd stuck in a room that was made rather than born
---
So an intelligent being that is artificial?
---
I think this would be better as a separate item slot (ring perhaps) like the class mods from the borderlands games. Overall a cool idea though.
---
They stack, all 3 of them.  Just like lockpick does
---
I saw someone with the Atom Cats paint last night. Said he bought the plans off someone. Is this out now? Part of another secret scavenger hunt perhaps?
---
Start them high, if after a day they don't sell, lower price. Then just keep doing that, they will eventually sell.
---
It’s a good game.  Get over your fucking whining.

r/fallout34

If I remember correctly, Agent Grey ( Enclave field operative) said there were Chinese stragglers they killed off, and they seem slightly surprised about it (something along the lines of “we found out that the Chinese had an operation among momma dolces”) in one of the Whitesprings security logs on the terminals scattered throughout the Enclave bunker. So I’m not sure they knew about it. Can’t be sure though, 
---
And a terminal in the facility addresses the Chinese engineers realizing its not much of a threat, and redesigning it into its current form, with the spinning blades and such, so it can engage targets in melee combat.
---
I use a Bloodied with only one rank of Heavy Gunner and can do visible damage on the SBQ. It’s amazing (but man it eats ammo!)
---
Learn to read.
---
Yes, eats ton of damn ammo
---
For vending machines there needs to be a small cap overflow.
---
It’s dumped if you log out but,  if you reach the cap limit while logged in it should hold like,  5k until you claim it or log out.
---
Cletus Wickkibal
---
I posted the same problem a few days ago. I think whoever said above that it has to do with renaming is probably right.
---
I have lost 2 pcs of 3star armor at the scrp machine. Aaarrrgh! I like the ZZ renamed idea and I'm also thinking about maybe just dropping them off in my stash before I even go.
---
There are my to go PAs for the same reason.
---
I have found several animals that I tamed at earlier levels in the same spots I used to. Now I only ever see pacify, level 197, 12 charisma, 25% budget free at camp. Its definitely not working for me, and I have been pretty much only be pet searching for Grodd knows how many hours
---
I made a new character too. But kept getting slaughtered as soon as i got to flatwoods. That is what turned me off survival.
---
so if i have rifleman and master rifleman they stack to 40% then?
---
Are the mutations Egg head or Bird bones worth getting on a low strength and endurance build?
---
Or will the stats go too low?
---
If you even think about nuking some place that might remotely house our beloved pet frogs, we will look for you. 
---
We will find you.
---
And we will kill and/or eat you.
---
Yeah deathclaw is classed as improvised, sword will work.
---
Read the cards.  Each has 3 stars and tells you what percentage they are when full
---
Building became awful after a recent patch. The game fights you every step of the way.
