Yeah I’ve got two of these for workshops. Works great. Mount turrets to the edges.

We are not talking about the designers or the programmers. But every large company has a CEO, CFOs, and other financial strategists. Part of their jobs is to maximize profits. So, here is the basic strategy. I posted this before so I'll just copy and paste from my other post.
---

---
It all comes down to money. Bethesda knows that there are two types of players. Those with disposable time and those with disposable money. They also know that usually those with disposable money have jobs/families/etc and usually don't have alot of disposable time. So, this is a strategy used to get those with disposable money in order to buy atoms to level up quickly. So they will not put in additional ways of leveling up without players paying money.
---
As far as the people with disposable time, many of them do not also have disposable money. However, by having them log in every day, it makes fallout 76 look like it is doing well to stockholders. It makes it look like the game is very active with a dedicated playerbase.
---
So, either way, it looks good for bethesda to implement this strategy.
---
People are talking about that problem more than this one!
---
Just look where the center of tour screen is also you can turn on first person crosshairs
---
Don't be salty. They most likely awarded the 1000 SCORE at 3/5 completion, and it looked like you didn't get any when it hit 5/5. 
---
From help.bethesda.net:
---
Why does it look like I'm not getting S.C.O.R.E. points in Fallout 76?
---
We are investigating an issue where some Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 completed instead of 5 of 5 completed. In these cases, you are still getting your S.C.O.R.E., but you have already received it by the time you have actually completed the Challenge, so it will not display an updated score when you complete 5/5 on the Challenge. This will be resolved in a future update. 
---
Please note that sometimes the UI may take a few moments to update. 
---
If you are experiencing an issue where you are not getting your S.C.O.R.E. points other than the above mentioned reasons, please submit a Feedback report here under "Quests". Make sure to include screenshot(s) or video of the S.C.O.R.E. and Challenge that you are reporting.
---
we just don’t know for those nuclear winter limited time events. I would assume so but who knows. The level 1-100 NW awards are still there. 
---
FYI there is a bug right now where some players apparently are getting the Halloween and Christmas NW awards in NW if you want to try to get them.
---
Some players are extremely impatient and can't wait more than 3 seconds, I usually either speed up my buying or just stop and let them in. 
---
Having said that I was once in a queue of 3 players waiting to use the vendor and we all just patiently waited in line lol
---
Make the machine a thing you can transfer ammo into, and get an item tokens in return. Then spend those item tokens at the terminal imo.
---
No it is literally a bunch of lemurs locked in a room check the job listisngs
---
It took me 15 attempts to get it to drop, then I got it twice in a row. I’ve been farming it still for the impostor sheepsquatch outfit as well as proc’ing it for something to do, to waste 2k when I’m getting close to limit, and because events are fun now everyone is chasing them. 
---
I must’ve done it another 20 times and haven’t seen the plan again at all. I did get the outfit though.
---
Hmm I must be missing them, cant say ive been looking that hard either. Its just crazy nothing has been done yet, that has to affect a mass majority of the people. I would think 🤔
---
I subscribe to the belief that this is just a game, and people spent money to make said game. So those people need some sort of financial gain in order to continue to keep the company running, and more or less, to keep their families fed.
---
At the end of the day, it’s a fucking game that is free to play. If you are bored, annoyed, or otherwise not interested in playing then by all means play something else. 
---
Stop complaining. Start playing (something else).
---
I havent ever launched a nuke, it seems like such a pain and huge task after reading the post about it. I've just been server hopping trying to find any server with a nuke anywhere but fissure site prime
---
I actually played last night and one person PVP’d with me. We have thumbs up to each other at the end. 
---
I wouldn’t like one bad experience sour the entire event.
---
been playing it since launch, bailed after the first fasnacht, came back for wastelanders.  and yes, things have been worse, things have also been better.
---
the fact is that while it isn't snowballing, it has remained a steady stream of issues.  the world and gameplay is fun, but underlying it all, is an unadulterated sense of lethargy.
---
a good example of all this is that i'm far from the only person getting screwed out of score, and do any of you think bethesda is going to do something to fix that besides doing a hotfix in a few weeks or waiting until the next proper patch?
---
i'm not after stuff like those ddos idiots, something more like a combined effort at hammering their offices with envelopes and boxes filled with bottlecaps.
---
the world is one of the best they've made thus far, the gameplay when it works is really fun.  but that's where everything is breaking down.  i'm on ps4.  i don't have any options past crossing my fingers when the game isn't working.
---
i paid for the game, paid for fallout 1st, paid for atoms, the LEAST i should be given is a product that works most of the time.  there were a few high points, but of late, it had been issue after issue, and there's no way out of it.
---
i like the game, i want to play the game, but it is not within my power to make it any more functional.
---
No this is a similar but seperate problem, this is caused by playing in Adventure mode during the time of which the daily reset occurs!
---
Mate, read your own thread topic, then think why tf you even wanna play this game, when they are manipulating you all like this.
---
GaaS games, Live service games, need to die in a fire.
---
I read just the front-page here of this sub, and it's all about grind-this, that, etc. atoms or whatever being removed, etc. all to get your money.
---
Skinner box, etc. All of it needs to die in a fire.
---
\- Signed, Fallout lover since 2 in 98, that's never played 76 at all, because of these reasons.
---
You want Beth to change? stop playing this shit or supporting it at all, and lets get back some quality Fallout games.
---
Thanks.
---
Like, I know that. I just can’t do it. I didn’t know about first person crosshairs. Thank for that tip. XD
---
Then honestly, thank you. I am not being sarcastic. When people with money are able to pay like this, it makes it so that people without money are able to enjoy free content.
---
There are a ton all around flatwoods on all the porches and in the trailers. All of the survivor stories.
---
Dude, that’s crazy. I will totally take you up on that. Will FR you when I get on in a bit. Thanks. You’re the real mvp. XD
---
Mails systems in MMOs tend to be a furnace of dupe glitches. Given Bethesda’s track record with allowing faulty code through their QA I’d bet they are terrified of implementing something soooo ripe for fuckups.
---
And with feedback you don't get a papertrail and ticket number to keep track of any communication!
---
Better than me - I received an email saying to follow the troubleshooter if I am having issues with a quest, and to reset the game! Uhh...
---
I have replied explaining that this was not the issue!
---
Just believe in your self and if not believe in the me that believs in you
---
No. I literally don't know what you were asking. I'm guessing because you said 'clearly you understand' it's because it was one of my latter two suggestions.
---
(Also, *I* personally find it baffling you think I need to be enraged to issue an insult on an online forum, but that's a different issue entirely.)
---
I'm personally aware that the game is very grindy in general, but it was a sort of calming, meditative kind of grind imo. The sort I like. With the current SCORE system, it feels like you're on a ticking clock. With the way the system is time-gated, it feels like you're doing it "wrong" if you're not actively seeking to increase your SCORE if you want to progress on the board. 
---
I do like having little daily incentives in place. I don't mind working for caps or bullion or cosmetics instead of Atoms. I'm aware this is a grind. I don't mind some grinding. I do mind the amount of grinding required to get to level 100 without money.  
---
I am rambling because I don't know if any of this has answered your questions, because you have yet to be direct. I think daily incentives are good. I think some grinding is fine. I'm not sure yet if I prefer the old system's rewards to the new one's. It's the amount/style of grinding required to keep attaining rewards I take umbrage with, because if you missed a day previously, it wasn't an issue, but now it's a grievous block to your progress.
---
Yeah, well since they locked my ticket I can't really get through to a person...
---
sweet melt yo
---
Yeah. Site prime isn’t a good site for that. 
---
Gotta go elsewhere. If you fight the queen sometimes you get stable cobalt I think.
---
I'm getting off soon, but if I'm gone when you get on, I'll get you tomorrow.
---
dunno what kind of garbage luck you're having.... but fallout 4 was actually the fallout the performed best out of all the bethesda fallouts.  unless i go banana balls on pumping in mods, it has been very stable on my xbox one when i had one, and my ps4 and laptop currently.
---
Half the advanced builds in CAMP are literally all about doing exploits to have objects literally fuse into one another and all seems fine so far. 
---
Only way to get a terminal on a desk or toolboxes in your work shelf in th garage.
---
I've found if the sh\*t ones are dropping then change server or try later.
---
Are you on that part of the main story? My first launch was a lot of fun. It’s just a dungeon filled with robots, it’s not that bad.
---
Man, I hated that Wendigo Cave.  Died many times with 2 other players helping.
---
You don’t do 200 damage a hit (not factoring in adrenaline or sneak both of  which are currently broken)? Get the rifleman perks, hardened/prime receiver,  and Bloodied works best.
---
Definitely do Morgantown. How many flux you need?
---
Weird. So changing servers seems to help
---
I definitely have been robbed of at least 2000
---
I participate on one and did not knew was an pvp event till the guy start shot me, I did kill him in 2 swings and he just stayed killing the mobs props to him I hate pvp and would leave if he killed me.
---
That's awkward. Is rewording and sending a second ticket an option?
---
im being greedy, and hoarding mine for the double XP event
---
That’s the only cobalt there I’m afraid. You need to go to nuked Morgantown for that, there’s some at whitespring but not loads. 
---
People are not nuking anything but fissure prime these days because of the event challenges and the XP/chance at wendigo.
---
Hahahaha poor innocent gamer
---
Since you said that ure already a stealth build, I doubt you spend much time standing around. I think u would be better off with cavalier for those moments you need to rush to a new location to regain stealth mode. Prob be beneficial more often then just standing around when being swarm by a mob.
---
Any complaint about score gets filtered through the bot from what I've seen, they just assume it is the weekly challenge early completion bug.
---
I have money. I can
---
my problem currently is related to the shit gear I have on that toon..
---
once i get max lvl armor and a good furious lever.. its nightie night for that bastard.. lol
---
Ah, so you're a smug jackass. Gotcha.
---
Only tried one and got furious too. I’ll see how it goes. My current bane is SS gear. I keep getting Endless weightless for some reason.
---
I’m on xbox one. I’ve been looking for the mire’s healing salve recipe for almost a year :/
---
thank you guys for your efforts! amazing job!
---
I don’t think it’s possible to be halfway through yet lol
---
Step 1: Activate Solo mode
---
Step 1a (Optional): Vote for Morgantown and equip Aqua Boy/Girl. Hide in the bottom of the lake up north for as long as possible. 
---
Step 2: Find/relocate to a bush or shrubbery and crouch in it. Go into 3rd person to adjust yourself as well as allow you to look around without shifting your character. Try to conceal yourself as best as you can. I would actually suggest using specific cosmetics to camouflage yourself, the Ghille Suit works the best but I've also found success with the Free States Revolutionary outfit and Mountain Scout uniform. Anything with a dark color scheme and is preferably green or brown. Using the basic vault suit will give you away.
---
Step 3: Only move towards the circle in the last 30 seconds before it starts to close, you can even start moving once the closure begins. Moving as late as possible means you're less likely to be spotted from behind as others move inwards. Stay in the outside of the circle, and again, hide in bushes.
---
I have placed within the top 10 consistently using this method, and have even won once due to the enemy team dying to a Scorchbeast. Placing in the top 10 adds a substantial xp boost, so aim for that at the very least.
---
Remember, you get more xp the longer you survive. Kills are comparatively much less important xp wise.
---
Yeah I'm on "I am become death" and I'm lvl 81 so I'm pretty sure i can do it solo, i just read the post about launching a nuke and got scared about how much of a pain it would be.
---
Reviving players is super easy if you have teammates that are also looking to get it done.  just ask while waiting in the lobby and pick a spot along the edge of the map to spawn in at, then take a step into the fire until you're down and then repeat until everyone is done.
---
I dont want to be a party pooper but bethesda will not return us our score points. They just dont give a fuck.
---
Like I finished the weekly gather building materials and got no points. Happened with something else too
---
congrats on being carried i guess?
---
3k for me...
---
Yup. Took around 50-60 rolls to even get a bloodied. Never got a junkies at all. Plasma caster took 4 rolls to get at bloodied and the service armor took 5-6 rolls to get bolstering. Might be do to bad luck but it felt odd.
---
I feel like ss buttressed doesn't need more DR, for non bloodied I like lifesaving or mixed racial sets.
---
I only need one more stable cobalt flux I'm just trying to make the decontamination arch.
---
I was indeed
---
Get a sniper rifle if at all possible and pick them off one at a time from a long distance
---
From what I've seen they've only admitted to the weekly challenge bug where you get the score early, I've not seen any response about the daily bug other than "we don't award missing score"!
---
Only glitch I've seen is dailies I keep in my tracked list are carrying over into the next days daily. Maybe Im wrong and it's supposed to be that way idk.
---
First time this happened to me I must have spent an hour looking for the random NPC playing the music at the Robco plant. 
---
Wasn't till I gave up and heard it at my camp that I realized what was going on.
---
Thanks for the tip I'll keep fighting her every chance I get
---
Yeah lol I mean screws and springs would also be good ones to keep large amounts of but stuff like cloth or glass shards are hardly ever used. Like when's the last time you used cloth? I bet you cant remember.
---
No one should be sitting out any of the NW challenges really, almost all of them are easy as shit.
---
At worst you're hiding in a bush for thirty minutes or you actually have to try killing people.
---
the most mine has been dressed down was the wildman rags to match me in the king grognak outfit.  
---
\*officially\* at least.  more than once i've fast traveled or logged in to find her in her skivvies, despite the assigned outfit being assigned.
---
couldn't get her to put the outfit back on until i assigned a different one and then went back to the first one.
---
not that there aren't any perverts out there, but i wager many of the nekkid allies are from the game goofing up.
---
Sorry also storage is fixed to 800, though building size is level based... I think? It’s been a long time since level 10 lol sorry
---
Oh yea you should be able to solo no problem. Probably will take 20 minutes. Just need to have the keycard and code handy. You can find nuke codes online
---
whatevs.. Imma stop posting in here after this..
---
 
---
so get your last word in.. and then you can continue to banter will all of the other non smug people lining up to discuss your deep and thoughtful topic..
---
Have A Nice Day..
---
Good point. Bugs in fo76, news flash!
---
Rule 10.
---
Yep rose worked for me too
---
You guys are getting mini guns?
---
I did most of trades on ps4 communities like "Fallout 76 I" or "Fallout 76 Trading OutPost", but it's not that hard in here if you have the right price like 1c for steel, 2/3c for lead and 5/6c for acid.
---
So far I got 20k leads, 65k steels, 12k acids and a tons of other like nuclear material, plastic, aluminum ...etc.
---
It would be cool to have a courier system where players could deliver letters to camps for caps and experience.
---
That's not good. Maybe a rewrite using 'the new point system  as wording' instead of SCORE? Or sonething similar.
---
friend just rolled a Bffr drwa and I've got a V5050
---
For now.
---
Anyone who doesnt play daily is going to struggle when the higher levels are over 3000 score for each rank up. Assuming the +25 continues.
---
Don't get me wrong I've been playing daily for a while but I really hate the unfairness of it. Someone who can play for 1-2 hours every day will get to 100 no problem. Anyone who can't play every day is heavily penalised, even if they played for 14 hours straight on the weekends. 
---
It's borderline toxic of a game to require daily play in this way, and will be causing problems for people with addictive pre-dispositions.
---
Nope I have a gama gun kills you trash in 1 or 2 shots I love when trash like you join me and my friends we start shearing sunkissed and one with rad sponge gives you a huge wile I spam stims to heal you trash can players
---
Could you add an edit to your post mentioning the workaround for people to make note of the reset time and log out before it occurs? This might help people avoid it in future.
---
Too many commas; I can’t get behind this.
---
I use cloth when making gunpowder but that's about it.
---
wait, there are granades in fallout 76 
---
/s 😜
---
It’s been happening to me all along. Sometimes I completed one, it will mark off its complete, but I get nothing. At least one section a day. I’ve lost thousands already, and that’s on top of the stuff I miss just because I despise NW.
---
Oh yeah gunpowder lol, ok fine what about glass? Guaranteed you haven't used it unless youre repairing laser weapons
---
Stay in the forest. The enemies are not as tough.
---
Good point. I'll see if I can find the correct info on here.
---
Besides a shitty revolver with a scope attached that’s about the same size as the gun itself I haven’t find anything like a sniper but I will look for it👍🏻
---
Trickle That Shit Down Yo
---
Get the silo holotape it tells you when you can use the silos again
---
The ammo workshop? 
---
You were kinda asking for an asshole to show up.
---
I was actually gonna delete this soon as it was clear there isn't an answer to my general yet so there's really no point having it up. Letting you know so you don't feel obliged to keep checking for another 'sweet melt'. ;) 
---
Have a nice day, too!
---
Had the same issue at your same level,I kept getting killed at the airport.My suggestions are: 1.follow some guides online,I suggest angryturtle "strong start" video
---
2.get a friend(that's how I solved it)
---
3.power level a bit at events using public teams
---
PSN is dixiemomma1577. I’ll give you one to finish
---
Try Free States bunkers
---
On PC don't get the black screen but can never reliably fast travel without giving it three or more tries, clicking slowly, waiting between clicks, running about etc.
---
I really don't think they know how to fix this one. Been with us for months, ever since that cool off period when enemies are near by was added to the game.
---
Even those weak enemies are giving me a hard time if they’re more than two🙈
---
Best one.
---
I just want less ‘clean’ objects to get for my camp they all seem waayyy too clean for a post apocalyptic world ..i mean i get we’re supposed to be rebuilding but the junk walls and floors in fallout 4 blended in SO well (also i know 76 needs the atom shop to keep going but it wouldn’t hurt to add in some new plans in game for buildings every now and then)
---
Awesome. I’m on pretty often so nbd. Appreciate it tons. Enjoy your weekend! :D catch ya when I catch ya! :D
---
Another bug is if you hold onto the small supply package you don't get the medium one. I was gonna hold onto them as an emergency scrap because they weigh nothing but apparently i can't get the medium one now.
---
Can't you just check the the missle silo holotape to see the cool down? I'm not 100%
---
Baffles me that they added so many arbitrary restrictions to camp building. Can't have people having too much fun, or a thing other than box buildings
---
Tell me more about this "fatsnatch" masks.
---
I actually move quite a bit of bulk junk in my vendors lead, acid, springs, screws all sell pretty fast, even if I price them at a higher value then I’d get for them from the robo vendors
---
I was offered like 200 stimpaks in the first player camp I had wandered into, but I never like taking handouts in video games so I ended up rejecting them. Appreciated the gesture though.
---
It’ll be interesting to see what the brotherhood think of the SS when they arrive ?
---
Hunting rifle modified will get you there
---
I’d upvote but it’s currently at a 69 upvotes so gotta take the little victories my man.
---
Oh Jesus Christ no.  Just no no no no no.
---
Steel, lead and wood should NEVER be touching your stash as they're the EASIEST things to just collect on an as needed basis.  Hitting a single super mutant is 20 steel, wood is a free fast travel to 76 rummaging through the forest or a paid fast travel to Watoga and hitting the beaver dams and Lucky Hole provides more lead than any sane person ever needs in one sitting.
---
I'd recommend the Pioneer Scouts questline. You are given a backpack that can help increase carry weight, fair warning it's a lot of grinding though which will take time. It's also possible to get an upgrade for it to have an armored backpack which really helps with defense.
---
I agree it shouldnt be easy to hit max level, but it should be fair. 
---
Anyone who can get on daily should be fine, but someone who can only play every other day, or 1-2 sessions a week, will struggle massively without some serious marathon xp/event grinding. 
---
You could probably hit the dailies and weeklies playing 2 hours per day, so that's 21k score (roughly). But if you can only play once a week and do all the weeklies and that days dailies you're short roughly 12k. That's alot of score to make up, even if you play for 14 hours straight (same playtime as 2hrs per day). That's 1.2 million xp  or 6000 highest level supermutants (with int buffs).
---
Make sure to place it because Bethesda will probably remove it
---
Might be worth leaving it overnight, see if a daily reset cures it.
---
Please look at the inspect option in the Atomic Shop for the Veteran Oufit, Mountain Scout hat. It says it's part of the Veteran Outfit.
---
Yeah make sure team fill is off if you do that.
---
Tenderizer would probably be the better of the 2
---
That's 2am (AEST) for the Aussies. Thanks for the tip!
---
for the second question: nope. heal away, as long as starched genes is on
---
That would be great. I'm on PS4.
---
Thanks. I got one near Resin (directly opposite my camp) so nice and convenient.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah but I dont want to repair 2 weapons then have to fast travel to repair an armor piece lol. 100 is just for convenience sk that I never have to actually go looking for it. Wood is because I like changing my camp, it's up to you if you want less wood. Again, it's the convenience of never having to actually go looking for it. As for lead, I put that there because of a thing I do with ammo, I'll take it off though
---
I was thinking about something similar to this the other day: having a ‘notice board’ system where players can place a board in their camps, and other visiting players can write notes (in the style of the ones we find in game) to ‘stick’ to that board
---
National Socialist reasons
---
I will have to try it!
---
Events: Free range, project paradise, awol, surface to air, leader of the pack and any horde 
---
Places to search for legendarys: West tek, Whitespring, Charleston capital building and my favourite spot cranberry bog
---
There are actually several unusued ATX mailboxes in the files:

leader of the pack in the forest.. 3 legendary mobs every time.. it procs often
---
Same here
---
Cobalt can be found on trees outside areas of Whitesprings. Northeast and east of train station.
---
No mods for consoles, sorry buddy.
---
I was the same way, especially after realizing they put atom shop stuff on sale. I would grind those dailies and grab all kinds of cool and items. I'd be okay to smack a couple extra dollarydoos on there to get a bigger item. 
---
Now? Idc. This week's atom shop update was meh, Flyboy is cool yeah but there are no sale items rn and everything is lasting for way too long. 
---
But it was what Bethesda wanted, they knew it was too easy to get atoms.
---
Int does not give bonus XP in Fallout 76. Int affected XP gains in fallout 4, but this definitely did not carry over.
---
There is a market for others, just gotta price them right. But you are right, it’s mostly junkies and bloodied that you make bank on. Others like furious and AA sell pretty well too.
---
u/LadyDevann u/Valseek u/lonevaultwanderer
---
As a rifleman I can't decide, I benefit from rifles so logical yes, but shotgun reduces damage so I could kill stronger enemies easier, without dying. Any advice there?
---
Nice!
---
I use locks to keep allies out of places I don't want them, because they're inconsiderate asses. But I'll generally leave my workshop area open.
---
I don't know why but I hardly ever see free range shown when I'm on. Thanks for the suggestions, though.
---
I think every fallout has promoted old songs so much that it no only increases those song sales but also increases the cost to use those songs in a movie or game.
---
Maybe some of the returning songs are cheap to use or a multiple use deal was made. 
---
And yes it is a good song, big gun is great as well
---
fair enough. there are just lots of other factors like well rested, meat stew etc and i lose track.
---
Yes it absolutely does. I've been playing for a year and am level 717, trust me it does... If you don't believe so, go kill a Level 68 Super Mutant Warlord and see how much XP you get. Then pop a Berry Mentats and do it again... Tada.
---
I have seen a lot of the hordes pop up but not as much of the leader of the pack. I'll keep a lookout though, thanks.
---
the spawns are great for farming
---
The problem is I'm not sure that's the answer. My partner was on XB at exactly the same time as I was on PC. We were both sitting on the picnic table outside the Wayward, waiting to level up our new characters.  The dailies loaded in, the XB was fine but mine on PC had auto-completed.
---
Woah there buddy this is a family website!
---
Yeah the airport was a nightmare.
---
Ok thank you I will look into this. Hopefully I can someone make believe that its not a bad game as it’s always stated but well see😅
---
If you only have time to play once or twice a week then you shouldn’t expect to get all the rewards. I get to play for a couple hours at night after I get the kids to bed, 5-6 days a week. It’s my hope to get to around 75
---
Man, you people are so over dramatic. You act as if you are entitled to everything for free.
---
Not dumb questions. You're obviously still learning the mechanics of the game.
---
1. Legendaries "in the wild" are random but certain places tend to have a higher chance of spawning one. Whitesprings, West Tec, Sunny Top, Watoga buildings.The best thing to do though is do the events that have a guaranty legendary.

2. As long as you have Starched Genes on you cannot loose your mutation. You can take Radaway and go through a decontamination shower to completely get rid of your rads.
---
Happened to me 1 time and my son twice. We were both upset. Not sure what can be done.
---
Whoever gets there next gets to save a card, run enough silos and karma will even it out for you.  
---
You can buy the "missile silo state holotape" and check it before you launch to avoid this
---
Alright gonna look into this as soon as I get home😁🙏🏻
---
I've been robbed of about 3000 score in total since the season started, hope they fix it soon.
---
Which many of us wont xD
---
Can't build if you're maxed!
---
Todd Howard hates you and loves your money.
---
I do the same, but in addition my vendors are inside a room with no door facing windows for people to access them, once I hit 25k caps I kill the power and change the windows to solid walls so people can’t access them at all.
---
Pretty much
---
How do people go about passing caps between characters? I’d imagine you’d need a friend but I never even thought about doing that
---
Thanks, I’ll do that
---
Are those the only ones you’re missing?  I have a mule with extra plans, I checked and don’t have them, but have many others, so wondering if I could still be of some help?
---
I'm on PS4 and it auto completed, it's not happening to everyone true, but since I've been stopping my playtime a few minutes before the reset and returning 5 minutes after, its been fine. The only thing linking players who it has affected that I have seen is all of them were playing while it reset, yes it won't effect everyone but this is a safety measure to help mitigate the issue.
---
I would share cards, but they decided to nerf Magnetic Personality, so I can no longer share my useful cards.
---
I’m curious, what about it made it difficult for you?
---
Unfortunately. I hope some more user-friendly changes are included in Season 2.
---
My point is that it would be the same amount of play time in total. Why does Bethesda need people to play 2 hours a day, as apposed to the same amount of time in one big chunk. Why should 14 hours over 7 days be so heavily incentivised above 14 hours over 1 or 2 days?
---
Holy shit that's amazing
---
I thought it was supposed to be that public team members couldn't do anything in your camp ... Including build anything. Fairly sure I read that in the patch notes. 🧐
---
People aren’t coming by camps a lot right now anyway. Because all people care about right now is the garbage battle pass junk. And unfortunately there isn’t any daily challenge that says “buy from another player’s vendor”.
---
You have budget left?
---
Something strange is going on then as I definitely didn’t place that many small letters
---
Wrong they cant build random stuff in your camp in a public team only in private teams you can so what happened to you was someone in a private team with you
---
Yeah a tiny bit well not anymore
---
Must have been then
---
People buy power armor mods
---
Weird i tried to build in a friend camp on a ojblic team lastnight and it wouldnt let me
---
&gt;At worst you're hiding in a bush for thirty minutes 
---
Ah but that is thirty minutes of my life I would have gladly spent doing anything else. Forcing Adventure mode players to enter into NW is beyond the pale as far as I'm concerned. Shame on you BGS, have you no honor? Rhetorical question of course...
---
Will it be worth the grind? I already got a plan for a small backpack but the unbelievable increase of 5 which is the same increase which every of my armorparts with pockets gives me is just a joke to me🙈
---
Thanks, I already have it I did check and all silos were available?
---
That is way too level headed and thoughtful for reddit...especially about FO76. Please stop it. I was under the impression that this was a tool for bitching only.
---
People like weapons and armour in vendors. I sell a LOT of stuff in mine. And usually once you get someone there. Someone else turns up. And then someone else sees a couple of people at one camp and they turn up. Next thing you know... PARTYYYYYY. Now i'm not saying you should put some crappy legendaries in your vendor just to get your numbers up.. but.. you should.
---
In my experience mods very rarely sell. I stopped stocking them a long time ago. 
---
last night i had 5 people in my camp. I had an actual queue for the vendors. And i wanted to get off.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks!
---
Server hop west-tek
---
I can confirm that Halloween, Winter and Survivor unlocks are dropping. Just got the Fur lined Jacket and Jeans today, which took 14,000 XP to get.
---
Ive personally tested that and all you can do is highlight stuff you cant build so someones fking with you xD
---
Honestly I have no idea having never done it. I would’ve thought you couldn’t do it solo no, hence why it’s too much trouble for me. 
---
Most I’ve done is transfer gear from character to character on private world using suitcase at train station.
---
For a streaming game radio there isn't many song tracks
---
Probably
---
I guess we were kind of over saturated with events in the past which led to no-one caring about them ..? So in a way it creates scarcity or at least it makes it more of an actual EVENT rather than minutely occurrence ?
---
The silos were available it is me who needed a cool down. Just annoying. Glad someone will get a free card though.
---
oh cool mine is Sparkachu (i think). We’re pretty well off by now, we just finished finding a full set of power armor and the plans for the excavator suit
---
Quite a bit of cobalt around Whitesprings in fact. Sap on trees near the station and on the hill above the bunker, and beside the road heading south from the station, also neutron pods (silt beans) around beside the road nearest the station.
---
I respect your sir. You are exactly what this world needs.
---
The reason I said dumb is because I've been playing since beta so Ishould probably know already... but I'm mostly a loner that messes around with my camp,  vendor, and doing side quests so I don't do much of the typical stuff.
---
Yeah I have noticed I’m no longer getting pips on my HUD compass anymore to indicate enemies. I don’t have a high PER but I have always been able to see the dots when I would come into a town.
---
put this on the wrong subedit, but Id like someone to tell me here as well
---
Do leader of the pack when it pops up. 3 there for a start. Then do events that have one at the end. Free range, awol, project paradise etc.
---
It says 7597 lbs, guess I’m not as big a hoarder as I thought, I do craft a lot of ammo tho
---
We could also use one for the radio host.
---
Agreed.   I have atoms piling up.  Granted I'm selective about what I buy and don't feel the need to buy every new thing they put in the shop.   But I'm more excited about a lot of these season rewards than some extra atoms.  I also like the incentive to work hard to get something that not everybody in game can just buy with atoms (assuming the items don't get duped).   Big if I know.... and yes I also know you can use atoms to get through the season, but I imagine that could get quite expensive.
---
No, class freak is good imo. You’re not going to get detected very often so resistance isn’t as necessary. Personally I run a set of secret service armor to get my resistance up so I don’t have to worry about perks. If you’re killing scorchbeast a lot I’d invest in fireproof just in case, and if you’re weapons not explosive I’d take off demo expert and move those three points somewhere else.
---
Found some one who had plans similar to this and he had duplicates of some super nice plans so I took 2 of the dupes and then gave him a Santa crash and icle plan in return
---
Let’s be honest, the only player base this game has now is the “addictive personalities” that only care about mindlessly grinding for legendary gear and get off on the gambling elements of the game, like the purveyor. Then you’ve got the cosmetic craving people that care more about outfits and building little cute camps all day. Bethesda killed PvP and there aren’t any PvP players left. So everyone gets butthurt when somebody wants to PvP. And Bethesda never had much of a roleplaying element so role players were dead before they began.
---
Horde events. don't kill horde boss and more enemies turn up. Sometimes legendaries.
---
Maybe a glitch or something I don’t know
---
I don’t care about the downvoting sour patch kids lurking about. You’re very right. It’s a shop, not a donation bin.
---
Go shopping! Donate to charities! Flush the caps down the toilet! idk
---
I’m in exactly the same boat but with no FO1st so I have to risk pub sessions to transfer. Lost some high value things but it works most of the time
---
Does this include the glowy skeleton outfit?! If so ima gonna keep grinding lol
---
Radiation rumble.
---
They won't. The community manager already confirmed we can keep everything
---
Other combat rifles can't be equipped to the Fixer, it doesn't have a cosmetic mod slot yet! Guns that do [even if you don't know one yet] have a slot to equip them!
---
Wow, I had no clue! I guess it's time to go pop some Radaway and hope to lose Carnivore before all the rest . . .
---
So...dont play the game so that it works?
---
Thats a new level Bethesda...
---
Hahaha. Sorry for assuming you're a noob! Still stand by that it's not a dumb question. Everyone has their own style of playing. I didn't mess around with legendary farming and mutations until I completed the main story line at level 70ish. I was in the same boat as you. I had to look up a lot of things. My playstyle has changed vastly since beta.
---
Pretty much so it gives everyone a chance to grind it out
---
Yeah, i've had similar experiences. This game has one of the better online communities out there. Not to say there isnt some jerks out there, but the nice people far out weigh them.
---
I feel the exact same way. And it's really not that hard to get most of the stuff.
---
On trying to ask for help from support, they gave an automated reply about the weekly score bug, auto locked the ticket and stated they won't replace any missing score....
---
14 maybe? 15? Idk, I’ve done all the non NW challenges and gotten some XP challenges done
---
*points finger up* fair point
---
Damn that's crazy. I'm also on Xbox and I built a tie-bomber camp, so that's pretty funny.
---
Yes, got it yesterday, def worth it!
---
/u/LadyDevann I completed 2 challenges today on a private server that gave me no score. I won't keep testing it but please check if  private servers are properly rewarding score.
---
10. Been doing the S.C.O.R.E challenges oof and on. So far no complaints on my end, well except for the Ammo Converter but at least that's gonna be changed soon thankfully.
---
Aaannnndddd, pick it up, playing one doesn't count for some weird BGS only reason.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah, I would like to see a side quest about Julie (I think that’s her name) I also want to just listen to the radio without hearing “HeY fRiEnDs JuLiE hErE” for 3 goddamn minutes
---
Awesome! It will go well with my camp once I unlock the glow in the dark wallpapers lol
---
What tape was it? If it was added in any update after the base game, it won’t work.
---
Rad rumble, uranium fever, free range, AWOL. You can also server hop prime as I see 1-3 legendary scrochbeasts there often.
---
Worth it to me but it's also been a while since I did the grind. There are a few different upgrades. I carry a few backpacks in my inventory. But I'd definitely go for the high capacity mod. It adds 120lbs to your carry capacity.
---
We need way more tile sets (eg the seedy shed and log cabbin should've been a wall tile set) and we need way more decrepid stuff to make our camps more immersing to the real Appalacia.. Even a scaffolding tile set like fo4 had for under construction.. We are mentioned to be rebuilding Appalacia after all lol
---
Last time i checked bloodied builds are the only way to 1 shot with say a gun or something also imo yes alot of you are assholes let me know when you get out of that one shot fantasy of yours
---
Okay, I see what you’re saying. It seems Bethesda would just prefer we log in every day rather than once a week.
---
Today I played, and some super high level dude hooked me up with tons of stuff, and knowledge. FYI everyone.
---
I've got a question only semi related to this, I'm really not a fan of pvp in this, so I just don't do it, how do you avoid this event if it starts whilst you're in watoga? Is there time to run away... Bravely of course, sir Robin style.
---
Also I just don't understand anyone who puts the effort in to send hateful messages it's petty and hardly cathartic, I've had them in other games and it's really just sad, sorry they bothered you with it
---
God i love radsponge so much as well as that ther perk that cures a player of all radiation upon reviving them
---
Is that on purpose/permanent?
---
To my understanding it will affect anyone in the area. Had non teammates open 4 and I got all the buffs at SBQ fight yesterday. I'm not sure on range but I was minamally 20 meters (or whatever the ingame measurement system is) away from the group
---
I think a lot of the complaints are going to be from people who don't have "time" to play through the season.   Well, that's understandable,  but tough titties.  Prioritize your time and life.   You can't have everything in life.   If you want it bad enough, find a way to do it or accept the loss and move on.
---
It's in the pipboy description as such so I'd assume so but its online, they may decide to change it later
---
If it's one of the 5/5 weekly challenges, or even dailies, it auto completes at 3/5 and you get the bonus then, and you don't have to complete the other 2 ive found out
---
Yeah this pmuch the last time i had a actual gunfight was back in the beta
---
Spot on. Yeah, I remember the tracker from the last limited rewards, too bad there isn't an overall tracker as well. I managed to figure out that I am quite close to the last christmas reward, but a tracker would be a nice addition in general maybe. Thanks for taking the time to reply :).
---
"At the end of the day, it’s a fucking game that is free to play" and "We paid $60 for this game"
---
I think that would be boring but you’re entitled to your opinion. I don’t really like the Idea of an XP grind.
---
Love that idea also!
---
&gt;What tape was it? 
---
Well let me think, the camp site at Spruce Knob Lake directly below Foundation is where I knew I could find one and it worked. I played one I found in the small shop there the first time but that didn't work. If it has to be from the base game that would be a wicked bug.
---
No problem dude! Worth getting the early rewards if you don't have them already ☺️
---
 Bethesda could give us all golden Handmades with TSE and you all would complain about it. You guys realize that they have kept pure cosmetics to purchase, other then the crap fridge and collectrons. Bethesda needs to make a revenue to keep the servers up and running. I see a lot of complainers yet FO76 is rated pretty high on steam. Be thankful that the atom shop is cosmetic shit and only that. Its not a pay to win its luxury cool looking items.
---
You have probably already read more than you need but I figure it can't hurt to tell you what I did.
---
I started off as rifleman going for semiautomatic weapons. It got me through the main story but never felt very strong. I died a lot because I couldn't take proper advantage of my range to damage ratio.
---
I have since adopted a meta called Junkie that gives me a damage boost for each addiction I have to a max of 5 or a 50% damage bonus.
---
I keep rifleman and semiauto weapons for when I need range. Otherwise I've moved to junkie melee and power armor. It is devastating damage and quite a bit if fun.
---
Hope this and what others have posted helps.
---
Cheers!
---
That’s why. It’s always been that way (at least as long as I can remember). You can loot enemies your teammate killed
---
I’d go to Flatwoods or Watoga. Those have had confirmed successes.
---
How did you lock your fps? I have this same issue
---
And yet i found a camp under the world with the tip of a instrument sticking out of the ground to glitch in. It just works.
---
Honestly, my experience tells me that people are coming for three things mostly: Weapons, Plans, and location. Junk and Misc helps too, cos people are looking for flux, serums, and nuclear keycards.
---
If you are on the very outer edges of the map, your traffic will go down around 75% compared to somewhere more central. But it sounds like you've got that covered.
---
But if you are putting unwanted crap in your machine just to add numbers, then it is diluting your items and making any good things in those categories easier to miss for any people looking there or for any people like me that do the majority of browsing directly through the 'Inventory' tab. Just don't fill your machines with stuff that you'd never consider buying yourself! Has anyone honestly *ever* bought a plan for a Chemistry Bench!?
---
Personally, I'm still assuming all items in 'Armor' are Fasnacht masks - so tbh if you are selling bulk armor and plans, I'll be avoiding your camp.
---
Yeah, super entitled to the thing I bought.
---
So basically if I make myself another two small backpacks and put them in my inventory I will have +15 capacity instead of just +5 from one? I think I gotta make lots of these then🙈
---
Well its not much different than what we are doing now because most of us finish our dailies and weeklies p fast
---
I ended up with a lot of EM protocols and have since upped my price to 3k on every model I find and they still sell.   
---
Honestly it just depends I sell insurgent outfit and treasure hunter hats in two machines and plans in my other two. I sometimes toss a god roll weapon or armor in for cheap which seems to have people spend more and more.   
---
It will come down to what you personally farm. Me I get non-event/event plans I am sitting at around 400 plans still down from 600 I sell them all for 10% of the list price on the plan. Event plans I have over 1k in faschnaut, mole miner, meat week, and such those I price on rarity and time of year. Like I just sold my spare pumpkin plans for 4100 caps each today. Now that I am close to full I moved my camp to make sure I don't cap out.
---
What I said is the truth, if you don't like that, oh well.
---
They did pre patch. It’s dirty anyway.
---
Xbox or PS4?
---
Some asshole decided to just blast them with his Gatling Plasma today..
---
Yep this has been my experience on XB1
---
Just a casual lighthearted *fight to the death*, you reckon?
---
You have been insulted!
---
You  are so dense. I can’t believe I have to differentiate, since you don’t play the game.
---
A game is $60 yes, but the services people are complaining for are free to play. I’m not going to entertain your troll ass any further - you get my point. 
---
This is a clarification for the other folks who might not understand my statement. So I thank you, troll, for bringing this misinterpretation to light.
---
Thanks for your experience. Anecdotally it fits with what I think took place in my case. I dont mind at all if everyone nearby gets it. The more the merrier really. Im going to hold onto anymore I get for the bonus weekends and share the love in the big events if thats how it works
---
I didn’t have this as bad on rifleman builds but heavy and commando your literally doing no damage.
---
Short bursts helps though!
---
This is true!
---
That's the real issue and rather than sell better products in the store they decide to limit what you can earn.
---
Are you in a team with lone wanderer equipped? Because that won’t work and may be why you are taking bigger hits
---
Wish it worked that way haha. I just meant I carry a high capacity and an armored backpack to switch between for different situations. I mainly run the armored backpack because I'm also a Melee build that takes a lot of hits. Glutton for Punishment.
---
This is why I *always* carry my BE laser rifle. You get the asshat at the vendor who hits you in the back, then while he’s engaged with the vendor’s trade menu, kill him and steal his junk.
---
Nobody is being robbed of score if you kept up to date with the information available you would know that you actually get the score points BEFORE your completely finish the task
---
16 with all challenges including nuclear winter and 12 repeatables. 
---
Would have hit a couple dozen more repeatables when I was grinding out the glitchesd nuclear winter rewards the past 3 days if they didn't totally screw us by adventure xp earned in NW not counting.
---
Listen, there hasn’t been a goddamn thing on the TV in 26 years we need SOMETHING to keep us entertained.
---
Feedback reports don't give you a support ticket or a means to further contact, unfortunately any ask for help mentioning score gets locked and that automated message!
---
Dude people are fucking children. They haven’t worked for anything and they’re expecting everything to be handed to them on a silver fucking platter is comical
---
You can’t open the PipBoy while sitting down.
---
Haha at least you're chill enough to see I was just poking fun ☺️
---
The option will be available two weeks after the beginning of the season :)
---
"should" but doesn't alas.
---
another week before that starts..
---
2 week no pay period at the beginning
---
Awesome thank you for the info! :)
---
i managed to fix it but i dont know what did:
---
setting my network on my PC to private
---
setting both the bethesda and fallout 76 EXE files to "High Priority"
---
I mean the dude was just saying other builds can one shot (they absolutely can.. instigating, junkies and magic shotguns for example), and that not all people who run bloodied are assholes who do that. No need to be a dick to him. Find some chill.
---
Yeah I just straight copied it from Beth., I probably should have chopped the bottom off as well. Everyone just gets the automated response and told they can't give score out due to limitations.
---
Why are they booing you? You’re right!
---
No prob!
---
Best selling one is the 'Camel Toe' Fatsnacht mask 😜
---
It's not an issue of them being to generous it's an issue with the quality and direction of the atom shop. If they don't sell anything people are willing to spend money on then they don't deserve peoples money.
---
Yeah I’ve had one maybeee 4 times total that didn’t involve someone either leaping around like a lemur monkey or crouched the entire time.
---
Ah I understand, well I guess I’ll keep that in mind for later then
---
You bought atoms?
---
Not wise the poke a man in the wasteland, who knows what he’ll do? 👀
---
I have limited game time. I had all the daily challenges done today in 20 minutes.
---
I am on the other side of you in that I have gotten no junk primaries insofar that when I rolled my first 10 I got all "good" and "god" rolls my next 10 a couple of days later looking for a furious I managed it with 25% and 90% on it. My very first roll was TS2590 which is my penta barrel prime queen buster.   
---
With that said I noticed something peculiar when I was rolling secret service. I kept getting the same 3 primaries bolstering vanguards and troubleshooters   just those 3 out of ten rolls I server hopped rolled 10 more and got hunters, unyielding and auto stim. Thinking back I got 3 TS and 4 junkies in my first 10 gauss mini rolls want to say the others were zerkers that time.
---
You can tell how many 10 year olds are in here by your downvotes 😂 you are one hundred percent correct man. People have no life’s and are clearly putting all their anger/frustration towards this game and it’s hilarious
---
Subjectively disagree
---
I want to say they do reload, i think ive seen it happen. But now that you mention it i'm not positive. 
---
I'm pretty sure ive seen then reload various pipe-guns. Higher level scorched use stuff like combat rifles and assault rifles, ect. so they have higher base capacity so seeing them reload would be less common since they need to reload less.
---
This is true communism.  The ones with the power are inevitably corrupt and keeping the juice for themselves.
---
Yep. Everything takes time, you'll get there. You on PlayStation?
---
Yes! I spent yesterday visiting other players' camps looking for decoration plans. The shelves in my camp are so boring and I have nothing to place on top of them.
---
I think you answered that in your original post, tbh
---
Why? My camp placement helps the squad reach vantage points!
---
So I have found that those items are replaceable it just usually means there is another item in the way. I built stairs for instance and wasnt able to place an item next to it because the stairs for some reason take up the space I moved the stairs then placed the item then moved the stairs back and it worked. I know this likely doesnt apply for everything but it might solve some issues
---
2021
---
If you search 'junkie guide' on this subreddit there's a really good breakdown.
---
You think F2P is defined as a free service that requires you to buy in and I am the troll?
---
Because they can't take a joke.
---
I had suggested a guest book that could be signed by players visiting your camp.
---
You're right. No periods.
---
I finished all my dailies, except Holotape, in one radiation rumble.
---
It’s hardly a joke, look at all the AFK people that have turned up at vendors in the last 19 hours...
---
Also could support not just autolock my calls for help? That would be great! If like to reach a person before your bot locks the thread while assuming the wrong thing!
---
People who are high levels are pissed because they don’t have a reason to play anymore (as much). When in reality, people don’t understand that this move was made to get newer players to try the game and play more. Not to keep their older players playing! Where is the business logic in that lmao. People forget that this is a company at the end of the days and that company has to pay the bills somehow. Jesus Christ people it’s a game that barely costs any money to play. I can’t stand these prima donnas on this sub that think everything should  go their way - and when it doesn’t, they have no other way of dealing with it. It’s fucking hilarious.
---
To be fair this is how it already happens with the current system!
---
What do you price keycards at?
---
I mean i understand it. 
---
They are running a buisness, the game isn't a charity, they need to make money. If atoms are so easy to get no one needs to spend real money to get stuff then well they're missing out.
---
But as a casual player (i havent played seasons yet) ive been able to get every skin and camp item ive actually cared about with ease with free atoms.
---
The Atom shop is supposed to be a cash shop where you occasionally earn enough stuff for a free thing or two.
---
I mean do you really expect them to fully support the game with new content for free?
---
Maybe I feel like I have seen them reload pipe pistols
---
Yep, looking forward to future steins for the collection as well
---
1. Reading this gave me a stroke. 
---
2. They’re plans.
---
Nope PC
---
Say it louder for the people in the back
---
I can confirm, I received it a couple hours ago. It took me 11 hours today playing nw back to back just for this outfit. 14000 exp is such a tedious grind and I felt like giving up at some point. I normally bush Wookie and my luck was really good at the start but started to dwindle, so towards the end I said to myself f@ck it... I grabbed a pint and teamed up with some random people and to my surprise we won, which just happen to be enough to complete the final reward. Keep at it, I believe in you.
---
I primarily use a B/E/25 Handmade.
---
did you get the fur lined jacket and jeans? have not got it yet and it seems like I should have.
---
It doesn’t require you to buy in you fool. 😂 god you keep proving my point!
---
I buy serums and gold Bullion or I put the garage door down and close my shop
---
Interesting, I’ve seen it work. I use a B/E/25 Handmade.
---
I got mine taken away, my subscription ran out.
---
Usually 300. Turrets melt me as a melee player, so I never run silos and am just pricing them high enough to prevent people from buying and reselling but low enough for them to end up in the hands of the **amazing** people who run silos for the rest of us. You can *easily* get 500 for them, though
---
I put all my plans at 5 caps, I really don't want to put the effort in trying to find all the values and I want people who need them to get them.
---
They don't fix bugs in ESO either alas, loads of bugs since launch for that game too! Currently eso server stability is worse than 76 right now!
---
New since patch. Also repair swords and revive players is listed but with no values.
---
I'm on pc sadly, wish someone could lend a hand but I've noticed a lot of the more creative builders I've seen on the subreddit are all on console so rip me haha
---
Riding Shotgun, started at Big Bend Tunnel East, always has at least one legendary, the Captain, in roughly the middle.
---
The plan aren’t in my pit boy
---
All my plans are dirt cheap. I'm on PS4 if you need more. 
---
Psn: kittehxkaboom 
---
:)
---
holy cow I bought this game when it first came out but am super casual and still to this day know very little about gold bullion cause I'm lazy and don't really care, I play when I play but
---
BRO
---
CHEST PIECE
---
sorry I had to
---
and you may have just bought a recipe .. so load that bad boy up on the power armor station and check .. hopefully someone with knowledge can help ..
---
but chess peace ... WTF!!!!
---
Me too. SBQ and Encrypted mainly :)
---
Bought plans, stopped when I was left with plans I'd never use rather than ones I'd almost never use.
---
Mostly just stopped playing.

I'm also full of legendaries and can't really play very well.  All my perks are weight reducers so I can move.  So log in, sell stuff, buy modules to bank scrip when I get to THAT cap.  And do SCORE.  Why?  I don't know.  All the stuff you get from SCORE is garbage.  Ugly power armor paint I'll never use.
---
So you’ve quit fallout but still come to the reddit? 😉
---
Click the right thumbstick when in notes menu and the latest/unknown will pop at the top.
---
Its 20 hours after you.first use a machine
---
Really?  Why?
---
Yes, I have, back when they were still sticking to their word. Before they decided that my buying atoms wasn't enough so they had to sell utility items and functional camp items, before they decided they also needed to charge for more storage space, before they decided that what I spent wasn't enough for them to keep their word to me.
---
The time you are on doesn't matter. I haven't played in 24 hours and I just logged in and one of the challenges were completed.
---
In that case I'd definitely keep demo expert then
---
It’s so easy that mine was completed before I even logged in!
---
If it didn't already auto complete
---
How do you even get to the event though?  I play pretty often and I’ve never even seen it on my map.
---
I think it stays on until you log. I only played it by myself but read later that the rewards for spending candy aren’t worth the effort so I’m sure people are just using it to farm. Got a few legendaries last time I did it.
---
my son .. when he played used to have me do it with him .. but not for the candy .. at first it was until he bought the top prize like twice I think then quickly realized it ain't worth it .. 
---
instead he would grab the mask and run around and legendaries would spawn and that was his goal
---
To run the Encryptid events, gives me something to spend caps on.  Someone has to pay for cards to run the event.  They cost around 1800-1900 caps
---

---
Thanks for the suggestion Ronny lol
---
It did Not pop up but thanks for the help
---
I was surprised, like there’s a daily with this stupid robot next to tea time event, but this bad ass dudes in a vault don’t have anything they need done??
---
I'm confused because I've literally not encountered somebody afking a vendor.
---
It just works
---
I do believe so, yes. I still need to do a final check to make sure I didn't miss anything else, but I have a feeling it would be something small and not rare if I were missing something else.
---
 If you were able to check a few times a day the leftmost mirror in camp venture just inside the lower entrance on the left in the little building, it would help a lot. I can only hop it so many times per day because the contents don't change if you check it again on the same server. Aside from that, just keeping your eyes peeled when looking at player vendors would be excellent. There's also making new characters and immediately running them through Signal Strength or Personal Matters if you have a lot of time and/or multiple consoles.
---
can anyone confirm if you can get the fur lined jacket and jeans? its the only item I have not recieved yet and it seems like I should have.
---
It’s a joke. Maybe not the most obvious one ever but it is a joke.
---
It takes insanely too long for 99.9% of the player base to give a damn. You are gonna be sitting there running around the highschool for 30min+, should be reworked or removed.
---
Encryptid? Have you never done it before? There’s a whole quest line related to it, starting with a poster around Lewisburg (I think) it’s worth doing if you haven’t, and it’s a shame it’s so easy to miss.
---
But otherwise you can buy the keycard under misc from vendors, then go to pylon ambush site craft the full version at the tinkerers bench inside the small hut and then use it on the terminal there and the event will start.
---
Yeah I was thinking of just moving my camp to a popular location - selling to max and turning them off to go actually play the game. Then turn em back on when I need more caps. 
---
Currently way northeast so not a ton of action. Seems that when people do get up there they kinda over purchase to make the trip worthwhile.
---
The service is sold with the game. Do you think it's possible to buy the game without the service? How exactly do I access this "FREE OF CHARGE" service without buying the game? How do I play the game without using this service? You are awfully hostile to some one who simply points out the inconsistency of you argument.
---
It sucks to see higher rank players take advantage of kindness for lower levels.
---
That's the rank you're working on.
---
Same for me
---
Ah, I bet it's because I logged in so late yesterday then. Forgot about that. I was watching DARK on Netflix and didn't log in until later than normal. Thanks for the reminder.
---
Now I’m just that asshole not doing their due diligence and looking up things online. I try to limit all that because I like discovery things in my own. Kinda bit me in the ass here.
---
Had an overweight junk merchant character too, as soon as I got Fallout 1st it all safely got tucked into the scrap box, this character can at last be leveled up and used!
---
Whitesprings is better for cobalt than site prime.
---
Fissure prime and toxic valley are good for violet.
---
I usually share Team Medic lvl 2 is that any good?
---
Lol
---
Fun fact, that i just learned last week. Fallout 76 is the first fallout game where Intelligence actually has no bearing on the amount of XP you gain.
---
From what I've heard you can submit a bug report and they will manually add atoms to your account for these... haven't bothered myself though
---
Is dark a good show? Im almost done  with space force and meand the wife need something new.
---
Yeah it blows. I have my vendors on switches. They'll still be able to sell but you'll at least be off the map. If someone pushes me over by stumbling upon my camp then good for them 👍
---
I just farm the ghouls for XP and Legendaries during this event. I never pick up the mask as it makes you a target and slows down progress if you get killed.
---
Ah, can't help ya there sorry.
---
So I’m just extremely dumb and the in game progression bar is showing how close you are to that level?
---
😲 maybe [my location](https://imgur.com/a/UUcHn0A) isn't so good then.
---
Good to know, thanks! I did my first nuke today and never again... so if I have any keycards I’m letting them go lol
---
I'm only responding cause you mentioned Abbie, this name carries weight round here
---
As your friend I recommend you get on PC until then I shall judge you
---
Very clean, I like it 👍
---
I’ve no idea how this was done, but maybe it helps inspire you. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/yGO4DcL.jpg
---
Can't build it in Nuclear Winter, you can the sink though, it heals toy at the cost of rads so very helpful!
---
Funner Fact:  You're wrong. See comment I left for the last individual who erroneously stated this. Kill enemy, check XP. Take Berry Mentats, kill same enemy, same level, see that you get more XP. Pretty easy to check before you make an ass out of yourself online.
---
Omfg that whole thing is wholesome and i love it you deserve good friends names crimzon pleassure to meet you hun my psn is crimzon_abyss but i have my settings set to friends of friends so just pm me your id and ill hang out with you and we can hopefully become great friends
---
I like it. I’ll take one at 4” please.
---
Yep to the last bit.
---
The daily score challenges are also broken!
---
Yeah I killed them too. Seemed like a lot of people not knowing what to do. Oh well fun anyway.
---
very nice top it off with some [https://bullsballs.com/](https://bullsballs.com/)
---
Man... definitely having better luck than me. I’ve tried many different public teams on different worlds and probably 80-90 percent of them are just players afk’d at their bases.
---
I don’t blame you, sorry for semi spoiling it for you because it really is one of the better quests in my opinion, which makes it so much sadder it’s easily missed by people who prefer finding things organically through exploration.
---
I highly recommend it though, as it adds a certain gravitas when you launch the event after the quest.
---
Is there some kind of list which has details on what to do to get these things? I just started a few days ago and have no clue what I did yesterday to get some Christmasstuff🙈
---
Hmm.. Probably not the *worst*, considering you're in the area of the vault, Event: Project Paradise, Overseer's House, Smiley, and can be seen on the same screen as The Rusty Pick 🤔
---
Yeah. I did it once last year. I’ve only entered that high school once since then.
---
I sometimes use my full ghillie and don’t pick up any items at all, just pop down my camp and place a bunch of trees and brambles to hide in until someone finds me. I’ve gotten as far as third without even looting anything.
---
I really liked it. It's like Science Fiction Drama, I think it's one of the better time travel shows. I've been waiting since it came out to get some resolution to the storyline, and they manage to deliver an actual ending which you can't say for lots of shows.
---
It sounds like you have lots of anger to work out about this. Maybe it’s best if you just move on to another game.
---
I use it as a legendary farm as well, but the candy in massive amounts I use for food I know not efficient but when you accumulate a few thousand it helps if you are like me and forget to cook the meat from animals you kill
---
if you want it to be floating put a doorframe on the edge of a foundation and delete the foundation, stack doorframes until you reach the height you want, then delete the doorframes under it 
---
then turn that doorframe into a normal wall and build from there 
---
maybe add some big lights under it to look like they're some kind of spacey hovering system
---
Not a big fan of the south. Of course I live in north Central WV so bias I guess
---
Well a small funfact not too many people know but crouching improves both your general accruacy and hipfire accuracy
---
lots of weird shit going on, my camp loaded wrong, enemy’s that don’t exist, enemy’s that randomly appear, events the miraculously finish ( getting credit for completing) all since last patch
---
Not saying it’s a solution for all,  but a microphone just to say “Hold up, I’ve got to go take a scrap!” could let them know you are overburdened!
---
Magic shotguns?  Uhh explain?
---
I love this! Add me if you want. GothicBarbie25. I would love to play with you and hang out! 🖤🖤
---
I don’t have the time to play every day thanks to my job, so I’m just not playing at all. The most play each day systems have driven me away.
---
My only suggestion .. unfortunately is keep trying to join a public server until the infamous 'Can't place camp' popup and then replace your camp somewhere and delete the stored stuff and start fresh .. also though you may want to send in a ticket or inform us of what you placed last in your camp

I knew right where to find one. Inside the rusty pick on a barrel like five steps from mama Murphy. It's my first stop after logging in every day so I swear I know that place better than I know my own house at this point lol
---
yeah. i've had trouble as well. been ever since the update as well
---
I had one on my car but it ended up clipping through my garage floor and fell out of bounds. Had to use console commands to get it back but the textures on the tires stretch towards my garage. Jokes aside, I love the game and that decal is rad!
---
I’ve always wanted a gaming PC. It’s not until I actually got my PS4 in 2015 that I realized how much better compatibility most games are on PC versus console. 😞
---
I love Abbie SO much!!! I have the picture of her, Calvin and Dax as my loading background. I use Abbie’s picture as my Twitter picture. After doing LOTS of research I’ve come to find that nobody has ever found her body. So the chances of her being alive are very great.
---
Fingers crossed that she’s in a future DLC involving Harpers Ferry. Something tells me that city won’t be uninhabited for much longer.
---
I'll have to give it a look. Thanks.
---
am or pm
---
Wanting friends on ps4 isnt wrong we are alot nicer over here then you think plus you sound like your preaching pc master race so calm down buddy shes free to play on any console or device
---
if you make a team with just you then you will get +3 if you have strange in numbers
---
If on a team with people you get +4
---
I've played a lot and I am only 18.  You are right on track if not ahead.
---
Ah ok thank you for the explanation
---
Grind xp during the double xp weekend and grind more xp during the double score weekend they announced to compensate for the lost score.
---
That means so much to hear you say that! Thank you very much. I’ll PM you. 😊
---
You mean scrip lmao
---
Oh my lord that is not what I am saying. You could not be farther from my point. 
---
— THE GAME ITSELF COSTS MONEY AS EVERY OTHER GAME HAS — 
---
— BETHESDA ISN’T CHARGING YOU FOR THE SEASON PASS, NOR ARE THEY CHARGING YOU FOR THE CONTENT OFFERED PAST RELEASE — 
---
What inconsistency? What are you arguing, exactly? That a game should be free? That it should cost no money? 
---
To make it clear, I am arguing that the “endgame” or “seasons” shouldn’t be demonized simply because it requires you to play every day. You are taking my point and redirecting it to something that it shouldn’t be. 
---
So let me explain this in basic economics terms. Or on the other callous hand, let me to put it in Laymen’s terms because you can comprehend: 
---
1.) An economy runs on one principle: the trading of goods and services.
---
2.) fallout 76 is a good/service. It requires a compensation for its service. You pay $60 for that compensation, right? 
---
3.) Yes, originally the service wasn’t up to par. And they responded. Bethesda then released wastelanders, dlc, other QOL updates since release. Publicly acknowledged their terrible release, and vowed to rework the game.
---
You still paid for the original. Money is gone. You get updates yearly, regardless of the content, you get communication/updates from the developers. What more do you want? For them to feed you?
---
who shit in your cereal, ya cunt? proud of proving people wrong on reddit because you draw so little satisfaction from your actual life?
---
I looked it up last week, saw on wiki that it said Int doesn’t affect XP, and didn’t look further into it. I’ll test it for myself when i get home. Cheers
---
Yep, have a foundation on both sides of the wall you want double faced. Make a doorway where you want it, then you can attach a second doorway on the other side of it. Now you can use the replace option on both doorways and turn them into walls.
---
I’d love to know aswell it’s a shame they didn’t included a simple interior wall😓
---
This is cool and all but you could just get players being dicks and leaving a single spoiled meat or somethin
---
esp given the terminal's aesthetic, I think an old internet style, server-wide message board would be awesome, it'd be nice if we could advertise legendaries, coordinate nukes &amp; the like
---
Yes. Make one a doorway, then you can place another one facing the other direction inside it. It works with any variant, but I’ve had the most luck with metal. Good luck!
---
Its that easy?
---
Is this the same issue that existed with being in NW during the reset, or was the last thing you were in before the reset? 
---
I thought about testing it on my spare Xbox account.
---
Question 
---
Do people in my building team, or anyone public team for that matter get to touch my camp? If so, that a no no.
---
There is.   I’m not familiar with the actual process but it involves placing two walls. If you search this sub you might find some older posts on this.
---
They’re just teasing. I appreciate your input as it does come from a great place but they’re not trying to be condescending. Most games are just better on PC, especially Fallout, due to the console commands.
---
777
---
Not to mention fix the ground issues...
---
Love it!
---
Who do you side with?
---
BOS, Raiders, or Free States
---
I want to send you a free sticker.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mwDIDIj
---
First place a wall with a door frame down. Then place another wall with a door frame over top that wall, but facing the opposite direction (so that you have an interior wall on both sides). You can then select and replace them with regular walls and then apply wallpapers to both sides. Unfortunately, this doubles your wall budget, but it's the only way so far.
---
I’d call this organic. This is just fallout convos so works for me. What system you on?  I’m on PS4
---
Yep! I think it might not work with all building sets but because you can replace it as any type you want that's not an issue.
---
Absolutely! Sounds good girly. I’ll add you! ❤️
---
Lvl 358 and they still hit damn hard.  I run lifegiver 3 or I'd probably die a lot more from them.
---
Agreed the current system is brutal and it happens to all of us, you are not alone. I always have my vendors behind a garage door with a power switch in my generator room to kill everything. Also Remeber just because your vendors have no power doors not mean people can't buy things!
---
I just got an auto reply about the weekly bug [which is not as bad as the daily one affecting us], said they won't replace the score and auto locked the ticket before I could talk to a person....
---
I JUST found about this in the thread. Sounds like a sound investment. Thanks!  What system are you on?
---
The birds and the bees, eh? Let me tell you about the bats...
---
Yes true sorry i just like to make sure everyone is fairly treated and i thought they were on the attack lol my bad xD
---
The day the season started, I saw a guy on the map that was level 1000, saw him again an hour later at scorched earth at the end of it he was 1111.
---
I swear Rocksy is also Bagalore from Apex Legends...
---
Oof
---
The one for picking up an audio holotape appears bugged.
---
haha yeah I was just playing .. you sound fun and down to earth so I was just breaking stones .. good luck though I wish you the best
---
Not just that, on the second day half of them auto completed not granting any score at all! Customer support locked my ticket stating that they won't replace any missing score!
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/0jIt82C
---
Thank you. Nobody ever seems to stand up for me so I really do appreciate that.
---
Today I used my benches and I would get a server non-responsive error. 
---
I eventually left and haven’t seen the issue again, yet.
---
My CAMP is perfectly placed and aligned and I would never be able to get back in place because some build rules have changed and foundations placed a year ago can no longer be placed (have tried with an alt and it seems the collision meshes for nearby rocks have changed), and though I love my CAMP the entire thing is built around this one box staircase which I would prefer to be left-handed rather than right-handed, but because I once placed a column above it for decoration, it is now fixed and immovable.
---
Yeah, you too. Take care.
---
I paid for the game and enjoy playing it, I simply won't give them any more money. I am entitled to what I paid for however and I paid for dailies and weeklies that give atoms, it is in fact one of the reasons I bought the game.
---
7% flat Damage Reduction per piece.  90% rad reduction.  It is huge.
---
I go with weapons and ammo. I think people are burned out on too many masks under Armor and mounted heads under Plans. The masks are starting to dry up at least.
---
Yes, it would.  This is my first MMO so no Mic yet.
---
I hope that’s true, but I doubt it
---
If you collect the ore, its spawns more scorched
---
And i just tested inspirational. 10% Xp per kill.. kinda
---
Was getting 126 per ghoul and then i got 136 per ghoul after putting it on in a team of one. 
---
Hard to tell with squad. I don't think i was running much faster.
---
Interesting, wonder why no negative effects when you weren't on a team? I thought with class freak you still took -1 to all stats out of a party.
---
My apologies my info on mutations is probably a bit dated, and only recently returned.
---
Sounds like herd mentality is a must have now.
---
Your only included in this event if you choose to enter the school when the event is taking place. However just store your junk and head on in even if it's on. If you die nothing lost if you win good job. If it's too much to handle step out with a GG. At least you gave it a solid effort. Honestly it can be a good amount of fun.
---
Love it.
---
https://imgur.com/a/mPc5TtH
---
Unyielding without a doubt is better because a full set adds +15 to all your stats except endurance at low health.  This is huge for Vats accuracy, Sneak, AP Regen, Carry Weight etc.  
---
15% INT gain means you level up 30% faster.
---
Bolstering merely gives you a little more damage resistance and no increase in stats.
---
You are not a geek, you are a nerd.
---
I just wish blueprints would remember original location and alignment too, so I could reliably swap between themed guest house builds when I switch allies, instead of the incessant fiddling needed now to place it in the very narrow confines of the build zone just there between those two trees extending _just_ a touch out over the rocks so that it fits properly.
---
how dare you think of your own fruition!
---
but this is good keep hope alive .. it can really go one of 2 ways right, they said the FIRST season is free .. 
---
so it could theoretically reset back
---
OR
---
it could not .. and in order to continue through the seasons it would require you to buy at least some or many
---
but let's remain hopeful and that they don't make that final leap off the cliff
---
[The list for Christmas items and their XP requirements](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/GeOXrBr)
---
So you want them to only fight at your level?
---
Aw man, that's crazy!
---
It's all about the maths. Class freak reduces the negative effects by 75%. Herd gives -2 stats BUT 75% reduction means you lose 1/2 a stat. You cannot lose half a stat. And because they can't exactly make you lose one point as that's not what class freak says they just make it zero. 
---
I've given out about 25 herd serums today to people cos everyone should have it. 
---
Also Empath is a must. You take 8% more damage but team takes 33% less. 33%!!1! but if someone else in your party has it then you get a damage reduction as well
---
Yeah. The converter isn’t the best version of the idea, but I am not unhappy to have it overall though.
---
Where is my super suit. Where.
---
I’m glad to see it’s not just me
---
The entire point of this seasons update was literally nothing but to strip away players ability to earn as many atoms as they were with the dailies/weeklies we had before, so that they can try to pressure more people into spending extra money (even though there is no justification for microtransactions in paid games) on atoms.  It might be helpful to note however, while bethesda is entirely responsible for all the pathetic technical failings of the game, zenimax is more likely to be the primary culprit for an increased push to take away the atom earning we had before and heavily reduce the amount we can earn so we'll be inclined to spend money.
---
That is awesome! Thank you so much🙏🏻💋
---
great tip!
---
Let me know what you think sometime, if you decide to stick it out for the three seasons. When I realized it was back on, after nearly 2 years, I sat down to watch what I thought was S3, previously I'd cancelled Netflix so my watch history isn't saved, and before I knew it I'd rewatched the first four episodes of S1.
---
After contacting customer support, they assumed it was the former weekly bug, stated they wouldn't provide any missing score then locked my ticket!
---
😂😂😂😂👌
---
hey guys since we are talking about mutations is worth taking the healing factor? I use chems a lot and just get 2 mutation and wanted this one but -55% (with class freak -20%) how much less is the pshycobuff? is worth getting those and still use chems?
---
It only works with the brick doorway.
---
I know right!
---
It takes me ages to put them in my shop...
---
which I have every right to stock...
---
how I want...

Take the junk yard work shops theirs a good chance they get attacked by robots when you have to defend them and you should get the eyebots done that way.
---
I pretty much play this game now simply to help new players out lol. I'm only lvl 124 and have almost everything I'm looking for. Started doing this thing where I help people out and when they offer some form of payment I just tell them to keep an eye out for good fixers or handmades. Basically children are our future and I'm investing in the future!
---
Nah, I've personally done it with the barn and contemporary ones.
---
i'm too lazy to contact anyone
---
According to the guy who spent 30+ hours grinding xp with over 60 int and hit rank 30...no, no it does.
---
I think they said all seasons will be free in an interview a while back when SCORE was first introduced
---
That one is a bit of a harder sell for me, my guy is already paper thin hahahaha, but if empath becomes the meta I'll definitely get on board. Thanks for the info.
---
Thanks so much
---
As later levels require more XP, you are best waiting until just before the end of the event before unlocking levels.
---
It’s part of the loot pool for events IIRC.
---
You can go to the market pages and ask.
---
A more friendly page is the Filthy Casual Flea Market page to ask on.
---
IIRC, you can also get them via maps (same pool)
---
On Xbox it requires a friend add both ways. 
---
If Player A friends Player B but Player B doesn't friend back Friend A is just a follower. 
---
Maybe this could be causing this.
---
That's funny but why is your profile NSFW?
---
Theres actually a few in the Atomic Shop files that were datamined but as of yet unreleased, so something like this may happen eventually
---
Go to C.A.M.P.s with a lot of plans you might get the plans for stimpacks dirt cheap.  I think it takes a bloodpack and steel to make a stimpack.  And it takes tick blood and antiseptic to craft a bloodpack.
---
Will do!
---
That's why I've been playing so much Nuclear Winter these past few days. I knew about the rewards, but never played to earn them back in October. I'd have jumped back into the game if I'd known there was also an event to coincide with them!
---
Luckily, I've played enough to earn all of the Halloween AND Christmas rewards over the past two or so days. Hit the final threshold for the fur-lined jacket and jeans last night.
---
Hm, that sucks.
---
I used healing factor and its great, i also combine it with a rank 1 int ability that makes stim packs heal more. Either way its a good ability, you always have lots of stims just use more. Free up that weight for junk hahahaha.
---
It does or doesn’t lol
---
Oh I see, I misunderstood. I was thinking swap teams.
---
I have quite a few people I play with and none of us are the play all day every day or use everything in the game to Max out xp and we are all pretty much give or take at 15.
---
There a are perk for cheaper repair and a perk to repair at 200% .. switch them on when about to repair stuff and you be good 
---
Stuff cost about 2 mats to repair lol
---
Be careful. Tow truck might see it and assume the truck is broken and take it away haha awesome decal though
---
Fyi, if you're not a bloodied build you can take a radaway or two to clear your rads and it fixes the bug 100%
---
we have a great group of peeps, mostly in their 20s, some younger, and few older. Bring a mic. and wonder the wasteland.

Assholes and trolls not welcome, but everyone else join the fun.

Looks like you’d be able to fit one of those huge Scorchbeast dumps in the back of that truck.
---
With the new update, I noticed npcs and turret blips disappeared when I crouched. Is this related?
---
Camp Plans: 400
---
In reality: 30 mounted plans.
---
I drop em at stations to rid of them.
---
No one buys them anymore.
---
Yeah I don't have any masks for sale (yet) and I am so over seeing mounted heads I just drop them whenever I have them in my inventory.
---
I’ve made sure that we have each other friended and we have tried out of game invites, yet nothing changed. I do appreciate your suggestions though.
---
Nope, they can't do anything like that
---
Yea this is why I pay for fallout 1st every few months and just go nuts hoarding stuff into the scrap box
---
Sorry friend I got nothing then. I did me best haha
---
I don't bother with it. If you're not doing high end content where you need to use stims a lot it's apparently decent. 
---
You can kinda cheat it kinda. Rad x suppresses your mutations so you could then use stims. But then you have no mutations until the rad x is gone.
---
Oh you know, for auschwitz of reasons
---
It’s all good. Hope I didn’t sound passive aggressive there
---
No no no not at all haha I hope you find a solution. Done a full hard reset on the console?
---
Yea we definitely have the numbers. But there are some on pc. 
---
I think I'll make a how-to video after the holiday. I'll send you the link when I have it up
---
Do events
---
yeah I'm actually doing the endgame now, with chems my s.sledhammer goes to 413dmg from 317, so I'm not sure if the exchange from chems to healing factor is worth it.
---
didn't know that worked, thanks!
---
Did they fix this yet guys? I'm not getting anymore drops after much XP earned.
---
Does not*. Sorry autocorrect on my phone. Hates contractions.
---
👍
---
Yay, fellow Free States follower. Rebels for life. 😂
---
This sounds wonderful and like it would be so much fun! I’ll add you. Thank you for commenting and including me. It means a lot.
---
I think they're in the order they came in. The camp stuff is frontloaded. To get everything the experience amount goes up, so it takes longer to get each new thing. If I remember correctly it was 7000 for the last item.
---
It’s rough, as a guy that only gets to play for a few hours a week on the weekend I already missed out on so much, now instead of being able to save 1500 atoms in three months it will now take me three years. After playing the game for over a year and a half through all the grim bs, i think this new system bugs me the most, I don’t have the time to grind out the levels for the rewards. It’s honestly disheartening knowing there is no way for a casual player to enjoy the rewards. I get why they are doing it, and for people that can dedicate a few hours a day to play will be able to earn other rewards and get cool things. But us casual player aren’t welcome in this new system.
---
but the chems mate is my buff to take down those huge monsters lol, just wanted to know if the psycho buff will give less than 20% damage
---
Seems obvious to me that if you don’t play with mutations then you should probably pass on the gun designed to pair with mutations.
---
In almost all cases of this happening, you got the reward for completing 3/5 of the requirements, and missed it when it happened.
---
Thanks. 
---
Is it possible to get the ghillie suit still? I got it a few weeks back but my wife did not.
---
If I start it, I kill it at mybsoeed. If someone else's card, I tag it and kill adds ... unless the time gets too low.
---
I have them all, but I still buy serum recipes to trade.
---
If you ever need to mule caps over to an alt account would be glad to help.
---
PSN Vault_Survivor_
---
Say hello to my 22 sheepsquatch/encryptid event cards 😂
---
I have 3k+ mounted head plans in my shop. Your annoyance fuels me.
---
Just you watch. Bethesda will fix this within three days, as it directly benefits the player.
---
Do u know how long it would take the team to implement such a system?
---
Great idea! When I see someone collecting magazines/bobble heads I always drop some if I’m carrying them near their displays. I have no idea if the majority of people even notice before they log out
---
Raiders all the way
---
You shall be sentenced to burn in the fissure site prime, Demon!
---
Congratulations!! Im PS4 or would come help
---
People are **really** overestimating how long it takes to get score points. 
---
It's entirely possible to do everything in this game without 1st. Many people play without 1st and do just fine.
---
I don't lock anything, purifiers and collectors fill up so fast they'll be full again by the time I return home!
---
What? I'm new here, but they really just drop em into the nether when you hit cap cap?
---
Jesus. ESO is more generous, damn it Zenimax.
---
I hear the cap economy has been tanked in FO76 but that still really puts me off, I can see why people just put things cheap.
---
They were from the mole miner pails, they do not drop now.
---
Just find a NV playlist on YouTube and play it on random.
---
Cool I’ll add ya!
---
If the NW Survivor stuff is also bugged and being given then yeah. I've only been getting Christmas and Halloween stuff, but I already had all the Survivors challenge stuff unlocked. I wasn't aware that was bugged too.
---
Haven't had any trouble completing all of my challenges so far in a public world, and I have F1st. I don't even really use my private world though. I like vendors and running into random players
---
Buy steel.
---
This is the opposite of what you said.
---
" NOR ARE THEY CHARGING YOU FOR THE CONTENT OFFERED PAST RELEASE " This content was sold with the game, they specifically marketed it as including free updates. People are not mad because they added new content they are upset because they removed existing content.
---
" services people are complaining for are free to play " and  
---
"fallout 76 is a good/service. It requires a compensation for its service. You pay $60 for that compensation, right?" so I paid for the service but the service is free?
---
The game can't be considered free to play and require $60 to be able to play it. You are twisting yourself into a pretzel rather than admitting you are wrong and then you get angry at me for pointing it out.
---
This!!!!
---
If I see more than like 10 plans I just assume they all mounts
---
Looks absolutely amazing
---
PM me your address and Ill send you one
---
Ohh got ya!  then I don't know for sure, I would assume it means all chems, then yes it would reduce your psycho buff and lower your dmg output.
---
Hm. I logged on last night, very few events, I logged on today, many events.
---
It's either confirmation bias, or a bug of some sort imo
---
Highly doubt it, had other people with me and we all were confused. One of us would have saw it.
---
It might be fine if you had like a weapon with SS and vamp.
---
I have 120+ in my camp, all 50 caps, no mounts. The way it should be!
---
I'll do it and I have 2 nuclear cards.
---
Scrip your legendary stuff at the rusty pick but don't use it unless you are either at level 50 or more or unless you are at or close to the cap of 1000 script. Do some research before scripting as something you may not ever use could be really valuable in game and can be traded for something you would use. Bloody or junkies pretty much anything should never be scripted no matter the level or number of stars. Low level players doing those builds might want that level five one star bloody pipe gun put it in your vendor or save it for another character you want to try the bloody build with.
---
Jesus I miss mods
---
I HATE steel. Goddamn herpes junk. How much do you sell it for?
---
I only have 2 CHR PTS, so I can't share any perk because they remove the CHR count with uny/+1CHR armors legendary effect, and i'm never gonna move any point just to share an 1 star perk that someone gonna share
---
We’ve been asking since launch.
---
I sadly don't sell it because of a addiction called a gauss minigun.
---
Hopefully it is. Bush wookie that I am I love the thing.
---

You are missing my point entirely. I am getting angry because you refuse to see the nuance or the differential aspect of what a game costs at release and what I’m actually talking about. I’m sorry you do not have the mental capacity to comprehend what I am saying. I feel sorry for you. Have a good rest of your day, sir!
---
looks dope, wish the game had the driveable trucks from that one fallout 4 mod haha
---
Can confirm my BE laser has been breaking at its usual pace, if not slower than normal. My lvl 10 BSS sledgehammer on melee however, has been breaking significantly faster. The extra use it has seen is negligible because I’m already doing everything possible at a time. But hitting 2400 damage in a Chinese Stealth suit is 100% worth it. My BSS pole hook in glitched Unyielding with buffs (and incomplete build bear in mind) can hit for up to 20k. About 14k without glitching my Unyielding.
---
Yes
---
You forgot to correct “pit boy” and “mpc” as well. Hahaha
---
I have this feature(?) too. But I’m not complaining, sure as hell beats wearing the mining helmet 24/7 and looks a lot better too.
---
Oh no I understand that it’s the turn invisible part I don’t enjoy.
---
Exactly this. I also have F1st and use the public servers way more than my private one. I have had no problem completing all the dailies and for once in my Fallout life all my weeklies are done. My husband who doesn’t have F1st has done the same as me and is at the same point on the SCORE board so I’d say F1st has little to no impact.
---
Have one already thanks :)
---
Where’d you get that face mask?
---
So is Flatwoods. There’s like a dozen survivor stories.
---
Eesh, ammo I guess?  I haven’t branched into heavy weapons yet. I kinda uselessly tickle scrotchqueen with aa plasma Gatling. I’ll probably have my weapons all situated in another 2 months. Bought the game when it first came out but didn’t actually like it until 2 months ago
---
I’m not entirely sure what you mean by this question but I’d like people to actually fight rather than fly away using marsupial and 100&gt;0 someone’s health in a nanosecond with their fully optimised blooded gear that isn’t necessary for 95% of the games content.
---
Got to say, me too, and I'm trying to grind for that glowing skeleton 🤣
---
I think the let's camp emote might get your point across. The emotes are so limited and not everyone has a mic or wants to talk. I wish I had a "Sorry" emote so many times! Never been a "let's scrap" that I'm aware of.
---
speak for yourself, my goal is to give everyone a chance to get ahead
---
Survivor stuff is supposedly bugged too. 14000xp total for all Halloween items, 14500 for survivor, 27001 for all the christmas.
---
... I’m angry that I found this funny
---
I know you can sell the high capacity backpack mod. That's how I got mine without spending a month doing nothing but wierd challenges. I paid almost 17k caps btw so there's alot of caps to be made for them.
---
surgical mask, you can grab it from pretty much any raider bot vendor, including the one in The Whitesprings shopping center
---
I think it's like 30 caps?
---
Yes I've been doing this for more overall exp but sadly no one joins them (on xbox)
---
Cool, thanks!
---
No
---
I have multiple times. Sadly nothing has helped
---
I hope so. I didnt notice getting it, but I guess I very well could have missed it while I was busy fighting stuff.
---
Its 2% is what I herd
---
I hopped in tonight with friends, they havent gotten anything so I assume fixed.
---
why the chems ;-; I would be an unstoppable ugly monster with tree arms
---
I have never used it as a bloodied build.
---
I already had the survivor items unlocked but I saw other people claiming to be unlocking survivor items.
---
14 right now.
---
I also don’t bash or go out of my way to fight animals
---
no problem! 
---
the only thing I could call myself professional at in this game is fashion collecting lol
---
I believe it is 1500lbs over whatever your characters actual carry weight is.
---
So if you can carry 292lb your max limit would be 1792lb
---
This makes sense, last night I was getting score out the nuke silo for completing what I thought was a single challenge.  Got like 2500k in three smaller pieces, thanks for the clarification
---
I can only afford 2 tiers of a perk, and that's basically the best perk I own that's only tier 2. Do you think that it is completely useless or kind of useful for a bloodied build?
---
You can grind 100 levels and still not buy a 1600 P.A. paint of your choosing. Insane.
---
I find it sad that there is only 5 or 6 songs.
---
They all play in the same order too. I just wish they had a better radio. Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 had amazing radios
---
SS? I know about the camp but what is ss?
---
350 hours...never even seen one yet 😒
---
It doesnt transfer over. Trust me, I played over 60 games the past few days and not a bit of the XP I earned for adventure through NW counted towards that challenge
---
Probably clicked a button on accident. Thanks for letting me know!
---
it's all just 3000 cat heads too
---
SS stands for auschwitz? What’s wrong with you people? Just tell us the acronym so we can move on with our lives.
---
Shoot the Assaultron in the legs!
---
Then don't play it. However people do play it and shouldn't be forced to go into Adventure to grind a pass that should be grindable through BOTH modes. 
---
They should be adding more ways of earning S.C.O.R.E. across the board, I agree. However Nuclear Winter gets 1 daily, a single daily and that is it. They need more ways to earn
---
Agreed.
---
I wish they’d make a pvp mode that like adventure but without legendary equipment. Would actually be fun because it would be fair. Instead of one shotting everyone you fight.
---
😂
---
Bruh. You can finish the season by casually playing. I've been playing 76 all week and I'm already past the 1 week point. (Level 10) It's a 10 week season. Maybe play more than 5 minutes a day and you'll make it.
---
Spotify
---
That’s what I hoped that Survival would’ve been but with them allowing you to take already existing characters into the mode it killed any chance it had of being relevant.
---
What if it was constantly radioactive but manageable except, the surface is full of scorched beasts and behemoths that are a way higher level than you no matter what
---
me too thanks
---
I haven't seen a legendary minigun since I unlocked the skin I wanted to put on it in NW 3 months ago
---
You could place a shit tonne of mines and make a chain and blow em all up
---
Very true. Kind of asking player to play all the time to grind but ill just play just like how i play. Some night time only + weekend if im not going back to parent house.
---
I put mine outside using small letters on the screen that read 'useless POS'.
---
I can't upvote this enough. The video was super clever. I can't believe I've been playing this long and never knew about it. Thank you so so much.
---
Yeah I guess but it needs to be like you have to stay underground to stop people from surface dwelling
---
To add to this
---
I already detest the season concept because of this: We lose the ability to select the cosmetics we want and we are locked in to the ones they give us. I couldn’t care less about the stuff they are giving at max level. I’d rather get another 1500 atoms so I can get what I want instead.
---
I was logging on every day for those atoms but I will probably give up soon since I’m done with reputation and it’s a lot contrived stuff for little atoms. I had got 5000 since Wastelanders but they give 1500 for 2,5 months now? Screw that.
---
ok.. I just played a couple what I would consider regular sessions for me..
---
I easily made it to lvl 5 from wherever I was.. two I think.. without even trying
---
I never once looked at the list
---
Man i just need the recipe for power armor stations
---
No, that takes almost twice as many points, I wanted the Ghillie suit and that was enough for me.
---
swing speed. highly sought after
---
Hello friend! Check out r/FO76FILTHYCASUALS as well for a good time!
---
Just got the missing S.C.O.R.E. from competing the next days daily tasks. 17 hours later is better than not at all I suppose ...
---
Welcome to the community!
---
Dare I hope? This is the coolest idea I’ve heard in ages and would love for it to be a reality. Maybe let us send things to other players too.
---
All good
---
would be awesome paired with one of the mascot suits haha
---
basically a sentient piñata
---
I am in eastern time. I logged in today after 12 noon. The pick up a holotape was already checked off.
---
Yeah no I just thought it would help give you more reason, but I would love to but in fallout 3 style metros with friends that would be so fun, would there be a safe underground town?
---
Thank you so much! You are a dear. ❤️
---
Some lvl 34 in full Excavator PA cleared out all the robots in the place where you are supposed to discover the Excavator PA. So bow my friend and i have the blueprints for the whole set at lvl 9. Thank you random player for making our day so much easier!
---
Same.
---
I don't care for it honestly as for the atom changes. I mean, there is hardly anything worth buying anyways in the Atom Shop and over time I am sitting at like 8k atoms. Still nothing of interest currently and even if there was, its not going to cost maybe 500 to 1k in atoms.
---
This guy's got it.
---
Also, people get killed by Scorchbeasts in Nuclear Winter? They go down pretty easy if you have at least two people. I guess if you have lower end gear you could probably get killed by one
---
I know
---
That's not an issue. In fact, that's the opposite of an issue.  
---
That is how it is *meant* to work
---
Came back to confirm this myself, looks like it works!
---
You call him dense, but you're acting like there isn't a very commonly accepted definition of what a free to play game is.
---
This game only functions as an online service. It is not available as a single player game. Saying that the people who purchased the game and expected it to at least stay as good as it had been are somehow not understanding that the game needs to earn money is absurd. That's the rationale of a free to play game, and fallout 76 is not a free to play game. Free to play has a very specific definition in the game industry. A game that costs nothing to play, that makes its money on often aggressive methods monetization. 
---
Games that are full price games that also have aggressive monetization are not just 'developers need to buy food'. It's a lame and shitty practice that pisses off customers.
---
If Fo76 is going to shift to aggressive monetization methods, it should be a free to play game as well.
---
*Greenhouse nightmares return*
---
Thanks OP I really needed that.
---
Always wanting people to know there is other Reddit’s to find some good people! Have fun out there in the wasteland!
---
oh nice, I need to find the s.sladgehamer plans to be able to roll on the puveyor, thanks for the info guys
---
You get sooo much loot from it though from the regular wendigos and it’s a blast. I’d say it’s worth it.
---
Till today I always received the buff benefits just not the food benefits. So yes this would be an issue.
---
Oh that is to perfect
---
My issue too. I’ve lost so much SCORE already and I was never going to be able to max it out because I just don’t have the time. I just wanted the chicken coop and the firefly lamp.
---
It is not working for me
---
I don’t hate the PvP in this game per say, but I have a great dislike for the PvP community in Adventure mode. Everybody thinks they’re hot shit because they have the stealth armor, a quad Tesla, and a BE laser to get easy kills. Well that’s fine and all, but guess what? I have that that stuff two, just swap the laser for a TSE flamer. But if I’m going out looking for a fight, I’ll play fair. Not everyone has legacy weapons. If I actually fight people, it’s with a .50 cal, handmade, and lever action. And regular armor. Something that’s respectable.
---
You’ll get them in the middle of the month again then. ☺️
---
I appreciate that. I’ve been restricting my posts to one community when there are multiple out there. Thank you for helping me realize that!
---
Tell me, is there a use for pre war money? Ive been hoarding it for a while now because i think in Fallout 4 it was valuable
---
But you’re much more likely to do so than you are to suddenly play with mutations all the time. But frankly neither seems very good imo.
---
Your point is the game was disappointing at launch and it took extra work to make it not disappointing and they should be paid for that.
---
 Now along the way I addressed your point when you clarified it, the updates where sold along with the game.They promoted it that way. They sold it that way. Now they sell the game for cheap and decide that those who stuck with it should be punished by removing things that may very well be one of the reasons they bought the game.
---
  
---
My point was it is not F2P which led to instant hostility from you.  "I am getting angry because you refuse to see the nuance or the differential aspect of what a game costs at release and what I’m actually talking about."  Rather than agree and accept that you didn't express yourself well you decided it was somehow my fault and attacked me instantly. " You are so dense. I can’t believe I have to differentiate, since you don’t play the game." 
---
It is not my job to try and decipher what you meant, when it clearly is not what you wrote.
---
For the record I bought the game during the BETA and have almost 4k hours in it with a level 500, 100, 76, 50 and one character slot I keep open for permadeath runs. I have bought atoms since release but not since they started going back on their word.
---
Not good prefixes. You say those were the better ones?
---
So basically on the day I subscribed?
---
Thank you so much for the info 😊
---
As long as the Vault Dweller doesn’t fuck a ghoul as a plot point like what Interplay was going to do, I think I’ll probably be fine with it.
---
&gt;It has to be that. There is honestly no other explanation.
---
What if doing all the calculations every frame was too CPU intensive, so some are not calculated until placement?
---
Or what if they do use the same code, but when the server verifies that the client is sending a valid placement request it sees something different than the client sees?
---
Two other valid explanations off the top of my head, and that's without knowing anything about what is doubtless very complex code.
---
Pretty sure it’s the day (or around the date) that your 1st renews
---
Bethesda fixed a bug affecting food buffs/carnivore/herbivore in the latest patch.  
---
Losing a beneficial bug does not make it an "issue".
---
Yup. I’m used to getting shitty useless guns.
---
my tesla has been sitting on the shelf for quite a while (for obvious reasons) so it is TOTALLY great \*cough\* to hear it is happening even more now..
---
Yep yep. And you’re very welcome! ☺️
---
&gt;cryolator
---
Of definitely confirmed now lol.
---
Thank you so much 😊
---
Yeah good idea. it should be its own character for the mode and you do not need to hit both people so you can ambush people
---
I’d like to hand out Stalker’s Rolling Pins to all the good boys and girls during the holidays.  Everyone else gets coal or fertilizer.
---
All skins should be applicable to all weapons and remain in the item shop.
---
Same
---
I have a bunch of plans too! Not a single mounted head among them. All of those got dropped at either fascnat or overseers camp for a new player to come along and say " hey what's this paper baaa holy shit what is all this!!!!???? Lol
---
I doubt it will be better than The Storyteller.. if it can be even half that good it will be alright
---
So what for three years it was a bug?
---
I mean honestly I have no idea what their logic is, but my best guess is that they see the ghillie suit as too much of an advantage for an armor skin in NW
---
the ghillie suit currently usable in NW can only be used with no armor equipped at all
---
buuut it also just may be a bug that they can't be used currently lol, who knows
---
All 3 stars? It has to be something better lol
---
In the final circle, there were 9 players left (me and 2 teams of four). I got a great view of the fight between the two teams from my bush, only one guy survived. Must've been at low health or distracted, as a Scorchbeast one shot him while he was looting the corpses :/
---
Guy was in PA too, probably could've punched him to death. I might have done that too, considering I picked up literally 0 equipment.
---
If you haven't yet, buy a mutation serum that uses violet or yellowcake stable flux. Theyr like 15k
---
They never expected anybody would want to use them.
---
Game hasn't even been out for two years, but sure 🤷‍♂️  
---
Yes. It has been a long-standing issue, until it was fixed with the last patch.
---
Nope. Just things I don’t use like broadsiders and flamers, grenade launchers or some radium rifles with some bad traits. All I use if my trusty 2 star shotgun that happens to be absolutely broken when using vats
---
Oh I getchu, I don't like using power armor but still use an ultracite Gatling laser with all the heavy gunner perks at level one(most of my cards are energy/DMG resistance without PA) But even though the ultracite Gatling laser destroys everything it still doesn't do alot of damage to SBQs or even regular scorch beasts. Any idea why?
---
Serums, plans, outfits you don't have, weightless armor and reduced weight weapons. 
---
For example, I bought Fixer Plans today, priced 8000 (was at 26000, dropped to 18000). I already know the plan, but if I need the caps, I know I can get 8-15K for it. 
---
You can also keep buying recipes you know and sell them for 14000. You lose some caps, but they are so light, you can sell meds or food, or even junk to compensate. Craft 5.56 ammo and you'll never be poor again.
---
Never a problem friend! Always helping others out realize there’s different ones.
---
Like the markets, there’s the market page and a filthy casual page of market! (Check the FC page about for more info!)
---
Hope to see you out there! (Same username!)
---
Yeah, basically this. I remember early 2019 I said here that I’d go as far as to pay $100 for the NCR veteran ranger outfit. Low and behold, in October I got it for that price. Sure, there’s benefits that come with it, but I really only got 1st for the outfit. The only time I really use the 1st server is to try and do the queen solo or with only a few people.
---
sure do miss fatsnatch
---
You're a life saver
---
Big Thank!!!
---
Nice man. Sometimes I try to just hide and hug the circle the entire time, but I'm just too impatient. I'm either at the highest vantage point I can find, or sneaking through bushes lol
---
yup, you can build them at workshops but not camps for some reason 
---
wonder what happens if you save one as a blueprint tho
---
i completed 2 weeklies, 1k each quest, didn't get that 2k score.
---
Are you using Cloudy’s mod manager?
---
Bloodied does far too much damage for how tank they can get. The games actual glass cannon prefix, berserker, dies way less damage while being much harder to play and with none of the benefits. It’s absolutely the most broken element. Unyielding is second.
---
Wait, seriously?? Im gonna have to try that out, im guessing its just under floor decor, right?
---
Vortex.
---
Get the mod manager made specifically for 76. It takes a little extra work than Vortex, but I’ve never had a problem with it.
---
I only started receiving copies after I learned the plan (a friend gave it to me). 
---
By then, I had run the event maybe 100 times. So... Range can drive you crazy. Most people realise it is cheaper and faster to buy the plan. I sell them for 8-15K depending on how poor I am. 
---
They sell fast, fast, fast.
---
Same. I can’t believe it’s actually close to happening.
---
Yup
---
So do you have to pay extra to shift gears while driving?
---
Ah. But the brain IS a muscle my friend.
---
The legendary run is pretty cool ngl
---
A public team with one person acts like a team. Everything else depends on your mutations and build.
---
NAR repair yard and Watoga
---
I am thin again, because I wanted to match my main character.
---
You should keep going with that shotty then. What are that flamer stats? You run any build?
---
 For casual playing the best prefixes are Furious, Two shots, Instigating. In addition explosive, 25% faster fire rate, 10% damage while aiming...
---
Nevermind, found it under Misc., blueprinted it, gonna see if i can place it
---
That “could” only changes to “will” when people *don’t* give them a break.
---
Exactly. This is why the scrapbox should be a base game feature accessible to everyone.  It fundamentally changes how you play the game
---
Best place for that is Nuclear Winter really if you want fair fights!
---
Can we use the stun glitch from eso that slows it down when it trys to fly
---
Not OP but I’m on ps4 and I always make a build team for the xp boots and the team fills up pretty fast 9/10 times
---
Yeah...it doesnt want to place...
---
Nice tip on switching team type!
---
I have mine on switches with garage doors on the same switches. When i get around 25k i hit the switch and it takes my camp off map and closes garage doors as well. So even if someone stumbles on my camp they cant access the machines.  But i agree there should be a better way. I like the set up i have i glitched two windows side by side in the garage so it looks like a shop window. When i shut everything down it looks like the store is closed and security gates are down.
---
Get rid of the “V” and put a “7” there!
---
If you're in need of more friends add me. Unknown87654.
---
Even cooler is if they added a bot mechanic to it so ya can leave a little letter to the owner
---
Thanks man, we gotta stay streets ahead

Cranberry relish gives 25% now while in a group with SiN, I’m not complaining.
---
Dump demolitions expert. Explosive weapons add 20pct to base damage- the 3 points gives you a 40 pct boost to the explosive damage not the base damage.
---
40pct of 20 pct is 8 pct
---
3 points gives you a measly 8pct more damage.
---
Blocker all the way.
---
...also get rid of better criticals...get ready for some math here.
---
Criticals are based off of the base damage. Rifleman perks, adrenalin, sandman etc have no effect on critical damage. Criticals are a 50 pct boost to base damage so three points into it gives you 20 pct more base damage. Now if every 3rd shot is a critical hit you are getting a return of 6.6pct for 3 cards which is a damage boost of 2.2 per card. Not worth it.
---
Put those points into grim reaper, keep your AP high, along with Critical Savvy you will get off more VATS shots and your AP will always remain high.
---
Also not sure what kind of armour you wear but at least one piece with AP refresh.
---
I thought this happened to me on day 1. Finished a weekly and the gauge didn't move. So I did all the math of everything I had unlocked and how many points I should have and none were missing. Triple checked math. Didn't report it because I figured I must've missed it. Then yesterday, I had one pop for 1000 score that I wasn't expecting in the middle of a firefight so I didn't check it right away but then when I did open it up nothing else was done... But when I finished the robot weekly I didn't get my 1000 for that. Checked the math again and I wasn't missing any. That had to be the 1000 that popped earlier. I'm still not missing any score, have done all daily and weekly so far other than NW. It is glitchy af tho
---
See I get that but with it being available to everybody, for free, the advantage becomes less
---
That’s Awesome!
---
rippp
---
any message in particular pop up?
---
Man thats fucking awesome!!!!!
---
Buy mutation serum recipes!
---
It's 2%, not 5%. I usually stack up to 45 INT for levelling and it still makes a very noticable difference. I level once per run of West Tek at level ~240.
---
Well now I feel silly.   Apparently my console did come with a Mic, I just took it out of the box!  So now I can in fact tell the party when I need to take a scrap.   😆👍
---
It was available at some point early on. Sounds like it was abused, however. Players would place the mat in a place that would cause visiting players to instantly be killed when fast traveling. 
---
Wish it could be limited to working at least for the person who built it, or their teammates.
---
Unless it had infinite capacity, which would be abused, I feel like trolls would just fill it up with bullshit and memes whenever they saw one.
---
How so? Did you repeat the repeatable over and over again?
---
It gives u one cloth a piece. I think that’s the best you can do with it until the Sierra Madre Grand Opening
---
Says that it cant be placed in this location and the blueprint as that little circle with a line through it
---
Yea I can agree with that, fortunately it's esrnable again right now
---
but hopefully they'll do something about it for a better solution
---
Do i need to mention all the ones that are broken? I feel like id need to write an essay for all yhe atoms im missing lol
---
I found a fixer plan for 200 caps when the vendors were broken, I was so mad I couldn’t get it
---
I picked up the one in the bus in crater and it didn't even count for the challenge lmao Bethesda
---
I've been doing this, and can confirm its been rocking. Just remember to share a perk! And emote to communicate. Been using the thumbs up/down emotes as a ready check system. Works awesome!
---
Did them... No love.
---
Thank you so much for the answer. I’ve been questioning my in game ‘effectiveness’ lately.
---
So I’ve been worried about my offense and defense.
---
Now if I could just get my defense straight...
---
It's outrageous when they charge so much for them... like don't you want to get rid of them? I sell mine for 1 cap each whenever I come across them
---
Perk Loadouts will be coming at some point this year.
---
And craft ammo for my 50 caliber weapon
---
Side question, do you play NW a lot? 
---
The Christmas and Halloween event rewards are obtainable and I highly recommend getting them. The fur lined jacket and jeans is my favourite outfit in the game lol.
---
Oh dear god that was horrible while jumping
---
Shit super Mutants can shoot further than draw distance!
---
I used Vortex for FO4, but didn't get it to work for FO76. So I simply just add mods in manually. Simple 2 steps, copy the mod to Data and add it to the customs ini. I have about 10 mods added this way.
---
Nope, if they need to try to force people into this mode of the game with the daily SCORE there is something wrong with that game mode. And, it speaks volumes for the management of the game that they think this is acceptable.
---
Yea as long it has any rifle stock on it and an automatic barrel then it will count. Unless you use a flamer barrel on a plasma rifle then it will strangely count as Rifleman although it shoots like an automatic haha.
---
Brings back good memories from my Halo days as a teenager... “hooray!!!”
---
What I’m hearing is that you’d like to buy lunchboxes one the Atomic Shop, right? 
---
—not asking for Todd.
---
What I mean is people are going to use whatever advantage they have, as annoying as it may be to fight against. Some of it is 100% dumb, but there are always going to be “better” players, dying is half the fun IMO. Bethesda ruined pvp anyway, casual players have zero chance against anyone who’s even slightly decent at pvp.
---
You get that Tacoma for 76 dollars or something? /s
---
It looks really nicely done, and placed pretty well on the vehicle, good on ya'
---
Welp that answers another underlying question I had too about that attachment lol 😂 
---
Thank you!!!
---
Lol, this is me too. I suck at PVP so I either outlive my teammates by hiding, or my team carries us to victory. I help when I can but I’m mostly a bush wookiee. When I see my teammates go guns blazing and die, I think, someone needs to learn the Way of The Bush ...
---
If your on PS4 and have one I’ll pay a premium!
---
Sweet, that’s one major complaint that’ll be fixed!
---
Ah, i see...that makes sense at least...still, really sucks theres no better way to spawn into a camp you fast travel to other than hoping the camp projector thing is in a good spot (which is a gamble anyways...)
---
Ooo imagine like a nerf on marsupial like oh idk 50% total AP cost to jump. they can still jump, just not as much.
---
&gt;Of course then you'll fill your stash with weapons armor and clothing and collections...
---
Which is what the stashbox should be used for. Everyone should have access to the scrapbox
---
I did it for the achievement and swore never to do it again. It's really boring and not really worth it reward wise
---
Great advice!  Thanks
---
I’m at rank 16 currently I’m hoping I can make it to the last rank
---
Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan are a fucking power couple, West World fucking blew my mind sometimes. they both stand on their own accomplishments too, I'm not only basing this off of West World. Joy wrote for Pushing Daisies and Burn Notice, and Nolan worked with his brother Christopher Nolan on Momento, the Prestige, and of course the Batman series
---
increase overseer rank is easy, make a new toon and bush wookie 1 match.. then delete toon
---
There's nothing specifically I want from this pass, in fact I'd go as far as to say there is nothing I do want but I still like grinding things and doing challenges. They're free rewards at the end of the day.
---
I just love how it makes it easier to find downed foes!  Something I’ve wanted forever!
---
Ghoul fuckers are valid tho
---
Did 2 days' worth of dailies and all of the weekly challenges and am sitting at 12.5
---
It’s the same bug that made me loose atoms before, it always happened when I logged into NW before logging into adventure mode. Always log into adventure mode first then switch over to NW.
---
Grunt birthday party i know
---
Ah thanks for the info, and yeah nothing to lose ofc but it's just not my cup of tea in 76, might as well leave the pvp events for people who enjoy them, hopefully your next event will actually have people like that in it.
---
The crouching is my favorite part, the armor just stops pretending.
---
haha yea I started playing it alot a few months ago, never got the holiday rewards 
---
last christmas item I unlocked was the snow metal armor skin, so the grind has been real haha but Im trying for beanie!
---
do you know if wearing the beanie makes you bald like the plain beanie in the main game does?
---
I already have the reskin of the jacket and jeans that you can grab from the responders vendorbot encounter, hut I'm hoping I can snag that too before they patch NW lol
---
Oh the int bonus will probably help with sharing perks too!
---
Vortex already did that though. It's in the data folder and the Fallout76Custom.ini has the mods in it. I mean I could do it manually but it'd be the same result, no?
---
Amazing! Do you have the actual picture you took too?
---
Your the dumbass!
---
im honestly surprised this wasn't conceptualized earlier with the live action content and commercials made for the game till just now. Fallout 3's Vault Advertisement, Fallout 4's intro sequence, Fallout 76's Launch Trailer. They all are pretty flawless and fit well into the universe, so if it has that level of quality i'd be in with it.
---
I get that randomly as well. It is a map piece I picked up somewhere, but do not remember where, so I can’t go get the others.  I don’t know why it randomly loads the pop up either.
---
adrenaline is broken
---
Oh nice
---
It still works the same for me, i haven’t checked the numbers but haven’t felt more ammo usage. The only things got obviously nerfed are gauss shotty and mirelurk kings.
---
lamee, dunno why they disabled it in camps, maybe it wasnt working properly or something
---
does fast traveling to a workshop ypu placed it in actually make you spawn on it?
---
Weight reduction gear or perks making items in your carry weight different than stash.
---
Makes victories easier too when people leave after. I see this as an absolute win.
---
Take my poor man’s gold 🥇
---
TBH it’s not so much the gear that does it, it’s the perks combined with the aid stacking. Nice gear doesn’t hurt, but it’s not enough by itself to make you some sort of immortal. You can’t really one shot anyone either, damaged is capped at 110 now, so it’s all about DPS. It was more fair before the cap because it gave other builds a chance, now it’s just who can live long enough to inflict damage the fastest.
---
I'll actually have to get back to you on that one but think it works like it should. I really hope they just leave it in as a little bonus reward for everybody
---
Most likely, if its anything like 4.
---
From what someone else said, it was apparently being abused, i didnt even know it was a thing...
---
previously I only logged on to check broken stuff and see how everything looked/worked..
---
I just played a couple of what I would consider regular sessions for me for the first time..
---
I easily made it to lvl 5 from wherever I was prior.. two I think.. without even trying
---
Take my upvote
---
14. I've only done 2 nw dailies. And I'm not really trying to get the repeatable 10k exp one.
---
I know huh instead of having to look around for some meat pile
---
I'll look into that, thanks!
---
The progress of the season pass is brutally slow I can't believe they would do this right before this game gets added to Xbox game pass. You want it to be accessible and fun.
---
It’s insane how many functions games like pso have this game doesn’t and desperately needs
---
Nukabreak was a really good live action Fallout, Twig's vault actually seemed like it could exist
---
You can share 1 rank/3 charisma. Only one perk at a time per player
---
16
---
Very cool and more people will know about this when the Amazon show comes out!
---
I've using an Instegating bolt action lever rifle (lvl 45). I've been seeing regular dmg and crits north of 2k damage.
---
Absolutely. This artificial ‘limited availability’ doesn’t work with an RNG based game, at all. I was looking for the 10mm SMG skin when I got a good roll, ooops not available, now I shot all 10k of ammo and sold the weapon, I don’t need the effin skin any more. That’s hundreds of atoms’ net loss due to their own outdated sales strategy. It’s like the owner of the atom shop is old and clueless about how in-game sales works.
---
prosnap camera
---
Did you look at the Fallout wiki to make sure you did all the quests?
---
I have one, what does that mean?
---
What's your build and level? To be honest, I scrip guns like those. Keep an eye out for a good, cheap weapon in shops. If you're on PC, I can give you a decent gun, like a Two-Shot Lever Rifle.
---
Go to grafton pawn shop
---
Don’t worry, it will be for fallout first members only.
---
My numbers are exactly the same with my non legendary pipe revolver
---
I think they still do, I’ve been gaining atoms from them
---
I get it everytime I log in.
---
I haven't been checking in with most XP/math posts, but on day four I've done enough of the repeatable quests to get around 2000 SCORE (level 16.5) so that should at least cover some failed quests going forward.
---
14 right now. Only weekly I have left is legendary enemies. About halfway through. Done all dailies.
---
Vortex didn't work for me when I tried it so there's something it's not doing right. Just as a test, you could try to uninstall the mods in Vortex and add one in manually and see if that works.
---
19.
---
The other guy is not dense or any other personal attack you feel the need to muster up.
---
You're just wrong.
---
You can't pay for something and then receive it for free. It doesn't matter if it's an online only game that requires Bethesda to run servers for the consumers to play. You purchase the game with the intent to consuming it. Consuming it without spending more money does not make it a free service.
---
Aim it around where the legendary died, its name will pop up in the corner
---
Even some pre written "awesome camp" "great prices" notes to leave would be great
---
Awesome! Happy scrapping!
---
Same here, I’ve spent a ton on 5 PA skins and a few camp items and still have 10640 saved up with only 1550 hours
---
Lol again I haven't bothered so I'm not sure just saw it mentioned in a post about how it never counts the sbq when u kill her for the challenge.
---
Yep. When the Gatling gun skin came out I thought 'Oh, cool' but didn't buy it since I'm a stealth/commando. I found a BE gatling in someone's vendor though, and decided to start up a new character and use it on reaching level 50. If that skin were still in the shop I definitely would've spent atoms to get either that one or any skin that works on the thing, but Bethesda logic.
---
The 'revive' better not still be a challenge, that'd just be outright bullshit.
---
Everything else, even kill are doable but it took me over a month just to get the basic 'revive players in NW' challenge complete.
---
What do you play on?
---
13. Been busy with school work today so I didn't have time to play much, but got the go do something stuff done. Just not the level portion.
---
I’ll have to try that, thanks!
---
I was like "What's so buggy?" and then you moved...
---
This needs more recognition
---
Yeah, I can’t even tell you how many legendaries I’ve lost at scorched earth with all the ditches and tall grass 😢
---
Oh no, how ever will you and your max gold cope? /s
---
Drop a revolutionary pamphlet.
---
Right across from Miss Mrglirghughrurghrgr next to the pie machine.
---
Yep! it was glitched out and couldn't be killed or interracted with so I took a few different pics lol
---
I'm not at my pc atm but I have them [here in my photo album lol](https://www.imgur.com/a/zmdhRrC)
---
I think imgur keeps messing with the photo order tho:( , but there aren't many photos so you should find them easy
---
oh i absolutely love nukabreak, but what i mean is stuff that actually came from bethesda.
---
it shows what youre looking at in the upper right of the screen..
---
use it to find the corpse
---
iv been saving up to buy ss set so yeah its an inconvenience since iv been on this game every fucking day for the shit
---
Unless I misunderstood the question. If you and your wife are both on the main menu (or with two other friends) you can send a team invite to each one of them. Then once the team of 4 is made. You can decide to go into regular story or NW. Once nuclear winter is over. ALL 4 of you must click on “quit” if you guys die. Or if you win just wait for the timer to expire. After that all four of you should be back on the main menu. 
---
Now if you meant how can you permanently stay on the same team with randoms, you can’t. The game makes it so you get a random team.
---
Yeah I’ve seen people having experienced this. to limit the the amount of bullion you can carry when you can only earn 200 per day (plus 300/week from that Texas Pete dude at Wayward) is odd right now.
---
I'm glad you had such a positive experience. In my first session, I claimed the dirt track, not understanding anything, and then a few minutes later, a level 200+ swooped in, enclave power armour and stealthed, and he claimed the workshop. He shot at me when I went into the track, so my friend and I just walked away.
---
Ah, I didn’t know that. Makes sense why my lmg melts people stupid enough to start fights with me
---
i started about two days ago, im one away to the Bow Skin
---
I hate it too
---
I'm not sure what I'm doing differently
---
It’s identical to the machine at munitions factory,
---
Exactly
---
Absolutely! My psn is Funereal-Grief, give me an add and send me a message if you see me on and would like to check or we can schedule a time for you to come have a look.
---
Take all their crops and resource gatherer contents. Then leave the pamphlet.
---
When I’m solo it seems to be fine but during events my damage seems to be way lower than it was before 20.
---
Two people trying to break into a building when they got irradiated?
---
I'm now level 17, but I feel like I haven't advanced enough
---
Guess they just couldn’t be bothered to test it
---
its all the same, honestly. i got my C.A.M.P in the whitespring golf course and i still get alot of junk and stuff from it.
---
Based on your other bumper sticker this one is probably your IQ score
---
I hope you get a backpack and saddle bags. I bet a centaur would be a perfect race for the Hoarder Build.
---
Okay but he can be a ghoul fucker and it not be a plot point
---
Google sheets. Here’s mine
---

---
Too hard
---
To be fair getting to level 5 is not much of a grind. 
---
That said the ammo machine needs an interface improvement, and Bethesda has acknowledged this.  
---
In its current state it is usable, but not really worthwhile.  I can be better off just dropping ammo and crafting what I need a lot faster than this machine.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Absolutely. Don't expect it to replace having to farm for ammo though. It's more of a supplemental source that can help stretch out your supply so you have to farm or purchase ammo less frequently. Just make sure to frequently check back since the box fills up fairly quick (it can only hold 200 .556).
---
bruh
---
Sometimes dirty dames got a little bit of wet work worth doing too, boss
---
So the Wasteland.
---
Generator, not converter. The ammco machine is unlocked with high raider rep.
---
Well, their parent company's Elder Scrolls Online has one. I mean, their team helped up with Fo76. Shouldn't be much work to implement it here.
---
I think hes talking about the Armco Ammo Machine for maxing Raider reputation. That actually generates ammo rather than converting it.
---
Don't bowls have a giant hole on top?
---
Awesome thank you! My PSN is UncleLongLegs, sending you a request now
---
No, there's a handful of new challenges under that tab and they seem to mostly give out 40 atoms each
---
Full bos combat and you should be fine
---
If you gattling plasma is non explosive do not use the splitter. It makes it shoot. A green fog and the hit box is terrible. It is utter garbage on a non explosive gattling plasma. But if your plasma is explosive its godly
---
You dont. There are plenty of counters to frog legs. 
---
Its a playstyle. Same way people go in with ridiculous builds specd towards abusing the gauss shotgun
---
Ahh...that is correct. My bad.
---
So all other armor is pointless then? That sucks :/
---
Idk I feel like the pvp is so awkwardly shoehorned into the game that there’s no chance to be “better”. You can either abuse the broken system and be a tool, or try to have a regular gunfight and get absolutely fucking dunked on lol. Most of the time when I feel like pvping, I’ll just unequip my damage perks and weapons and try to get someone so unarmed brawl me. There’s no fair way to do it besides that, so what’s the point?
---
Thanks 😊
---
my endurance is only 4.. I doubt its just that..
---
I also run blocker maxed.. and grounded mutation.. otherwise all my DR is from armor.. 
---
except in the case of ASSaultrons and some high lvl gutsys.. Im pretty tanky
---
full health build also I should add...
---
For starters, you don't need vortex or any mod manager for that matter. It's pretty much put the b2a files in the data folder, and then add the file name to the archive section in the custom in your documents folder. Mine looks like this.

Some of the mods such as the chat mod and perk loadout manager require SFE, which is a single file that you put in the base directory for fallout 76.
---
When the game is designed to make it very hard for a player to find his dream tool, the shop should make sure the player can always spend the atoms when he wants to. Nope they have to play this ‘limited time’ game and lose all the impulse buys. Very, very dated thinking and strategy.
---
Anyone watch the 100? It's basically all in there, vaults and everything. Until season 5 I think when they left earth. Whenever I watch this show I just want to play fallout
---
No, other armour is viable it's just non legendary is not good go for full bolstering ss pieces. Thank me later
---
How do you place junk though? Anything I drop is in a paper bag.
---
It's gonna crash later
---
Charred ferals hit hard. Really hard. As in, the same as a Scorchbeast melee strike levels of hard. They also tend to hit rapidly and there's usually a few of them in the pack.  
---
In general, you'll need better armor. This isn't spitting on what you have, but I'm wearing full T-65 and they hit me for between 11-13 points a strike after my mitigation. Given how often they swing, that can be a real problem, real fast.  
---
Beyond that: don't let them surround you, try not to melee them unless you're built for it, and cripple'em if you can.  
---
They're basically the high-level trash mob, so they will make a mess of you if you're not careful.  
---
And all of this is without taking into account the obscene rads they put out, which likely isn't doing anyone any favours.
---
It’s kinda like itching your leg with your calloused foot
---
Exactly, I’m stumped 🤔 
---
I basically became putty in both thr guided meditation and radiation rumble events because of ghouls
---
Nothing would bring me more joy than coming back to CAMP after a long day of hunting the wastes, opening that mailbox up and finding raw cloth+fertiliser and a "You have been insulted!".
---
You can mod 76?
---
Blocker and ricochet do nothing to stop rads which ghouls attack partially count as.
---
I lost 1000 score today because of this. NO better example of how broken it is, my game said I had completed the Gold (and tow others) but I have not completed 5 dailies required for the gold!
---
I am aware the score  is sometimes  delayed and gets added later when another daily is completed (or something else triggers it?) but mine never came in and I know the exact points progress I had before this.
---
And if this much happened already on day 3, it is expected it will keep happening occasionally - amounts that may make the difference from me completing the run.
---
Ghouls, col. gutsy, and super mutants rockin a minigun all spank pretty hard. 
---
There are mags you can use that help. Another perk to consider is dodge in agility.
---
You can sorta do that with Tormentor + -ap cost rifle (aligned/reflex parts) and shooting the wings, but honestly we really need a unique weapon/legendary that lets us knock them down. Maybe even a grenade that functions like the sonar towers, idk.
---
It feels pretty bad to play as a melee build though, having to use Concentrated Fire + Tormentor perkswap every time.
---

---
I have been asking for mailboxes since BETA.
---
its not a matched set because I only really care about the effects.. but all my gear is minimum 1* legendary..
---
get a ghoul slayers piece
---
You do feel a difference when you take a few hits with armor, and when you take a few hits wearing just a hazmat suit, but yeah, over all there really isnt a giant jump from wearing it and not. But it can take you from getting hit by a mire lure king 3 times before die, to getting hit 5-6 times before dieing.
---
Your probably never going to feel like a wall of stone, especially considering major gutsy's are in the game. 
---
Get good legendary mods on your armor, and concentrate on killing everything before it can kill you.
---
Yea it’s goofy, there’s not really any “winning” once you’re at a certain point. Playing hide and seek the with the stealth armor is entertaining though, you’ll die instantly if they spot you but it’s funny to creep on people.
---
grab some explosive perks and toss a mine 
---
they can jump all they want with their new broken ass legs lol
---
If you were not inside Power Armor, yeah, that's pretty much par for the course in standard armor. Especially being dog-piled in melee by ferals or scorched.
---
With diminishing returns, defensive stats pretty much cap out around 400-450. At which point, you're peeing in the ocean. You'll notice no worthwhile gain in protection.  
---
Even around 350-ish, you're pushing the boulder up hill already. And should start looking to avoid gear/perks/mutations that add DR/ER, since they're not really offering much.
---
That's where the % perks come in. Like Blocker's % reduced from melee hits. And Serendipity that's % chance to ignore the attack entirely at low health.
---
15, with everything but one NW daily completed
---
It's literally all of us
---
also.. get marsupial and jump on something tall
---
i would updrade to whatever has the highest DR until you can use max lvl gear.. then you can start to worry about what type.. 
---
youre just going to outgrow it anyway
---
Ss?
---
The problem I have is that, unlike every other game that has passes and challenges for them. Weekly challenges don't stay permanently.
---
Other games could have 10 weeks worth of weekly challenges for you to do if you logged in on week 10. 
---
This game will just have the previous weeks challenges disappear meaning the only way to catch up after joining late is to pay
---

Out of curiosity if you are a f1st member and store all your junk in the scrapbox, what happens to the junk after your membership is over? Does it stay in the container or?
---
Ok good to know 👌
---
Doesn't work with Steam.
---
Holy crap good to know i use to keep 200+ of everything in my junk. No wonder i had no room in  my stash
---
No prob 👍
---
And yeah when I get in my excavator set it does help but it’s ridiculous this ‘trash’ mob is so op when they’re 30ish levels under my character
---
Honestly, this is the best advice when It comes to armor lmao
---
Nah I’m a pvp build. I do it in assassin sentinel armor lmao
---
I used ghouls as an example and yeah the horror of their rads causes nightmares 😖
---
But things like yao guai or gutsys have been a thorn too
---
Events should have a 2 week test phase so people can play it after everyone finds all the bugs cause this typical “oh here’s an update” then everyone getting screwed shit is a pain in the ass.
---
That would be something
---
Gracias, will look into that one
---
Try picking up 'old' holotapes - those who were already there before the Wastelander patch.
---
I have been thinking about this and tell me I may be wrong. But, they offer 150 atoms 10 times on the board. So 1,500 atoms is 10 free levels to jump. So I figure grind to the end and whatever I can't reach spend the atoms to complete the board. Right? But how far do I have to grind? 90? I think it's the full 100 days though. Any input would help. I will probably use those atoms to complete my run. Hopefully.
---
Is it really that hard to aim up? After jumping 3 times the jump height goes back to normal. Stop whining and git gud
---
Problem with that is they then run and hide 😅🙁
---
Okay! 😊
---
So? 
---
It's a premium currency. BGS gives more of it than most other titles, and yet? Every one here bitches and moans about it. 
---
You're owed 0 premium currency for free. Free premium currency and an entirely free (with optional paid levels) season pass system? 
---
That's pretty fucking phenomenal by comparison. Go open Fortnite, Warzone, Rocket League and just about any other title....
---
Tally up how little you get compares to 76......
---
And as Black President Bush said to the UN..... 
---
"Shut the fuck up"
---
Holy shit, Bubbles
---
&gt;what happens to the junk after your membership is over? Does it stay in the container or?
---
Yes. Everything in the scrapbox stays in the scrapbox. You can still access the contents when crafting 
---
But all NEW junk going forward cant be added to it.
---
Do legendary effects stack, if so then I’m gonna get a full ghoul set, I swear
---
I find it pretty nice. I've got it set to 5mm. I use that ammo but not often. So I sell the excess that I end up with at 1c per and then buy ammo I use more frequently
---
Bethesda has to get licensing for songs, they can’t just throw things in.
---
It is a feature. It's premium currency. They have zero obligation to give players any free. 
---
And compared to other online titles? 76 gives players well more than the standard.
---
Seriously. I joined for Wastelanders. GREAT addition to the game. The story and world exploration was fun. I thought Bethesda was turning the tide. Worth a one time payment.
---
Now here they are - the very first opportunity arises after Wastelanders to fuck up, and they dive into it head first. Terrible new weapon skins with texture clipping, the ammo converter controversy, the grindy Legendary Run, the further neglect of Nuclear Winter... 
---
Bethesda has become such a 50/50 company when they used to be such an industry legend. Wastelanders added depth to the game. Beyond those quests and missions, there appears to be none unless you want to read several books' worth of terminals and notes. (I don't. Hence why I'm playing a game and not reading books.) Now the remaining gameplay mechanic is to repeat redundant quests for the promise of in game items that someone probably already added to FO4 and did a better job on the texture/mesh. 
---
My time as of recent has been given to Halo MCC and 343 Industries - another company with a troubled past but instead has vastly improved themselves by working in tandem with the community. Bethesda take note or this game will go the way of the buffalo. Your brand no longer holds the status it once did!
---
Ok see this was where my opinion was leaning before I posted was trying to ‘defend’ is pointless almost.
---
To whoever downvoted this first, I'm sorry you can't get obvious sarcasm. (by the time I wrote this, I had already done it, and it actually the easiest and fastest, but good luck out there).
---
Explosive shotgun + enforcer
---
Every other game has this model and nobody bats an eyelid but as soon as Bethesda wanna monetise their game like every other company people throw a fit.
---
I don’t care if they took your free atoms away, They were free... I don’t get the issue (referring to the complainers not you btw).
---
That would be freaking awesome! I like this idea too!
---
Thanks! I hope it stays so I can get it.
---
I love this idea! And I wouldn't even be mad at all the insult notes left. 😂
---
-sigh- I’ve heard something similar to this before. It sucks that the defense mechanic becomes like this after you hit that minimal cap. And yet enemies can go way past that cap.
---
Weird. Doesn’t happen to me. I just think it looks like shit though so I don’t use it
---
See here's the thing. You seem to think BGS is missing out because of this....
---
But you were never buying it. You not getting that AS item is no different than you getting it free.... 
---
Sorry you're not getting as much free premium currency that you people seem to think you're owed? 
---
Go load up any other online game. See what they give you by comparison.... 76 is pretty generous with the freebies and free premium currency. And a free battle pass (not the standard for games)
---
Your first part was the question, unfortunately when we get back to the main menu we're no longer on a team together. We also play with teams off. I don't like to bush wookie when it affects other people.
---
Are you aware of the fact that the update broke the Adrenaline perk?
---
It currently does nothing.
---
I don’t consider it canon. I don’t think anyone should lol
---
It takes balls to flaunt around that you play/support 76 in public. I commend that if nothing else lmao
---
No its more or so the fact that you have an entire squad jumping up and down while dodging everything. It's annoying as all hell.
---
Didn’t know I needed an Animal Crossing bulletin board in my CAMP until now. Great idea!
---
Same spot :)
---
don't get me started on bugs.  i'm currently 2500 score short of where i should be due to the challenges popping, but not giving me the points for completion.  ironically two challenges gave me 1000 score each at 3/5 conditions met rather than 5/5.
---
i'm pretty livid right now about the state of the game.  due to a server crash i lost my sophia daily as well.  all i had to do still was talk to her to turn it in, and on the way the game crashed.  upon logging back in, i didn't have the quest, she wouldn't give it to me again, and i had no rewards from it.
---
Ah I see. Well I admit it is a little weird that you two aren’t on teams anymore after the match ended. F and I don’t seem to have that problem. Occasionally a glitch will happen when I see her on my team but she doesn’t see me. Or the other way around.
---
That's just bullshit. 
---
One of the MAIN selling points was free atoms? BULL SHIT. 
---
Regardless, you still get free atoms. And a free battle pass. 
---
Compared to other games like Warzone, Fortnite, and Rocket League? You get waaaaaay more free shit and premium currency in 76.
---
I don't, and I wonder what'll get pulled out of the hat when the BOS returns in the coming update.
---
Yeah I knew it was broken but it’s like the games not registering that my gun is a two shot it should be doing 355 per shot
---
Screwed over ? By offering slightly less free premium currency they had no obligation to provide you?
---
Cheap, entitled trash. This whole sub. Cheap. Entitled. Trash.
---
If they're going to have loadouts, they're going to have to give us the opportunity to respec.  There's no room for debate or argument on this.  We need the ability to respec, even if there's an atom cost to it (though there REALLY shouldn't be).
---
I spelled both of those correctly haha haha?
---
I second that. GRAFTON PAWN SHOP. I guess it must be an Easter egg. Before wastelanders update. Pretty cool.
---
Yeah. I challenge any of these entitled 11 year olds to go play a plethora of online services that give players ZERO free premium currency and charge you for an every level reward Battle pass.
---
2 shot doesnt work like that..
---
also the accuracy is ass...
---
Yeah, you clearly aren't the only one who thinks that way. 
---
I hadn't seen anyone else wear the armor and was starting to think that what I got was the skin's default state.
---
Thanks for clearing that up!
---
I believe you’re right in the spending 9 levels. I’m definitely going to put a bit more money into it as well though to finish because some of the end tier rewards are really cool. 
---
This happens often when a game first adds their battle pass. Developers usually don’t know what a good XP system for a battle pass is/what challenges should give/how much a level should be so the first pass is usually sketchy. My guess is if this SCORE pass is almost impossible to complete without atoms Bethesda will tweak it a bit for the second pass... that or they keep it the same to get more money. Who knows. My guess is if they don’t want the SCORE system to die they’ll have to rework the points sometime. Maybe even sometime during this season
---
It is not rare anymore
---
?
---
It’s a fairly common reward from claims tickets. I’ve gotten it a few times.
---
Thinking you are some how owed a certain amount of free premium currency. 
---
Insane.
---
It literally was doing the correct damage right before that patch now the gun is useless at 180 damage
---
I recommend (anybody) make similar posts! The more it gets brought up the more bethesda will see how much people want it. I know they're already aware its something people want.. but I think it needs to happen SOON! Not in another year or 2....
---
Yeah, you are better off getting marsupial and jumping on a bus than ever taking a single hit. Or better yet, getting your build to where you are one or two shooting everything so nothing has a real chance to hit you, crowds of enemies are a little tougher to handle if you aren't a sneak build.
---
I got all the fragments and tried several times trying to get the last 2 to place but they won't. Even tried server hoping private servers. 
---
Its not a big deal.. i just wanted to complete it for personal reasons
---
Cry me a River sugar. 
---
What's the exact amount of free premium currency you feel you deserve?
---
The ones that got 'ticked' are impossible to do in that time.
---
This was the other repeatable that was datamined.
---
SCORE_Challenge_Weekly_QuestComplete_Events_RECURRING "REPEATABLE: Complete a Public Event"
---
Which is most likely what they were talking about when the advertised that events would give season points.
---
That would make it so much easier to target people with free aim instead of the pseudo-aimbot...
---
It was silent, but deadly.
---
What do you mean by "these are outdated but all of the vats DEFAULT values at the time .. adjust spring value etc to your liking"
---
Have a link to where I can learn more?
---
Omfg. 
---
Someone with some logic and reason?
---
Don't lose hope fellow wastelanders! There are 10 150 atom prizes. So 1500 atoms means 150 atoms advance 1 level. 10 free levels if you spend them on the score board. Which is what I will do. Hopefully I get to the end.
---
Ok thank you 😃
---
All you have to do is set exactly where 76’s data folder is with it. That’s all.
---
Used to be rare, along with the chaps version. Pleasant valley tickets have made them both common items now.
---
The last time I did monster mash there was one other guy there. I killed him nearly a dozen times by the end of the second round without him even bringing me to half health, and sadly he dipped after the second round
---
What we think doesn't matter. Canon is, by definition, what Bethesda says it is. Ignore it if you want, but you'll be wrong.
---
Congrats! I love playing NW just to chill out since there are so many crazy perks and strats you can try that other battle royale don't have
---
if you ever hop in again, just letting you know you get a boost in rewarded rank points and xp for the main game just by surviving til only 10 people are left
---
also you gain more rank and xp by killing enemy mobs like ghouls and such than you do killing players! killing players actually doesn't give you much at all.
---
so try and play safe and sneaky, use melee to kill mobs cuz they are silent, til then, and then go ham and try dumb strategies since you don't have much to lose
---
winning does get you a lot of xp tho, but it's no fun worrying about winning every time
---
Bethesda could fund an indy garage band for 5 years for $1000 and half eaten ham sandwich with no cheese. To license some songs from them
---
Idk, using a ts ffr handmade lvl35 on my alt char - both bullets deal the same amount all the time, 75 each on headshots to lvl5 scorched.
---
I assume bethesda patched some older version in certain sides with update 20, since we have the seasonal nw rewards and a op Tesla prenerf as example.
---
Alot of stuff doesn't work like intended since last week, more then usualy at least.
---
Thanks!
---
yep I have an addiction to moderately animated meters filling up accompanied by sound effects
---
Been thinking of that since day one tbh would be a nice feature even tho it’s 50c sometimes
---
.
---
You're trajectory locked for far longer with frog legs, thus your movement is easier to predict than someone staying low to the ground jump strafing with gun runner.
---
Ficking eh.
---
The idea that these people are somehow owed a certain amount of free premium currency is absolutely fucking childish entitlement.
---
Ah well, it's a minor inconvenience. Just takes a second to team up again.
---
I do it for the candy and legendary pieces. Then I take the candy and leave a few pieces in a bag with a "Free Watoga" flyer on player's camp steps.
---
I have my strength maxed with blocker &amp; barbarian (+4 DR per point), 1 in perception, 13 in endurance with Adamantium (no limb damage), Life Giver ( a must have, imo) &amp; Ironclad, and Agility maxed with Evasive (+3 DR per point). Sneak is a must have too. I can go toe to toe with lvl 95 Behemoth and win with more than half my life left...without sneaking. Leather armor is just good for energy DR but weak otherwise, breaks easily. BOS Combat armor or Scout are the two most durable outside SS armor.
---
No. It is a cap sink
---
https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2020/07/fallout-is-getting-a-tv-show-from-the-team-behind-westworld/
---
Damn, I never would've thought to try this. I had bad experiences with blueprints back when the game first came out and I've avoided them ever since, but I can already think of a few things I want to try now using this trick. Thanks for sharing.
---
Sounds like someones a masochist.
---
Thanks this info is very helpful 👍😃
---
Please tell me it's not every 10 public events :P
---
And they wonder why people build underground camps.
---
I'll be the first to tell you then :p I logged in well past reset and I still had 2 done. One was even finish 5 dailies when I had none completed
---
That’s how long ago it should have happened.
---
Do these idiots have any QA at all? Oh wait... WE ARE THE QA DEPARTMENT.
---
Is doesn’t matter. It’s been made canon that the Master’s army killed all the ghouls in Vault 12, even if the Vault Dweller saved them in your playthrough, which then directly contradicts the canon.
---
I run 3 characters so I can only share rank1 cards
---
Please no.
---
There is a reason we have capsinks, there are literally way too much caps around inflationing all prices. The only reason a single bullet isn't sold for 1000k caps is the 30k limit. Go check the cap auctions where stupid items like a single purified water got sold for 1mio caps.
---
Bethesda designed sunny at wayward exactly like he is because of this.
---
Yeah i said that, but there is also way more loyalty free music from the 50s era that the game uses, or very cheap nowadays and all in the same genres and styles of music. Another way Bethesda have already gotten around this on the cheap is by using cover versions.
---
Considering we've had the same track lineup for over a decade with FO3, FO4 and now this. Even New Vegas had new music, but then again that was Obsidian
---
Don’t understand why you got downvoted since you’re not wrong. I’ve also been getting the occasional atoms, but in all honesty it’s probably  due to one of the numerous glitches with the challenges.
---
I feel like the worldbuilding and lore is more intune with the original fallout 1 and 2 games than 3 and 4 was, and I heard some of the devs actually did work on those games too
---
so yea, It's a great addition to the canon imo, lots of interesting stuff
---
I'm not going to lie, i started the match, placed the camp 3 times and got the score points, then hid in a bush, and went to make some tea and when i came back like 10 minutes later i was still alive and there was only 6 people left.. decided to just end my misery after witnessing that.
---
Well now it works🤣
---
This is like saying to remove Scout’s double jump in TF2 because you don’t know how to track.
---
Go wait a week or two, until you reach a point where you need 3k points and more.
---
PC player here - what I hear you saying meets my experience of hackers lighting you up through terrain
---
This was the most logical reason that I could see. Sorry for the late reply, busy day.
---
So...why not just buy one piece at a time?
---
No in fallout 4 it was worthless its good to make alot of cloth really quick though
---
Maybe.....
---
Sooooo much. It doesnt have to be a hit to be a game worthy jam. Theres tons of comedy albums too and if theyre pushing up to the 60s beach boys that broadens the available scope by a lot.
---
(doesn't relate to this post) just thought I'd spread the word. If you're on Xbox 1 I'm WAY over weight and giving away most stuff on my person between 0 &amp; 10 caps (depending on the item). I'm currently at Whitesprings Station and my gamertag is AppleHead230.
---
Almost there already
---
Done in 3 days.
---
I have no life pls send help.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
They did change it up some for F76 adding Beach Boys (not cheap loyalties) and using a Johnny Cash cover song Ring of Fire for Nuclear Winter, but the quantity just isn't there for an online mmo for a 24hr  radio station.
---
&gt;bolt action lever rifle
---
Oh man, I wonder when that’s gonna be a common drop so I can get one too.
---
See? People like you make this game often
---
Tomorrow your claimed workshop along with your resources will be gone
---
Have trusted friend buy anything for whatever caps you're going to move. Switch characters, join same server, have said friend sell you one item for the same amount of caps.....phase 4....profit
---
The sonic traps scattered around for the It's a Trap event literally do this, so there is even in-world tech for it already.
---
Level 6! Im officially burnt out, After the whole settler rep deal doing tasks to fill up a meter til you max it out just seems so.......soul crushing. Esp when you know once its done a new "season" will start with almost no new content.
---
Nope it increases by 25 score each rank, at that rate youd need 3,000 score at rank 120. The max is 100 not 120
---
Someplace near the crater might be a good spot
---
Awesome , this looks perfect , Thanks
---
Is this different to the rewards being given out early and not on completion?
---
Born Survivor is my usual shared perk. Very rare that I encounter anyone purposefully running health so low that it might trigger needlessly.
---
Yes.
---
Because many people were expecting an implementation similiar to that of new vegas -- breaking down and crafting ammo.
---
That said, the terminal method isn't exactly streamlined and the 2000 point limit doesn't make sense either.
---
If you're on the same account the only thing that isn't shared are the actual items you gain- The scrap boxes, perk card packs, caps, etc. Everything else is bound to the account itself so you can both use whatever skins or camp items you earn.
---
They can afford it. There is work arounds like using 50s/60s joke/jazz/blues etc that are loyalty free and lost to the ages like they already have, and a 24hr mmo that's always online deserves a 24hr radio station of no repeats at least imo.. Yes even the Classical Radio Station.. It's all streaming.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Uhm excuse me. But, could you direct me to where I can use these claim tickets. Thank you in advance.
---
how come?
---
Made it to rank 15 so far, with a little grinding today to get a few extra repeatables
---
Hellfire Armor
---
I’ll check it out thanks
---
Screw that, I will play the game on my terms. I could not care less about groups. I’d rather miss cosmetics I’ll never use instead of being stuck to a group.
---
Yeah I’m pissed as what the game needs is more solo stuff and decreasing number of people in events. Fed up with body blockers and roof chameleons.
---
I think actually you may be correct lmao
---
The Beach Boys was a nice touch and so was Ring of Fire, but you make a point. We could have used more tracks period. There's no way they can't afford licensing when they keep milking Skyrim for every ounce even though it's clearly visually dated.
---
It gives u one cloth per piece. I guess that’s the best u can do with it until the Sierra Madre Grand Opening
---
No, I’m getting some after each public event. It’s only PUBLIC events, though. You won’t get it for any of the others.
---
It also had getpos/modpos/setpos and getangle/modangle/setangle
---
Nope, there's a spiritual successor to Cloudy's that's coded even better.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546?tab=files&amp;file_id=3754
---
This is a REALLY good mod manager.
---
Ever log in at a friend’s ps4?
---
Pleasant valley ski resort. Bottom level. Need a keycard. Talk to robot down there.
---
Agreed. The only thing that kinda sucks is that the daily give so little score. I'm at the point that I go up maybe a level or something. Can't wait for later on
---
Well yes I get all that, but the way people exaggerated the issue on here (check any of the top posts about this) and went on about how the devs never played this game or they're trolling players or its the worst thing ever created in any game, and so on, it's really way overblown.
---
Maybe it's because it came at the same time as the legendary run and atom point shift that caused people to be more angry over this issue than what's really warranted, I don't know.... But some people need to get a grip
---
No, have not. :( just mine unfortunately
---
Yes you can. It's a massive pain in the ass at least until I found the mod manager I am now using. I tried Vortex and Cloudy's but both were trash in my opinion. (Not coded decently, not enough options, not intuitive enough.)
---
That is til I found this one:
---
I guess I'll just have to play it to really get the full lore experience. based on wiki reading it seems like connections to older games were haphazardly thrown in, but it doesn't really do the game justice like terminals do. And yeah, 4 had some serious retcons that make me cringe a little (specifically T-60 power armor, and Jet in the drug Vault)
---
I think you can get a refund on the atoms if you submit a ticket. I've not heard of any glitches like that before, but Bethesda seems pretty good about handing out refunds from what I know. Apparently they even let you keep the items?
---
Mine won’t go past rank 2
---
This needs to happen.  Please make it so.
---
Submitting one now, hopefully it helps!
---
I added it to a leather chest and took it off. It had no physics.  It never followed the bob and sway if my character.  It floated off my character.  I didn't expect much and it was worse.  I'm just ignoring it now so I don't get mad that it was a reward spot on the board.  Along with the bullet converter, this is a just... Bethesda.  I usually really on modders to did this stuff, but can't here.  It's saddening.  I'm worries about the skull gas mask.  I want it, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up even if I get to that score.  It might clip horribly, it or might not even be a gas mask in function.  Who knows at this rate.  Sigh.
---
I thought it was already said directly from bethesda this is non canon? I thought we knew this during the advertising campaign??
---
Where is he located at?
---
I think they did with that Ring of Fire cover version lol
---
Haven't seen anything like that posted here, by the dataminers, or on the trade subreddit so if someone told you that I just think they're trying to get rid of their explosive railway rifle
---
Not about that at all its more about the nonsense and their inability to do the simplest things right or smoothly. Dont try to shame people for voicing a negative about this game. Bethesda deserves every bit of it. Do you realize how long the list is?
---
They're also selling us a sloppy ass skin this week. They want our money for thoughtless and careless work. Thats not cool. Not to mention for 3 weeks an atom shop item was broke. Its first world problems but its a testament to their care with this game and they want us to pay more for it. Asking for better quality while they ask us for more cash isn't entitlement, id just like to feel like they actually give a shit about their own product.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm honestly not trying to argue I just dont remember much about hellfire armor since I didn't use power armor at all back when I played fallout 3 and fnv
---
but doesn't the Hellfire armor in Fallout  76 look nothing like the OG hellfire armor? I mean isn't it just a skin you can unlock in NW? I don't remember anything about it in the main game existing tbh 
---
I thought the Hellfire armor in Fallout 76 was just a fancy coat of paint that just happened to share the same name, I don't remember any added lore about it in fallout 76 that would break canon 
---
If there is I would love to know so I can check it out ingame myself!
---
Ok thank you
---
It’s happens to me before if you submit a ticket and ask for the texting support they fix it almost immediately I had my atom back in 1 hour after I explained what happens
---
That RoF cover fucking slaps too. Like I shit my socks when I first heard it unexpectedly
---
Explosive harpoons are.
---
Come back in a few weeks when someone destroyed your camp, cheated you out of a trade, and ran in front of your bullets so they can kill you and take your stuff.
---
Cool thank you
---
Hopefully.
---
I have a Tse 25% faster fire rate.
---
It sits on alt, I prefer my quad and bloodied railways.
---
Yeah it’s purely cosmetic like that, I understand what you mean. Maybe I’m just nit picking tbh.
---
Knowing my luck they’ll just leave me propaganda fliers
---
You are mistaken. You're not getting any points for public events, you're getting points for the repeatable 10k experience challenge. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjvw0c/what_is_the_official_answer_from_bethesda_on_how/fwpcpyg/
---
I think Fallout 1st people should have 50% more storage space.. so 1200 and not 800.
---
I also think FO1st should have camps that stay in place on your private world.  And in your private world you should have x3 the camp budget.
---
It just works kinda
---
It just works kinda barely
---
It just works kinda barely and not well at all for the 40k plus ammo people have stored up.
---
It was a lazy implementation with little to no oversight on completion. The systems the game has in place already were completely ignored for this iteration. It is either incompetence or lack of oversight. Neither are something the FO76 community hasn't already been dealt with by Bethesda.
---
In my experience, the actual written stuff in the game and explanations it provides are way better implemented and explained than anything currently listed in the wiki haha
---
a lot of wiki pages haven't been updated and were written by people who hadn't yet found every bit of lore in the game at the time, so while I'm sure there are tons of plotholes, it's probably less than in the wiki or not
---
either way, the writing is something I found very satisfying in the game, even if it breaks previous lore, it's still interesting stuff that pulled me into the world, so at the very least if you're someone who likes lore hunting, you should be satisfied I think
---
I love a good mystery. Do you live alone? How long was your system out of your sight? Any enemies? Scorned lovers?

I had foundations that were difficult to remove. I just moved my camp and it blue printed all pieces into storage. I scrapped a little bit and rebuilt my camp. Turns out that my budget was maxed because I had somehow had alot of foundations hidden. I suppose the other hidden ones kept me from removing the others.
---
Bolstering is only better if you run a low hp build (lots of rads). Its also better as a set or with unyielding at low health. Out of the 2 I'd say the hunters for low level.
---
I would say maybe along the water near the left side of the map close to vote 76 and the mothman museum. [Right around here.](https://imgur.com/a/UUcHn0A)
---
You can find a lot of places that are flat next to wavy willards kinda south east of it or you can find some good spots in the very middle of the map that are somewhat flat next to some cliffs
---
also I know the jet thing breaks lor3, but I like that it implies Myron is a lying, credit stealing little shit haha, be he genious or not
---
You should get help for that...
---
Probably, but nah
---
It's needlessly painful to use, and the conversion rate is borderline criminal (though that's a minor issue).  It would be hard to imagine a more inefficient way to make this happen.
---
That said, one of the devs or CMs stated that they're looking into redesigning the UI, so there's hope that it will improve.
---
thanks for the heads up, i was pretty much prepared to skip all the NW challenges.
---
I'm being serious, that's kinda worrying man.
---
I love the idea but unfortunately the technology isn’t advanced enough yet for this to happen.
---
New Vegas’s VA for Jed Masterson (Honest Hearts DLC) is on a Holotape (Requiem for Kelley) found in the Cranberry Bog (Lost Home).
---
I swear I thought I was about to receive an invitation to join the Happy Trails Caravan Company until things took a tragic turn.
---
Similarly, the VA for half of the NCR in NV + Alan Lee in the Far Harbor DLC for FO4 narrates two of the holotapes (Message to Marge 1 &amp; 2) you can find at Camp Venture.
---
high value comes from rarity.  
---
if there would be only high end drops, we'd just be selling outfits with 0,x% chance to drop and teddy bears.
---
Everyone, as long as they did damage to it
---
Thank you!
---
Get a couple hits in and you should be good.
---
still working on rank 3..I don't pay much attention to the challenges so if it happens it happens..
---
Hell Na
---
Thanks a bunch! Will do!
---
This is the point of the post
---
Oh okay cause when it went down I bolted to see wht it dropped
---
Legit put about 800 .50 rounds in it
---
Get that shotgun out and equip 4 leaf clover. It is a VATS monster.
---
Hey if you see that as something that breaks lore enough to write the game off as non-canon, who am I to argue that?
---
I was just curious if there actually was info on Hellfire armor in the game cuz I'm a lore junkie haha
---
Thanks for responding and sorry if I seemed like I was telling you how to feel about the armor being in game, I just type alot of words XP
---
Hey, do you have any more details on the survival tent trick?
---
I'm about the same, been pretty casual about it and not really grinding group events or experience.  I'm sure it will get harder as time goes on (it's 1000 for the first level, then +25 more per level after that), but it doesn't seem like it will be hard to get a long ways into it.
---
As far as getting to 100...I'm betting it's designed for revenue, so expect it to be a real slog to get there.
---
rank 14 without any NW, im happy.
---
You have to add a little raw fertilizer.
---
Imagine being able to write letters to people!
---
Think I delt the final blow that popped his head 
---
Didn't let up on the right trigger
---
Bethesda has gone retro, they're bringing back the old bugs. (This occurred right after wastelanders went live, any object placed in your stash while your camp couldn't be placed would result in items being randomized in your display cases and in your vendor) 
---
I got a gold cup chilling in one of my stein cases now.
---
do you know what happens if you claim the caps or junk boxes when you first boot up the game? like before you choose a character and pick a game mode?
---
Hey thanks for the upvote and you are very welcome! The system for building can be so nonsensical, it makes sense this isn’t widely known
---
Yes that it's permanent, right?
---
I read this, and all that came to mind was a pair of bowling shoes with RGB in them
---
just put game on in background and watch youtube or a movie. or have it up on one screen and watch on another
---
If you sided with foundation, no reason to put it off. If you sided with raiders, you might want to wait until level 50 for the max level named weapon. I say might because the weapon doesn't appeal to everyone.
---
Best not to put off the dailies too long though.
---
If you need the weight mitigation, go with them.  
---
If not, I prefer Overdrive Servos.
---
15 now but thats because dailies are auto completing for me.
---
That was the Free Range public event which ends with the Sheepsquatch appearing if you keep at least one Brahmin alive.  The  legendary level of the sheepsquatch depends on how many Brahmin were kept alive. 
---
Get a hit on the sheepsquatch to get the rewards.
---
Check out videos by [Jug](https://youtu.be/2AyA3qa8X24) and aswiftkickinthejunk[aswiftkickinthejunk](https://youtu.be/B2umzS1zpgs) for even more tricks of the trade!
---
lol thats gonna be much easier and faster than 10k xp
---
its free ammo, put it on what you need (not .50 it's bugged) and forget bout it.. check it ever so often for free ammo
---
is no one going to ask where his legs are?
---
And? Thats how the game survives.
---
Granted, no more vending machines.
---
No i think it was in the pharmaceutical building didn't see any Brahmin 
---
Luckily I got a 3 star 10mm sub machine gun, would like to get a legendary LGM
---
Seriously. When I heard that they were going to reward gold I thought finally ~~someone with the guts to help~~ a way to get gold without grinding out treasury notes.
---
But it's like 25 a pop, maybe 300 for the whole season.
---
Ahh..Arkos and the Project Paradise.
---
Get a couple of pieces of troubleshooters armour, makes it a lot easier.
---
Can you tell me what gun that is? If it doesn’t appeal to me there’s not reason to keep putting off the raid.
---
To many posts to read but i think the weekly will pay up at end of the week when there finshed? Only thing i can wrap my head about over it
---
No, not at all
---
How so?
---
I ran it for the first time a few days ago. It's just tedious and has horrid rewards. Never had any legendaries spawn either. The whole thing is a bullet sink and I'll likely never do it again.
---
Wings can no longer be crippled.
---
Yes edited it
---
Yep that should be the one 
---
Was overly generous with sheepsquatch and unloaded like 800 .50 cal rounds in him.
---
All your resources are belong to the proletariat.
---
Ok thanks i will be scripping it
---
Your head’s in the right place
---
Final Word is an AAFFR .50 cal and I would say it's better than 80% of all random weapon rolls
---
Just make sure not to scrip other weapons with AA or FFR, if the rolls are good enough they can be worth a lot.
---
Never said anything about owed or Bethesda missing out. The question was if I hate the system, and I do because now I can't work towards the items I -want- in the AS in a fairly short timeframe.
---
Ok. Elder Scrolls Online. Free items for logging in. No minimum time required, no fetch quests, no other gimmicks. Log in enough times throughout the month and you'll get one or more premium items. Also full of content but gameplay gets old fast.
---
You're right, I was never buying the item with my money, but I was certainly paying with my time to play specific parts of the game to work towards the item. I agree though, 76 was pretty generous with the free currency, which is not normal. I knew that I could get at least one AS item I wanted each month if I just did the dailies and weeklies. Whereas any other game I'd have to buy their currency or have a premium membership. On top of that, each character has challenges they can still complete for atoms although most are one and done.
---
My point being, were I Bethesda, I would think this system change would inspire/force more users to purchase the items they want in the AS instead of just play the game. However, those that just play can still be rewarded, but they don't get to choose what they want and they may not be able to get them all, especially if they're casual non-daily players, thus coaxing them to purchase atoms. I play daily, so I have an okay shot at getting most or all of the season items. So instead of bothering with the AS, I'll just play like I have been and be fine with the free stuff. Occasionally I'll gather enough atoms for something neat in the AS and I may buy it or keep saving. 
---
Regardless, the system change was very much a move towards fewer obtainable atoms.
---
Oh I thought it said Gatling Laser haha yeah that's trash
---
I had the same issue. You need to drop whatever note it is that's setting it off. You'll know it's the right one if it tells you that the item can't be dropped, only destroyed. Once you destroy it the message will stop popping up.
---
Calibrated shocks is a leg mod, right? Or is there some kind of exploit for the T-65? Literally a cart before the horse scenario OP
---
There are 47 songs. Diamond City radio had 37. Radio New Vegas had 13.
---
Yeah man, your getting bulldozed if you try that shit
---
2%
---
Why tho
---
I made this same comment to a teammate today
---
The bubble pop noise that the cursor makes as you move it around the Legendary Run game board is sooooi satisfying. I think I spent a good 3 minutes just moving the cursor around... Ahhh.
---
Seems to be a bug after patch 20 hit. You don't actually pay the caps to travel so don't worry.
---
Because video game addiction is a real thing. You sound a lot like me a couple years ago.
---
Been thinking about getting it! I got a torso piece with ap refresh and 50% fall damage and I feel like that would be good for the jetpack!
---
Oh ok. Ya I had to hop off because everything is kinda screwed up at the moment in my game with the server.
---
Thanks for the info
---
God damned raiders.
---
I'm not actually sure, but I \*assume\* it would go to whichever character of yours is active at the time.
---
Small satisfaction from grinding in a game is not an adiction although i know that is what most adicts do is deny lol. Thanks for the concern tho
---
Same, almost every time i claim something i do that lol
---
It's shocking how few people are teamed up.  I've been on nearly full servers and I'm the only one with a team and I'm the only one on it.  It's really weird, you get SCORE for XP, so even if you don't care about XP like me with 50+ perk points unspent, I'd think most people would want that SCORE so they can get that ugly paintjob for the T45 power armor no one uses.
---
Yes because it simply is. Now the question of weather or not I want it to be considered canon? I have to say yes and no.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes because I like the idea of the characters I played in 3, NV, 4 and 76 being in the same universe.
---
No because I don't play 76 like the others. In FO3, NV and 4 I am playing a character and living his life and telling his story. In Fallout 76, I am just playing a game, looting, shooting and general fun. I came up with fleshed out backstories for my characters in 3, NV and 4. In 76 I just made my FO4 character again and threw together is ridiculous story that the FO4 version of him got bored one day as Director of The Institute and decided to one create a time machine and two create a synth version of himself and send him back in time to Appalachia.  
---
So if they made it not canon, they could go all out. No real boundaries. We could have BOS, Enclave, Caesar's Legion, Tunnel Snakes, Institute, Railroad, Minutemen, etc. There'd be no limits and that'd be kinda cool.
---
Doesn't work, Queen can't be crippled anymore.
---
Maybe the light has been inside of you all along.
---
those are worth 8 to 10k but good luck!
---
Yeah no matter what it's going to take a long time to get to Max rep with both factions so the sooner you can start those quests the better. Everyone says it's a grind. But if you're anything like me I just like playing the game so  it's more something I get to look forward to if I put the work in as opposed to something I MUST HAVE or I won't like the game anymore.
---
Pick a build and spec special for that right away.
---
Get as many of that builds cards along the way, if you can’t get the right card, save the levels and chose later.
---
Inspirational, cranberry cobbler and well rested as much as you can.
---
They’re both garbage
---
You’ll likely need to trade for one as the other person said 8-10 k. I’ve seen them go for 30k
---
buy plans at whitespring from pendleton, itll add caps beck to the pool and give you some cool unlockables, cards for encryptid, camp hop looking for those last few plans
---
Imagine this would b voted as the worst fashion fails in the area of fashion design in online gaming. Lolz
---
Lol less than an hour? You could almost always get them done in less than 20 minutes before the update. Now they're so simple you don't even have to go out of your way for 90% of them. Really should rename them from "challenges" to "misc. tasks".
---
Just what the game needs, players AFK all night hoping caps would dribble in.
---
Yeah I knew it got mine already just want one for Beckett lmao haha!
---
I only encountered it once and with a bloodied build, i am avoiding the radiation zone completely
---
hell no, Final Word shreds shit.
---
People are pretty sure it's a bug, there hasn't been any mention of this stuff by Bethesda
---
Lost 1000 score for killing robots and now greyed out as completed.
---
yeah you're probably right, I hope that's how it works haha
---
Bethesda should definitely 100% add in some good hots from Little Richard, Everly Brothers, Fats Domino (Doubt they'll be able to add any songs from Dion, all because of that bullshit 'lawsuit' speaking: Did Bethesda even do anything about that?), David Bowie, Fleetwood Mac, Mamas and the Papas. 
---
I mean that's a no-brainer right there.
---
Yea, the only thing you lose is the tent.
---
The game has lore regarding the armour: Stanislaus Braun (who created the G.E.C.K.) from the infamous Tranquillity Lane had ties with Vault-Tec. The armour is a prototype version developed by the Enclave. The armour was sent to Vault 51, because ZAX impersonated Dr. Stanislaus Braun... Hope that helps you! 
---
The game is canon as far as I am concerned!
---
The unlockables from Xmas, halloween and whatever the event in may are glitched to unlock right now, but theres no tracking. Thankfully xp stacks for all three so you can unlock them easier. I'm looking forward to the pumpkin combat armor paint.
---
Ranger District Office usually has one in one of the side buildings; you may have to server hop.
---
Awesome thanks do you know if there is a schematic so I can craft a high-level variant
---
I can vibe with that
---
Is this found via the NW holotapes? I haven't found them all myself yet lol
---
Its far below imo, warframe has the best premium currency system.
---
Well, the Mr Handy Blade stayed in my inventory forever and was only priced at 50 caps...
---
No it can go to 50 want a pic
---
All the times I've asked for help when I was a low level player, other players have always given me a bunch of chems and plans. It's indeed a very nice community.
---
Increased camp budget was something that Bethesda said was coming to F1st when they first announced it
---
piles and piles of raw fertilizer
---
Seems that developers mindset of creating a game with user friendly UI is not the aim here. Thats why the constant complains emerging online.
---
It like you buy a freaking metalic car which is powered by passengers using their feet to move it like the flintstone age.
---
This is what this game user interface is like (really a post nuclear scenario).
---
that sounds like an oddly specific analogy
---
I was gonna say the exact same thing.
---
the chest i have is a life saving/ +1 Charisma/20% weapon weight reduction only took like 20 chests to get it lol now gotta get the unyielding  arms/legs lol
---
You can always use gold to buy the one with vines on it from the secret service guys
---
because of the secret developer's room that's under it
---
Yes they are looking at fixing things up, but it's not that painful really. I was selling thousands of rounds in my vendor. I pulled it all out to see how much I could convert.
---
I was done with all the converting I could do in maybe 5 mins. Yeah there was some extra button clicks and could be fine tuned a bit, but it certainly wasn't painful or felt like any serious chore to do. We're talking about the difference of seconds.
---
It it took like half an hour to convert everything, I could see some frustration, but out of all the other things to complain about in this game, this is like bottom of the barrel.
---
14 and a quarter, didnt do the first 2 days NW though. Might be at 15 otherwise. 
---
With weekend gameplay I plan on being at 20 by weekly reset.
---
Sadly all of it is just as common as most plans the fasnacht event went on so long that it made those plans worthless I’ve dropped so many to people who are just getting out of the vault just to get rid of them
---
do you mean here on reddit? probably under user preferences or whatever term they use
---
We lured it out of the nuke zone so everyone could fight it
---
[for you my good troll](https://imgur.com/gallery/CgC2VIN)
---
Not that I'm aware of; I believe you can only find them.
---
Same. We all know a Tiffany like that.
---
Well that's why I bought 2 off the fallout76 market sub. I also kinda scrapped rare outfits which now haunt me
---
And since I’m max caps on 5 characters, where do the caps go????
---
Oh man, i think i know that Denny's
---
People are just completionists which is why they want it, but it is surprising how few people are actually teaming up
---
There are some subs that are good for trading
---
That sucks, so I can’t ever place a camp there?
---
I really hope bethesda will never take back the rewards if they are glitched lol i really like that stuff
---
Where’s that?
---
a community manager confirmed it's unintended a while back
---
it will probably be removed by the next weekly patch on Tuesday morning so grind if you want em
---
Out of curiosity did you look at the link and see all the pics? There should be at least a couple that are rare that I didnt get from fasnacht
---
That'd be awesome! and even more blues like Howling Wolf, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson etc, but not even.. There was so much good music from those eras that is undiscovered and lost to the ages, and alot of it (even the mainstream stuff) is loyalty free by now.
---
I do agree it needs more solo content, but I'm not going to ignore what the game is offering
---
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/
---
not directly on it, but a bit away from it
---
The Secret Service will think the Brotherhood are traitors to the US (if the SS know the origin of the BOS) or not care. 
---
The brotherhood will think the SS are cowards, and keeping tech that the BOS could use. 
---
Either way, there's bound to be some tension, and I'll be very surprised if there isn't.
---
Yes i was searching if it was a new event but found nothing! Really cool stuff lol
---
Apparently someone left an even bigger one in your cereal
---
Sausage and old man effigy have some value
---
I doubt they could it they wanted to.
---
I just looked right before you commented and I see a few that are worth a little more but for the most part a lot of plans were duped and turned to be mostly worthless sad to say for those who actually worked hard for what they have.
---
My junkie commando is the most fun I've had in 76. Ammo costs make it unviable for me to do long term, so I spec to rifleman to play daily, but when it's time to kick ass and chew nukacola bubblegum: I hit lucky hole mine up, make some ammo, pull out my guns, switch up the perks... go to bed, but the next time I play  I kill. A lot.
---
Because the game probably isn't making  enough money to continue being supported and unfortunately fixing current issues and improving the current game doesn't make enough money compared to hyping up a big new content update
---
I'm just up the cliffside, but you can build right up to the yellow house.
---
yea it was given to everyone accidentally 
---
its supposed to be exclusive to the tricendential edition, so it's been removed from quite a few people 
---
unless you do have that edition and are still missing it,  in that case you should contact bethesda
---
Link isn’t working..... I’m on mobile that may be why
---
I was sorta on the fence on what to buy, was gona make a final decision once i had enough to buy a full set of either t-65 or ss
---
Please fix this bug Bethesda. Thanks. CAMP objects should only have the green outline if they can be placed.
---
If you use a shotgun, 4 leaf clover is a must. But really using a shotgun at Westtek is just a waste of ammo. Your weapons suck, look for instigating or give bloodied a try. 
---
A bloodied build can clear Westtek using 30-40 rounds using a lever action rifle.
---
Oh wow ok.   I thought I had purchased it in the atom shop.  Oh well   ok thanks
---
Well when it comes to presents people duped the crap out of them...at one point I was shopping at a robovender and a random person came up and gave me 500 and ran away like it was nothing so it's kinda hard to judge it's worth based on presents to me. And you can get it still in game just by playing and getting the drop eventually. So it's really up to you what it's worth. 1000 presents will get you to 30 k twice at least btw.
---
I think they want risk vs reward. While it would be nice, as mentioned, what balances the near-perfect camo is the complete lack of resitances. Would be a different story if you were near invisible AND also be in scout armor. That way you HAVE to be stealthy with it.
---
Also you can craft and gift super op stuff to your low level. I started with a shielded jumpsuit, nice armour, stims and radaway. When they leveled up to 15 I gave them some legendary gear that I bought cheap from vendors, and a fully modded handmade with 5k rounds. Plus 10k caps. Level 15 life was way easier and leveling up was faster.
---
I believe it is located on one of the terminals inside the actual vault. I can't remember exactly which one, but I believe it's in the room with the mountain view windows. 
---
It's really interesting the ZAX machine actually copied Brauns writing patterns to mimic him perfectly!
---
I figured most fasnacht ones would be "rare" and had decent value. Wish I hadn't learned the sausage one early on so I could have collected a few more
---
3 clicks per 30 rounds when Ive got thousands of rounds to convert. Not counting misclicks, it’s easily 5-10 seconds per conversion accounting for terminal text load times.
---
Thanks for this, noticed it was gone and was wondering about it ever since
---
no problem, I was confused about it too and nobody seemed to know why at the time, so I know how it be lol
---
Wouldn't be a bethesda update without new bugs!
---
To be honest the presents were duped so I wouldn’t trade for them or other stackables. I’d wait for other outfit offers in the least, but that’s just my opinion.
---
Unless you want another 500 mounted cat head plans you’re not sure what to do with.
---
do you know which reddit app you're using? just the "reddit" one or are you using "rif?"
---
I bought 2 for 500 caps each from a player 2 days ago
---
I’m level 140 and I’ve only been griefed one time. Is it really that prevalent for others? Is there a difference in player base by system? I play on PS4 and most everyone has been pretty cool.
---
They can...radicals mask for example.
---
Only Nazis in the game are the enclave
---
Cranberry Bog. Right below Robco industries, there’s a lead deposit and it’s sooo F L A T out there. If you can handle the higher level mobs.
---
There's also one on the table in the WV Lumber Co. It's the mill you head to as part of the Wayward quest line.
---
Update 21 will bring the Wendigo Colossus boss, which is much harder than the typical wendigo Colossus
---
That still hurt... Lol
---
👍👍👍
---
just happy to give some info before mass hysteria haha
---
I’m just using the reddit app
---
What system do you play on? I have the plan on Xbox I could toss on your way
---
I don't understand these "level 1" players they got explosive handmades and they're melting the sbq. Even the game registers them as 1 so idk what's going on
---
Ha! Could you imagine never being able to place your camp because all the spots are taken by AFKers.
---
The level ones would obviously not get any loot, but I someone did enough damage earlier, my anti armor explosive 50 cal was doing 4 damage and when she's on the ground 5 damage. 
---
I don't know where I Saw it, but I think the threshold is 1,000 damage, they just need to fix it so you can't one shot it or kill it 2 quickly
---
Yeah I bet I read about it being one of the few legendary clothing items and it must have been an old article online got so excited when I found one in a player vendor for cheap snatched it up before I looked at it. Went to equip and damn...no effects on it. Least it was only like 300 caps
---
I'm in PST and it say reset in 10 Hours, 46 minutes though?
---
There is no plan for the chainsaw, only static drops.  Mountainside Bed and Breakfast basement also has one.
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
3. Logging into the game and a challenge is just already done or partially done.
---
I just logged in for the first time since this launched. 1 of my weeklies is done(I have 0 SCORE &amp; again just logged in for the first time) and 1 of my dailies says 1/3 on kill Legendaries.
---
I’ve experienced many legendary-designated enemies at WES that aren’t actually legendary. 
---
Just do leader of the pack for three easy kills and 3-4 scrip items.
---
All I ever get are bloodied weapons. I hate it, it has to be the worst legendary effect ever. Why would anyone ever use such a trash effect that basically means you die in one hit
---
I missed the first couple days but I think I'm sitting at 11 or 12.
---
I never seem to do well hiding in bushes. I suspect the bushes are in cahoots with the other players.
---
on bottom right you see the message symbol yea?
---
tap that and then on the top right you'll see 3 dots on top of eachother, tap that and then choose "notification settings"
---
that's about all I can be of assistanxe with lol, I don't use that app
---
good luck with your emails dude
---
Incorrect, my gf just started playing NW and is unlocking items in the Ghillie suit line, I saw her unlock the loveseat after her first game yesterday
---
no it wouldnt, you just make junk items not load until you actually enter the settlement zone and make them non-physical after placing...
---
Yea I already checked those it doesn’t give me an option to disable them😑
---
Arktos pharma is good too
---
I made a bunch and sold them for 20 caps each in my vendor.  Same with the Insurgent and Treasure Hunter outfits/hats.  They went FAST.  If on XB I can hook you up tomorrow.
---
I don’t think it was ever intended to be learned by scrapping it.  Do any items that have plans do this? (Outside of recipes) 
---
It was a rare drop along with the Insurgent outfit during the Miner event.  I was lucky enough to get both on my alt character.  I always have one for sale in my camp but they rarely sell 🤷‍♂️
---
According to the roadmap for the season, between July 23 &amp; 27 there will be a High SCORE Weekend, which will have double dailies:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates
---
Less, but still somewhat useful, between July 16 &amp; 20 there will be a double EXP weekend which should help grind the repeatable challenge.
---
All that being said, I think the real concern is that the implied 10 week limit, which would suggest that the season ends around September 8th, is too tight. 
---
If instead it ended on September 22nd, which matches the end of Summer &amp; beginning of autumn, we would have 2 extra weeks that would give a larger margin of error.
---
Lastly, according to a prior Inside the Vault article, aside from dailies &amp; weeklies, you could also earn SCORE constantly by earning EXP... and doing public events:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons
---
Quite honesty I haven’t been paying attention to whether events add any SCORE (which makes me assume they don’t), but they are supposed to, according to Bethesda.
---
Given the EXP requirements for an extra 100 SCORE, I don’t expect Public Events to provide a significantly better source of SCORE (which might be the reason it’s hard to notice if it’s actually doing so already), or may need to reach a events completed milestone to actually give the bonus.
---
Alternatively, I guess they could be “alternating” the weekly repeatable, so perhaps next week we can get extra SCORE from public events, but won’t get any from simply getting EXP, which needless to say, would be one of the worst scenarios.
---
disabling every notfication doesn't also disable the emails? that's annoying af
---
sorry I cant help more
---
you could always just delete your current reddit account and make a new one without linking an email tho, using an email isn't necessary for reddit account creation
---
that's all I got lol
---
Yea that’s true it’s just annoying maybe if I just go to my email and block reddit 🤷‍♂️
---
thinking outside the box on that one lmao good idea
---
I wanted a pillow for my bed.
---
I also would like to cover the bed with the horde of teddy bears I've collected.
---
I get about 1000 .556 a day from mine, so I think it’s worth it!
---
I bought 1 .45 ammo from my gf for 5k caps
---
Screw your money, I have your grandfather's soul trapped!
---
Bethesda's been breaking things and selling players the solutions for years. The only difference is that now people seem to mind.
---
Make railway spikes and convert them to other ammo. It's a great way to dump steel and get ammo when you're out of Acid/Lead
---
Holy shit I actually did not know this
---
It saves the last menu item you selected so just spam the button to speed up the screen text load to quickly jump to the next menu. Clicking your left mouse or A button on a controller always bypassed the text load animation on all terminals since the last couple of Fallout games, thus speeding things up.
---
I got one auto completed last night but I also got the points for it, but if you don't get the points I can see that it's an real issue and let's hope bethesda looks into this asap.
---
Oh nice! I had no idea cause I did unlock those earlier, and hadn’t seen anyone mention it before. But thanks for the info, that’s good to know
---
Right.. But without a proper trade interface the only way to safely trade items is by using a courier. That shouldn't be the only way to trade without risking getting scammed.
---
There. idk what exactly it is but Some sort of a Bundle. I assume its gonna be some sort of camp, skin,atom etc.
---
should be easily possible, especially if you go ham on the double xp weekend
---
is there any reward in particular you're worried about not being able to earn?
---
I really doubt money is actually an issue... I mean they're about to start making a tv show.... that costs a LOT.
---
Being less greedy than EA or Activision is hardly a high bar to pass. Besides, it's one thing to have a system that rewards Atom infrequently at launch, and another to artificially restrict supply 2 years into the games life span.
---
Im  at 14 or 15 too, just done the dailies, weeklies, NO NW crap, its just about 250-500 anyway, Illl just do the repeatable 10000XP thing couple times extra.
---
And it is at that point your server gets hit. What do you think all these items being rendered does to a server. What if 2 people enter the camp.
---
What does that 'nobody cares' decal say on the rear window? 
---
 I think the 76 vault looks good.
---
Out of curiosity which platform are you on, because my friend has had this problem from before patch 20. It's always when you have say between 7 and 15 shots left in a weapon and your character just starts reloading the gun and you're like 'wait no, finish the magazine before reloading'.
---
Hell, I've had Ultracite cores with well over 50 shots left in them get ejected for a fresh one for no reason.
---
God knows what causes it but its definitely a pain in the ass at the most inopportune times.
---
None of them are worth much sadly.  The rare mounts WERE valuable until the gift dupe, same with the Plasma Mine to an extent and the T45.  The Fashnacht stuff will sell in a few months to new players that missed the event, but the dupe was SO bad that it just killed the value of all the plans that could come from the gifts except maybe the Heavy/Sturdy Raider/Metal plans.  I found multiple bags of plans at train stations just after, dupers killed the value.
---
Nope, sorry, not going to remove Inventory management and Perk load-out mods, because NW doesn't launch with modified game files. Like this helps against cheaters in this mode... Plus the challenge auto-completion bug seems to be related to NW, so double "nope".
---
lmao shills responding to every comment calling them entitled for recognizing they are getting worse deal with seasons then they were before.
---
some top tier pay piggy shit. imagine being so whipped by bethesda XD
---
Create 2nd character
---
Transfer plans to that char with a friends help
---
Sell plans
---
???
---
Profit
---
Except for the fact that there are numerous reports where people are having challenges automatically completed without doing them, awarding zero points. Talking about others keeping up to date, for shame. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
You see that level with 250 points awarded and two 1,000 point weeklies filled in? Math is hard, so tell me. Is 250 less than 2,000 or what?
---
I’m on Xbox. Someone on pc during a streaming was watching said that they have the same problem.
---
gonna be real with u i don't even know the rewards. I haven't played or kept up with news since midway through fasnacht. i never even finished wastelanders. im just a bad meta player and grinder and the game feels geared towards that rn.
---
however if I'm gonna grind, I like cosmetics and weapons best, and this is the first time in a long time weve had lots of cosmetics added that I don't have to pay for with irl money so i wanna try and play
---
IYHO, any worth keeping aside from the gorillas and fasnacht?
---
Good score!  I foolishly traded one that I got months ago when I wasn’t aware of the rarity.
---
Have you came across the guy that's running away legit scared shitless of the chicken chasing him? That is my favorite random thing to happen in any fallout game so far.
---
11, completely missed the first two days so I've been burning through the XP challenge
---
it could be apart of the second dlc then
---
Excuse me????
---
Lone Wonderer is useless now, because Public teams are a must. You can easily join a public team with Empath mutation and get same ignore % damage bonus.
---
Seems like it's universal across platforms. My mate and I are on PS4 and as I said we've had it happen. Might be worth submitting a support ticket just to see if they'll give you a response
---
The limits on nearly every currency in game don't make sense. It's like Bethesda is actively trying to get people to play less.
---
22 grinding like no tmw since I don’t do the NW quest wanna make sure I’m close or got it all done by the time it’s over
---
I just logged in for the first time since updating and 1 of my weeklies is already completed(0 SCORE) as well as some of my dailies being partially done...kill legendaries is 1/3.
---
Have never logged into NW, just logged in for the first time and looked at the list, then logged back out to come comment here and the official boards.
---
I think it's just a visual error. I've had it happen a lot on PC, but the most recent time I was doing Heart of the Swamp I kept an eye on my ammo every time I dumped my magazine into the heart. What happened was I'd get down to 0 rounds, then it would suddenly change to 7 or 8 after the reload animation had already started.
---
I was planning too. I just wanted to see if other were having the same problem. And not just me going crazy.
---
I’d be tempted to question his build because he couldn’t tank that.
---
I’m happy it was taken out cuz I got the collectors edition and well everyone knows how that went I’m happy I still have that emote this I was upset when everyone got it just cuz I’m petty
---
Well I can't speak for the greater fallout community and other players but it definitely seems to be a problem that exists so you're not crazy 😂
---
Well, if the show has technical difficulties immediately after airing, you'll know it's legit.
---
Holy crap.... everyone knows already. This is easily the 10th post telling us. Ise the search button before posting. Like its been what? 4 days, we all know.
---
I get that too. But I’ve had mags auto swap. At queens, in UF, LB, many places around the map.
---
The dailies you can knock out very quickly. Maybe 2 hours tops depending on how you play. Weeklies you obviously have time to do aren’t too difficult. I believe the season runs until September so you have plenty of time. Plus, you can buy ranks on or after July 14th with atoms. So I say it’s way less grindy than most of the aspects of 76.
---
Same here on both. Completed and neither popped score.
---
&gt;And the Scorchbeast Gods smiled!
---
No. They made a mistake and Todd is punishing them right now.
---
Yeah but getting others to get behind something especially on Reddit can be fickle. And equally fickle when comes to 76.
---
Some kind of activity log would be great for this.
---
well the "big deal" reward that's haedest to earn at the end of the season pass are power armor skins that look like astronauts
---
I think they're hilarious and awesome so I'm definately going to try, but if you dont use power armor there's no reason to sweat it 
---
imagining going through blind, its a slow drip of actual new cosmetic rewards, but in terms of cosmetics that I actually liked, I was able to earn a few ghillie suit skins for some armor sets, a clean sink for my base, and a ufo shaped childrens slide for my base in my 3 days of playing
---
and I mostly have just been doing the dailies, the only other thing I've been doing is the battle royale mode sinxe all the limited time cosmetic rewards are available now due to a bug lol
---
the battle royale mode gives a decent amount of xp, so when I jump back into the normal game, I get a boost in my seasons ranking since every 10k xp equals 100 points 
---
I'm sure people who do the 4x event xp groups, and use xp boosting foods and perks rank up even faster
---
I would advise going ahead and looking at all the possible rewards, havjng a goal helps me have more fun anyway
---
Even bluegrass and fiddle and hymes like African chain gang stuff and more "mountain music" so to speak of Appalachian origin to suit the immersion.. Still better than Classical Radio and repeats lol
---
True that. Still a support ticket may still be worth the effort just so you can at least bring it to the attention of someone on the dev team since it would seem that they hardly ever read the reddit posts
---
that sounds hilarious, now I actually wanna find him lmao
---
At least I didn’t get my inventory stolen by hackers...
---
Second person to post about this one in a few days, do you know if they appear offline? I'll start keeping an eye out
---
Now that is a big brain play.
---
How much for one of each lol?
---
that's actually a random encounter area, sometimes the encounters will have the tent, sometimes the encounter involves the tent but not the settlers
---
if the tent went away for you, it wasn't because the settlers were killed, it was because the encounter changed to one that didn't involve the tent being there
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
Not that i saw. Tried to warn people showing up. Watched him do it to several people. Mean but interesting to watch.
---
I scripped this garbage immediately
---
 https://imgur.com/a/tU2sGSP
---
It's not out yet. I know it's shown on the legendary run update, but it does say 'future update' at the end of it. If I remember correctly there were/are a few things they still need to get right with it and they're going to be doing more PTS testing with the event before releasing it as an update.
---
If you want a legacy weapon, you need to pay a lot of caps for it. Real money. Or trade it for another legacy weapon. 
---
Nobody in their right mind would trade a legacy weapon for a regular legendary weapon.
---
It was funny to watch, irritating to experience lol.
---
reading your post, I'm not sure whu you play this game at all haha, seems like your tastes and preferences go against everything this game is
---
I'm not trying to argue I'm just really curious now, what do you like about the game then?
---
Yeah as long as they're not appearing offline I can join and hunt them/nuke their camp repeatedly lmao, I hate these people
---
I'm off for the night but I'll watch for them :)
---
With 3 hacker perks and 3 lock pick, plus Chinese stealth Armour you can do ot without any problems,  turn off the turrets , bypass the lockdown, sneak past the dominators.
---
It ain’t the sexiest ways to complete it but it works
---
The worst crime was the prices for his wares lmao
---
Don't need anything for them.  They cost nothing to make if you know the plans.  People selling the outfits for 1k or whatever are a bit out of line IMO.  I get it, they want to make caps, but they're literally free to make if you have a few cloth, rubber and oil.  GT ThreeBicycle976, won't be on until tomorrow afternoon/evening(12 hrs or so)
---
I'd be happy to just chase the rewards if only the game stopped reminding me of have many bugs it still has. The game should be a relaxing experience but the bugs destroy the immersion and create needless stress.
---
Good luck :)
---
I have an ultra cite Gatling Lazer with the executioners effect, but I can’t get enough fusion cores.
---
Just hit 22 hope we get a nice long break Before season 2 starts cuz I know I’m gonna be burned out once this is done lol
---
Closed the whole weekly challeges in 3 hours maybe, and the daily ones took around 2 hours while I was doing my regular route (raiders, foundation, vest tec, sqb, pumpkin house, white spring). Nothing has changed for me, except some stuff like "plant N veggies" :)
---
And where do you think the money comes from to fun such a thing?
---
It does, but damage is capped at 110 in pvp.
---
Everyone going into toddler level temper tantrums over the ammo converter and when Faschnat got delayed by a day or two has easily made this sub full of the biggest crybabies I've ever seen.
---
Did not know that. Thank you.
---
How rare is it?
---
No one in their right mind would sell legacies for caps
---
You no Xbox?
---
This happened to me today and was honestly worried I was the only one
---
Wait why do people not go to the white spring I always go there and no ones there
---
Indeed. People just need to take a step back and breathe.
---
Voice concerns, report bugs, offer suggestions, but stop with the raging and freaking out.
---
You’re the man dude! Ill still shoot you some caps or something. Gt: FriendlyDremora
---
I've been some drop lately, more so now than prior to the update.
---
Probably just a coincidence.
---
The combat and metal helmets have mods you can learn by scrapping them.  They're just cosmetic to change the color, but there are a bunch for the combat and the orange metal one looks good on Commander Deguerre with the short pumpkin suit.  Black Powder Bayonet is another one, still need to get that myself.
---
I love that decal.
---
Sounds stupid right? But believe it or not, my friend bought an explosive Gatling laser for 60,000 caps. The guy had 3 extra mules and since they were all at max caps he decided it was worth it.
---
haha I bet, I just enjoy experiences like this more than, say, that one fallout 4 encounter where a woman asks you to help her hurt friend in an abandoned building, and then when you go inside there's raiders to ambush you, but like there's no payoff it's just generic ai firefight and its never acknowledged by anyone ever
---
on the other hand in fo76 never knowing if one day you could run into this crazy photography dungeon dood, and just hearing horror stories about him and players like him is awesome to me haha
---
Videogames are basically just complicated slot machines now
---
Llmao
---
Bruh wtf, b4 wastelanders? Or after?
---
Exactly!  I don’t know why three level 1s was there.
---
I actually agree, or they should rework atom store prices for some of the older items
---
Halo birthday grunts.
---
I know they could have put the time elsewhere, but they still are releasing content besides this season. Meat week, the BOS storyline, wendigo colossus event. I’m sure more will come in time too
---
I’m going to assume after because we were talking about it two weeks ago. Unless he was telling me the story of something that happened long ago. Regardless. I’d be pretty happy and willing to pay 60,000 caps for that too!
---
Truer words most likely have been spoken or in this case typed, but i do agree
---
I just logged in for the very first time since this went live(did NOT log into NW first) and 1 of my weeklies is already done and 1 of my dailies is 1/3 completed.
---
All I did was log in, look at the challenges and log out to come post about it.
---
I wonder how they got out of the vault without leveling up
---
500+ hours here, have been griefed just ones with trapped camp. However that is okay. Players are different and it is fine. But the obvious thing is this community has so much more polite and kind members then others. Just insane how much!
---
They slowed down heaps in the update that added Fasnacht recently.
---
I believe you can only find lvl 20s. There’s a few spawns for them like others mentioned or YouTube it. Even though they’re low level they are a blast to use and do decent damage depending on your build. Good luck!
---
I've got a similar issue on my commando. 
---
Update 20 sheered about 200 off of stealthed headshots on WT supes and thruster shots on AWOL Gutsys on both my instigating fixer and junkies handmade.
---
 I've pulled all my perks and reset them with no luck. Body shots, out of vats, and out of stealth look very low, too, but it's not like I had those #s seared into my brain like I do the supes and Gs.
---
Calibrated shocks is a leg mod
---
Yeah. That’s what part of the gutted Fallout movie was gonna be before Bethesda took over.
---
Not true in Fallout 4 it was amazing because it had no weight. Sadly not the case in Fallout 76
---
So get the legs first I would say
---
I started to get bloodied and other good rolls only after 105 lvlp
---
I think people are just getting completely sick of how inept Bethesda seem as just designing something in an efficient, easy way to begin with. Like, why would you design it in the stupid way they did? How could they have possibly thought it worked efficiently?
---
No it’s not playing you’re kind is worse than ISIS
---
there is a joke in there somewhere about your truck crashing but i would never wish that on you, good sir.
---
Not sure if my comment went through. But I think it was after wastelanders. Because we talked about it recently. But then again maybe he was just telling me the story and it happened a long time ago? Regardless I would totally pay 60,000 caps for a legacy weapon that I want.
---
Thanks op. Unlike the other commenter, this is the first time I've seen it posted and am grateful you wanted to help.
---
Because it is actually Tiffany posting this.....
---
I think a lot of players suffer from this issue. Many of them bought it just because it's a Fallout title without any thought about whether or not THIS particular Fallout title was the kind of game they were interested in. Instead of doing some research and choosing to avoid the game when it wasnt what they actually are looking for they bought it anyway and choose to complain that it's not what they wanted.
---
I wish these players would stop making some of these complaints about the game and just stop playing it if they don't like it. I feel like they legitimately ruin it for the players that bought the game knowing what to expect and we're okay with it.
---
They’re definitely making enough money. The profit margins on cosmetics are excellent and the fo1st subscribers pay 100 a year with no further effort from themselves. If ten people have fo1st, that’s already a 100 dollars and if 5 people spend 20 bucks on the newest cosmetic, that’s 100. I guarantee you they’re making a million or more. The steam charts say 12k today. Add 10k per platform and that’s an easy 40-50k players per day. Not to mention that different people play on different days and the console player base is most likely much larger, and you’ve got yourself a game that rivals NBA 2k20 that raked in $317 million dollars last year. If Bethesda raked in even a quarter of that, they’d be sitting pretty and more than capable of funding the game for years to come.
---
At this point I’m not even sure what else there is for you to actually do if you’re not doing the legendary run. I’ve been finding myself only able to stay logged in for dailies then getting bored. Maybe a queen or encryptid or two and that’s it. 
---
Even my friends that don’t play as often have almost everything they want gold wise, and the gear and weapons were set way before that. 
---
I’m more than happy with what I’ve paid for this game. I’ve enjoyed my time playing it bugs and all. I don’t have many titles reach 2k hours played. So for that it has its place, but that doesn’t mean it don’t get old and when that happens I take a break.
---
I hear ya and totally agree.
---
This! I was wondering etc is wrong. The best time to replace it it with dodge card
---
I think they were trying to fix the bug where you can't discover the location as part of some of the challenges so they added the location as a marker but must have forgot to add the rest of the info next to it like it did prior to patch. Just my guess.
---
It definitely feels like that sometimes but people farm more legendaries once they hit max level than when they're leveling up so you have a larger chance of seeing them then
---
I was just making a note of it, I don’t know why three level 1s was there. There were plenty of high level players too.
---
This doesn't fix the issue but I've started listening to Fallout themed playlists on Spotify and playing them through my headset while I explore Appalachia. It's not the same, but it gives a similar feel and allows me to listen to songs from NV &amp; 4 as well.
---
I think with the game going free to play the chances of that are incredibly unlikely.
---
Yeah... that shit ain't gonna happen... this is another smart way to  force people into buying atoms...
---
AFAIK carnivore/herbivore just negate/double their respective bonuses based on what you eat. Meat? Carnivore doubles it and herbivore negates it. Plants? Vice versa
---
That was the first thing in my mind when I saw the board. The animation is freaking awesome! If there is a chance that person from Bethesda who did it reads it, know you did an awesome job here!
---
Couldn’t say, perhaps they were displayed as level 1 while they loaded in, then it updated?  I didn’t pay close attention to them after the fight began.
---
Well overall, it works just fine. It does the job, you don't accidentally lose ammo or credits during the process.... The only problem is people have issues with the set amounts of ammo at a time, which is low amounts so low level players can use them.... And a few steps in the terminal menu that need to be taken.
---
That's not ineptitude or stupid, it just needs a little refinement, which is to be expected since this is the first release of this new item.
---
That would be awesome!  yes, I am on xbox. My gamer tag is : Flash 126
---
 Are you in Uk? When are you on?
---
That’s kind of the point though. High prices keep their vendor stocked so people come to check then lose their junk.
---
If they made it easier to accrue atoms then there would be even less a need to make in game purchases of atoms. We think the game isn't updated enough as it is now imagine if that cash flow was hindered further...
---
Yes it is, favorite it for nuclear winter in the atomic shop
---
I totally see where you're coming from and feel a bit of it myself.  The thing is; the game is basically a huge grind any way you look at it.  I see it as a world that I can 'exist' in and try to grow and expand it; we don't always need new content to do that. Collect everything, get all the plans, etc.  
---
I've hit the wall more than once but 'Ol Todd wasn't wrong with 'It just works'.  The road is rocky, but at the very least it's a game that you can have a presence in if you so choose.  Not many games can say that.
---
Harpoon turrets that you can interact with, if you’re lucky enough to land a hit you gotta activate the reel and drag the queen down.
---
Fall Out: Agatha Christie Edition
---
I think it has to do with the damage resistance on those beasts.  If the queen or any scorchbeast comes down, I either use my Gatling Plasma or my .50 Cal.  Gatling Gun if they aren't landing and staying in the air.  I primarily use the Gatling laser against Ghouls and Floaters.  Against high health and armor enemies, I think you need more initial base damage to get through before your perks take effect.  That's the way it feels, anyways.  Definitely try bringing one of those three guns along and put a prime receiver on them.  The Ultracite ammo crafts in much larger quantities (360 ultracite rounds for the .50 cal vs 180 normal rounds per craft, for about 5 more lead and one ultraviolet flux) and fires  pretty damn fast.  Not as fast as the laser, but I think it's significantly more stable if you pulse your clip in 75 shot increments. And it packs significantly more base damage, around 85 or so before any legendary effects take place
---
Haha that's awesome!
---
Yeah, but why spend that money on development if they don't have to?
---
This whole game needs to catch up with the times. I mean realistically, why does this "MMO" not have things other and older MMOs have? A safe peer to peer trading system, mailbox, ability to swap gear between accounts, etc. It very strange that the simplest and most common things aren't available.
---
Though I was trying to be funny lol. Your 100% on that.
---
In my case, I only take PVP serious if they go against my friends, and in the one time it was serious war, was against a very bad person and I'll probably get banned on the sub trying to explain the situation, but I can agree, some people take it way to literal
---
Yea man you can have your own fireworks celebration, if you’re fast enough throwing grenades you can get a few rows going at once.
---
Parent company. Not bethesda gaming studios...
---
Behold the church created a sub Reddit name church_of_atom whe will take this savage wasteland to greatness
---
I competed the C.A.M.P. weekly and didn't receive my 1000 score. Which kind of sucks as a new player because that was a waste of 20 copper for the lights I needed to build.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
I'm kinda okay with that.  The last Uranium Rumble (?) Event I was in had 9 people in it, all one-shoting everything and running around pushing their way through.  It was maddening. I have suddenly come to appreciate the limits Bethesda has put on number of people on the same world.
---
I will never unhear this from now on..
---
I'm not running around all the time with extremely low hp,  like 50-70%, very rarely with 30% and I prefer the bolstering. I grinded bolstering and vanguard/Regen sets for Secret Service armor, was so happy to finally roll the max level build pieces and then I switched back to bolstering. It just works better for me, even though I am not a bloodied build. I do not have much endurance, my hp is low at this point, so even in vanguard with high resistance the bunch of ghouls or 70+ ugly bear doing a lot of damage. The bolstering pieces give you a chance to survive at low hp, the vanguard pieces is just like: "not my problem anymore, please die"
---
I noticed it too, its not a problem for me because I impulsively reload but I think its caused by the same glitch that made you fire off a shot when you started sprinting.
---
Lol daily challenges rewards 10-20 (usually 10) and weeklies were only 20-40 back when they were a thing. If you did every single one you cleared maybe 250 or so a WEEK. Yeah I agree it would be nice for them to give more, esp given many will have to spend atoms at the end to get to the final rewards. But so far I’ve gotten 150 atoms which is about what I’d normally get in 3-4 days of old challenges.
---
Just to give some perspective to what you’re saying
---
Today some guy walked up on my front porch (which I was standing on) and threw down a meat bomb thingie.  Then he very slowly turned around, walked down the stairs off the porch, walked a few paces, then turned around and watched.  He just stared.
---
Whack-job.
---
I mean yea but he says he's even been a fallout first subscriber so I'm honestly curious as fuck what he enjoys enough to spend that much money on this game in particular instead of playing anything else, and why the addition of a season pass causes him to no longer find that same enjoyment
---
It honestly baffles me, I have no idea what's going on here haha
---
I'd like the same bathtub full of pre-war money that I had in FO4
---
I hate to say it but I think that's what it was, omg I feel so stupid
---
I didnt use stealth so it was a bit longer than 20 mins lol but I got it done, launched my nuke on Morgantown and had all the cobalt flux I could want. Got my decontamination arch and my PA jetpack made too, all in all was a pretty productive day in the wasteland! Thanks for your help!
---
I would run life giver but I've got my setup basically perfect for me now
---
The server I finally launched it on had two nukes going on site prime and mine on Morgantown eventually lol.
---
Level 363, have seen Mr. Bandit maybe 4 times.  The Prize Bot on the other hand follows me around it seems.  Been overencumbered from all the pre war cash many many times.  Give me the Insult Bot every time.
---
Thanks. Good advice.
---
Nvidia control panel
---
Idk maybe, but after I hited that 105-110 lvl I got a lot of bloodied, junkie etc things I have never ever seen before. Even from purveyor.
---
Thanks.  I have so many good junkie weapons I don’t use.  Can’t wait to hit 50
---
Double xp this weekend?
---
Thanks. Saving till the right cards come is good. I definitely didn’t do that the 1st time.
---
I don't even care about any kind of bonus just give me the animation as a legendary
---
Only saw it once, but it came with Wastelanders.  My fave is the bot herding/leading cats; only saw it once and snapped a pic.
---
i would be down for that, if they can figure out how to do that in terms pf UI
---
cuz atm you choose your NW outfiy by finding it in the atom shop, and if they implemented every base game outfit you have the plans for into the atom shop it would be even more rediculously cluttered
---
an armor workbench in the lobby that could only make clothing would be a pretty good fix I think
---
GIGGLING

This, just this. I remember I fought this one guy for one of the Power Plants and whenever he took out a proper weapon I started to destroy him with my PVE oriented Heavy Gunner and Casual T-51. However after I killed him a few times too many he whipped out the good old Tesla Gun and pretty much one showed me for the next 15 rounds of combat. As soon as he put it away I started winning again until the Tesla Gun came out. Whole time I was bamboozling by shooting him with my Gatling Laser that set him on fire, basically making his stealth useless except ya know, he still got the bonus damage after I shot him up a bunch. Definitely didn’t know where he was
---
Yeah so ....... First of all look at Doctor Who, Bat Girl  and the Star Wars...... Oh and Star Trek Discovery and tell me your hopeful.
---
I'm definitely trying old ones in locations I'm familiar. Picked up, listened to, all combinations. Nada.
---
You monster.
---
Yep, that worked. Found it on a desk in a room across from the vendor bot.

My girlfriend doesn’t like video games 🙁 I’d give her 30k if she played with me. You’re a cheap person and don’t deserve her. 
---
Jk. But seriously. 30k.
---
Feel the same. People say the adrenaline card is broken for sure, but it feels like something in rifleman's perks are also broken. Many things that I used to oneshot with my 419 dmg  two shot Gauss rifle (from the first shot, not even with adrenaline perk) is now survive from my attacks. And the numbers are definitely lower.
---
Please, please please don't compare this to GTA... Completely different genre, completely different target audience, completely different budgets, completely different eras. As you so astutely mentioned, it will cost large sums of money to add a significant portion of new music to this game, I'm not sure why "7 songs" is the magic number for you. Would you rather have that in exchange for other development directions? FO76 is not a streaming music service......Spotify, yes. It'a also NOT an MMO, or a looter shooter. People are attaching all sorts of false labels to this game, because it is innovative and you want to spend time in it. Quit trying to mold it into something it is not, nor will it ever be. Enjoy it for what it is.
---
Here's a solution for you that is relatively free and you can implement today if you like; mute the in-game music and run a music player of your choice in the background while you play? The rest of us will be just fine with what we've got.
---
I play the game because of the lore of Fallout. I play because I can play with multiple friends when our schedule coincides with each other.
---
Basically I play it for the game aspect, not some adrenaline inducing fast paced shoot 'em up that's pumped out by game companies every other week.
---
I enjoy everything about the game other than the things I mentioned. There's plenty left to do in the game without grinding out dailies/weeklies or teaming with people.
---
When companies gate content behind specific things, things that not everyone enjoys or wants to do, it's pushing aside players and basically telling them that they don't matter. Just ask FO76 PVPers about their hardcore survival servers. I'm strictly a PVE player, but I can see how PVP'ers feel neglected especially when the company tells them that, basically, they don't matter.
---
Use your camera to find them. It’ll show up in the frame as legendary and you can see when they appear and disappear as you move or pan/tilt.
---
15. No NW, just grinding the repeatable.
---
I’ve been selling them for under 100 caps (usually 50 each) and people are actually buying. Not everyone cared about the Mole Miner Treasure Hunters! I also sell insurgent and treasure hunter outfits for really cheap so people get a chance at them.
---
How do they manage to become more incompetent as each update passes?
---
Message me on XB, I don't get notifications on my phone cuz it wakes eveyone up and I usually don't remember to turn them on.  Or here, I'll see it and can hook you up.
---
Alright dude, I think I friended you and sent you a message! Hope it was you lol
---
He’s clipping through the ground like ward on his bed at foundation lol
---
And it cost to fast travel even if you own it
---
I came here to say I prefer the Valley Galleria if I'm trying to chain explosions. red rocket Mega Stop is also amusing
---
Same I miss when there were a few people in there
---
I still sell cryptid heads and bigger monsters.  Snallygasters, moth men and shit still sell.  They are set at 50 caps like all my plans.  Everything else is on my mule so every alt I ever make will be able to make blue icicle lights.
---
That's a little mean spirited calling out your stepsister like that. I'm sure whatever issues you have with Tiffany can be worked out like adults.
---
I saw a Mr Handy named Mr Veterinarian leading 3 cats to Wixon homestead for safety.
---
Idk i never played much NW before. I have never been one for PVP but I am kind of enjoying it. I did hide in bushes but i do keep moving and try to stay ahead of the fire. I haven't killed anyone yet except my own teammate yesterday by accident. And he swore at me before logging out which i totally deserve. But if I ever do manage to kill someone it will be cool. 
---
Anyway i just have been going for  SCORE but the challenges are pretty easy so it's not a hardship really.
---
He was just being a smart ass about my comment saying that it's easier to grind xp during double/triple xp weekends. A genuine degenerate ngl.
---
But how many of you had the guts to give him your stuff?
---
It isn’t been working since update 20
---
Yeah, known bug. Judt replace with something until it is fixed.
---
I was farming it to see the best prize for 5k candies or whatever it was. It gave me 1* bloodied gutling gun. That was my last visit.
---
It is planned to be out on August 4th, see here [Summer Roadmap - Fallout 76 Wastelanders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMd-mmKwwHA)
---
It's definitely messed up.  My dailies were stuck on 4/5 and would not complete despite completing another 3 daily challenges in hopes that it would kick in.
---
Same with find a holotape.  Found 2 and it would not complete.
---
I researched the game. They even said they welcomed all play styles. PVP, PVE, solo, teams, questers, builders, lore/story buffs, etc.
---
But, as time went on, they started favoring certain play styles rather than continue to produce content for all. This isn't a Bethesda exclusive issue. All companies do this when they feel they need more revenue from a specific player base. All while alienating players of that aren't in that core group.
---
I mentioned three things I disliked: dailies/weeklies, gated content, and being forced to team with people I wish not to team with. I have friends I play with. I choose not to play with random people because it's not how I want to play.
---
But everything I mentioned is a focused part of the game, now, for acquiring a new gaggle of items. They have said this is how it is going to be. Instead of finding a middle ground to appease everyone, they are shutting out people for not playing specific ways.
---
This has nothing to do with what was promised at the start or pre-release.
---
I can live with things like Fallout 1st or not doing Nuclear Winter because, in the end, I get what I want out of the game because there was more content added to appease everyone. 
---
Now it's catering to certain players and ignoring the other players that they welcomed in at the start. That's what I'm not a fan of.
---
I’m pretty weary of putting and stickers on my car, but I’d put that on it.
---
No bro you just gotta pay for the $20 premium version
---
Upvoted for Toyota
---
"Survive half an hour" is torture if you don't like NW.
---
The highlight of my session yesterday! :D
---
My gf and I would probably be down. We should be n a good portion of the weekend. Gt is name.
---
Seasons are something for us to invest our time in while we wait for new content, I don't necessarily think they're pushing anyone away
---
80 scrip right there
---
Hey thanks for the response!
---
I actually enjoy alot of the same stuff you do too, but it just sounds like this "Seasons" content isn't for you, but the new Brotherhood of Steel content and questlines will be! You know, hopefully it will be anyway. lol
---
Bethesda is trying to cater to a lot of different players with this game, and a season pass is a really common thing in online games, I actually enjoy them a lot because I prefer cosmetics tyat are difficult to earn because it makes them feel more unique to me, like you'll see a player with the spaceman power armor and you'll be like "woah that dude played the shit out of some fallout 76" haha 
---
but I totally understand your dislikw of them! 
---
if you are really hating the idea of it, then don't even bother with it yeah, maybe take a break from the game
---
but like I said, they're still making content that appeals to what you like I think, it's not like they're only gonna make season passes from now on, if that were the case I would be pissed too lol
---
Ah - survivor stories seem to work. I used the one at the top of Flatwoods church.
---
Not a whole lot of reason too anymore.
---
Merging the vendor cap pools was the first strike against it, player vending the second and now with Crater/Foundation having all the benches+a vendor to sell+dailies there isn't really any reason to go to whitespring vendors anymore.
---
I’ll add u in a few
---
I swear any time someone mentions Todd on this subreddit, the post is immediately downvoted... we may have some Todd cultists here
---
Oh boy... You havent done the math yet did you? I am lvl 15... Do the math and you Will see what I saw... Either play every single Day or spend atoms.... Its True, go see for your self
---
i dont think
---
Spawn in the middle of the map and go directly into a bush then tab out of the game. It will take 3 rounds tops 99% of the time.
---
We should be on after noon est tomorrow
---
I have noticed that people I party up with and then go to do sbq pop up as lvl one even thou they are lvl 100 pluse I think its just a bug visually its happend well over a dozen times for me sence the new update cam out. Hope this helps
---
I've only seen this once in 363 levels, was between Sutton and Sutton Station.  Made me smile.
---
At least everyone can place statues of two of the devs at their CAMP now (...the gorillas).
---
Hum... Thank for making gaming for the gamers! I have money too, I also have brains and know what is a good investment... And paying not to play seems kinda stupid.
---
I’ll try n be on around that time
---
No worries. Just get on when you normally would.
---
huge drag.. fuckin sucks
---
Legendary scrip spending spree
---
I ran into him the first day of Wastelanders, I was over collecting pumpkins for the daily. He can screaming down the highway saying it was going to get him. I see the chicken and go "ok?" an punch it with my Bloodied Powerfist turning it into a red smear. He then thanked me, gave me a reward then continued walking down the road, and ran into a bunch of supermutants...
---
Who the fuck is half way through? lmao what. 
---
Each level goes up 25 score, and 100 score is 10,000 xp for the repeatable weekly. 
---
That would be well over 5 million XP for level 50. That’s physically impossible without some exploit or hack.
---
They will kill and die in the name of the legendary Toddman, and see the broken light of his nukes.
---
I want the bathtub full of skulls and teddy bears i had in both fo3 and fo4.
---
But honestly if the junk items cost one of that junk item to build and place,  and took up camp budget like everything else, i don't see the problem. Even if plans were required.  Personally i love hunting for plans.
---
Those are called trash. You throw them on the ground and walk away.
---
How? Unyielding?
---
How does that get rid of caps???
---
Yeah that would be amazing. It would make sense lore wise too, because only 20 (21 with Wastelanders) years after the Great War, you could probably find at least a few working cars/trucks.
---
Huh I saw one at a shop recently for like 100 caps, had I known it was rare I would've bought it
---
I’ve had this too
---
That's weird. I have tricentennial but don't have the emote.
---
There isn't one.
---
Yes. 
---
Yes, no.
---
Not really.
---
Nope. Kill ghouls, exit.
---
Thanks
---
I got the legs first and regretted it. I had to go back to my X-01 legs as I just didnt have the carry weight to play comfortably.
---
did you even read the post or just skimmed for keywords? they never compared the gameplay to GTA or any other game, they were comparing the number of songs on the radio. you're arguing a completely different subject matter entirely. also, you honestly think adding more songs to a playlist is going to change the games "development direction"? "quit trying to mold it into something it is not"... wha? is the tiny selection of songs that huge of a defining point of the game? if you add more music it's no longer fallout?
---
16th July.
---
To add to this, once you get 1st you learn the scrap box plan, so you can craft them when your sub expires.
---
Same! I had never seen one until tonight and man, what a tough sonafabitch
---
Born Survivor rank 1 has been my go-to for sharing but I never even thought about what that would do to bloodied players. Don't most bloodied players try to stick just under 20%?
---
What I would do is hire a local jazz band to make some old school jazzy ambience music. I am thinking that royalties cost more right?
---
...you mean they won’t suddenly become valuable again in half a year? Wut.
---
I’ve noticed Rad Rumble pops up way less since last week.
---
Considering I can get 200 score from just killing ghouls, I wouldn’t doubt that was intentional.
---
This happens when somoeone on your team launches the nuke storywise there is nothing to miss and the quest is just there to help with the prep and to launch prime for the queen
---
Because fallout 76 is a makeshift multiplayer mod + global overhaul mod for fo4 made by people unfamiliar with the game code due to how game industry works. I'd say a dedicated team of experienced modders, given they get paid, will do much better job.
---
Hahaha!  This has become a chronic "must do" every time I'm there.
---
It's been the bane of gatling plasma builds for a long time. I keep having to dump my empty cores after every SBQ.
---
In 6 months the holiday gifts will drop again and they will become even more worthless.
---
Ah, I think you tried a little too hard there.  1/10
---
Make a new character and fast travel. That’s the only way I got it to count.
---
So did I basically miss out on learning the steps of how to launch a nuke, then? Because I still have no idea how to do that.
---
Could you maybe explain what your xp grind is? I’m running Whitespring, west tec, and areas around watoga but I feel like I need to add some better spots where I can just take in the xp
---
is it in the atom shop for ya, may have to equip it
---
not everyone sees those posts you know
---
It's probably second to the calibrated shocks. Reasonably rare. The calibrated shocks? I have done many hundreds of queens and still don't have it.
---
It’s worth a lot!
---
Wastelander holotapes won't count. Asylum has a couple laying around that will in addition to the previously mentioned areas.
---
Your atoms don't go anywhere, you just can't access the on the other launcher. You can go back on the other launcher and spend that at any point and all your unlocks transfer over.
---
There are many guides how to do that but honestly u just need the nuclear keycard the codes are on a website updated weekly and if u want the queen nuke fissure site prime not directly try to get the zone of the nuke outside of drop site V9
---
How can you have an explosive faster fire rate?
---
I normally hate pvp but would actually give it a try more often if the pc version wasn’t so full of hackers. 
---
I wouldn’t mind losing in a pvp match when the person actually has skills and spent the extra time honing their build. Instead most the time i get someone with hacked weapons or abusing exploits to cheat.
---
If you will leave your weekly for this time than hell IT will be awesome boost.
---
If still possible I'm in.
---
I mean working vehicles are in the lore already, you could own and drive a car around in fallout 2 which takes place wayyyyy after fo76
---
I don't know why Bethesda won't like at the very least port over the mount mechanics from the elder scrolls games
---
or give us motorcycles or something bahaha
---
That’s a great shot!
---
Yup, it's definitely noticeable.
---
I never listen to the radio because of this🙄
---
flechette harpoons used to be great for getting the queen on the ground... when limb damage was still a thing...
---
turn your interior wall into a doorframe and then you'll usually be able to plave another doorframe in the same location turned to be facing the other direction (dont ask me why)
---
then turn the two doorframes into walls and you'll be able to apply wallpaper to both sides 
---
it doubles the budget of these interior walls but it at least works til they ever add actual interior walls
---
With a group of atleast 2 (but a lot better with 4) u go into glassed cavern.  Once all 4 are inside 3 of you hit the first 2 ultracite veins on the right.  But just one of the veins, doesn’t matter which one.  A horde of scorched will attack from both sides.  Once u all kill the horde the 3 that hit the veins leave the cavern and come back inside.  The 4th or other person that didn’t hit the vein now hits the vein kill the scorched and also leaves and comes back into the cavern.  Once all 4 people or 2 if u don’t have enough r back inside u all hit the vein it won’t disappear but will constantly stay lit up.  But all the scorched will respawn.  With 4 people u will have approx 40-60 scorched for each time all 4 people hit the vein.  With leader bobble head ... cranberry relish.... the perk for xp... and a lunch box... u can get between 500-800 score per hour
---
30k each , got both
---
They didn't remove the mask, just the effect on it.
---
Exactly what I thought.  I'm swimming in stimpaks (ok I exaggerate, I have them more than I need).
---
What I meant is if somebody crunched the numbers and theres a generally maximum acceptable price for other people to consider buying?
---
I set it for 10 caps each. 30 for psycho. Too high ?
---
Disagree w repair kits. Looting scrap is easy as fuck, ive never had an issue keeping my weapons maintained
---
Yes, and just instead they make it a new daily job called seasons.
---
So that's why my op shotgun does 3 damage lol
---
If ur interested im about to start up a private and I can add u to friend list and we can do some grinding
---
Good to know, but we still need interior walls
---
Spike traps? Weak sauce. What you need is a good old fashioned cannibal raider player-trap flamer oven. Roasted. Toasted. And ready to eat. With no 'aggro' involved.
---
By fibbing.
---
Ok.. let me put it to you this way.
---
I hit level 12 in just 5 hours of play broken across the first two days. Im sure with a few more hours ill hit 20 and its still week only one, of a 10 week season.
---
Seriously people are just being pissy about seasons because they're losing free premium currency that beth isn't obligated to give you. And what they have been giving is a lot more generous that other games give.
---
Like I'm a casual and no where near worried about falling short of the 100 levels. And if i do its because i chose not to play probably for weeks.
---
One usually at mountainside bed and breakfast in the basement I believe.
---
I’ve heard about that vein that constantly spawns scorched, thanks for explaining that I’m going to try it.
---
Go to the dam north of Morgantown and look in the shed next to the building.
---
And of all things he pulls out to try and finish me off with, its a mf gamma gun. Rookies, I tell ya
---
I've been dumping a bunch in the cache at the Overseer's Camp any time I see people in Vault 76, along with any other super common plans/recipes I may have on me. I figure it's the best way to get them out to people that don't already have them.
---
I've read you can miss some 26 days of challenges and still hit around level 80. At that point you could probably use atoms from FO1st if you have it and finish it out. 
---
How the double SCORE week/weekend will affect this we'll have to wait and see.
---
Be sure to give some of the easier NW challenges a go if you weren't planning to! Placing 3 camps is super easy, reviving someone isn't too bad if you get put in a team and try to follow them, most of them are fairly easy.
---
are you planning to start a band new character for this or turning an Allready created character into a gun smith?
---
That's so weird system... but what if I do some challenges while I play on steam and earn lets say 300 atoms. Will they add up to my total atom quantity or it will be like separate counter? If I decide to move back to Bethesda Launcher will I lose those 300 steam earned atoms?
---
If he has to try to finish you off himself, then he built a sad sad trap.
---
Thanks man appreciate it
---
Turning my existing character into a gun smith.
---
I am currently on a road trip and a few hours ago we passed a building with a slight variation of these banners on them &amp; I was reminded of this lol 
---
I am now debating on getting them; they looked nice lmaooo
---
I feel you pain man, even if I wanted to with my work I cant even remotely get enough progress if I played on all my off days starting from when I get home from work.
---
I recieved the points and the meter increased in the loading screen bc I always get the "damaged holotape added" when I load up.
---
I'll give him points where its due, he really went hard on the trap he must've spent at least 40-50 minutes stacking each spike board to make a square cage out of them that I was immediately able to hop out of lmfao
---
I fully agree yeah, just giving some work arounds
---
oh if you get the brick building plans, the brick walls look pretty nice for interior walls!
---
Wow, lucky, everyone seems to ignore me lol. Ive been playing a couple days now. My problem im running into is trying to get better gear when I seem to lack specific junk items even though it seems like my stash is getting full. Its confusing
---
FYI, I keep posting the dailies here: [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html)
---
And those 1500 atoms for sure are meant to be used in the board's last 10 levels if you don't smartphone login enough.
---
 AGREED! I just spent like 2k on plans I didnt have mostly power armor for like 50-100 a piece
---
Hi, I’m a melee pa player and I farm Burrows all the time if and when I want to level up.
---
Burrows is good for easy killing of ghouls, farming of gut shrooms for xp boosting soup (although they seem to NOT be respawning as of this last patch), and legendaries. Usually there’s 1-3 of them there depending on your luck.
---
Brain Bombs. Wasn't remembering those! Thanks!
---
u/R1shathra I think you didn't read my post properly. Im just talking the in game radio. Secondly the argument of using outside apps to make the game better can be shunned on. Look at all the cheating and hacks in Nuclear Winter with aim bots etc using out of game apps.. It's not as big and serious obviously but similer. We shouldn't have to "hack" the radio to get it working like a normal radio station should be..
---
Getting a few more royalties to songs, even royalty free ones isn't a large sum to a business like Bethesda at all. It is a streaming radio as far as i know. It's running off their servers wheather you are listening from a radio or your pip boy it all syncs up..
---
And lastly it is Bethesdas responsibility it fix all areas of development without sacrificing one for another. Just because they released the game so undercooked doesn't negate that. F76 may not have made MMO status yet, but it's still a MO. It's only restricted by their player cap on their servers for stability.. But getting back to the radio, it's lacking tunes lol
---
What I do is set the price just over what you would make selling them to a robot vendor.
---
No friend. That's not a trap. That's just sad. I run a Gourmands oven. It doesn't matter what level you are. I burn you alive. No muss, no fuss. None of this bs 'stick' crap. And it doesn't take me '40-50' minutes to setup. That's the kind of person who makes kill houses look bad. Sorry you had to suffer that loser wanna 'trap'.
---
Neither?
---
That's it, thanks!
---
Especially if you save these for a level close to the end!
---
The NW doesnt count since the update was challenge isnt NW which is stupid but oh well and adventure should count
---
Yes! More harpoons :)
---
Separate counter. Atoms earned are unique to that client.
---
No, but they “extended the event as a gesture to the community”, the event being the one the update was for. The event is pretty much just for grinding+crafting cosmetic items. 
---
One of the studio heads even mocked people for it on Twitter https://mobile.twitter.com/NotDollie/status/1278091634895249409
---
Thankfully I run dedicated servers and only play there so we have more control over stuff. Anyone on official servers is pretty much at their mercy.
---
Like others have said, the ammo workshop is one of the few desirable workshops, but workshops in general can attract PvP players.
---
It's like an invitation, but most of the time you should be left alone with your workshop for at least a few hours.
---
Careful, this sort of bug has been related to vending machines selling unintended items from your stash. Double check all of your vendors for items you may not have posted. I destroyed and rebuilt all of my vendors and display cases after I heard about the bugs. Even after I destroyed all of my vendors, I still had 2 items for sale in my stash and I had to manually move them. This only happened on 1 character.
---
Yes and and same goes with fallout 1st
---
Yes, unfortunately it is.
---
It does?! I was just doing it out of habit from other games!
---
no problem friendo
---
Buy all legendaries from vendors then scrap them to clarify.
---
I am visiting vendors hunting for plans at reasonable prices.
---
I'd like to see some very difficult but doable monthly challenges that award more score than weeklies.  Say 2500 score for killing 100 legendary enemies, 10 SBQ's/imposters/colossi, launch 20 nukes, Obtain 5 perfect pies from vending machines  or something along those lines.  It would give us something to grind for that is more fun than just 100 score per 10000 xp once we've finished all the dailies/weeklies.  Something like this would make the grind less tedious without breaking the whole system and it would be a nice alternative for people who don't want to do the NW challenges.
---
Yeah, once I realized this is how most PvP players go about it, I pretty much stopped PvPing all together.
---
I loved PvPing at workshops during the beta, and a bit after since everyone was generally on the same playing field, and I didn't have to worry about being 1-tapped.
---
I bought wastelanders because it offered me a more Fallout like experience. Namely single player. I got to the ammo converter by accident really, and it is very useful, but I'm basically ignoring the run thing and carrying on with the storyline quests. There's obvious pressure to go teaming, with all the pop ups, but as a non headset player I simply take no notice.
---
Another game i play, Creativerse, solved this neatly : You basicaly got an display-item wich is only visible when you are in buildmode. You place it on a surface and then you can put up to 5 items on it . and when you leave buildmode it looks like the junkitems/weapons/whatever  are placed on the table/ground/whatever. I do realise that there is still the drop in performance that such a solution would cause in Fo76 but its an idea to start working from at least
---
I went from 800 to 150 on 2 characters when I finally bought 1st. So p2w
---
I have had this too. I can't kill them and they won't fight back either. Makes for a good photo opportunity mind. Got a great photo of my character snuggled in between two charred ghouls
---
The fact we are finally grouping up with others more regularly means a whole bunch more perks will see the light of day more often which is neat. Now if only we can get perk loadouts to make it a lot more fluid.
---
True, but I never told anyone they should keep a large stash of it.
---
I keep lead, steel, plastic, cloth, wood and acid. The rest I regularly bulk and sell (hence the plastic)
---
Ive been doing all of the NW challenges, but on that first day of the season I was so accustomed to ignored the NW challenged that I skipped it without noticing.
---
They need to create a 'Sweet Tooth' perk just for you 😉
---
Rusty pick soon as you enter look right by the pie machine there is a barrel with a lantern and holo tape on it.
---
You can borrow the ones with a hole in the toe already. I got plans for those other gals!
---
My Tesla has done this since the beginning of time.
---
Ok I got it. Thank you!
---
That's the 3/5 bug. The OP's bug (and one shared by some other players) is a different one. Both are a PITA!
---
The weapon is always max level and who knows if he gave rara food/drinks
---
Good to know. Thanks!

Reset is at 12pm EST for everyone as of TU20. Used to be 11am, but I guess Beth wanted it to be the same as the Atomic Shop reset, which was always 12pm. I used to take advantage of that extra hour of new weekly challenges if I wash m was close to something that was leaving/on sale. Doesn't matter now though since the Atom Bundles in the Legendary Run are so far apart and we're earning 5k ($50 if bought) less in the ten weeks that this season will last. They are really trying to go back on their word for earning atoms for playing as much as they can get away with. I don't care, Beth! I won't ever buy Atoms straight up.
---
Thank you. Allmost missed that.
---
I have a switch on my vendors.  I turn them off and lock the door theyre behind till I find something to spend on
---
You asked, I replied, I don't suffer with any lag when cooking, I mean It could be quicker, but noticeable lag? No. I just wish we could cook multiple items, not just one at a time.
---
I love the confetti it’s hilarious, definitely one of my favorite parts of the update
---
my son just started to play, hes lvl 17 i think? I gave him an owl head mask from that party event and he refuses to take it off. Even when he is choking, he refuses. He said that mask will remain until the day he stops playing.
---
Same for me. Also i've unmarked vault tec armor paints, and now i can't re-equip them either. I can use any skins except for armor skins.
---
Pick up a survivor holotape in flatwoods...several of em there.
---
Got a source on the game going free to play? I couldn't find anything.
---
Yeah I have the brick plan I’m just tired of the look, sometimes bricks stick through my paintings.
---
I think these lunch pails should be dropped from events every so often. I wouldn't mind the random lunch pails buff including the confetti. But yea I also hope the confetti outlast the season thing.
---
That's why I just grow and eat lots of melons since they give food and water in one hotkey
---
Happy for you but dupers are scum, even dressed up as santa.
---
That's what I keep telling my missus
---
I did a glitched Line in the Sand once and with the Scrapper perk I walked away with 3500 Steel. Was crazy.
---
That won't help. I bought a raider set a while back and the underarmour clipped through like every chestpiece I tried. Even the premium stuff is busted.
---
As a chainsaw fan I can tell you there is not. The level you find in the world is the highest.
---
I wish they would make the chainsaw and drill viable and drop in the legendary pool, I want a furious lvl 50 flaming chainsaw that's buffed by melee perks, drill too.
---
Is he wearing thobe? any arabians here?
---
They have actually the most basic building system and for some reason they still managed to fuck it up.  Can’t even use shelves correctly in the game, or place anything taller than a bookcase in a pre-rendered building
---
It's not worth it for the micromanaging because, much like the problem with swapping out perk cards, people forget and you can be stuck with an events bonus, whilst doing non-event stuff.
---
Also, it's exceedingly selfish of you to do so IF you have a team that doesn't stick together. You're only changing the benefit for yourself while the other members of the team not with you (which is VERY likely since Building teams tend to solo) will get pockets of situations where they lose out on up to 8% bonus they're expecting for being in the team.
---
You chose poorly
---
What is this rank thing people speak of?
---
1; What do I win?
---
2; Where do I collect my prize?
---
I have a feeling when we get instanced camps everyone will have more build budget but FO1st people will have even bigger...
---
if you put your survival tent with the stairs pointing towards the second gap in the fence from the left but not past the edge of the road towards the sonic generator. they will spawn there every time. it's fun with Fatman.
---
Refresh should be 9am PST.
---
How about a neutral third party (Whitesprings robots?) to act as bankers with unlimited caps savings account. You would be limited to 30k carrying, but could put extras in saving account.
---
I also have multiple items extra that are traded between 20k-45k range. Unfortunately I have no use for caps at the moment, but you never know what the future brings.
---
The last character you played us selected by default, so those go to that character.
---
Of course there 2 bugs, lol.
---
Someone please make this a sticky
---
Also, why not have light armor set get something akin to Action Boy, medium set +30 carry weight, heavy set Fireproof. Better than what they had proposed before where there was nothing unique about having one set or another.
---
As far as I know, patch 22 will remove hunger and thirst debuffs, so if there is any bug related to the meters, it is probably not a high priority to fix at this point.
---
Oh thank you Todd for sparing my eyes lol
---
The other two theories being suggested are that people who played Nuclear Winter on there last session could be affected, or that the last time they played they completed challenges within an hour of logging off.
---
There's definitely a strong correlation between being logged on and having the bug, at least on this sub.
---
It very well could have been the case, but the speed at which the SBQ died is my gripe. Myself and many others simply didn’t have time to dish out enough damage to get loot, and that’s BS. Considering I went through the effort of launching the nuke, I felt particularly screwed by the event.
---
I participated in two of these this morning, and both times my internet went out about half way through (AC tripped the circuit breaker) :)
---
1. Playing the game as a non inventory management simulator 
---
2. In the atom shop
---
Damn, cut myself on that edge...
---
And share a useful perk, something else solo players forget to do.
---
Right?? The people saying "I only play for the atoms" sound stupid. You play a game just to get cosmetic things for your camp/armor/pew pews?? Can't relate.
---
I believe they plan on doing something like this already since they removed legendary perks from the PTS.
---
I think light armor should be stealth, medium ap increase and heavy extra carry weight.
---
Well, it's supposed to confuse enemies about your location, right? The confusing part is there.
---
So nothing then, how do you even win the game anyway?
---
Yes! The events are finally populated again!
---
Im not sure it matters if they play or not. You get the buff from the bonds created so as long as they stay in game somewhere you get all the benefit you can regardless
---
Where is that info from?
---
They have known for 2 years and still haven't done anything to solve the bugs. I've seen dozens of posts in here from when the game released and had those bugs. It's kind of sad that there was/there is no sign of them caring about it.
---
I haven’t had any of the server connection issues you speak about, but the general bugginess in the game grinds against me.
---
It’s a cool game, clearly heaps of effort has been put into it. It has a lot of potential but it needs to get over these growing pains and start to build up some rapport with the player base through stability, timely fixes, some showings of good will and ultimately being honest about what’s going on.
---
Thanks for the info on the correct placement. I dont think Ive been putting it down right. Im surprised no one has yelled at me yet
---
You can't buy a perk that unlocks at level 25 without spending the previous 24 perk points.
---
For exampl: You can't just save up 25 points and buy "Bloody Mess, you have to choose 24 other perks (or whatever level Bloody Mess unlocks at) first, otherwise it just won't show up.
---
You know what I mean lol stop being pedantic
---
Reaching Level 46 now. I've had a number of players drop bits n bobs off over the course of my progression. Legendary items, plans, stims, 25 Nuka Cherries and other bits.
---
It really does warm the heart and it's what makes this game so good. Despite this games bugs and failings, the community is certainly the best there is.
---
No. NO NO NO NO NO I LOST MY BLOODIED EXPLOSIVE REDUCED WEIGHT LASER RIFLE WHICH I STILL HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE TO THIS GLITCH TAKE DOWN YOUR FUCKING VENDORS RIGHT FUCKING NOW
---
Xbox
---
The most frustrating bugged one for me is "Emerge from Vault 76"
---
How the f does Beth think I started playing this game? I ain't no settler!
---
There’s another meaning for pay to win?
---
What do Todd’s pubes smell like?
---
Not bothered to be honest hahaha. It was the gesture that I appreciated, I’ve learned over 50 plans/recipes now so I’m happy
---
We had this 80 years ago...nobody liked it.
---
A very mature and thought out response.
---
If it’s still on sale I’d do it!!
---
Not necessary if he knows the PA clip glitch
---
Did the SCORE reward proc properly? Someone's mentioned there may be a cooldown on it.
---
Its an important skill in a game hinged on cosmetics so heavily
---
Jesus Christ, everyone has been bitten by the Christmas in July bug now.
---
Happened to me exactly 4 continuous times on a mutant hound today... Shot it, and everytime its health would go to 0, the next second it would reset, and so on until they killed me because i stopped caring.
---
Every 180 items.
---
some low bridges
---
the gullie suit is obtainable ran into several people who were grinding for it will grinding for the older stuff myself
---
I get you man. I think for launching said nuke you should get some kind of reward like if you just snipped one shot on the sbq. That way I'd that does happen at least you get something I dont know maybe a stupid idea
---
Youve taken some awesome pics. Well done. Where is the skeleton and protectron in wheel chairs?
---
Yeah I defiantly feel that way in Adventure but what i'm really confused about is why marsupial was added to NW.
---
To be fair, Discovery got better in season 2. Something about Captain Pike being there made it feel more genuine.
---
I have a picture I took crouched down next to a glitched Mirelurk King and another I took leaning against a glitched Yao Guai. As often as the glitch happens they are still rare, so I get excited when I find one.
---
LOL...theres a lot going on there
---
Same I usually just join events teams so I'm not lonely bc they seem to be the only ones ppl are doing
---
Guaranteed recipe learning was only able from scraping devroom marine helmets.
---
Daddy Amazon is funding that one for sure.
---
Happened to me as well. It was a weekly scrap challenge.
---
Oh god, what terrible people for handing out free shit in a game that has the worst RNG in history.
---
Surely its not bethesda who's scum making a seasonpass that is designed in a way where to vast majority will not make it in the last weeks so they buy theyre way up to level 100.
---
Surely its not Bethesda, who promised to keep the atomic shop cosmetic only.
---
Surely its the people who help other players out by handing out free stuff in a game that is 99% about grinding if you want to achieve something.
---
Were doing this for the oldschool playerbase who just keep to themselves and want to enjoy a fallout game like it was ment to be.
---
With freedom of choice ,  picking what grind they want to do and not be punished if they decide not to do every single grind mechanism in the game.
---
Keep to yourself and dont go calling out other people.
---
From what i could hear, Liam O'brien voice of many characters in New Vegas, also as Allen Lee of FO4 Far Harbor, voiced a few NPCs from the Blue Ridge Caravan.
---
I don't understand their workflow. After you designed something, isn't the first thing to do is to try it on and see if it works? Typical Bugthesda.
---
I’ve died so many times running away from ghouls when my frames freeze and then go back to normal just to find myself dead.
---
Have you tried closing down steam and just using the Beth launcher?
---
It’s also full of trolls who attack those of us that actually like this game, I get downvoted for helping to answer a question
---
I don’t get anyone’s urge to PVP in a game that has auto aim and a compass marker to tell you where they are.
---
I'd say Casual fits that role pretty well, but I usually default to Event since players that wanna grind events can get the most benefit, even if they aren't playing together.
---
Need 1000 dmg
---
Me and my entire team were killed from full life in one hit from a melee attack yesterday. How did he manage that if the damage is capped? Genuinely curious
---
Yeah it’s absolutely worth it especially if you play a heavy gunner character, it’s great to come back to your base and have some extra ammo to use!
---
Really? Damn. Well, that's not gonna happen for me yet. lol
---
Depends on if you’re there at the Launch of the Nuke aswell. Have had the same thing happen to me but I arrived after the queen was mutated but who knows might be a new bug.
---
Yeah, this is why i've stopped taking anyone complaining about this game seriously. It's like a "boy who cried wolf" situation. Every issue. Literally every damn issue has been a mole hill made into a mountain. For no reason whatsoever. Keep complaining about the shit that actually matters, like the bugs or the shitty exchange rates for the ammo converter.
---
I wasn't there for the launch. Waited for the event to pop up in the corner and then joined in.
---
Don’t share sun kissed if you have people with bloodied builds on your team, it takes away all their hard managed rads. I always share strange in numbers because it’s super fun and you get even more xp with egg head mutation 👍🏻
---
It's not categoized as anything in the current game. It was classified as heavy armor for legendary perk purposes in the recent PTS, though.
---
Yeah I recommend getting there about 39 seconds before impact just so you’ll have enough time to get as many hits as you can. Bunch of high levels are out and about right now so early bird gets the worm. Good luck!
---
This is the way.
---
Beth1: "Hey, fans think if we picked the good ideas they post, and put them in game, it will improve the game..."
---
Beth2: "so... just make things more tedious, to extend existing content?"
---
Beth1: "exactly!"
---
(Beth1+2 high five and smoke crack)
---
Neither of those two work while you're crouched for stealth. So it really depends on what you do when you get detected. Do you keep on fighting? Use Sentinel's and **remember to stand up once you are detected** so the effect can kick in. Do you run away so you can hide and get to stealth again? Use Cavalier's.
---
More like 2k
---
With the new ammo machine I think less people will be showing up there...
---
Thank you! You, as well! Ran into a dude over level 1000 the other day. That's dedication!
---
This is true enough, remember that every online game has a certain amount of asshats.
---
While it doesn't justify their shitty behaviour, I garuntee you that number would go down if Beth started listening. A lot of the recent 'organised' trolling is because people are tired of the fuck ups. I promise you that number would go down if they were enjoying the game more because they listened.
---
Devs mentioned it in a interview
---
in the future if you want to drop a nuke again in the future you can ski\[ half of the bunker once you reset the power system and repair all the pipes in the next long hallway you can power armor glitch through the wall of junk thats right in front of the door way leaving the reactor area youll know its the correct one because you can see the stairwell leading up to the control room the only important part is that you dont go in to the next area where you have to break the cores or the game wont update the quest progression
---
From help.bethesda.net
---
Same. It's a power food in my book.
---
Sure, as toilet paper.
---
Sorry they can't die easier for you? I am a stealth build, that is where I put my points.  I am not going to handicap myself because you dislike my build.
---
Using a shotgun in VATS if it has certain effects (limb damage for example) does insane damage. Outside of VATS worthless. So yes I one shot things on my own, but am nice enough to not use VATS when tagging things
---
Wonder how many times people will post about not getting score? I think you’ve got your work cut out for you
---
You need to make a video or take a screenshot of the player/s doing the hacks.
---
I’ve been hoping they add more since forever. This is a 24/7 online game we need more! I was thinking maybe just add old fallout music in. Not sure if they need to re-get a royalty but still would love variety
---
Expeliarmus
---
It's clear online games are not for you. For starters, you're actually going to complain that an online multiplayer game is incentivizing players to group up? No one is forcing you to, so why is it a such a bad thing? Because you're not getting an incentive to play solo? Sorry, but it's a multiplayer game.
---
I also don't see why you're going to complain about the change to daily challenges. Literally nothing significant should have changed for you if you have no interest in them. Instead of not doing the challenges and missing out on free Atoms so you could get cosmetics without having to purchase them with real money, you're now not doing challenges and missing out on score so you can rank up without spending real money. I honestly can not see what your problem is with the change.
---
Either you should stop caring about limited time rewards and just play the game the way you enjoy it or you should put it down and probably look for a single player game to play. Usually they don't have limited rewards (although they've been becoming more and more common), you can play at your own pace, and you don't have to play with anyone else. Sorry the devs are more focused on the multiplayer aspect of their MULTIPLAYER game. Most of Wastelanders was a single player experience that did little for the multiplayer side of the game. Maybe you should be thankful that the biggest and most hyped update of the game did more for solo players instead of complaining that the game is now trying to give players more of a reason to play together.
---
I don't PVP often.  Is that 110 before or after bonuses like sneak attack and targeting a weak point?  If its after, that just shits all over the high damage low fire rate weapons.
---
Well that's true, but after your sub expires, you can only take out the remaining items in the scrap box, not put anymore in. So crafting the scrap box after your sub expires isn't all that useful.
---
Thanks! and I believe they're on the same platform, or a platform connected to the one that has the elevators to enter the Robco Research Facility in the Mire
---
Oh  I'm a console player normally and this is the only game I have for pc I dont know my way around doing that on pcs. So hopefully someone from the 9 viewers were recording it.
---
You'd really be helping that guy out a lot though,  stimpacks weigh too much xD
---
Or floating so high above the map nukes don't even affect them. Or just punching and killing everyone in that direction. Or just standing in the fire not dying. Or shooting in one direction and killing everyone. 
---
Am I ranting......
---
Also be on the lookout, because that's just one of many hacks.  There are people who can constantly see player markers, some can disable collision.
---
They want to fuck us over on the very system designed to fuck us over on atoms, I’d say the constant bitching is, while extremely annoying, justified. It’s the only way they listen.
---
ya if I ever find a passive mob I take as many pics as possible, I ran into a passive sheepsquatch the other day with a friend, I can't find any pics of him but it was awesome lol
---
I guess I only saved clips of that
---
Yes bit why would an american soldier fire at american soil
---
Also pick the perks you want I was recently in your position and I am getting there now slowly and surely
---
The same could be said for any game community to be fair. I've been playing FFXIV since August 2013 and have seen it change so much into a really refined game, and people still ask for more.
---
Granted, some things are warranted and would be good, but others are just people not wanting to work for rewards.
---
I won't lie, there are *so many fuckin' things* that would improve this game, even just on a basic, microscopic level, but I still enjoy what we got.
---
Just hand tight, Mr Handy prize bot is on his way.
---
Def not pay to win. More like pay to be less annoying.
---
You don't need a whole paragraph of misspelled rambling. "I don't mind cheating" would have done. 
---
I'll call out whoever I like, you scum apologist and likely duper. Play the game and shut up.
---
Drop by yourself in the middle of no where, find a bush, pull out your phone to watch YouTube, and move from the ring of you have to
---
 I'm just trying to get the last winter reward outfit while I can ive gotten all other rewards and i didnt come across any signs of hacking untill tonight
---
Holy Mothman
---
Good ol' wendigo bug
---
good playtesting there!
---
The atom shop items are also just copies of a fallout 4 fan creation
---
Glad that people within the community and the game it’s self are able to help in such a depressing time. I personally haven’t lost a parent but I did lose my sister to suicide at 16 so I understand that feeling and I got through it on fallout 4. It does get better little by little. Hang in there
---
Sounds about right for Bethesda.
---
My CAMP has been parked on the green at Whitesprings for over a year now, I rarely go into the buildings
---
He’s not faggot
---
That is flipping brilliant show it to Bethesda /valseek
---
Bruhhhh, after doing all sorts of event grinding it takes a handful of alt characters to scrip all that legendary junk. They really need to up the daily limit.
---
It might just be me, but I noticed more monsters spawn now on events. And also more people just tag the random legendary enemy instead of nuking it with some gauss-gatling-fatman-launcher.
---
Agreed #4 is the best, quad is great on the gauss shotty and VATS hit chance is amazing at hitting those mid range shots.
---
Same here my experience was pretty funny too.
---
Gauss Shotgun imo, better at conserving ammo, and still chunks the SBQs hp with fully charged headshots in VATS.
---
The sad/clever part is the team leader can switch the team type at the drop of a hat. So do most of the event with the Int Bonus and then switch to the Event Bonus roght before the event completes.
---
Maybe some people actually want the game to improve, but most of the suggestions I see are either to dumb the game down further or give the players something that would take way more effort than it would be worth implementing. 
---
I agree that there are some really good suggestions that will probably never be implemented, but I don't think it's fair to get on them for not implementing the majority of player requests. While I'm critical about a lot of their design choices I also really think they do care about the player bases wants. To the point it's sometimes been detrimental to the games health. They've made some pretty bad changes just because the player base was adamant about having them.
---
Lmao. You really went all out with the description there, eh?
---
I just never take the sub seriously on my enjoyment of the game. Definitely have frustrated moments but overall I still enjoy and come back daily and it’s taken over as my preferred mmo
---
gotta show my true anger on this :^)
---
*oh yeah*
---
My thoughts: it’s almost heaven
---
did u change it to another ally and back ?
---
I didn't know it was a bug, I figured my water drained faster the more you sprint, like Fusion Cores.
---
You do know that's not what RNG means right
---
Id enjoy combat with players, but im alsp level 23 and likely wouldnt be much more than stepping in a dogturd to most
---
Now I feel like a scrub.  I came back to the game and bought a pile of these for basically full price from a person's camp not knowing where they came from.  At least caps aren't too hard to farm.
---
Doubles the effect.
---
You are low health because I see nerd rage.  Therefore you don't need so much sneak, you are already at over 30 agility.  I'd move a couple points from agility to endurance and a point from charisma to endurance and run lifegiver 3.  Also, you are ridiculously strong, I doubt you need all shotgun perks.  It might be wise to downgrade each to level 2 and run fireproof 3 instead.   
---
 You'll be a massively less squishy, especially if you are running an explosive weapon.  Other than that it looks like you are pretty good.
---
Some binoculars
---
This.
---
Sweeet
---
Hey duper here, no I don't dupe guns, I dupe to help people, I help low levels and give them stimpaks, craft them full sets of armor, give ammo, etc basically set them up for a while. I do admit it sucks that other glitchers dupe weapons and sell them. But alot of us dupers are actually really chill and cool people.
---
Indeed, I set the radio punk guy in between
---
floater
---
Glad to hear that isn't just a me being new and getting ripped off thing there! But still have yet to find any shotgun blueprints and I'm trying to make a shotgun based character. Other than that I think I found an pistol plan in a vendor once and bought that with a quickness.
---
Respawn bug
---
I would pay to have more space in stash... I put some scrap legendaries for 1 cap in my vending machine and no one wants to buy them :(
---
Yea, I enjoy the game regardless.
---
If Bethesda wants this game to thrive, and make money  out of naturally, they should try listening to players...
---
Hi, heroin dealer here. Yeah I know it's illegal but I do give it out for free to first time users so that's fine.
---
Yes.  Pay-to-Win can include anything that could be considered *required* in the play structure of the game.  In many games it is rarely a flat win button but instead a reduction in time/grind required.  The nuance comes into play since the play structure can vary from person to person as well as what **required** means so it generally fall into what the majority of the player base feels on the topic.
---
I’m a heavy gunner build lol
---
Nice! The flight/flyboy outfit looks good too! 👍🏼
---
Sorry, Bethesda will do nothing about cheaters even if you have video proof. Cheaters will continue to cheat blatantly.
---
Hey mate, i would love to fight it too. Can you tell me how and where you find it? Thank you
---
Vats on the guass shotgun missing to the right consistently...grrr
---
i gave up pretty quickly on joining random groups. it's easier to just start a new public team yourself and immediately start or join an event, one or two randoms might pop up to join you but even if no one shows you still get all the rewards towards weeklies and dailies.
---
Same here “not now kid” he says. 
---
I thought for a second he had no quests tbh. Thanks for the post
---
I’m a Bloodied Stealth commando. I can still tank almost anything thrown at me including radiation. Yes, I can tank rad damage. I recommend using Nuka Cola Grape if you’re caught in a rad attack outside PA, Quantums if you’re not in imminent danger of death by rads.
---
For the love of God stop capping progress on everything. Stop capping the amount of daily redeemable gold. Stop capping the amount of sellable legendarys for scrip. 
---
And stop capping the amount of score we can get because we can't progress without just casually playing the game. Originally you were supposed to get it for events. Maybe it just wasn't turned on or its bugged or they changed their mind but its another cap.
---
All these caps are simply so we play every day. Thats it. Remove them. Theres no point other than to keep their daily numbers up. This makes the game a huge chore.
---
The lag in inventory or weapon wheel!
---
Ah, well, that explains the conflict of information. Thanks for that!
---
Lol how does hardcore drugs relate to virtual items
---
fallout stuff isn't allowed to be on vehicles because despite the fallout world begging for functioning vehicle systems and all the rp elements that can be put into them, bethesda is scared of them and won't allow anything that doesn't fly or isn't on rails to exist. but they put some spikes and shit on some parked cars in a raider camp so you can at least pretend vehicles are somewhat used...
---
I spent three days building the Americana ranch of my dreams without doing a single challenge.
---
As CAMP building is way more fun for me than some dopey PA skins, I go with my heart.
---
Speaking truthfully- these dailies and weeklies are shit you'd be doing anyway. Just check them out at the start of play incase they're sumn wierd but seriously its a pisser getting 100%. Mine today was like 5 dailies (3x Wastelanders ones and two scouts for the badges), get a holotope, do an event (God the Grafton dam manhunt you can snipe thru the fukn doorway and complete it) and kill 15 enemy.... Some other shit too but yeah holy cow stress less and just enjoy playing.
---
Its missing headless flying ghoul in the back, but yeah, pretty accurate.
---
Wrong.
---
I experienced griefing early on in the game when it first came out especially at workshops. Fast forward to me picking up the game again after a long hiatus and things have changed. I’m currently lvl 135 and seek out low level players to give stuff to, help out defend workshops etc. I still see idiots trying to engage me when they think I’m taking too long at a vendor but that just means diet coke break. Overall the community spirit in game is fantastic.
---
oh man wait til you see the actual video I'm making with this
---
The nuclear winter daily challenges and the nuclear winter mode itself
---
Thanks ikr I wish there was a version with just the jacket and pants with out the yellow bit on the front
---
owo a fellow furry, but you're probably one of the bad really rough kind cuz your flair is raiders and only actually bad peeps flaunt that around, unless you're in it only for the rewards because literally all the good shit was given to the raiders, like the ammo maker. wtf.  
---
also, what's someone who hates 76 gonna do to him in public? "boo that game sucks" or more likely just give a dirty look. but most likely even peeps who hate the game will be overpowered by the need to say ayyyyyyy to a fellow fallout fan regardless of the game.
---
10/10, would feel my heart flutter again.
---
"Team Up" emote (the one with +) has been missing on my quick wheel and atom shop since the last update as well.
---
Maybe the Bomber Jacket would suit you better.. kind of the same style but plain on the front.
---
There's not enough time in the day.
---
If you definitely want to get to 100 you can’t really miss a single one tbh. 
---
But it will get you far enough to maybe spend a little amount of atoms or be grind-able by the repeatable.
---
join the fallout community discord(you can find a link in this subreddit's description) you can surely find someone
---
Fun Fact: It doesn’t even apply in Nuclear Winter.
---
Just feel hugged from afar. Life goes on, as harsh as it sounds. i made similar experiences and depression is still a part of my life. playing saved a lot of my sanity in darkest times. i wish you all strength you need. heads up, the show GOES on. \*thumbsup\*
---
I just grabbed a tape out of a cabin next to where you deliver the tech documents for the Brotherhood.
---
I think over the next few months atom sales will plummet. They will realise that they were making more money with people buying "top up" atoms to get things they couldn't quite afford, rather than relying on whales buying outright. Maybe I'll be wrong, we'll see..
---
I have that one but I don't like the rest of the outfit if it was just the jacket fine but the under suit is awful lol
---
Its pretty easy if you can get your hand on a machine gun of and kind and a couple hundred bullets.
---
Having to click fast travel multiple times, since it exits out of the map screen when I try and do it
---
I think he means that it's technically 'free to play' now since it is on Xbox Game Pass
---
Thank you! I'll start the hunt for a good one.
---
Go to YouTube and search for this exact thing. 
---
Many videos will show up.
---
The lag while cooking and crafting
---
Same thing happened to me so i changed to the guitar girl and she gave me a quest right away. Havent tried changing them back yet
---
Am I the only player who wasn't affected by these bugs? I start to play at night like 10-12 hours after reset.
---
7 times in a row yesterday.... i wanted to join an event. This bug is killing me.
---
Same here. As soon as this latest update, he just hasn't given a single quest. Swapped him in and back out, did everything, no luck.
---
Daily scrip limit. Hate it. Where should be no limit for amount of legendary items you can exchange.
---
You can get all the daily challenges done within 30 minutes most days. Only 'revive' and kill legendaries can get you as those take awhile to do
---
Leveling up can be done quicker than you'd expect, just join a public team for the XP bonuses and it won't take that long
---
It's turned from a grind game into a mobile phone game. Log in later when your stamina regens.
---
Go into your cards &amp; it will show you what’s being shared by teammates
---
Shotgun is not worthless at Westtek. Got a magical VATS shotgun and I can also clear it in 30 to 40 rounds (especially before they broke Adrenaline)
---
Oh yeah. I had to try so many times in Fort defiance, I had to exit to desktop and try again. This is honestly the only bug that pisses me off
---
I get what you are saying but honestly a lot of things are being added and bethesda us listening for feedback
---
As an example they delayed the legendary perks to make theme bettere
---
Not only but i think we do not need things like better trading but we need more endgame boss fights and events
---
I know the ammo converter is trash but it does not mean thar all the season is trash
---
Not all the community hates the game and most of us have fun with it and being honest i am sick about people focusing only bad on things (ammo converter) and not seeing good (loads of free items)i am sure that a lot of us have fun with this game and i have a lot of hope for the future of this game
---
I'm going through a self destructive experience where I do everything possible to maximise my xp, and then play in way I don't enjoy and never would choose to without the incentive of that damn chicken coop and door, grinding to the point I just hit Rank 19 after starting the day at 16, with the mindset of getting 'ahead' enough that I can be lazy later while knowing full well I'm probably just going to burn myself out and never end up even hitting the half way mark and perhaps even disliking the game.
---
That got a tad more rambley than planned. I blame lack of sleep. Little blue bar go bloop lol.
---
Just did the weekly "gather building supplies" for 1000 score and never got the score. Given up on the higher rewards already, I can't plan if I don't know if I'll even get the score i earn.
---
Not worth the hazzle, so I'll just casually do the easier ones you earn from normal play.
---
12. Game crashed while loading on Tuesday and auto-completed 3 of the weekly challenges -\_-
---
I can't relate to your situation but it's awesome that you were able to find joy in something. Especially something that's so "broken". I put off getting 76 for nearly a year but I'm so glad I jumped in. The community on this game is absolutely amazing. 
---
If you play on ps4, maybe someday I'll have the honour of being the rando that you grind with. Stay strong brother, Seven Sixers got your back 👍
---
I'm level 48 and I did It with a revolver .44 and handmade rifle, its not that hard to hit 1000 dmg
---
'Play the game and shut up' how ironic you salty fuck, enjoy swinging your all rise and hunting down impossible to spawn moleminers with a 1% chance of getting the plan you want from those shitty pails.
---
Im gonna stick with duping them and handing them out.
---
In your perk load out you will see cards that have a group icon on them. Those will be the cards being shared by your teammates.
---
I saw some something similar. Saw a level 3 and a level 4 at the SQB battle. I still don't know how they could survive the SQB's crop dusting and spawned minions.
---
I gave up launching nukes. My last 5 nukes (made with 2 toons) was just wasting a time. I can do enough damage to receive a loot in less than 10 sec, but just  in1 of 5 events i barely had a chance. Deadly combination of fast travel bug and bunch of selfish pricks with glitched weapons locked me out of the reward just because i was able to join 20 sec after the start.
---
Yes, i see the shared cards but how can i know who is sharing a specific card?
---
Go for it, it's a great spot to farm junk. Sometimes the DC and ants can spawn legendary also. What kind of advice are you looking for? When I camped there i just build it like a floating house but I make it look like the substation was supporting the structure. If you put turrets on all of the corners, then any time you get visitors and the mobs spawn your turrets will shoot them and you can pick up the loot. One of the best spots to farm junk honestly.
---
Bruh I did it like at 30
---
I've never figured out how the trade menu works. me and my friend just drop stuff on the floor.
---
My question is, who would want to dress like Rolf from the muppets has been stapled to their armour and then vomited all over? 
---
I prefer the original textures, very few Reskins feel right...
---
Like where are the Raider or Foundation textures?
---
You can finish the daily’s in an hour or two if that’s all you do, it’s nothing to crazy, just doing the daily’s and weeklies will get you into the 90s on the rewards
---
The encounter is no longer random, it is constant. There has been a change in behaviour from when Wastelands was released when it was random, and the last couple of weeks when it has seised to be so. Every time I sign in the settler camp is there. If I server hop, it is there. That's not random.
---

---
Leave Tiffany alone!
---
For a few seconds after you join a group or change a shared  card you can see the shared cards on our teammates.
---
Yes, I also feel like I have to drink two full water purifiers every 2 minutes. Now we at least know why the lakebed at Charleston is dried out: because everyone out of 76 drinks like a camel. That stories about a Raider and a Mini nuke are fake tho. It was the Vault 76 people who emptied the lake
---
It's an analogy not an equivocation.
---
I actually don't mind the Ammo Converter. It's such a good concept and I could nearly forgive the tedious menus because of the benefits of unloading 3000+ fusion cells that have sat in my vendor for months. And your tip just makes it that much better. Much appreciated 👍
---
Daily scrip cap is a ho
---
tiffany is a slut!  all she knows is eat to hot chip, charge her phone, twerk, and do taxes
---
People can put what they like in their Vendors, eventually new players will join and want these... just don’t buy them...
---
There are far bigger issues in 76 than what JoeBloggs puts in his Vendors.
---
Never been into fasnacht hype (from germany, we have real street carnival each year, just hate it and won't parcitipate it in a game ever), so can't help you with these plans.
---
But none of the others catched my eye. If this was my vendor: 
---
-recipes: gift or 1 cap
---
-building / construction plans: 10c
---
- armor: 15c,  with the exception of those ultra light plans / deep pocketed 29 - 49 depending on armor (combat/marine maybe)
---
-PA stuff (mod or plan): 20c max, i charge more for headlights, jetpacks, excavators
---
- weapons: drop the ivory grip,most common and worthless; shotgun: haven't found the plan at level 58 myself, but shotguns drop everywhere, so not more than 49 if buyer is a completionist.
---
I would charge low and get rid of those, they take up quite some stash. Better off selling magazines, bobbleheads, maps if you are not into treasure hunting. Collect maps for some time, see if you find multiple of a spot and offerthose at once. Multiples will sell even if a bit overpriced. Ammo market is down atm, but will catch up eventually once everybody has spend their converter tokens. Maybe you can craft some armor (marine wetsuit / helmet, modded underarmor), those still sell and are cheap to restock for someone who knows the plans.
---
Some may disagree, but googleing each and every plan is too time consuming, just label them low and forget about it. From my experience after some game time you will recognize the potential value naturally (marine combat armor, marine wet suits / helmets, weapons like lever rifle).
---
Just get a minigun, wait until she lands and empty the clip everytime she drops, that's what I did when I was 40-100 or so
---
Yah I know, I'm just tired of all of this so I'm quiting the game I think. Im tired of the grind and yes the teams is fun and makes it easier but it's still a unnecessary grind. Ever sence I found out I could do 20 times more damage being a bloodied build the game wasn't fun anymore, it's just been a quest to get as strong as physically possible and then after I made it they add more stuff for me to do which is a great way for Bethesda to make me want to play more but it's not fun anymore
---
Im tired, that's what I'm saying
---
Interesting.
---
There is a lot of really flat cliffsides in the savage divide. Great view aswell
---
Do you fast travel a lot?
---
It's been stated more than once here, and indeed everywhere. But these daily limits on stuff are absolutely atrocious at this point. 
---
Scrip is the big one, and I *kinda* understand the bullion even if I don't fully agree with the amount of the limit, but scrip really is the biggest ballache...
---
Of course having said that, there is a sub service offering more stash space in the form of unlimited scrap, whilst freeing up stash space as a side effect, so altering the mechanic that pushes people to buy that sub because of all the weapons/armour they accrue daily isn't really in their best monetary interests.
---
triggered!
---
no not really, i just kinda stand for a while and move a few meters around
---
I’d rather have this than the impossible challenges of last summer.
---
Guarantee your truck quits working within a week for no reason whatsoever.
---
Keep in mind that challenge 99 is going to be much more of a grind than challenge 9.
---
That challenge auto completed for me 😅
---
Lol, I put the Bomber jacket on my Raider Punk and was surprised how skinny the pants were!
---
Remove bullion limit on the gold machine. I have over 500 notes, which grows everyday, and I can only trade in 20 per day.
---
5 addictions, 10 percent each, 50 percent total.
---
I the bully random encounter and had some moth cultists spawn there without the tent just yesterday (I check there often to try and spawn the settler merchant)
---
so if they did try and remove the random encounter from that area, it didn't take
---
at least not on pc
---
This is the way!
---
Yeah I'm at 7. I do dailies but its hit or miss if I get any S.c.o.r.e xp at all. I just want the camp items
---
No, he is easier to defeat than the SQB. Soloed him today in the overgrown sundew groove. Crappy rewards for spend loads of ammos on him. No stable fluxes, no plans. Just a two stars legendary weapon.
---
Endurance on any armor piece or under armor not working (fails to add to HP)
---
Keep in mind that 99 isn't going to take a week to clear.
---
i was robbed yesterday of 750 s.c.o.r.e. when the new daily challenges came on 3 of mine were marked done ..such a bummer
---
Thats why I stay away from the caps limit by a full 5000 or 10.000 caps. If I get close I just buy all the 5mm ammo I can because it is weightless and just blast it into the SQB whenever I can.
---
As long as you're ok with it that's good. Do the quest, it leads to some other stuff as well but I loved it personally.
---
Nah I'm a PC boy I'm afraid, but do let me know how you get on if you do it.
---
I can’t find a left arm to complete my T-45 set, or a helmet to complete my T-51b set. 
---
I’ve been running around the left half of the map checking all possible spots, trying to server hop, and every time I find *any* T-45 it’s the motherfucking RIGHT ARM.
---
i could be wrong but I really could have sworn that the XP I gained in NW went toward my Seasons XP tracker, but only when I would load back into the main game
---
I'll test in a bit
---
Yes, you get to keep it and you can take out/use all the scrap you put in, you just can't put anymore in once it expires
---
My advice would be that if you're planning on just a month, set a certain amount of time aside in any play session you can be bothered or at a loose end, to store as much as you can of everything, scrap EVERYTHING, but if not focus on the actual useful stuff you will always need, like lead, acid, steel, ballistic fibre, screws etc.
---
Scrip limit
---
Only running 4 charisma so strange in numbers/travel agent usually.
---
I've ended up with a floating camp, stairs at the side going up then a platform above the substation itself, I would have liked to build it into/using the substations metal bars or whatever though. Gave myself a fright when I turned around and a SB turned up as though it spawned out of nowhere but it flew off luckily. I'm not sure if it is worth putting vendors in. I'm trying to keep my build budget low and maybe considering securing my vendors behind some powered garage doors or something, because I heard if someone spawns near your vendors before everything is loaded in they can use some glitch to access your inventory or stash and steal your stuff. Did you literally place your turrets in each corner of the substation itself or was it on like a platform/half floor or something attached to the floor of your base?
---
Yeesh the ghillie skin on wood armor doesn’t do that. When I unlock the leather skin for it I’ll take it for a spin.
---
I don’t see the problem
---
Thank you! I missed the last adventure mode daily yesterday - just couldn't find 3 legendary enemies - so this was worth 500 score for me.
---
If you didn't get the gullies suit for NW, is there anyway to get the head piece for the armor?
---
Launch a nuke and watch them all go.
---
All the daily limits, remove them and let us play how much and whenever we want. This is not a freakin' mobile game Bethesda, you should know better.
---
Builder teams are generally just people who want to play solo with team mutations and perks.
---
But yeah for event teams you should group up.
---
It’s funny how having many public teams of of enthusiastic players grinding out these events make said events fresh and entertaining again.
---
Cheers mate!
---
If you hit the repeatable challenge you can make up the missed 250 and pick up 300.
---
Not enough to do. Having finished the main missions I can do a couple missions for a tiny bit of settler/raider rep while getting my 200 bullion and then there’s not much else to do that’s fun.
---
Events I’m very bored of. I can do some boring checklist challenges for SCORE. I can mindlessly kill legendaries for some scrip. It’s just not interesting unfortunately.
---
They really need to find a way to remix previous long story missions into something new. Change a boss, add a different objective etc whole reusing precious full story missions in a different way for items and XP.
---
I saw "the thing" last night ahah
---
If you are logged in during score reset this happens.
---
It's been a know issue since patch 20 release. 
---
Bethesda is aware of it.
---
Feel free to browse the last 3 days post your not the only one.
---
I know it sucks... but the fix is to not be logged in during score reset.
---
We'll see. They should probably be in new pts 21 and reworked for test.
---
it's like they got some freelancers from Fiverr making their assets.
---
TIFFANY you bitch, I can't believe you stole MY boyfriend AGAIN
---
😆
---
What do you want from your team and leader?
---
You're getting a buff from the team.
---
 If you're upset they're not fulfilling your desires (what do you want, them friending you and chatting over mic to collaborate?!) find a different team that wants to do that.
---
OR START YOUR OWN GROUP.
---
IIRC it's due to draining your AP bar. Or maybe that's just with power armor and fusion cores.
---
No. But if you level up your character in NW, when you load into adventure you'll get the level up score
---
Also game needs to have Outfits and Armour separate.
---
If I see 43 armour pieces for sake, fast travel across the map only to find a dozen nightgowns and fasnachht masks I WILL loot every resource.
---
Have an upvote. I miss my Yota 😢. Traded in my 14' for a  fully loaded 18' f150 two years ago, but looking back id rather have that little truck.
---
Correct.
---
I made the same conclusion years ago. Welcome to enlightened gamer status.
---
We had this and one annoying sod just kept one shotting everything so no one else could get any XP.
---
I have to go into the settings to switch between a keyboard and controller. In every other single game you can press a button on either and it would change  to the one you pressed.
---
Considering how many times they re-released and resold Skyrim with all its known bugs, I don't have high hopes.
---
There's been a history or them giving us what we don't ask for. I'm sure they prioritize what they want to work on - and if it hasn't happened thus far - it ain't a priority for them.
---
we need a new currency that we need to grind for but are limited on how much we can get each day, how much we can spend , and how much we can hold on too.
---
No.  But after level 40 or so it takes TWO days of dalies to get up a single level.  It slows down and you'd need a lot more xp to get the repeatable 100 to move up.
---
Dude, I know. The funny thing is: fo76 is (was) the only modern AAA game I've been playing... I know, I'm stupid.
---
Ive had a similar issue i just ignored it and kept playing, when i completed the 10,000 xp challenge i got the xp for it, its a piss take but dont leave your world and stick it out for a bit and in theory it should just pop up a little later, hope this helps
---
That’s great!
---
👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻😂😂😂😂
---
Open your perks menu, and the shared perks will appear "equipped" on the top of the stack for the relevant stat with a chain-link symbol in the top right of the card.
---
Wow, this is great! Ty
---
They are rather easy yeah, I did all mine last night on one SBQ fight, by accident. I didn't realise I'd done them until after the fight.
---
The vats bug, makes most shots on my lever action miss. Takes 3x longer to kill something and i'm burning through 3x more ammo.
---
also they have to change your party members icon colours on the map.. most of the time when I join a public group I don't know where they are at
---
In a filing cabinet above the train tracks inside is little room overseeing the inside (sry i dont rly how to describe it else)
---
-sigh- "Human, I'm a dark harbinger from another universe. *...Are you getting my good side?*
---
Sorry? Did you say your giving everyone head?
---
I nominate you for the 2020 Bethesda selfie award.
---
The plot was predictable and under developed. The acting was over the top drama and poorly executed.
---
I rate this post a 0 star.
---
The question is : how to see it when after you missed that brief moment where it shows.
---
My biggest issue with almost all PvP in this game is that its lil pecker twats with a PvP specific build character with a hundred stealthboy mk3's and all the drugs necessary for their build and NOTHING more. Not even a single cap on the character. 
---
Who wants to deal with that when you're trying to actually enjoy the game?
---
Screw em. I just give em the finger guns and move on.
---
I heard they were getting rid of the food and water bars altogether don't know of that's true or not
---
Keep in mind that if you equip armor it will remove it.  Have to go Berserker to keep it visible.
---
It’s not, so guess I’ll avoid splitting it. Lol.
---
Its not a bug , its a feature
---
could get a B2525 Handmade for it, but currently no luck with the fixer.
---
The daily limits. Me and my friends would genuinely play twice as much if there wasnt a cap on everything. We reach the cap and move to another game until the next day
---
That would be great thank you when will you be online ??
---
I mean, Could always just Gentleman’s Agreement it i guess
---
Best solution I’ve found is to just not be playing NW when the challenge reset happens
---
Bethesda should work it into a legendary perk. Listen to what people want and give it to them. Business 101.
---
At lvl 82 you should have 0 issues! Its about your perk cards. If you are running only weight reduction cards you will not get anything even as lvl 999999
---
Fair enough, I only sided with raiders on my main which was way above 50 when wastelanders launched so didn't notice.
---
There is a feedback form on their website you can fill out. The have hanged UI in the past based on player feedback.
---
The pied piper eye bot leading rad rats is good too. There is always one rat at the end of the line straggling behind, running in circles that has th catch up. Makes me laugh every time.
---
Why so serious?
---
This isn't an airport.
---
Departures don't need to be announced.  
---
Just go.
---
On console its fairer as we don't get hackers!
---
Hey, good question. Have you? And what happens? What does he do? Now I'm curious. Can you kill him and loot your stuff back? Inquiring minds want to know...
---
The filthy casual sub allows them but i honestly dont understand why they are not allowed here
---
Ahh Adrenaline? Other than that they have broken the fast weapon switch yet again.
---
We vault dwellers need to stick together to survive if you need someone to talk to we're all here.I personally like to think of it like a slingshot,life sets you back enough that you'll fly forward and it's beautiful.
---
if that ever becomes a thing, I'd be all over it lmao
---
Yeah this happened to me I got the score like half way through the challenges it didn't happen for yesterday though
---
You mad bro?
---
Some of us actually play our games instead of watching some random dude on the Internet play games. I never understood why people care about, or even watch, streamers.
---
Just try to change your shared card to another again (and switch it back after you would be able to see your teammates cards), it should work this way.
---
You know it Bro...
---
There are usually several holotapes scattered around Watoga Estates, including part 1 of Sideshow Snallygaster on the bar near the rooftop pool.
---
They made an announcement that they heard player disappointment in the machine and are going to make it better. I'm not holding my breath though...
---
Cause of the mentats...
---
Welcome!
---
Could you not build on Wade airport? One of the runways maybe? 
---
A popular spot for shop camps is right next to whitespring station. Lot of traffic there. not a parking lot but there's a road and fairly flat ground.
---
This is what happens. The game has so little content players have nothing better to do than dump all their extra stuff on noobs. It's not really a highlight.
---
Lol PvP events? What’s that. Bethesda killed PvP a long time ago. Ask a player to PvP and they’ll get butthurt cuz all they wanna do is collect more outfits and build a pretty camp.
---
Inside of the actual main building? Or like outside  nearby it
---
If you really scrolled for even 5 minutes you would see positive posts. Nice troll
---
You should check out the PKOA sub this is exactly the kinda thing we do over there 👍
---
Inside the building but i bet there is a walkthrough somewhere
---
Yeah seriously. I love outfits and a cool camp but there is plenty of time for both.  
---
On the flip side, it got a lot more fun to steal workshops
---
I played last night and still got some of the Halloween rewards.
---
I found that the survival rewards do show up as challenges (the one where you grind for the bush suit) 
---
But the others do not, ie. Halloween and Christmas rewards.
---
It seems they are still active though and I’m on the way to getting that glowing skeleton outfit I missed out on.
---
Best thing to do is get a list of the rewards and hop in the atom shop to see what you have and haven’t unlocked yet to see where you are in progress
---
Ah! Will try that. Thanks!
---
I stand corrected.
---
Hello, just started with the teams and was wondering how you get a Bond? Do I need to do events with the team mates or just be near them for a certain time in normal gameplay?
---
It’s a dungeon so your objective is to clear it out. 
---
Did you read the lore in there? I found all of that pretty interesting.
---
it's what i've done. Was gonna cancel after a month but i  am furloughed for another 3 so got another month to fill it.
---
You should of put a tracking device on your ammo stash like Ward.
---
I'd buy that for a dollar!
---
The Burrows is stupid, and they made it like a vmbig thing when it was released
---
It worked at one point. I have it completed.
---
Don't forget well rested/lover's embrace, canned meat stew, etc.
---
Bethesda already knows this game is too far gone to add any “real” content. It’d only cause more bugs and exploits. The battle pass stuff is just to please one of the two types of players that have stuck around. The cosmetic craving players. Because that’s basically all the junk on the battlepass is. I can’t be bothered to worry about it. I’m the other type of player, the addictive personality. All I see is stars. The RNG and gambling effect of things like the purveyor keep the other players around. I’ve tried twice to get my friend into fallout and he can’t make it to level 50 without being bored and quitting. I don’t blame him though. The storyline is terrible and he always asked me what there is to do after the storyline. And I can’t really answer that. Because there is nothing to do. Unless you like mindlessly getting better gear that’s pointless since there’s nothing to use it on.
---
Would laying mines to bridge the gap between vehicles outside the blast work?
---
Wait until you find a kid in God mode with an explosive flamer... He kept following me and the only thing I could do was change server...
---
Maybe because those can be turned into rifles, I did the challenge just before patch 20 so it could be freshly bugged but maybe try a weapon that is strictly a pistol.
---
Same thing for me when I saw the screenshot on this post then clicked play I was like “well yea an under armor is needed but- holy crap wtf?”
---
It's been broken like that some times as far back as wastelanders.  It's fun if you have an automatic explosive weapon, no so fun if your melee...
---
Lol right, its like players assume that the people putting work into delivering content for this game are doing it for free.
---
I wish they had just done the season pass similar to cod, easier overall to go through levels but gotta pay to unlock alot of the content. 
---
I think people would view it differently too, right now people will be spending atoms to unlock probably the last few items or so which will seem like they arent getting that much bang for their buck. But if they had the content behind a 20 or 30 buck pass or something you'd feel like you were gaining alot more outta what youre spending. 
---
For those that dont wanna pay, have every 5 levels be the free item or whatever. 
---
I just cant grind daily but im also gonna be much less inclined to spend money for the final few items i miss. 
---
Obviously the marketing team isnt very high in perception
---
Wait Hold up theres a Build Builder, Ive just been hand Picking Perks and shoving them into a Notebook Document
---
just use Imgur bub, its what we all do.. except for a few that use a different service.
---
Before I started playing the game, I was expecting intense ranged battle, using cover and wearing down the opponent. Instead I accidentally hit people with a tesla rifle and trigger what I can only describe as a blind sweaty rage of bloodied jetpack build
---
Definitely seen this on PC, primarily with the prime receiver gatling lasers.
---
Yea look up a site called nukes and dragons it lets you plan out your build
---
I guess, and I’m not sure, there’s an unmarked parking lot in the toxic valley you can build.
---
I think it’s a little south of the crater.
---
good luck, m8.
---
tbf the horses were janky as fuck I don't think theyd translate to cars/bikes easily
---
and there's many different types of addictions you can get. Try and get ones that don't have a negative effect on your build. So if you're melee/shotgun don't get addictions that effect STR
---
I always reach the limit after a couple hours of normal game play then find myself dumping every legendary item after that, with so many more ways to spend script these days the daily limit could be increased to 300 at least.
---
I mean people don't get banned for duping, exploiting wall glitches etc.  
---
I'd say in any other game yes, but Bethesda doesn't seem to care very much what you do.
---
Also, if no one clears it right before you go in there. I don't go into the asylum unless I'm on a private world. That way I get a good run with all my ballistic fiber in place.
---
Nobody cares about your stick figure family
---
See the irony here that Im labeled Mothman, but am the one receiving Wisdom is staggering
---
Do you not see it in the atomic show? You should be able to select it as a NW favorite there.
---
Lol yeah, my bloodied explosive black powder rifle does 110 damage. Well a little more since explosive damage can put you over the 110 cap. But how dumb is that. Bethesda killed PvP. PvP could’ve been there way to actually add fun content into the game but no. We get a lame battlepass instead.
---
It's alivvvve!
---
I think you just have to be in the team long enough. It will slowly fill up the bar and create a bond
---
I think that’s cell block D.  Looks blocked but there is a hole in one of the cells
---
From memory it’s inside the building the top level in one of the office areas.
---
That's good for a big, fast explosion. I prefer the domino effect. Ligt up one and watch them go off in succession. 
---
It's only a little sad what we all have to do for fun in this funky, messed up game. I'll keep playing though...
---
Don’t share sun kissed perk when you have bloodied builds on your team either, happened to me twice today lol.
---
ok, i tried it. i thought i didn't get my 2k score from my 2 weeklies. the other guy here was correct. scores were being given in advance prior to completion of the quest. i did the camp build weekly. by 3/5 i got the 1k score. that's why no score is given after 5/5 same to what happened from my 2 weeklies, it's still a bug, but the score was not robbed, at least for me. I'm on the 14th rank now.
---
I joined a group and over time everyone has left so I’m the leader. A person has just joined and the blue bar is moving up but I don’t have one. I’ll have another go at google
---
I wouldn't think so, building a camp out of bounds wouldn't negatively affect any other player.
---
Why do you want to craft repair kits in game? You can already repair at a workbench to 200%? Is it just for convenience of not needing a workbench?
---
Why not scrip em?
---
What happens?
---
They just havnt rendered yet. Just give it a min.
---
Because u cant get more than 150 scrips.
---
That's the 3/5 bug. This post is about the auto-complete bug which is not the same problem. Many people are getting the two bugs muddled up.
---
There's plenty to be found in Flatwoods.
---
Use pressure plate
---
A level 82 and 400 are the same thing, once you’re over 50 it’s all about you’re build. The only thing is a high level player had more time to find legendaries
---
What are their effects? I’ll buy em.
---
Since when is gamepass free to play? It’s $10/month. It’s a subscription service.
---
Well jokes on pvp players, there might be a lock on damage per hit. But my two shot lmg doesn't care lol.
---
There is a hidden wire attachment inside the door itself, not the power box, that you can attach a switch or pressure plate to, attach power to the switch and you can then open it from the inside, pressure plate is best as you dont have to turn it off, it does it once you step off it.
---
So if you didn’t do daily and weeklies before why do you feel compelled to do them now?
---
My Fixer sometimes reloads when I still have 8 rounds left.
---
FYI you can turn off the pop ups under settings.
---
This is a great example. I’d never played Radiation rumble before and I find it fun as hell bum-rushing past mobs my teammates are agro’ing so I can collect as much ore as quickly.
---
Found BoS transponder signals. Fought off 1 Legendary SB &amp; 1 normal one. Went through Glass Cavern. The same AFKer is hogging Watoga's station vendor.
---
That's sums up the entire game.
---
PC ? i want to buy a couple
---
Why is it more fun to steal workshops now ? Did something change? And I’d love to be able to use my bloodied explosive black powder rifle for PvP but with the 110 damage cap it’s kind of pointless to use it. Considering I can use an automatic weapon and hit them for 110 twenty times in the amount of time I can hit them once with the black powder rifle. Bethesda logic... lets cap the damage at 110 when every single weapon in the game can do 110 damage. So that way the only thing that matters is fire rate.
---
find me by this nickname and I ll give u them for free.  (PC)
---
common effects 1\*
---
Wait, does being in a builder team by yourself turn off line wanderer??
---
Damn... glad I ditched that perk for Party Boy awhile ago then.
---
I think I was attaching it to the power box looking thing on the inside, that explains it, I'll give it a shot!
---
Love this story and I love that you’re enjoying this great game
---
A guy did it to me, hogged the Legendary vending machine at Watoga, I headed off to wipe out a few scorchbeasts and nearly 30 mins later he was still there!!! I thought the server was supposed to boot people if they're inactive?
---
You’d like an actual gun fight??? = nuclear winter
---
Multiple items would be great!
---
Walk 30 seconds up the road to a different vendor
---
Because it heavily impacts both number of sales and any potential resale value for the game on XB. 
---
For comparison, Outer Worlds xB sales vs their PS sales obviously drastically different. Why? Because game pass is such a good deal for what it offers if you play online as it bundles with xB gold live service meaning that it will be no additional up front cost for any existing game pass users to play. 
---
You can say whatever you want but especially since it's adding PC as well that's a definite chunk of the user base that now has access to the game without needing to wait for specific free play weekends to try it without out of pocket costs. 
---
Very few people would buy game pass to play 76, yet many people who have game pass will likely try 76 and for them it's going to be free to play.
---
Not sure what's going on with the challenges, but I just had a bunch reset (from release) and recomplete giving me the atoms again.
---
Flatwoodd monster is somewhere close
---
I see.. thanks for clarification bud
---
Ammo converter.
---
Enough said.
---
They currently reset at 3 pm gmt,either daily or weekly.
---
Why can't you say the word t? Sorry I'm new to this aha
---
I actually prefer it without. Because memes generally get more upvotes than discussion posts, almost every gaming sub that allows image posts ends up with a front page which is nothing but memes. This way actual discussion of the game ends up at the top.
---
Or better yet, have the other guy not hog the vendor so you don't have to fight your way through a bunch of bots &amp; an assaultron!
---
I think the whole thing is wasted. I have no idea what this event is even about. I heard it was based on a quest in fo4, but with all existing lore in this game, and new 76 lore, I have no idea why they fixated on this.
---
I just use a mobile app like Apollo.
---
I think my main complaint about the game is the ridiculously low limits on certain things.  
---
A brand new player can make the daily cap limit in a couple of hours of junk collecting.  The 150 daily scrip limit is abominable.  The gold limits are ridiculously low for how much stuff costs.
---
But the main most infuriating limit has to be stash space.
---
Certain things prevent that. Some other activities include crafting, playing instruments, etc.
---
Ok it's not working with the way I've done it. The blue box with the red light on the left, on the inside of the door is attached to the generator. The pressure plate is attached to some hidden node or something right above the door.
---
I'm pretty sure while the invisible wall seems to not be all that wall like from time to time, the game does have the whole out of map region marked as a no camp zone. So I don't think you actually can.
---
From what I saw you can't get banned at all. Even leas for aomething like this.
---
I'm quite new to the game. I reached Level 11 some days and that day I also had my first entcounter with another player. 
---
So I was looking around Riverside Manor and this Level 60 player showed up and started shooting me. He didn't say anything. He just followed me around and shot at me.
---
I guess I did the only reasonable thing. I ignored him and kept on with looting the place.
---
If you don’t mind grinding the daily raider quests (it takes a lot of XP to get to max) then take all the gold. If you want to get a good amount of XP then half the gold with the raiders as tbh gold bullion isn’t that hard to come by. At the end you can buy it from a guy at wayward (6k caps for 300 a week). Or you can split it with both factions and yourself which I did and regret it massively!
---
Yes, me too. I wasn't sure if they added in some new world challenges to go along with the season for if it bugged out.
---
Respawning is still a problem (probably some other issue blocks correct respawning)
---
Patch is overall good.
---
Is it planned to stack underarmour while beeing in power armour?
---
Being able to use the combat rifle paints on the fixer would  be great, it's essentially a unique version of it anyway.
---
Small confession - my stealth sniper character uses the fixer. When I saw the dark matter paint, I bought a TS/10ADS combat rifle that I found cheap at a camp I was passing through just so I'd have something to use that paint on when I get there.
---
All you can do is push Bethesda on this matter and have them admit to the myth that they can't do anything to fix this issue is wrong and they actually can do so.
---
The support person who receives the case may not have the tools on hand to resolve this issue but someone at Bethesda DEFINITELY does. All we need to do is push them to actually do it.
---
u/LadyDevann
---
We're asking for this since last halloween with the bat combat rifle skin. I also asked for the same treatment for vault 94 armor as it is actually scout armor through and through.
---
Mine somehow always has that dress tucked into her undies.
---
From your daily posts,you sound like the one that could use a couple of smiles.....me as well lol.
---
Yeah, I'd have to close the game, uninstall my mods for perk load outs etc, restart the game, do the challenge, close the game, reinstall my mods, load back in to adventure. Too much effort and yeah, banning modded game files doesn't even stop the cheaters so I don't know why they bothered.
---
I sided with settlers and decided to keep my sweet gold. The only minor inconvenience was small reputation drop, nothing serious to me. It\`s up to you what do you prefer - if u like to have more bullion or cut some daily reputation grind. There are no other consequences.
---
Scroll through this and itllo tell you all the reputation amounts.  
---
[Reputation ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)
---
Gamepass is double the price of Xbox gold. It’s certainly not cheap. 
---
And even though new gamepass players didn’t purchase the game, Bethesda still gets money from it being on gamepass. If it were truly free to play, it would mean no new revenue for Bethesda which isn’t really the case. Instead of getting revenue from direct Xbox sales solely they now get a fee for having their game on gamepass from Microsoft. 
---
Anyway I think free 2 play is not the correct term here for a number of reasons. 
---
TLDR: not F2P for 2 main reasons (game pass is a subscription and Bethesda still gets an IP fee for having game on the service. )
---
Some people in the public team look like events with the big yellow dot ahah
---
inb4 he gets banned for out of bounds
---
Thanks! Did you lose rep from the raiders when you went with settlers to do the raid? And did you get raider rep when you screwed them over? That would be my ideal outcome.
---
I wouldn’t use the grenade launchers, missiles or any of those types of heavy weapons for a build. I’d go for a 50 cal, Gatling gun, Gatling plasma, Lmg, minigun, Gatling lazer. Those types of weapons will put out the most damage per second which is what matters.
---
No, you can't change the gun.
---
You can customize it,  just buy the mods off of the prick with the fancy suit.
---
Not sure what else you'd like to do with it though..
---
You can always use it. You know. To shoot stuff.
---
That's a clever way to tell someone bot to do something ehehe
---
It's still a random encounter spot.
---
Thats not correct. Its 17:00 BST which is 16:00 GMT/UTC.
---
I don't think that's going to fix the issue. Most of the time, there's no reason to go to the whitesprings. 
---
Only reason why you go now is either because it's convenient stash location or you're looking to buy missing plans.
---
All the other end game stuff pushes players to either of the three Wastelanders hubs or The Rusty Pick.
---
and youre still reading the subreddit?
---
Lol I want to shoot stuff with it but it’s so weird of a gun I have a instigating with %10 aiming in and when I sneak and shoot sometimes the dmg is high then sometimes it can’t even os a lvl 3
---
Pvp is disgustingly toxic and bullshit jn this game. There is a reason 90 percent of players ignore it completely.
---
Chinese stealth armour is amazing. Used it all the time when I first got it. Use secret service now but I always swap into CSA for SBQ and nuke zones.
---
Or you took Betty mentats
---
Lol yes.. yes we do.
---
I'm sure you think you're making a legitimate argument but you're not. 
---
Free to play is a term that encompasses many different models but the only requirement is that it doesn't cost the user extra to play the game. 
---
This can be done by ads (they're obviously still getting paid), subscription services such as game pass (still getting paid) or flat direct micro transactions only or optional disc purchase, all still getting paid. 
---
Adding this to game pass for every one who has game pass makes it free to play, and how anyone can argue that it isn't is purely insane. 
---
If I have game pass will this cost me anything extra if I want to download and play 76? No? Ok. Then that counts as free. End of story.
---
Couldn’t agree more.  Enjoying it again
---
It's made me super excited for One Wasteland, tbh. But yeah, I'm loving it 😬
---
My plan is to use both of the wepon types like the .50 cal along with the m79 grenade launcher so basically im making a tank type of character as a fun type of build but my main worry was if i should consider having the explosive effect on my heavy machine guns or just keep the explosive effect to my actual explosive weapons
---
Especially with few griefers killing all the legendary mobs and the rest of players not even bothering to complete a single event stage. XD
---
HAHA theres no way
---
Isn’t your entire point in calling it F2P in your original response that they won’t make an atom change because they are making less money because it’s “free to play”?
---
I like this analogy. Have a lovely Fourth of July :)
---
We keep fight'n
---
No we don't, we have people who can abuse exploits, but we don't get hackers!
---
Nope i just login. Btw my camp is near at the fissure so i thought there’s a legendary enemy attacking my camp
---
Have you checked under “outfits”?
---
Yep I got this and it totally made me smile, doing camp tails and shooting mobs in front of others and some of them looking confused as to where the confetti came from :P
---
I've noticed the repair rifles challenge recently showing 4/76. I'm was a stealth rifleman from lvl 0 to about 160 so that can't be right. 
---
Then I started tracking it, and it works every time I use a repair kit now. So try tracking it and then modding a 10mm.
---
Isn’t that the Strange in Numbers perk emote?
---
Lol I won for the first time yesterday by camping too. Sat in a bush the whole time, then the last person waltzed out in front of me. I only wanted the "survive 30 minutes" score challenge.
---
Todd Howard: Whats that? You want it to be an Atomic Shop exclusive? You got it
---
You don't have to kick anyone out though
---
At the back? Mines the same!! 😅
---
Are you trying to modify wood armour?
---
Yeah well it was a highlight for me. It was a nice gesture and given it was my first time playing anything online I appreciated it
---
Yes we do, plenty of people with jail broken Xboxes that can hack. It’s not as bad as pc but it’s there. You can downvote again and say I’m wrong but you’ll be just as incorrect. Night.
---
So far I’ve been able to do all the dailies in well under and hour—except the one that required 30 minutes of play time in NW. I even had all the weeklies done in about an hour. It’s not a lot of time per day, but to be efficient you need to log in and do them every day. 
---
There’s also a repeatable one to get 100 SCORE for every 10k XP you earn. If you use your buffs, boost your INT etc, you can crank out a lot with that to make up for anything you missed/skipped. There will also be a double XP weekend and a double daily SCORE weekend in July.
---
I'd hokey it, but they rot so they arn't in the hotkey for long...
---
I am not sorry I'm new
---
The Bush wookie lifestyle is an art lol. I only wanted the first 3 Christmas camp rewards. Now I can stop playing NW for another couple months.
---
yea, sure thing :) I'm most likely online in the evenings (europe timezone). Adding you.
---
You’re such an awesome player. Obviously your experience completely invalidates everyone else’s. It’s like if 100 people had a game bug and you don’t... well obviously that bug doesn’t exist.
---
Which is noon EST, thanks guys.
---
No need to be sorry haha, i haven't had a look but it's my understanding that each ghillie camo is a skin for certain armor types, wood, metal etc.
---
That's like asking if you want to buy the bread of a burgher first, or the inside. You'll need both anyway so what's the difference?
---
I have my tent parked in that spot just purely for the steel when it pops, and if lots of peeps turn up its crazy loads of mobs i'm there for atleast 10mins after just looting then I march down to watoga station and scrap it all and sell some stuff.
---
Shoot man sorry I play on PS4.
---
I think it's a given that there's absolutely no QA outside of "create offline test environment, spawn item in, doesn't crash, ship it"
---
Sure... and only 10 of them consistently play.
---
haha.. whatever, man. take care.
---
Siding with a faction gives you nice chunk of their rep, so final cut if you decide to keep bullion doesn\`t hurt so much imho. I finished the quest with 3 of my toons, main sided with settlers and screwed them up, 2nd too but shared bullion with settlers, 3rd sided with raiders and shared bullion with both factions. First two have reputation maxed already today, the 3rd is almost done, but he started later.
---
You can find a happy home at pkoa
---
Ah that would explain why I havent seen them before. Im usually too busy dealing with murderous bots to remember to explore the exterior properly
---
That’ll still be drivable after the bombs drop.  Good choice.
---
You're right i'm gmt+1 so I messed up.changed.
---
Yeah, summer time always messes me up. Difficult to know which timezones are on daylight saving and which aren't.
---
it is a skin, modify an existing piece of armor to apply the skin
---
Ohhh that makes sense! Thank you!
---
My girlfriend logged in for the first time in two days last night, and had three dailies already complete. She's never played nuclear winter. The dailies are just bugged.
---
Yes you will get permanently banned and lose all your legendary items!!1!! 
---
Bethesda doesn't care
---
So it isn’t just time-based any longer?
---
Thanks for the info! I need the grocer backpack mod so the settlers need to get maxed out too! Will i lose raider rep when siding with settlers?
---
It rocks but I cant shot anymore since I cant see the gun. I wish there was a way.....
---
And if you read everything I've said in that comment, you'll see I already explained that games generally move to game pass when they are no longer selling new copies as highly.
---
While I'm certain that a AAA studio like Bethesda gets a very different end cut, I know first hand multiple developers with games on game pass and so regardless of how much extra they get I'm quite sure that the IP payout for game pass subscription is less than a heavily sold direct to consumer game. 
---
They would not be putting it on game pass if it was selling at the rate they ideally wanted, so this is a shift in direction to hopefully keep the game active and ideally for then profitable to keep up and running. 
---
So yes, the goal isn't it to add a large wave of new players getting to try the game for free without making it very overtly advantageous why they'd want to try paid "upgrades" like Fallout 1st for premium experience or lure them in initially with the free easy first character account atoms followed by small microtransactions in the atom shop. 
---
So yes, they're not going to make ongoing character atoms more regularly available because if you buy stuff regularly fo1st is ideal for players, if you want only a single thing once every couple of months you'll likely still get enough atoms to get it with the system as is.
---
 The players who are affected are the regular ongoing players who log in and play regularly but either refuse to or are not in a financial position to buy atoms or 1st and unfortunately that player base is generally considered the least important one to cater to as a developer because they are the first to complain and the last to support, they use up public resources and are often very insulated in their outreach in any measurable positive way. 
---
TLDR, game definitely can be considered "free to play" for most Xbox and a growing number of PC users and it's unlikely they will return to a higher free access atom system
---
That has always been the case as long I can remember.
---
Or at least lower the damned price on them, they're common and all over the place, I won't pay more than 50 caps on them!
---
To extend the lifetime of the game so people keep buying cosmetics. The bottom line is, 76 is a successful game monetarily.
---
I will never play this mode.
---
Did you stumble in to my camp in the mire? I’ve got about 700 mounted ticks.
---
Can we also talk about how it looks like they stuck random bits of confetti in it?
---
Nah homie it’s been server based.
---
People's complaining about this is fair play, especially if they don't use the forum often. Yes it should be stickied, but no point being sick of them complaining. Try and lose some of your challenges and SCORE points and and see how you'd feel.
---
Sadly the Fixer doesn't have a cosmetic mod slot yet.
---
This kinda thing is why pvp is dead with comments like this
---
Yup! I always feel like I'm flashing everyone. I was so excited for that dress, it's so cute!
---
At least the Well Rested one.
---
So let me be clear. You think they made the business decision to put it on gamepass so that they could earn less revenue? How do you have first hand knowledge of Bethesda’s sales pre-game pass?
---
Well you kinda need the ghillie suit for that or anything other under armor that blends in well.
---
Yes please. 
---
It doesn’t add up with the stash limit.
---
Well every time I died I had to play my tunes again. What platform?
---
XBox
---
Eyebots are generally lvl 1 they shouldn't be giving you any issues
---
Eye bots? They are relatively week and can be taken down by a few shots by any strong weapon
---
I mean if its a b2525 ill do that, ill be on after work in like 5 hrs if your around. I much rather the B2525 fixer but thats still a good deal.
---
Do they have Veronica mentats?
---
Cooking and crafting should also be done like vendors. 
---
Choose the amount, then craft. The game simply can’t handle that spam clicking. I wonder why they still chose to do this in 76
---
Did you craft the underarmor before the update? 
---
So people have said it's best to craft a fresh one, then apply the mod.
---
How about no.... This should be a weapons mod or something that doesn't add to the pool of cards at the legendary level. I could never have that occupy a valuable legendary slot if doesn't do anything else
---
If you made that one before the update, scrap it. Then make a new one
---
Them to fix dailies auto completing, right now I'm being screwed out of score and they keep locking my support ticket and ignoring me when I ask for help!
---
Ok, so i trade the b3325 hm for a b2525 handmade now.
---
I have a character with about 2,000 plans, 900 of them in the vending machines. Last week I pulled out all common and uncommon mounts and drop them off on the road in front of the Wayward. I kept 10 of each of the rare plans because people still seem to need those every once in awhile but the rest of those I dropped too. Gained like 80 lb of stash space.
---
Been like that since a week after Wastelanders for me...
---
do those blast mines still stagger afk people?
---
I was just talking to todd, he punched me in the face and screamed "SKYRIM PS5 WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!!" Then ran out of the room screaming hysterically "IT JUST WORKS!" over and over...
---
Todd texted me, told me to tell you, "buy more atoms, subscribe to 1st, and buy skyrim on pc5, and buy the buster sword dlc"
---
I also consulted my trusty magic 8ball about the situation, outlook not good.
---
Hahaha
---
the card system for perks gives me cancer 
---
u shouldnt need to change your perk loadout everytime ur doing something different like building or killing etc 
---
i dont see the point of applying points to SPECIAL, then level up cards and switch cards everytime ...
---
perk loadout blabla.. that aint solving the issue, but makes switching cards a lot easier
---
Similar for me. He actually gave me a quest to retrieve a weapon case, I got it, and now he won't talk to me to accept it. So I'm carrying around a weapon case for no reason and constantly have little Quest thing at my camp.
---
I'd do a test of it, just the box and a floor, just to see if: "Cannot fast travel to this location"  happens
---
also im on ps4, so performance is 10x worse on master PCs, stuttering, fps lag, fast travel lag, etc 
---
pls bethesda help
---
fast travel to a station or phoenix then. It's really not that big of a deal.
---
I don't know how they could get so far off track. The requirements were so obvious, ask absolutely any player and they would explain the requirements the same way because they are so universal and clear.  
---
The only reason they would ever do it this way is if they're expecting to monetize the points at some point.  
---
Just add it to the list of currencies too. We have Scrip, Score, Atoms, AmmoPoints, Caps, and then throw in resource types and I'm starting to consider hiring an accountant to help me play the game.  
---
I have been a staunch supporter from the start, so I'm not just jumping on the hate train. The converter is barely usable, doesn't deliver on the requirements, and adds to the already bloated list of currencies to keep track of.
---
Lol I think your reading comprehension skills need some refinement. 
---
No. They're putting it on game pass to hopefully expand the player base and in the process hopefully hook some long time users, of which some will inevitably be the whale consumers. 
---
What is the most frequent complaint? Late game is stale. What is the most frequent positive? Initial early game story and pacing is great. The world is beautiful and your first exposure usually surprised most of the original haters. 
---
So putting it on game pass is likely to have a steady flow of new users playing the initial early game and having a good experience and hopefully with enough time passing to catch up to where the long game becomes as good as the early game.  
---
Otherwise as has been seen from dropping steam logins, player base dwindles after they hit the grind. 
---
My personal connection is to other developers on game pass, not internal access to Bethesda but there are other public tracking numbers that keep activity reports on most played or most sold games on the platforms, and with the launch of wastelanders it quickly went back up hitting high activity with former and new players. Then a sharp drop off. 
---
These are only using publicly available numbers but also anyone who is actually playing this game regularly can first hand experience the player base drop without needing to devolve into purely anecdotal experience.
---
I also need to find the wanderer! Just have been unlucky so far
---
Same here, only started playing cause of the reward glitch, now I’m a full blown bush wookie haha
---
Keep doing Atoms work there brother, I've met loads of heroic dupers who hand out free shit because they were tired of seeing people give up their entire inventory for one item!
---
Alright, take care. Youll need some.
---
What is your psn?
---
Damage is capped?
---
If you can’t have a civil discussion without insults I’m done here. I overlooked the first one. I’m done. Have a nice day.
---
owsiak90, why asking?
---
I see it all the time people refusing to pick someone up, are they really that lame to want their lame junk ? Myself included by the way people running around me refusing to stimpack me
---
Lol, the way is called VATs
---
You gotta be kidding right?
---
I have no problem with that. It's simply not behaving in a random fashion.
---
Yeah... Lemme shot ma gun please myself... :)
---
I’m late to the party as I just got the armor plans the other day. Are you saying the stealth is like chameleon mutation? I hate that I can’t see my gun with it so I hardly ever use it.
---
I am on ps4 and will see what i have next time i am on. Anything in particular u are looking for?
---
I can go outside and smoke the biggest joint and still be active when I come back. 
---
It’s a little too long imo. 
---
How many players are actually just inactive it got me thinking.
---
Help, im locked in todd howards basement, hes been making me stream skyrim for years across many consoles... i get hot pockets and ginger ale as sustenance. Oh god, I can hear him comming... he's screaming "PS5 SKYRIM RELEASE WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!"
---
Oh dear god... im trapped in skyrim hell, and todd howard is the devil.
---
Another thing that appears to have changed is the containers in the settler camp are always empty now, where before they'd have typical basic loot.
---
I don't think todd has a say in what goes on the atom shop
---
Yup. Sadly. Other wise amazing armour but yeah.
---
There is a post about this. 
---

---
Apparently it used to stack, so people would get crazy Marsupial jump etc, but it has been fixed, and no cards are counted twice.
---
Only good pvp has to be sent up first 
---
Example I was playing on an alt with a few friends and a full group came up and didn't just start trying to fight us he came up on the mic and said they had there camps set up like a battle field and ask if we want to pvp let us all store are junk and we fast traveled to there camp all became hostile then got to there designated start locations and had a 4 v 4 pvp battle for like 30 mins most fun pvping I've ever had on this game (maybe only time)
---
I'm so sorry to hear what you've been through. I cannot imagine the pain. Hey, if you're on Xbox, you can join my private server &amp; we can grind together. Lmk. I hope you feel better.
---
I got the calibrated shocks before, since I knew I wouldn't be using the legs without the mod.
---
I play this mode very little. BUT! why on earth are we sent to the menu each time?
---
Idk how other BR’s does this as I’m normally not a fan. 
---
But it seems way more logic to just throw us into the vault again we barely have time to explore it and read the terminals!
---
Can I take them off your hands? Ok on pc my username is Venator02
---
This is the guy my gf tells me not to worry about, he’s just a friend
---
I could, but I already use Perk Manager alot, and its already enough of a hassle to re-share that one card every time I swap the builds. Thanks though!
---
Help, im trapped in skyrim hell, and todd howard is the devil. Hes been making me stream skyrim for years across many consoles... 
---
I get hot pockets and ginger ale as sustenance once a day, and a real world skyrim bucket is my lavatory...
---
Oh god, I can hear him comming... he's screaming "PS5 SKYRIM RELEASE WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!"
---
This is a bit disappointing. I’m still gonna give it a try. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
Near as I can find, it hasn’t been implemented yet, I don’t think. While not having a specific release date, Bethesda’s roadmap lists the One Wasteland update dropping in the Fall of 2020.
---
Or they could at least add the option do the death screen so we have the option to join a new match or the current (z) to quit.
---
My point was that they don't have to spend money on making FO76 a better game if people are willing to pay for it in it's current state.
---
That is not winning...
---
Yup, if you crafted it before the added the new plans you must scrap it an make a new one, 100% tested...
---
yes, find me and i ll give u them
---
No. 
---
It's simply a bunch of entitled tweens thinking they deserve free shit.
---
I'm a bit of both. 2 characters on passive who are very generous. And one who I bring out just to murder people.
---
It’s still on the roadmap as of the ITV on Tuesday
---
Hello there, just curious;
---
Do you have the marsupial and speed demon mutations?
---
They up your consumption quite a bit, especially while running and jumping.
---
I'm not saying there isn't a bug, but if you consciously jump less it might put a reign on your thirst until the patch comes.
---
Yay!
---
Day 1 player. 820 hours. It’s improved a lot. It would be worth coming back just to check out wastelanders.
---
Reason 5,000,000,000 I'm glad I moved on from fo76
---
I'm missing something here...  what am I missing?
---
Yes  very much. 
---
For all pvp players out there I really hope they have something to look forward to soon.
---
It's the update I am waiting for.
---
I came across him on the first day of Wastelanders, but when I saw him the chicken hadn't spawned, so I watched him running and screaming for like 10 minutes with no chicken actually behind him. Easily one of my top 10 favorite moments while playing this game.
---
I think it's mostly the interface and experience of it that people don't like. I'm not fussed by the exchange rate, and it's a balance thing so I'm sure it'll get tweaked.
---
It also wasn't empty.
---
Stealth is a tactic and I was the last one alive so..
---
I'm not sure if anyone has suffered with this but the disconnection from servers. It isn't network related, my internet is fine. The problem is that I could be in the middle of farming or doing something &amp; then the game just gives me a loading screen, sends me back to the main menu &amp; gives me a "disconnected from server", "unknown error has occurred" &amp; something else. This hasn't happened to me before the recent patch. 
---
Another glitch (or maybe not, I'm not entirely sure) is with the Shotguns. Let's say I would rush a Mole Miner with my Double barrel &amp; hit it square in the face. I would see its health drop to 0 &amp; then get boosted back up to like 80%. Does anyone know why this happens? Or is it the gun itself? Its like the server didn't register that as a kill shot &amp; just simply healed the Mole Miner.
---
I love this game so much, but the devs don't listen to anything that we suggest. So many ridiculous bugs just aren't addressed, and so many QOL improvements are never even considered. It's disappointing, because I truly love FO76, but at the end of the day I feel less and less like it deserves any praise whatsoever.
---
I think you need to scrap old one and make a new one
---
With a .025 chance to actually work and it costs 1700 atoms!
---
its must be a very rare bug i hope they fix it
---
A fair bit of it is on YouTube, should be fine. Good luck on your exploration!
---
I haven’t completed a certain quest and now every time I log on I get a holotape. I don’t remember what quest it was but the moment I logged on today I finished that challenge
---
Played starting in the BETA, I gave it a good month until I got RDR2 and once I was finished with that came back to the game to find vending machines and a scrap box doubled to 800! I like the game but the inventory management is still a pain. I could go for another stash doubling.
---
I have had a similar experience recently and this community has really helped me smile again. For all the bugs and the glitches it's still a game with a heart of gold, and an even better community. Love and strength to you 👍
---
Yep it doesn’t even have the ‘appearance’ slot so there’s no way to apply a skin.
---
Once they patch one in, then we know to get excited!
---
Incorrect, I always lost well rested when I had to respawn, and I know that because I always went for the 'Level up while [0/3]' challenge, and one of its variations required me to be well rested while leveling up. If I died unexpectedly when I was about to ka-ching I had to bail out of whatever situation I was in and find a bed.
---
But what **has been** changed about well rested is that it now finally sticks when you change servers. Which is great!
---
Even with unyielding armor I play sneak sneak shoulder tap for my unarmed girl, I only charge when I finally get detected by the last surviver! But yeah the Chinese stealth armor is also great, even if I'm over encumbered as soon as I put it on!
---
The team system has made a massive improvement to the game. Events are way more fun and it's nice to be using a different bunch of perks and making use of the perk share function. It makes levelling and scoring so much easier.
---
Use either a glow sight or a scope, then you can see to aim again!
---
Yeah I get that but you shouldn't be wearing armor anyway . If you want benefits from wearing armor you will have to do cheesy exploits like breaking it or rolling lvl 1 armor for now
---
BIGGEST HUGS I CAN GIVE.
---
May the bright moments outshine the dark.
---
I just started the other day too. Had a level 176 drop me 30 radaway which I was stoked about, but is nothing compared to what you got haha. I’m a hardcore fallout fan and this is actually turning out to be one of my favourites in the series which is incredibly surprising
---
Yeah please
---
Her and the old guy are my favorite
---
I'd rather not be upset and ft to another station, saves on heartburns.
---
But you do you. Not that your complaint ain't a legit one.
---
There was a outfit before, but it was a nuclear winter reward, it's no longer available. But you can get the new armor ghillie skins, pretty much the same if you get them all, altho it will require some serious effort tbh
---
Yea that would give us something to look forward to! I doubt they will let us use combat rifle skin on it though, it never happened with identical models of other weapons.
---
This sure sounds like a tactic to me. Congratulations for the win.
---
I don’t join the teams because I feel bad if I join them and don’t go to the events with the other people in the team. I’m focusing on daily quests and stuff and would rather someone who wants to do the events be in those teams.
---
Who is Todd? I see it mentioned often but no clue what the reference is.
---
Yeah... I'm not sure if revenant is working, either. Didn't notice a change in my damage numbers while playing last night.
---
Really combat shotguns and combat rifles should share skins too!
---
Okay when will you be on?
---
well done man. ive been close a couple times and had a fair few 2nd places
---
im a water wookie too and had a cracking round earlier where i was sat underneath a boat near the dam. so many people swam past me and i was sure was done for. lost out to a team of four in the end right at the death. loved it. theres def an art to wookie life
---
I hate to be that guy, but they do it because it works. Limited time sales and availability preys on people's fear of missing out. They believe if they have a constant rotation of time sensitive products, they'll get more sales than broad availability.
---
It's also about how the currency works. Currency spends, when you have it, you want to spend it. Something which will stop you from doing that is having a larger goal, something you could save for. They don't want people saving their free atoms to buy something they really want. They want players to see something they like, and either blow their atoms on a cheap product, which will lead them to buy more cheap products in the future because they won't save, or they want them to top up with bought atoms for a more expensive product.
---
Both of those outcomes rely on a constant rotation of products and a well applied fear of missing out.
---
It will suck for every player that hasn't played more than a few hours.
---
Oh my goodness.
---
If the game has crashed on you "thousands of times" its probably a problem on your end not Bethesda. I've been playing since launch and the game has crashed less than 10, 15 times over that time frame.
---
Same here, at least mine auto completed when I logged in.
---
Hehe, this proper tickled me!!
---
Yeah, 110 is the damage cap for PvP. You can break the cap with the explosive effect though. But the explosive effect only does a percentage of the damage. And 110 is low so you won’t get a lot of benefit from the explosion. That’s why PvP is broke. It’s either Tesla rifles or fast firing explosive weapons.
---
It's a long post to read but I'm melee using a deathclaw gauntlet, half power attacks do no damage even though damage numbers pop up
---
They definitely should, especially if the skin is just flat color. They really should have flat color skins for most weapons like the ones for excavator PA.
---
Silly Ghillie. :(
---
Reminds me of the time I added a letter "T" to my mates Volkswagen Bora.
---
Oh trust me, some people grind this game 24/7 for those cosmetic pixels. I honestly wouldn't be suprised if someone was almost done with the season.
---
That's half of all attacks for me
---
True edge is getting a chain outline for your license plate
---
If it says you are the Overseer. That’s winning buddy.
---
The rng sucks dogs balls.
---
Swindlers? I'm pretty sure swindlers is an allowed word.
---
True talent. Peaceful Victory! Congrats
---
It can randomly give it to you later just keep playing
---
The value of your truck just plummeted.
---
I know scopes but will a glow sight work you say?
---
Scammer. I don’t think it’s allowed for the texts in posts. I know it’s fine in comments though.
---
I'm so sorry... You have a family here in case you need anything or just to talk. Huge hug, vault dweller!
---
Yup, they glowey dot won't be invisible!
---
there is a mission that you get a syringer that lets you talk to animals
---
fun fact if you shoot a player with it they get a glowing aura all over their screen and you can see it to 
---
so when the idiot runs up and punches you swap to that shoot them in the face then watch them try to stealthboy while they glow in the freaking dark
---
PS stays until either they die or relog
---
It actually became more frequent after this update and have spoken to many during my games that have experienced the same issues. 
---
But even if the crashing issues are solely on my end, the ability to quickly rejoin your team as long as it hasn't wiped or you're character hasn't been killed should still be there.
---
At least I guess those tow being seperate I can now at a glance tell the difference between my combat shotgun and my combat rifle in Nuclear Winter! One being Vault tech blue and the other Halloween orange!
---
It gets auto flagged beach of rule 10
---
Will have to test that, thanks!
---
It makes a sort of sense for the caps. They just never balanced it. It needs to be tweaked. Think about this though. VATS and high good like damage is fun but it doesn't make good PvP. If they tweak the caps and remove vats from PvP, we could focus more on the fun effects and debuffs for the PvP load out.
---
As far as the shops go, it seems like I can claim the shop and only one person in the other team goes red. I got to play with it more though. I'm not sure that's intended or not.
---
That is true
---
At some point I stacked 15-20 levels and moved my specials and changed my build to use ranged weapons instead.
---
I had that issue a few times, but... then when I completed another challenge it completed both that one and the one before. It was strange.
---
Moaning like this will further destroy the game.. theyre taking away one of the most immersive mechanics because of people like this so thanks
---
It's either that... or both players "sell" both items for 0 caps... both are risky...
---
Rebalance legendaries. There are some effects that are absolutely worthless in their current state, and some that are worth entirely too much.
---
Oh, and make some kind of change so that Unyielding Builds aren’t incentivized so heavily for skill checks/Season reward gain.
---
We’re only willing to do that because they’re updating the game. If tomorrow they announced they were cutting all support, sales and subscriptions would end real quick. Sure, they might have the odd player buy one thing here and there, but I assure you they would be a minority..
---
I agree, you should be able to rejoin after that happens. I expect some crashing from being on line but that amount of crashing should not be normal.
---
Hey. You basically just start doing your own thing in the game and see if it catches on. Define your character, have a gimmick, stick to role, create your camp around it, and stay in character. I’ve joined CJ Martin in a couple of sessions and he just does it so well, staying in character and introducing others to what he’s created. 
---
I’ve been doing this myself for well over a year now. I’m an in game plan salesman with mysterious shops that appear overly friendly and inviting, but hide some secrets throughout. I don’t use a mic to make it seem like I’m just an in game character, not another person playing. I’ve gotten really good at being a tour guide of my crazy camp without saying a word. It took a long time to craft the experience at my camp and when others see it all, they usually appreciate the work that went into everything (the build, mine and my allies costumes, the camera mode poses on the tour, the emotes to show what not to touch, the plans for sale, etc.). Lots of people have been there, including some big players in the building community, twitch streamers, and YT’ers, and I’ve gotten positive feedback from all of them. Just do what you plan on doing and do it really well, and people will notice. May not make it as big as the doc, but as long as you’re having fun that’s all that matters
---
Found a bugged out invulnerable one yesterday too.
---
I got it yesterday and be using the back button. Helps a lot.
---
Sure is, but do you feel good inside when you win that way? 😁
---
I like to do it with my friend, it helps both of use get used of PVP. I wouldn't mind PVPing WITH GUNS not a goddam lightning bolt of explosive bolts.
---
Bow is just New and alredy had 4 skins. Sad
---
Nuka cola cranberries
---
Yeah even better. Stealthy enough time not have to fire a shot and still win! That’s a ninja moving in the night type shit.
---
I don't see the problem, I'm doing fine with doing daily and just getting exp, but if people aren't getting exp from what they earned it needs to be fixed.
---
Its hard to keep still when players are right on top of you, but so satisfying when they run away without spotting you
---
Hah, thinking the opposite.  I get more out of Uranium Fever if I solo it.  Same with  Guided Meditation.  One Violent Night is FAR FAR better solo.
---
The low level stuff though is good with more, like Campire Tales or Feed The People as it means I have to do a lot less but end up with the same reward.
---
I saw that challenge yesterday but just brushed it off.
---
Your post inspired me to do it this morning. Thank you.
---
Bonus. I got some Christmas and Halloween things!
---
I play unarmed. 
---
While I can get some great damage, it’s very tough to hit enemies that constantly move ‘just’ out of your hit box.
---
Armor is another concern: having enough armor and health to actually close with an enemy, and keep me alive long enough to spam stimpack until I can get the kill is terrible. 
---
My armor level has gone up over 200 hundred points, but it seems like I die way easier now after the last few patches. 
---
Apparently there are moments where the game simply decides I need to die, and my health drops like panties at a frat party. Doesn’t matter if I block or heal, I just die. I come back, and the mob dies rather easily.  But I had to die first lol.
---
It crashes 5-10 times a day.
---
I will do a reinstall of windows soon and see if that might alleviate some of the issues.
---
Stay strong fellow dweler. I cant say that I relate, but I sure can take pride in being part of a community that you enjoy and find happiness in. Stay strong n keep the grind on.
---
Maybe crafting many cannot handle Super Duper correctly.
---
Its a nice little break from adventure every now and then
---
the true endgame is the server jumping grind for six hours to get a new hat
---
You sure you didn't get the points when you did 3/5 of the required tasks per weekly? That's what happened to me.
---
Why?
---
Good luck. Hope you get it sorted out. That would drive me crazy.
---
This has been happening to people since Wastelanders.  Smiley has the same problem not giving people gold.
---
Beth1, high on meth: alright I have this idea about an ammo converter
---
I suggest checking under your misc labels in your side and daily quest tabs. I had this issue for a while then encountered the weapons case in the world randomly without having the side quest active, when I searched through my quest menu it was labeled under the daily quest category in the misc section along side talk to Cloe, as opposed to being it's own quest in side quests, when I picked up the case it updated and became it's own quest normally, and completed as usual.
---
That could explain why I'm dying so much more. I added the mods to my old secret service under armour.
---
The problem is FOMO only works when the player can get the weapon whenever they want, and the skin is the only thing they are waiting for. A heavy gunner won’t FOMO buy a handmade skin when it finally shows up in the store. If he doesn’t suddenly bump into a good roll during the week when the skin is available, he’ll never want to dress one up. And when he does bump into a good handmade, sorry no skin available, he’ll just play a bit and put the gun up for sale and move on with his 50 cal. Paring the ‘limited time sale’ strategy with complete low-chance RNG drops, the chance for impulse buy sales is next to never. 
---
I never wanted a 10mm SMG skin because I don’t have a good one and no reason to spend atoms and sit on a skin and wait for the gun. Then I got a good drop, started running around with it, wanted a cool looking skin, sorry nothing available. Now I don’t have the gun any more and went back to handmade, why would I FOMO buy a 10mm skin when it shows up next year, knowing next time murmrgh gives me a good one is probably three years from now? Multiply this scenario by a hundred thousand and imagine how many atoms they could have easily made if the skin is available at all times and show up as ‘Buy skin in atom shop’ button when you mod the gun.
---
Health bars rubberbanding and immortal mobs, i cant kill anything unless i use a weaker weapon/build thant im currently using.
---
Hell yeah. It means you successfully evaded 50+ people and used the environment and enemies to your advantage
---
Yep. As someone currently grinding Riding Shotgun as much as possible for a backpack plan Ill quite likely never actually use, I hear you.
---
Doesn't a purified water restore 25% of your water
---
I launched a nuke at lvl 18 once
---
Scrips limit and SBQ giving a 1* Assassin's 10mm gun as loot
---
Yea I'm almost convinced defense is bugged, I have 435 max health with 600 DR and 400 ER, and you wouldn't even know those were my stats if you watched gameplay of mine. Doesn't help stimpaks are bugged because of speed demon.
---
There should be a merciful trophy like in kingdom come deliverance lol
---
The red double doors are from the circus trailer plan :)
---
bro I've been grinding that for weels and my wife got the backpack on her first try, I had to beg for it lmao
---
still trying to get the gas mask and outfit from running shotgun, and that one white outfit that is a reward for certain events and dailies in the mire, forget what it's called but I really want it lol
---
Oh, Sweetie. *BEAR HUGS* I'm sorry.
---
From the atomic shop? So I can't get them?
---
Maybe the circus trailer doors. They’re the only ones I know that are double doors. To get those, you need the plans to build the circus trailer, which were a rare drop from the recent mole miner event. The pails used to get the we’re duped a while back and the plans can still be found on trading sites, but they go for quite a bit.
---
I’m not sure possibly
---
Hope so
---
Yea different skins help a lot for those similar weapons! Mine are the freestates blue and pumpkin orange.
---
I used to think they did this to prevent people from making camps that clip into or out of the map. But its stupid easy to do that and the same method I used in the first couple months of the game being released still works.  
---
I think the tools they use themselves for building game worlds has these restrictions to keep the game world looking and performing correctly. For some reason they thought we REQUIRED these same tools. What a joke.
---
It's a good event.
---
Loads of XP. Usually a bunch of legendaries. Plus, candy. Who doesn't love candy?
---
And nobody ever does it. 9 times out of 10 I'm the only one there. Even when there is, there's a good chance they're just farming plastic.
---
No the circus trailer was from the mole miners pales, so you can get it, might be a bit pricey idk what they're going for now
---
Alternatively you can offer someone some caps or something to come build them in your camp for you, most people are happy to help out with stuff like that
---
I don't know the plan or I'd offer (if you're on Xbox anyway lol)
---
I give put the good looking ones in, radtoad, Scrochbest, SBQ AND things like that. Not junk
---
I just got on and can help by dying a few times. My id is Numbers and I can fall a few times off the Hornwright building into the water to help
---
Not talking about how the hitboxes have no form of compensation or cheating in third person, making it a gigantic pain in the ass to actually hit things.
---
To clarify, the hitbox is aimed parallel to the camera aim, but comes from the character model, so having that character to the left and down from the camera means in order to hit anything you have to aim high and to the right, to aim where the first person camera would be aiming, while guns cheat and are aimed diagonally to hit whatever the crosshair is aiming towards, which can be buggy at point blank, especially with low slung weapons like heavies that are way out of alignment of the camera, but melee doesn't even try meaning you can never hit anything smaller than a super mutant when you are aimed for their center of mass.
---
Also, third person melee stimpack animation lock up in nuclear winter needs to be fixed.
---
You can! But it requires 14k individual xp from when you unlocked the beanie
---
I never knew that about third person
---
I binned the damn thing.
---
You can place a survival tent in a specific spot and it force spawns everything there. I dont do that event without that. Makes it easier and I just empty a clip of tesla into the and watch others explode them everywhere. It is great
---
I see. Thanks.
---
Right now it sounds like you shouldn't even be online when the dailies reset to make sure they don't auto complete.
---
Tattered Field jacket?
---
I see alot of people talking about it, I havnt even seen them at the vendor. What mods can you even put on?
---
Absolutely 😉
---
My bad, I was trying to remember, and clearly I remembered wrong.  Hence, the down votes.  I'll make sure to check today, what the 3rd is on that two shot railway.  I know I'll be able to sleep better......
---
People still go into the White Strings resort during a nuke drop. Easy place to unload when farming.
---
Very true
---
try hitting a glass bottle with melee in third person, it is horrific, you can go into first person, aim, then switch to third to see just how ridiculous the difference in where you are aiming and where you are actually going to hit is.
---
I've made a few camps to and my build functional objects also rest I'm at 47/7600 while the other 2 building challenges are at 2000 +
---
Treated, Shielded, and Lined I think? It’s the typical underarmor mods. Because the text cuts off most of the time it’s hard to even notice new stuff in that vendor.
---
Bush Wookiee! Bush Wookiee!
---
Going Zero miles an hour
---
Gonna hide in the Red Rocket Shop
---
With the radio on
---
I’m in love with Appalachia.
---
You do know vendor's have different stock, right? And having to server jump just so a guy can jack it is dumb.
---
But you're right. It's not really a big deal. That's why it's douchebag behavior &amp; not say, an atrocity against humankind.
---
I haven't had an autocomplete  yet, but I have noticed that sometimes when completing one of the sub tasks, I'll  earn the score early.  While doing  the robots weekly one the other day, I got 1000 score when I killed all the eyebots, but still had to kill one other type of robot to finish the challenge.
---
I have 10 armor pieces 1* to spare. If u join now I ll give u them. But in my next game session i can scrip them. Anyway I am not interested in saving this crap bcz my stash is full. The choice is urs.
---
NaCl
---
Thanks, I'll try that
---
Its the same with the lighthouse mothman XP buff.
---
Dailies are completely bugged for me. And 75% of weapons are shit to use.
---
What do those mods do? I know I'mma idiot and havnt really payed attention to under armour stats in the 500+ hrs lmao
---
Nothing beats the satisfaction of throwing a nuka grenade and team wiping players who stand too close to each other
---
It is if you move your camp as much as I do. 
---
I spent a year at Alpha. Now I move once every couple weeks.
---
It’s fine haha. I couldn’t tell you what each individual one does cause I’m the same, my friend modded my old ones for me cause he knew better. He told me to go for shielded with this one. They basically give you extra DR and some (all?) give bonus stats to your SPECIAL.
---
As someone who has also done two handed since the beta... I can’t say I agree with everything in this post. 
---
1) I haven’t played as much as 4, but in my time in 76, melee has always has consistent range, usually. This is across type. Even recently working as stealth I’ve never had issues with low tier enemies because, spoiler alert: *Melee damage is already high.*
---
2) Blocking is more or less worthless... But enemies largely Telegraph their attack with the exception of Yao Guai. For some reason those damn bears always get their two hitter attack in. With the retribution legendary perk coming, blocking will be more incentivized. 
---
The comment on PVP - if it’s not a swing speed up weapon, you’ve got a fair chance. A lot of melees have a long ass wind up before you hit, unless it’s unarmed. 
---
3) I’m fairly certain this is a problem on OP’s side. Whenever I do VATS attacks, I usually hit enemies. And it even allows me to get to spots I normally couldn’t reach, since I don’t run marsupial. 
---
4) First of all: *Don’t lie to yourself about legendaries.* Melee __absolutely__ needs legendaries for effectiveness **especially** two handed. 
---
Second: You say you don’t use legendary effects, yet you’ve tested them. That’s just conflicting. 
---
Third: This is my own point, not responding to OP because I agree with the summarization of... Most of the legendary effects there.
---
Note that I don’t run full damage perks for melee. I go high health, with tank perks. Unless you’re doing stealth, forget bloodied melee. Maybe back in the hay day of cavaliers it was viable, but it’s not now. 
---
I’ve regularly outdone the damage of anything short of automatics and heavy guns. The biggest problem with melee is attack speed and range. It’s got great damage already. Which is why these problems are easily ignored playing solo. In a team or group event, melee suffers because of the time it may take to get to enemies. 
---
My own other issue is the “melee tiers”. The fact that Unarmed weapons have a higher base damage than my two handed or one handed weapons makes zero sense to me. They swing faster, so unarmed is naturally the best DPS you can do. 
---
If they gave the other two ‘classes’ of melee something unique, it’d be ok... But they don’t.
---
Yup. Had that happen, I ended up just jumping in front of them to block their shots, they got pissed off and started yelling at me on voice like it would change anything.
---
Just have the Bloody mess perk have an alternative to Confetti added when enemies blow up
---
yup that's it I'm pretty sure
---
I mean if they’re optimizing I guess so? But in my experience, sitting at half health is more than enough for most casual encounters in terms of damage output.
---
Ah ok thanks mate. Imma prob go with DMG resistance.
---
Yeah shielded is your best bet then :D
---
Okay it's gone yet, but I had something similar on the Sheepsquash questline with the Terminal
---
At least let us have spacing of 1k.
---
Wendigo colossus
---
I just walk down the hill from my camp to Helvetia and pick up the one in the robot shed.
---
Yeah Ive never seen that one yet. I also am yet to get any of the jumpsuits that are supposed to drop from events. If you are PS4 I do have a spare blueridge outfit and mask
---
Hang in there buddy.
---
We care why?
---
Kill the power to my machines. Start shopping. 
---
I don't store them. I'm not exactly in a high traffic area so I rarely get people just stopping by. Depending on how much I've got I'm my machines I might unlist some big ticket items. Just in case. But I don't worry about missing out on a few thousand caps in the event that somebody does show up.
---
I'm on PC sadly but I appreciate the offer!
---
10000 is the new meta
---
No. I did the final raid with the settlers and I lost no rep with the raiders. You will lose rep with the settlers if you keep the gold. Thats all you will lose though.
---
I'm sorry that you had to go through that. I'm glad you were able to find that outlet though. I'm waiting for that "get better" to kick in but I'm a little relieved it's still on the horizon. Thank you.
---
Don't need the caps, but message me in a week.
---
Just done a 6 hour session,  Vats was ok,  1 Blue screen but as I was on a team so got straight back to the same server.. adrenaline is a known bug since the last patch.
---
Adrenaline is a PITA as I rely on it as on this character as I don’t use legendaries
---
No worries. Good luck with the grind. Hope you get it soon
---
I won't lie, the game does have its issues still (the ammo converter frustrated me significantly), but the community has been so wonderful. Thank you.
---
By I don't use legendaries I meant I don't rely on them, I don't change my build at all to fit them. I use all rise, which is a unique with no effects influencing damage, instead its unique mod gives it the highest base damage of any melee weapon in the game. I also saved this as a draft halfway through, so I forgot to mention how awful one handed is and how stupidly unbalanced unarmed is.
---
I’m glad you have fun playing this game the way you want to. Let me do the same.
---
It was for me at the time
---
Thank you. I'm constantly trying to stay realistic in knowing that this is part of living. It helps some.
---
How do you take selfies?  I can only take a pic by looking through the camera
---
What
---
I'm looking forward to that slingshot. Thank you.
---
If you’re on ps4 I might have a copy for you
---
Maybe we'll see each other sometime. Thank you.
---
Stealth melee with maxed out Ninja makes Instigating an instagibbing on everything but the tankiest of things. Even then, you just took out a massive chunk of health so swing again.
---
I swap between Instigating and Furious Deathclaw Gauntlets on my stealth melee and have yet to really run into anything I can't fuck up in 1-2 hits. Also don't have that much of an issue in VATS, the only shitty thing is you teleport forwards and behind the target, so trying to chain attacks is a bitch.
---
Thank you. I've made so many friends through this game. Some real winners. You guys have been a huge help to me.
---
I love doing public events right now there's almost always a ton of people there and it makes it so much more enjoyable though. Only problem though is the scrip limit... I have so many junk legendaries on me I'm having trouble with wright management
---
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
---
Ultra rare floating ghillie paint
---
One of the best families. Thank you.
---
Thank you for being part of that community. It definitely helps.
---
as a totally biased explosive build both in NW and in the main game (I want to die, please end my suffering)
---
I have found explosives to require more skill than say, a rifle build with the extra damage and armor penetration perks, which melt players even wearing marine or power armor
---
The biggest advantage explosives in NW have is the intimidation factor, enemies freak out when they see the "incoming grenade" symbol pop up and make mistakes 
---
Even using vats on the grenade to detonate it instantly is unreliable, I tried doing that a couple games and so many times I wasted a full clip (or two if I had enough AP) trying to get vats to hit the damn thing, failing usually ended in my death
---
that being said, I will say explosives definately more effective in NW than in the main game, by that I mean in NW O actually kill things with explosives occasionally :D
---
Dont craft it you get a free set after brotherhood questline
---
Did it ever have any kind of release date other than “fall”?
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Definitely other players crying about a game they “hate”
---
Are you charging it before shooting it? You have to hold down the trigger and the numbers on the nixie tube will go up. Hold the trigger for like 3 seconds before  you shoot and see what the damage is
---
I’m on Xbox. And can build. I’ll build you some if you want em.
---
Same thing happened to me the other day getting the 30 min challenge. Two of my teammates made it to the end and killed the remaining people. I then appeared from my bush, having not picked up a single weapon or armor the entire game.
---
I've had two people join teams all over the map just to get free fast travel to people's vendor machines. 
---
I've also had three people buy a lot from my vendor machines when they were turned off cause cap limit but the people were on my team so could see my camp.
---
It is hard to figure out WHAT i get credit for.  I finish a couple events, shoot bots, shoot pics, and suddenly my screen is a mess with rewards.  I forgot i even DID the rumble, but theres the reward..... i be getting old and forget things...  did i do that event and these are delinquent rewards?  Or, did i just snag rewards for simply existing???  How can you grief s.c.o.r.e., when ALL the rewards are missing, lagging, s.l.o.w., occasionally gifts and sometimes correct??
---
sounds good
---
Hmmm , no it’s just Fall
---
It happens with guns to just not as often. you'll notice it a lot with scorch
---
Hey, we are here for you. There may be some toxic losers but a lot of us just love the game and the people. We all have problems outside of the wasteland. I just like to go there to escape. Been cruising solo lately on Xbox due to me not feeling well/in a lot of pain. But I’ve just been messin with NW cause it’s dropping Halloween/Xmas stuff right now. Keep your head up. The wasteland needs you!
---
there's a whole free camera photo mode with depth of field and filters and stuff dude
---
you activate it on the map screen, should show the button to activate it at the bottom of the map
---
What about the white spring bunker 
---
It takes 3 hours to get from the outside to the comand room
---
All you gotta do is make a power armor set
---
Tier 100 takes a little under 3,500 score to complete.
---
Aside from agility boost, il guess nothing
---
You can kill a little latency by using wired controller &amp; internet.
---
Have glowing sight on the handmade and have seen otherwise. The only thing that doesn't go invis to me is a scope, though the iron sights/glow sights on the handmade are easier when invis, just put your target at the top of the wavy bit, vice having to find the middle when using the reflex sight.
---
You keep it. You just can't add anymore.
---
I mean...considering Bethesda's absolutley pristine track record when it comes to dealing with, and fixing bug issues in their games, I think its safe to say they'll have everything sorted out and fixed in a professional and timely manner.  In the meantime, for anyone who didnt know, there's this really cool event coming up where our sun will be turning into a red giant! Just a little something for us all to watch while we wait for Bethesda to work on the  issues. Oh... and dont forget your sunscreen
---
kk ty, yeah I was just messing up and adding up all my xp and not realize that it starts after the beanie. Good to hear tho I'm looking forward to having it, thanks again.
---
Thanks! Good luck with your fashion hunting as well!
---
You keep the 1st box and can remove items from it,You just can't add to it anymore.
---
Yea but we get a free bow skin
---
No problem at all! I've been writing my xp down after each match since the beanie. Good luck dude 😊
---
Jesus h...
---
I'm pretty sure on ps4 wireless actually has less latency, and with this, it's not about your input not going through it's about when the game sees you input but the server has a to wait for a second, and I know wired internet is obviously better but with most online games fast reaction based timing works fine, at least fine compared to this.
---
Desperately needed, but unfortunately I doubt we’ll see it for a good while if ever. I’m sure this is obvious, but they keep prioritising new content/mechanics over QOL issues because they think the former will attract new players. Their team must be too small/inexperienced to do both.
---
Todd Howard, CEO of Bethesda and official SpokesDiety.
---
I have been having the same issues! I lost out on atleast 5,000 S.C.O.R.E.! On top of that the server ya been working like shit the last couple days and I have died several times because all of a sudden ten guys pop up and I’m dead instantly! They have had plenty of time to work out the bugs! The new season is a great idea I believe but before you go ahead and launch it..... make sure you are absolutely 100% sure the bugs are out!!! It gets depressing when I also have limited time to play because I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old! So I only get to play a couple hours hear and there! I would like to enjoy the game for once without having a ton of issues aggravate me!
---
Any word on the stats for shielded? I haven’t been able to play.
---
Having the possibility of being ripped off IS intentional by design in this game. They won’t be changing it.
---
No, I've built 2 complete sets. It was a fun grind.
---
Iirc they said it’s either fixed or going to be fixed, I’m not sure when though. Hopefully it won’t be too long, but at the very least this method works for regular sb’s. 
---
Just wished we had a way to flashbomb out of the sky just like in Monster Hunter, the wing cripple method has them awkwardly fly around trying to find a spot to land at and any stagger (from One Man Army or other sources) can ruin the landing.
---
It’s there. And you don’t even need to buy them in order. Can just jump up to Shielded right away.
---
I play all the time, but spending a few atoms to stay caught up is exactly what I’ll do because I don’t grind this game like a job. Plus the board game display is sweet.
---
Sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how difficult it is. Glad you are able to dust off and keep going.
---
Welcome to life, where not everyone is out to please you.
---
greatest idea i‘ve seen on here. amazing!
---
When I first did it, it was an enjoyable challenge. Mostly because I knew I was gonna use it constantly until I could upgrade a stronger model
---
Ah, ok. That makes much more sense. (I don’t change my build either.)
---
Who hurt you?
---
platform?
---
So basically every pellet always hits?
---
God yes. VATS is so annoying. 
---
And stealth, instigating/bloodied is great, because you can get those first hits in. But when you can’t... Good luck. Though it seems you’ve got that covered, so, you know.
---
Oh shit are you on pc?
---
Line in the sand completly glitched yesterday and we all just stood around the sonic generator
---
i can help if you’re on xbox
---
Clearly you don’t remember how extra content in games used to work when you were a kid...
---
Yup. Some people only care about themselves.
---
How is it hard?
---
It even protects from airborne diseases!
---
What part are you struggling with?    If you need black titanium take the workshop at the junkyard in the forest and then kill mole miners and take their scrap.   To get the other stuff you need like screws and spring just loot and scrap everything you can find.   You will have all you need soon.
---
I stand corrected. Bluetooth has come a long way.

---
Conjecture. Sounds like you need to just go play a different game. I’ve been playing since launch and I take frequent breaks from it. It’s a sandbox game really and the fun is what you make out of it. Hope you find your perfect game :)
---
I always have issues in PS4 after updates. My only solution has to been delete and reinstall. This has always helped me. I have also found that putting another game in to play a while then going back into FO works. It’s almost like you have to show FO how it’s supposed to load up. Good luck.
---
Ye i cant remember where i heard this from but its the 3 cs of shooting
---
I’d like to see an option to automatically translation to the interior of most places, not just the Whitesprings.
---
Select a location and have an option for “interior” or “exterior”.
---
Maybe a perk card that’s a companion to the Travel Agent card that allows fast travel to interiors?
---
After 500 levels I don’t know how many times I fast travel, wait for load, take three steps, wait for load...
---
And that you can’t be targeted by VATs
---
Awww bummer. I was really enjoying having a salute lol.
---
I see peoples level 5 mule character with all 4 venders full of max level legendarys and they are just sitting playing an instrument to keep the shop up
---
May I introduce you to the glory that is Enforcer? For the low cost of only 2 Agi perk points, you can cripple the ever living shit out of almost anything using nothing more than a plain Jane shotgun. Yao guai trying to rip your face off? Pop them in the legs a couple times, then stroll away while it whines pitifully at you. Deathclaw trying to turn your insides into outsides? Insert a few ounces of buckshot into it's legs then flick its nose while it whimpers.
---
Seriously. Enforcer is fucking great. Even better if you grab a explosive combat shotty. Who cares about the legendary effect, just go for explosive and it's a game changer. Ghouls? On the floor. Murder bears? Floor. Deathclaw? Floor. Scorched Beasts? Floor. Sbq? Well she's a bit bugged atm so eventually floor. Maybe. Uhh.. Sheepboy is... Well it kinda works. I've had it take him to the floor and also had him shrug that shit off so it can be hit or miss.
---
I was on the hate train for a bit. I played since beta and at a certain point things just kept going from bad to worse. I didn’t know why but BGS just didn’t seem to make any of the new content mentally rewarding in any way. For a veteran player the game sucked for a long time before wastelanders and after the initial wastelanders quests were done.
---
Take bullion for example. It’s not a grind, because you can only play for a short time before hitting a time wall like you would in a F2P game. Except here there is no premium unlock you just have nothing rewarding to do until tomorrow. I’m still not anywhere near ally with the settlers, and I’ve bought maybe 3-4 uselful things. 
---
In the time between Wastelanders and long before the open public test server, this mentality and all the bugs just hit hard. I cancelled first and put the game down for a long time. 
---
I genuinely think the open test server and a few other things have made this game infinitely better. I think BGS still have a lot of work to do, but looking at the quality of play now compared to a long time ago is night and day. A lot of my personal needs for the game have been met and the main one is communication and clarity from BGS. 
---
Do you remember the early days? 400 stash, LOTS more bugs and no communication at all. I do to a certain extent feel that if BGS weren’t listening or improving it would be impossible to be where we are now. 
---
Still a ways to go but Damn the last few play sessions I have really had to call time to stop playing whereas before I would get sick of it quickly. 
---
Positive steps I think.
---
[billy mays intensifies]
---
Can you explain why I should be expected to nerf my build then?  
---
I don't run the Tesla Rifle from other comments is apparently a bit jank at the moment.  I run a Gause Rifle with high PER and AGI and have run this build since beta.  I have lost tons of times in PVP.  If you can dodge my first shot and close the distance I crumble.  I need the distance and stealth to have any chance at survival.  
---
Should a melee build be allowed to require every other person to fight in melee range to accommodate them?  
---
It honestly just sounds like hate on a specific build that just happens to be meta right now.  Not on PVP in general.
---
Some guns might be glitched, am sure some glow sights stay glowing green floating between the invisible sights.
---
I'll sell what the fuck ever I want and you ain't doing SHIT about it
---
You can crouch during VATS too.
---
Cool! Thanks! I often wondered about that.
---
I really feel like downvoting you just for being one of those guys with a Wall of turrets in whitesprings, ruining the legendary grind for everyone else.
---
Hey, I read your post and I went through a similar situation as you, so I just wanted to send some positivity your way. I’m so very sorry about your losses, and I’m sorry that they happened as quickly as they did. In November, my mom passed away and I fell into a huge slump immediately after, I even quit my job and stayed home playing this game 24/7. 
---
Fo76 definitely pulled me through the worst of it. It’s such a fun game with a great community and it really works to keep your mind off of things :) just know that better days are coming, and it’s okay to have a bad day whilst healing from everything you’ve been through. 
---
A few months ago I told myself I would never have the drive to work again, and that I’d never see myself truly happy again...fast forward to July, I’m actually looking forward to my future and I start my dream job on Monday! Things will get better. If you ever need someone to talk to or vent to, you can reach out to me whenever. I know our situations are different, but I’ll do my best to help you out if you ever feel you need it. 
---
Also, if y’all play on PS4, definitely send me your PSN, my boyfriend and I would love another couple to play with!
---
I'd say just make it a buildable consumable.  
---
Make it, use it, effect lasts for an hour, party favours for all!
---
Yes, it sucks.
---
I agree. Although please give the building group some love if your just grinding west tek etc. The INT boost will net you a better xp reward on a whole. 
---
I do join the legendary group sometimes but building is massively underrated.
---
Oh and to those of you with mutations my massive comedy jumps thank you 🤪
---
That is pretty fucking cool.
---
Yeah I’ve been having fun with enforcer and an explosive anti armor combat shotgun, thing breaks so fast but where else am I going to use the sbq repair kits on. A quad explosive combat would be pretty hilarious.
---
I haven’t really tried using it against sb’s though, because the stagger could mess up the landing possibly and range issues. Mostly been using a reduced weight pipe rifle to cripple wings until I find a decent quad/two-shot to maximize the chances of wing crippling.
---
Sorry that you had to go through all this, it's just too much, life is truly a bitch sometimes, I would know too.
---
I find that despite my constant bitching about Bethesda and their games..they are the only ones that I can truly immerse and lose myself into. 
---
Take care!
---
That’s not a bug she’s turning Wendigo!
---
That is just so darn cute
---
Is it fighting through the robots? I didn't find that too bad myself, but maybe stealth/rifleman is well suited to it. Maybe I'm wrong but I think for a lot of robots you're better off shooting the body rather than the head, if that helps. Also the robobrain's smoke doesn't seem to affect VATS, so you can still happily shoot them through smoke.
---
If that isn't the issue then apologies.
---
No I am not. It was broken and I was struggling for mats and carry weight at the time, and every pound helped. I put away my laser rifle (broken therefore not being used), and all my fusion cells. Not a day later, I lose my BE90 laser because somebody bought it for zero caps, couldn’t catch his tag in time because I was in my perk cards. And I lost all my Strangler Heart Power Armor pieces that same day travelling back to make sure it was what I thought it was.
---
Eh...the new ammo machine makes me want to take the ammo workshop even more.
---
Usually every pellet, and each for the full damage amount as opposed to being 1/8
---
I was wondering about that myself am at 11/76 at first it was a perk card icon then changed to atom but the number was blank.
---
Often times this sub feels like an echo chamber and it sucks because I love this game a lot.  There are so many possibilities for features and other things they can add but these suggestions often fall on deaf ears it seems.  I just want to see this game grow and expand because this game has so much potential!
---
And then you get people who downvote you for having a fairly innocent suggestion.  Whether it be a gameplay feature or an Atomic Shop cosmetic.  I just don’t understand it.  How does a suggestion negatively affect you to warrant a downvote?  Often times I see a lot of great suggestions even I haven’t thought of and some people are quick to shit on you for it.
---
There are tons of griefing complaints. Happens often.
---
critical man bad!
---
Yeah I've thought about doing it to keep my shop up but I'm always on any way and I don't have anything good to sell, just stimpacks at a low price
---
I always aim for the Combat Inhibitor. Seems to do a ton of damage. Oh and target Fusion Cores to OHK any Sentry Bot.
---
Well actually, turrets couldn’t murder ghouls, they were just there to help kill em if you didn’t want to waste a ton of ammo. So no, it doesn’t ruin anyone’s grind. People usually joined the grind and everyone popped a couple shots in every ghoul hat they saw lol. Thankfully my base at the time was literally just a staircase on a foundation with fences all around it, so only players would be able to jump over and camp on top. I mean feel free to downvote, also most people would just server hop if their own camp wasn’t able to be placed there or if they didn’t like doing this cheesy method. They removed it awhile ago, also whitesprings sucks for legendary farming now. Probably find 1 legendary ghoul in all of whitesprings + the golf resort. Plus if you did know of magical turrets that could melt ghouls, let me know, I’ll try it against the Queen. 👏
---
It kind of has to happen this way otherwise you would never get certain legendaries like legendary bone hammers. When was the last time you saw an enemy with one of these or a meat hook or a power fist (these are just examples)
---
You got the reward, they're paying out at 3/5 instead of 5/5
---
I mean yeah, nobody wants to get one shot in VATs by a player in stealth mode. But at the same time weapons like the black powder rifle should be capable of doing more damage. You’d be surprised how many shots it can take to kill a person with 110 damage. I don’t think having a weapon that can hit for 300 or so in PvP would be unfair.
---
No. It requires a little effort but it certainly is not too hard.
---
Small victories and what not. Read a book, ride a bike, eat a tasty sandwich. Always things to look forward to durning the day to keep your brain occupied
---
Wait a minute, could the secret service soon make elder Elijah?????? He was always greedy for tech and we do get to take gold bars from him
---
I’ve had a raider with a Gatling laser run at me. Take him down and another raider picks it up. Kill him. All he has is a shotgun. It’s quite silly.
---
Just like you should be able to loot the exact outfits characters a wearing.
---
Yeah. It is usefull for those who dont stop complaining about "SCORE mission impossible" and a lot of stupid math included. I mentioned about this quest before and think that all have to know how to beat the system. Throwing granade for evert wave with maxed radio of explosion u will got like 2000 exp without any buff (depends on ur natural intelect). Just make sure to not use perks to improve ur damage output.  Of course u can use any weapon u like but the best one is gonna be granades or maybe flamer. Doing this event all night long I managed to level up 9 times.  Btw it also can be done well (just for one player) when it is not glitched. Just go up to  the rocks behind the camp where u can observe all 3 respawn points and spray some bullets at every dirrection when u see mobs.
---
Just FYI you can go inside fort defiance&gt;elevator level 4 and scrap it all. Probably quicker.
---
Somehow he has plans... so presumably has finished that quest? Maybe bought plans? Weird
---
I mean, that's pretty much perfect.
---
You could say this about of a lot of games though. Not taking away what you’re saying but that’s just how I feel about a lot of games.
---
it’ll change next season. the points so they can give out different themed rewards and we’re not just getting space forever.
---
I've found it works more often if you holster your weapon. I am always in third person. Started in Oblivion and never went back.
---
Number one is fast travel
---
I get that, and I'm no expert in coding, but if you are using rng to create what drops(arguable as it's often very limited selection), why can the rng be created for the enemy to use it and THEN drop it.
---
So I guess then the question is why DON'T enemies use meat hooks or power fists(and then drop them); in theory they have access to the same loot?
---
Nope, just the dirty one that plays not jazz
---
If I can toss in a recommendation, I highly suggest getting your hands on a Executioners LMG. That thing pretty much decimates anything in 3 seconds flat( I timed it lol)
---
Totally agree. Scrip limit is neutering the game.
---
I think part of the problem is half of the community thinks an idea is fantastic and the other half thinks its complete shit. Several times now they have given us exactly what we asked for and were given animosity in return. Have they dropped the ball more than once? A lot more than once. Are we all a bit indecisive and crave instant gratification? Yes. In short a little more patience and understanding on our part isnt unwarranted. Especially since the majority of players have zero experience in programming or video game creation on a corporate level.
---
Large updates always bring on an onslaught of players; some new, and some veterans who were waiting for new content. This tends to make the servers busier and more unstable. At least, this has been my experience thus far (since B.E.T.A.).
---
If you look at the Wiki page linked above, you can have one from the leveled list and one from the miscellaneous list, but not two from one list.
---
All my PA Frames magically got deleted from my character. Its been a few days so I don't think they're just hidden. Could have something to do with this.
---
I just eat spoiled veggies. Even 400 I usually carry around weight like 3lb with tru-hiker, they fill me up 10% at a time due to herbivore mutation and if I'll get parasites (2% chance) I'll just press a hotkey for them a bit more often to stay nourished. Have a little carrot garden at my camp, I harvest it from time to time and since I don't have good with salt (Another pro, perk points you can use elsewhere) it gets spoiled pretty quick.
---
The game would be way better if they weren't just implementing features for the sake of ticking a box and actually knew how to make things fun/engaging.
---
Reputation system?  Here it is!  There's four repeatable quests.
---
Ammo converter?  Here it is!  Convoluted menu that converts ammo in tiny increments, making it a brutally slow process.
---
Legendary Perks?  Here it is!  90% of them have no meaningful impact on gameplay?
---
Challenge revamp?  Here it is!   Literally the same exact challenges with atom rewards reduced 70% and buggy af
---
Public teams?  Here it is!  None of the bonuses or categories matter.
---
New boss?  Here it is!  No way to consistently spawn the encounter.
---
It's just so fucking saddening to watch them continue to robotically add features without stopping to ask: Is this fun?  Is this polished?  Is this relevant? 
---
They are not playing the game.
---
also berry mentats, but either way not being able to vats someone that can vats/tesla you results in you being ded
---
Ill probably do that thanks
---
VATS is still broken
---
Yeah I really want to enjoy the game, but it's just a case of a really cool idea getting ruined by poor development and a dramatic over focus on monitization over engagement.
---
It'll be great for everybody.
---
Yeah. And that's why server hopping for vendors exists.
---
It's an extremely minor inconvenience.
---
That’s awesome bro. Thanks :)
---
Is that so? Gotta Keep a Eye out for that! Thanks for the Heads up!
---
Same here but I only ever found the wanderer once...on my alt 😭
---
God damn.  That's even worse.   I understand the frustration.  I'd be very pissed.
---
I guess we only have ourselves to blame.
---
I feel you. Im at 800-900 Script constanly and the Script Machine at 0.
---
My Inventory filled with 30 Units of Script Legendarys.
---
Molotov tags, doesn't kill, and marks them (on fire) for others ease of visibility.
---
Good then by
---
They’re all the same. They’re not interested in having fun, they’re interested in being bullies bc they grinded their life away to trade an inventory of gear for a legacy gun that shouldn’t be in the game.
---
I tried countering it with a massive health pool junkie build but i never sunk so low as to use cloaking, outside of “escape artist” at least. I’ll crouch to break their vats and give me a 1 second window where i can hopefully hit them enough to chip out their 50 or so health.
---
Problem is, god mode is SO easy and common, with multiple videos on YT showing how to do it in the effort to make Bethesda FIX THE SHIT and still, here we are. Cloaked tesla dickheads that take zero damage.
---
Fun game
---
The thing is, I didn’t even know I lost my SH until I tried to shoot something and didn’t see billows of acid coming off it. I’m sad they nerfed it because I was able to get the Vault Steel to make a new set.
---
Not exactly thrilled with that solution either. They couldn't just make them drain slower and/or making food last longer?
---
&gt;It makes levelling and scoring so much easier.
---
Playing this Game solo since Launched but Joining a Casual Group will give me that sweet 15% XP Boost!
---
I know it sounds weird but just open and close your pipboy and that should fix it
---
Huh. For AFKers. I didn't know that.
---
I always played every fallout in first person only recently started in 3rd and will never go back except when in some tight interiors
---
&gt; Even though I bought my jetpack at 2k I think.
---
I bought one for 6k caps in Watoga because I started playing when vendors were turned off lol. Not a big deal because of how easy caps come in but it's funny now looking back.
---
I'm about to start sorting through mine and keep the best scrip to weight ratio and drop things that are too heavy and only worth a little scrip
---
Man I often think back to the early days of FFXIV in comparison to 76.  In 2010, that community was very much like this one.  The first iteration of the game was plagued with similar issues.  Cumbersome UI designed to thwart hacking, lack of meaningful content, brutal grindy systems...
---
Yoshida really turned that ship around.  Bethesda doesn't have a Yoshida, I fear
---
It's been good!  Been able to complete both Arktos and Radiation Rumble several times - was a rare thing previously!
---
Not everything is an analogy.
---
I got the mask weeks ago (same mask just not white) and its all right no clipping
---
If you like the mire, the lot outside valley galleria is decently flat and not massive size. I've never built there so can't say if the cars can be removed or not, I'd assume so, but it's already a mall front and there's a red rocket so I think your camp would fit right in. There are some scorched there though. 
---
I think sutton station actually has a parking lot as well, on the southern side. And flat road to the west.
---
u/undeleteparent
---
I played FO4 in 3rd person but for some reason couldn't get on with it in 76,... until I realised I could pan the camera back away from the player a bit more than the default. 
---
Now I flip between the two because I got so used to 1st person.
---
True although I really dont rely on Events for Legendary Farm.
---
I was playing Project Paradise and Fighting Scorched Beasts at Fort Defiance with 10 People was really a Fun Time!
---
Yeah and they only nerfed it because (as far as I know) server stability.  This is a fantastic fun game completely dampered with bugs and reoccurring problems.  It's like they bit off more than they could chew from the very beginning
---
People using exploits and duplicating weapons, items etc. it’s literally cheating. Ruining fucking everything. All the bugs and glitches are a close second but that could count as the same thing honestly. I can’t think of a mechanic that runs properly in this game. Every single thing you do this game is cursed by a bug. Fuck new content, fuck new cosmetics, fuck everything Bethesda just patch this damn game up and get it running properly please.
---
Could be easily accomplished by them adding an anti-fatigue mat (rubber mat, basically) to the model of the station where the player would stand.
---
Semi off topic. I killed Bronx for my ally mission. Didn’t register apparently. Went to kill him again and mothman fucked me up before the cultist’s could
---
I’m at about 14. But having done most of the main game quests, tooling around completing checklists, public events I’ve played a heap and just clearing out sites for XP is getting pretty tiresome. This is exactly how I got burnt out on Destiny 2 and quit playing it.
---
Settler Forager and Raider Punk don't give me quests either, they just keep saying they're busy.
---
Ahh makes sense
---
Amen for that!
---
These Larger Scale Events profiting from this *ALOT*.
---
Made it on both Events with all Animals Alive and 100 Ore, just with 2x Full Groups of Event Teams and Randoms. Really nice!
---
THE FUCK?
---
Beth2: Dude wait until I tell you about this legendary perk idea where you pick flowers to gain health
---
But they didn’t need to nerf it. They needed to get rid of or tone down the animation. Instead of having a great big massive fuck off cloud, just a faint sinister green shimmer, like for Berry Mentats would have been amazing, if not better than the original version *and* kinder to the servers.
---
I left this for a long time because I'd get wrecked by the assaultron in the power armor room every time.
---
I respect that but I just cant bring myself to it.
---
Shut up pierce
---
I’m in the Eastern US time zone... I’m on a lot though, see you around! 😁
---
Never knew this tho thx
---
Yes I would rather get a lunch box from queen than another heavy ass repair kit ( would be nice if I could drop them for others rather than waste them)
---
FORTNJTE
---
My hats off to anyone that read this whole post....my response to all that I did read is potato
---
Lol no worries! Yesterday I found a pretty sweet legendary handmade that I’m now playing with... still love my fixer though! ☺️
---
I hope one day we get a fallout set in new orleans or Mississippi  both woukd contain some weird shit interms of rad creatures
---
I've been sharing 3 points in inspiration, giving everyone an extra 15%. Also strange in numbers with herbivore means cranberry relish gives 25% xp. That and my toon's int was boosted up to around 32. I managed to go from level 200 to 205 this morning.
---
Yeah my weeklies where pooping at 3/5 too, confused the hell out of me at the time until I came on here
---
Nice! If you’re on PC and want company I’d do it again - kalamity929.  I’m in eastern US time zone. 😁
---
I didn't even know Mothman could do damage lol
---
Whenever a hostile one spawns I just see it screaming and flapping its wings menacingly but I can't tell if its ever attacking or not 
---
Also my laser minigun melts them  :(
---
i want a colossal Mothman boss fight haha
---
Ya, I heard they were going to take a look. I hope they make it like the scrip machine. It's quick, easy and fun in a slot machine kind of way.
---
When he flaps and screams it does damage. Absolutely melted my health
---
Following
---
Details details. Added for a bit of color. Damn kids lol
---
&gt; PS stays until either they die or relog
---
Oh my god this is better than killing someone. I know what I'm doing when some asshat punches me when I'm using a vendor from now on.
---
He probably bought Ithem, i bought all the plans and THEN finished bh questline some people sell them 200c a piece
---
maybe I've just been running into low levels or something then, I'm not kidding I actually thought they wete just jumpscare enemies, I didn't know they actually hurt you
---
And one more is the Pleasant Valley Claim ticket... so irritating to exchange 1 at a time
---
Even if it was a Gatling Laser it still wouldn't be a magic one.
---
you can go on r/market76 and ask to buy ammo there.
---
Great question if someone knows
---
Not a bad idea, especially for those of us who like to conserve space.
---
Nice, I wasnt sure if the Inspiration Perks stacks If shared and used.
---
But I usually, cassualy just go with Lovers Embrace (wich I learned goes away after dying!?) And Cranberry Cobbler. Its they easiest to do. Going for that max XP Boost is really work.
---
I miss being a tinted invisible square tho
---
I’m not a kid anymore, but I sure grew up to be pedantic. It did everyone good where I worked, because it needed everything to be done exactly right or something could go *seriously* bad and end up hurting or killing someone. But in less extreme scenarios it annoys people and I don’t particularly care all that much.
---
Yeah I saw him as passive for the lighthouse event but ran into him as a level 30 while I was a 32. Really fucked me
---
A little late now for the holotape one, but I had the same issue, I had to actually pick it up and listen to it for it to mark the challenge complete
---
I believe it is 60 for containers, and 180 for world loot. Or was it 80 and 160? 🤔
---
Or you could just not pick it up and server hop instead, and it will reroll the loot. Depends on what loot you're potentially passing up though, obviously
---
Fallout 3: point lookout dlc
---
I used like 1000 yesterday in my ammo converter
---
Ill be amazed if you get a response from ladydevann.
---
Whenever I've tagged her I'm something like this I get ignored. Community managers are a useless on here.
---
A lot of people mod their combat rifles to .38. Also you can convert it now lol
---
I don't think Todd has cared about Fallout 76 in a very long time. Oh sure, there's reports, "How's 76 doing?" calls to the Texas guys, conversations with the folks in the hall... but with Starfield and ES6 on the (distant) horizon and the TV show in the works plus Deathloop and whatever else is in the mix at the ancillary companies... He thinks about 76 about as often as I think about my kids' parakeet... Oh, hey he's not dead yet. Good job guys.
---
Haha. Not touching that thing
---
This isn't an MMO, there's how many people per server?
---
WAIT
---
if this glitch has indeed returned does that mean the dupe glitches exploiting this very bug will also work? *Hmmmmmmmmm*
---
Yes, it is 255 items, and containers only count as one item.  You will also need to server hop after looting the items.  The ore will only count as one item, ore veins work like containers.
---
I'd say you are better off farming somewhere with lots of junk. Maybe Appalachian antiques nearby.
---
I think todd's hard at work with starfield atm and 76 is directed by someone else
---
I have to admit, that is cool.  TIL something.
---
Hopefully there Will still be an xp repeateble in the double xp weekend
---
respawn glitch.
---
die, respawn, forced to "respawn" again by fast traveling sufficiently away to trigger a loading screen, fast travel back to what i'm doing, hope to god the event isn't over in the interim pick up stuff and resume, so much BS for just wanting to pick up where i left off. 
---
and i swear to God, if i have to hear "alright agents, if you're hearing this it means i'm leaving you some serious business" one more eff'n time, someone's gonna end out like the guy who reprogrammed the impostor sheepsquatch.
---
Assaultrons are tough, really tough.  Aim for anything except the head.  Her head is nearly impenetrable, like most women.
---
The lunchboxes give random special effects when used everyone in the radius of it gets one. One of them is Confetti Mess. [Enemies explode with confetti when killed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDyC3qTzus8)
---
I’m a pretty casual player myself, level 63 and in my thirties. Feel free to add, same name as on here.
---
It isn't really that hard man.  Team up with someone and let them help you.  Are you on PC?
---
admitting you have a problem is the first step
---
Haha. Yeah this was a while ago, I'm fine with them now. I was just saying that's the problem I had with this quest at the time and would hazard a guess this is the problem OP is having.
---
Hey I had the same bug, move your power armor station in your base. Once it is reset you are good and should be able to use it correctly.
---
Is it currently double XP? I shot a level 62 superhuman, got 400xp earlier.
---
Nope.
---
The game had 5 dailies, though. Even if all of the dailies were only 10 atoms each that's still 350 a week. And weeklies were 30-40. you could easily clear 450-500 atoms a week. It only took a little over two weeks of grinding to get enough atoms to buy a bundle and now you pretty much need to almost finish the season to buy a PA skin.
---
To add to this - life goes on but they will always move through this life with you.
---
Well thats amazing!
---
Well then wtf.  Did it glitch?  My jump is normal and no other effects
---
No, think its next or the one after, cant remember. Its in the roadmap
---
I use it on occasion
---
I don't buy into the "They don't listen" stuff. HOWEVER just because they listen doesn't mean they can / will do the stuff.
---
Half the stuff in the game came from our suggestions. Everything from renaming items (specifically power armour was a biggie) to reducing TSE effectiveness, changing how passive worked (to stop using workshops to trigger you in PVP when across the map) to NPCs! Repair kits went down like a lead balloon but they were also requested.
---
Some stuff they can't give us though. Like bigger camps. I played FO4 and built up huge cities using settlements. I want to do that and, if I'm honest, show off to everybody else. The engine just can't handle it though... although I just remembered we'll be getting basements at some point, so yisssssss.
---
There's also other stuff they will ignore. Like everybody asking for more atoms or score. I'd love to have the whole scoreboard already done but I understand why it needs to take much longer.
---
Although they have made scrip a while lot more abundant I suppose.
---
On top of the building at the New Appalachian Central Trainyard.
---
Right next to the decaying corpse, you can’t miss it 👍🏽
---
that armor is the embodiment of FO76
---
Gotcha. Cheers mate
---
I heard September in a video last night.  It is supposed to be dropping with the legendary perks.
---
(small small world song, but done by fasnacht robots)
---
The furniture entrance in blocked. 😂😂
---
I think it's related to the 3rd person camera animation. I could be wrong.
---
I never played any of the dlc for fallout 3 mind explaining?
---
strongly agreed. My only complain about the whole situation - the game shouldn't be online in its current phase.  It must be a single player another fallout RPG with console command to be able to get through some bad implemented scripts. And whoever tests new features must be fired and never ever be able work as a tester. Some new bugs are pretty heavy. It is ok when u cant use ammo converter while wearing power armor but having lost ur 16 hours to build camp is a HUGE problem on their side.
---
Look under your Stats - Effects to see if the mutation is there
---
Adrenaline and/or how bad gauss'/bows are in vats (95% and still constantly miss).
---
I use it with a B3325 Pipe Rifle.... and just oneshot everything 😂
---
the ticket response will be something like:
---
Hey, i didn't get any p....
---
"You get nothing, you lose, good day sir!"
---
But i...
---
"I said good day!"
---
I dont like being punoshed for going in vacations...
---
So us West Virginian's keep nuking a neighboring state, neat not making a mess in our own yard!
---
I did and there are no effects.     i took it from my stash and under the aid tab it was there. I took it and nothing.  Fn F.
---
The RNG gods have blessed you, congratulations!
---
I hope we get a descent raider skin for the SS armor on day, but even if we do... it's probably going to be bugged.
---
Yeah they’re always good to buy
---
Dude sounds like you have a great girlfriend!
---
My condolences for your recent losses.
---
i enjoy the scrap box because it lets me do what i did in fallout 4, hoard everything i can
---
That's what she said.
---
That’s Caxton how I was in fallout 4. I left no stone unturned when looting.
---
In FO76, they neutered armor and weapon weight affecting stealth detection. It's just straight up Agi, a perk card and Legendary effect now. Makes other armor types pointless except for aesthetics.
---
Which is a questionable decision, in my opinion. Because of that change, nearly everyone and their Collectron just runs around in the heaviest armor they can shove their body into, since there is no drawbacks or benefits to use anything less... I just find it silly.
---
Really sorry to hear what you've been through, that sounds really tough. Depression is a tough monster, but games like this can give you at least a little escape, at least it does for me. Stay strong vault dweller, all the best.
---
loot all the things?
---
Yeah lol. I hoarded everything in fallout 4 haha
---
Hey, I could quit any time I want to!
---
What is in your stash that takes up so much room that you don’t have space for plastic?
---
Follow up question, I guess: does anyone want 37 gum drops?
---
I experience this ‘furniture entry’ issue as well, because I rock a miniature camp. I cram five workbenches (no fermenter/brewer for me), a fusion generator, a robot, a sleeping bag, my camp node, and an extractor *inside* my 2x3 tile structure. It’s crowded, but it has atmosphere. 
---
All of that makes for pretty close quarters in my building, and some sense of the animation area would’ve really helped during construction.
---
If the implemented a player auction shop inside. They would get a shit ton more traffic.
---
Stick a gun of your choice into said auction house, players can bid or buy out.
---
I dislike the mic. give us preset voices or more emotes that we can use.
---
Weapons, outfits, ammo, other scrap, just all kinds of stuff I guess. I kinda hoard stuff like I could in other fallout games
---
Nice! Congrats 👍
---
Rad-x suppresses mutations if you took that
---
Game is just like "nah, here's a couple of one star gattling lasers"
---
The weekly and dailies still only take maybe an hour to do, if anything they’re easier now. Now it’s chew one piece of bubblegum instead of 5, and level up instead of level up in some specific goofy ass outfit.
---
Heard people say you can clear seasons if you do all the weekly challenges when they appear, all the dailies every day, and the repeatable at least once a day. The repeatable isn’t hard though, I did it four times just doing the daily and weekly stuff, then another four times when I actually put effort into grinding XP. (Getting 10k XP isn’t that bad when the enemies give out 290, 700, or 1000xp each.)
---
Lol...dying from lack of +4 dr???
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0&amp;t=207s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0&amp;t=207s)  Angryturtle did a whole vid on items respawning 
---
I don't think it effects rare spawns like the red asylum though
---
It’s been answered, and I’m REALLY glad it won’t drop in your stash. I was getting to silly levels of excess scrap so I pulled a bunch I’ll never use to dump it. 20,000lbs. 
---
I may have a hoarding problem.
---
If we get a fallout series in Flordia, will the legendary 'Florida Man' be a major boss?
---
Well, when a game I'm playing crashes every 20 minutes I'd say it's unplayable.
---
As for the "empty" part, I was mostly referring to the lack of human NPCs despite all audio logs and notes left all around.
---
Also, and I'm aware this was a mistake, I instantly made a paragon with Fallout4 so of course I was disappointed on that side.
---
Someone down-voted you on this comment... :s
---
You don’t need to horde weapons, armor and certainly not heavy ammo. Power armor should always be in a chassis if you have any of those. Chems are also super heavy. It is a shift but you can learn to manage inventory. I usually only use 600/800
---
Thats Maryland though.
---
Reported.
---
I guess we'll find out. Hmmmmm is right
---
Ya. I wish they’d change it so that instead of it requiring an animation to activate, it would act a lot like a stash box in that you just activate it.
---
Sorry, I'm on xbox one.
---
I'm pretty sure if you do all the challenges you will finish 2 weeks early, so you can miss some. People are panicking way too much about this season pass.
---
Not at the minute. It's broken. But usually yes.
---
Welcome to online gaming.
---
Players who love their games, want to see it improved, give a lot of awesome suggestions, but they never get implemented from the developers.
---
Berry mentats are the shit
---
when it works it is valuable.. yes
---
The mirror ball is exceptionally hard for some to find.  Good Score.
---
It is.  But its currently broken.  So keep it in mind for later and use something else right now.
---
I’ve just got rare outfits and weapons that I’m selling. My main issue is that I just don’t have enough weight for all my scrap, hardened mass, and flux
---
Yes it is good, but after patch 20 it's not working.
---
Should legendary enemies be using legendary weapons? What about enemies who don’t carry weapons or armor, should they drop nothing? Or do only humanoid enemies drop what they are holding? It’s not a simple thing unless you want to see a sheepsquatch holding a handmade
---
Awesome get.  Congrats!
---
There’s the occasional eat cakes, pies, candy daily.  You could stash those in order to easily complete this daily.
---
Also. why wouldn't you just.. server hop?
---
Ahhh.  Wondered what that was.  Never used that.  Lol.  Cheers
---
I've missed this, thank you so much!
---
It answered all my questions 😉
---
Umm for what?
---
they wouldnt be "previous" if you could..
---
Did you used a Rad-X by chance? It supresses the mutations. Use diluted ones instead.
---
Gauss rifles were reasonably competitive if you knew what you were doing until they dropped the dmg cap from 190 to 110.
---
It is probably  this.
---
If they are capable of firing/using said weapon why not? A lot of the critters drop stuff they could reasonably have picked up for any number of reasons.
---
But I understand and respect your point.
---
Hope the game got more than just new items, what it really needed was an overall fix for crashes and major bugs.
---
It seems this happened tho, so I'll give it another try!
---
1 weapon can weigh as much as 200+ scrap. Just keep that in mind when managing stash. It’s easy to free up large chunks of space.
---
It’s a no build zone...
---
That’s probably my one largest complaint about the game. We shouldn’t have to pay for in game storage.
---
Welcome to live services.
---
You are beautiful just the way you are.
---
WOW. 
---
Didja submit a bug report or tag the devs yet?
---
"Whoa doc, you build a time machine?"
---
Yes marty, we've got to go back!
---
"Why?"
---
Tent skins...
---
"what?"
---
(time travel noise)
---
It's in Maryland and there's a lot of swampy areas in point lookout. I don't even remember why you get sent there but you get on a old steam paddle boat in the capital Wasteland and arrive in point lookout at a very large empty board walk with stalls you'd see like at Tyler County fairgrounds. The main enemy in the dlc is these inbred native folks that look like something from 'the hills have eyes' as point lookout was left untouched by the bombs but basically abandoned by the world except those who stayed there. It's a very eerie dlc. Fallout 4 far harbor dlc is similar to it being in a swamp but point lookout was far bigger.
---
Exactly man. I don’t see why a limit on our storage is even necessary.
---
That's my base game, I've had near max caps constantly since level 50 do I buy rare plans as often as I can and rare items but I always get good deals which makes it harder to lose caps. Bought fasnacht crazy guy mask for 10 caps, fixer plan for 25 or 250 I forget which, guns and armour that goes for 15k-32k caps for 600-1000.
---
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) is what you need
---
Or faster fire rate broadsider....
---
This is heavy
---
What platform?  If yours is gone and not showing up in your effects, then you'll need another one.  It should have worked.  You don't have to remove anything to use serums, just don't take undiluted RAD-X after you have mutations.  That will suppress them.  Any other form of rad resistance is fine.  I prefer Radshield.
---
I was getting score all night for it. This event I was getting them one after another.
---
I don't think I could play again without 1st, was lucky enough though a friend gifted me a 12 man who month subscription
---
Starched genes is the one that you need to remove for serums to work, then equip it again after
---
Don't thank Bethesda for a crappy game if that's what your doing
---
Yep I am PC! That's exactly what we did. What's your IGN?
---
You okay there son?
---
I think it was capped initially because of people abusing duping and other glitches in the game to hoard large amounts of items. It’s stupid that they would punish regulars players because of something that is their fault though, let alone turn it into a revenue generator.
---
It’s always nice to know how caring this community really is. It’s amazing how a game that started with such a bad rep could come so far and build an amazing community all the way through. Love this game, love this community.
---
I should do that, thanks for pointing it out! I'll report the bug this evening.
---
Ok.  Ill try it.
---
U sexy litttle loot goblin
---
Honestly man
---
It's fun in the early levels, as you go in highers levels the bar won't increase as fast.
---
I want Biv's Jukebox.  I'd pay mucho atoms.
---
Ps4.  It may have been a bug.  I never take radx
---
Ssssssshhhh down vote this so it doesn't get fixed.
---
It's a really fun team event if you all agree to melee only, and stash your junk before heading in.
---
Will that still be a thing with the Seasons update though, is the question.
---
I was under the impression it didn't work that way, if you didn't loot stuff, there wouldn't be spawns
---
I know it doesn't help much, but there's a mod that does this for PC on the Nexus.
---
Why you have no legs?
---
I have a similar issue on xbox. Usually with my own  footsteps, I can't quite figure what causes it but I think it's related to leaving dialogue early. 
---
My footsteps all but disappear and some other sounds like some reloads or character injury grunts, It seems to affect the environmental sounds as well. Makes everything seem really quiet until the shooting starts. Also will not go away until I log out and back in
---
Sorry, I'd make you one but I'm on PC.
---
Game throwing?
---
Just because I chose to sit in a bush and watch as you all die because you ran out and got killed isnt really a reason for me to get reported.
---
I'm just learning not it's repeatable... Pretend I never said this 😂
---
Thanks anyway!
---
Being able to group up with randos without giving them full access to your CAMP is pretty cool. I know it wont happen due to the way playstation is setup but let the person who joined know youre in a party chat.
---
I think its a bug. Sometimes they are normal and sometimes not.
---
Incorrect. It does not need to be removed.
---
It happens to me anywhere at any time, Ive had to quit numerous games of nuclear winter because of it (sound is so important to stop people sneaking up on you). 
---
Ive tried everything in all the other similar reddit posts and cant solve it.
---
Absolutely agree
---
Beth1: "They want workshops marked and travel-ready"
---
Beth2: "I know exactly what they want"
---
(bethesda eliminates all fast travel and map markers)
---
I'm still trying to get more info but it seems to me I'll be on a server that's popping public events just fine (always one up with a few minutes downtime in between) then someone will launch a nuke and afterwards they're practically nonexistent. This is all anecdotal at present as I dont have enough data to tell if anything else is at play.
---
The Pitt really isn't all that far away really
---
Wait, that's where Maryland is? Suddenly I'm a lot more ok with far harbour creatures in the game.
---
Excellent advice. Did not know that. Cavaliers I guess will work better since I do exactly that, especially on the Queen. Thanks!!!
---
If he is experiencing a glitch when a serum does nothing, then yea he does
---
I'd suggest trying out Nuclear Winter... 
---
But Frog Legs is a thing.
---
Well that’s not game throwing, game throwing is purposely making sure you and your teammates get killed so someone else can win. Ex: launching a nuke right on top of your team. The only exception to this would be if the circle is so small to the point where you’d have to run into the storm to avoid it.
---
Thanks. Good advice!
---
One of the daily things was to eat 1 bubblegum. I would think Bethesda might have  some daily for the candy. 
---
If not just drop or sell. Stuff is common to find again if needed.
---
Did you pull his finger yet?
---
Why would a glitch have anything to do with it? That perk does not stop serums from working.
---
Weird. They still look the same to me. Not sure what other people are seeing.
---
I had this occasionally after listening to a holotape (tape ends, 5 minutes of static, then all noise in game goes away)...
---
also had the Nuke-Zone wind noise seemingly stuck on, after leaving the nuke zone, until i logged out and in. i had hoped my camp ally would try to yell over it, but no such luck.
---
Awesome, thank you
---
That’s interesting as often when I have sound bugs it’s after a change in Audio state, like dropping into vault 51, or the Nuke circle moves or an event starts
---
So what about bugs rhat prevent you from getting score? I logged in for the first time yesterday and 3 of my weekly and 2 of my daily challenges where completed. Im level 1 and am yet to finish any weekly challenges.
---
Yeaaah, more skins, that's what we truly need.
---
(Live to Win song plays)
---
(grinding montage, with gameboard progression)
---
Because I had the same thing happen, and perk starched genes at level two prevents you from mutating, but instead of it being just from rads it just stops all mutations. Rare but happens
---
I love how often people actually complete Radiation Rumble with public teams added. Now if only the rad barrel plan wasn't just a myth lol.
---
I found out this last night. 
---
Did just that and then went on about the match.
---
But people like fallout because it’s not like other games. And yes, it was a main selling point. Idk if you were there at launch but it was definitely a selling point. What they would have done is just made the battle pass quests their on thing instead of replacing daily and weekly challenges.
---
You're assuming the repeatable for that week is experience gain.
---
WEST VIRGINA
---
If you install the bethesda launcher version to your steam directory, then install the steam version (to the same location), you will have access to your bethesda atoms instead of your steam atoms while launching from steam, though you will have to enter your user name and password each time you launch the game.  Also, when an update comes out, you would need to use the bethesda launcher to update, otherwise access to your Bethesda atoms would be lost.
---
I give it another try, just got my chores done so I got some time.
---
That is indeed. Thank you!
---
Y'all we are just a few days in... ask yourself: what level are you in the season pass already? Now extrapolate that to September. You got time.
---
I HATE being negative in my comments.  I cant stick any sunshine in this at all.  Oh, i suppose that if i was lvl 20, the converter might save my ass.  So the implementation of ammoterm can only be useful for small transactions.   
---
If you are looking to convert huge amounts to some small, tiny, pathetic amount of useful ammo, its perfect.  The interface was written by a 14 yr old, and tested on an etch a sketch
---
Yes bugs are unacceptable. The general way to avoid this is to not be logged in when the dailies reset. Not sure if you were, just a little heads up.
---
Unfortunately the math says otherwise, you need to grind the repeatable xp a bit. Im just planning on using atoms for the last ones if necessary
---
What happens in a private world stays in a private world😂
---
Eat or sell them
---
Still hope we one day get the rest of the Panhandle added!
---
I'm level 18 atm, so I'm sure u can make it up with some grinding
---
On mine they dont have the workshop icons and instead have a generic one. The farm has a farm icon, the food factory is the same one as vault Tec industrial farm, Charlton landfill is a pile of cars etc.
---
But there's no way you would know any of them are workshops.
---
That's our end game, paying $12.99
---
I've just made a post about it, but I'll link the video below aswell. The maths doesnt say otherwise. If you did all the challenges you would finish 2 weeks early, you can certainly miss challenges and not grind xp.
---
https://youtu.be/UUnOYA-jFrI
---
Same thing that happens every time this question gets asked.
---
I have been having this happen for over 2 months (at least) on PC.
---
The only way I have found to trade with them is from as far away as possible at an angle so you are looking at their side, or to try and target their leg.
---
I am now used to doing it this way, and a little shocked when I can walk up to one and trade instantly without doing the work around. 
---
I have the same problem with Walt as well.
---
And Ohio gets left out again...lol
---
Maybe, if they fix it great. I hope they let us fast travel to workshops though. Having to walk to them serves no purpose.
---
Just as a reference, Destiny 2 is an outlier. Fortnites battlepass is roughly the same price. Apex legends is too. Hell, the current price to buy all of the event packs and get a limited time item for having said packs is sitting at 120 something dollars. And that's only with the added money that comes in buying those coins in bulk.
---
If anything. You should commend Destiny 2.
---
LOL. I crafted huge amount of ultracite fusion for my guns yesterday.  Then I remembered its ultracite plasma cells.... dumb ass, is me
---
Responder tag should be Raider tag.
---
(nightmare of fasnacht music bugging back into existence)
---
Exactly. I honestly think the issue is that Bethesda has lost their fanbases trust, which leads to everything they do being so heavily questioned. Noone is going to release a season pass that is impossible to do without spending currency.
---
harpers ferry and berkely springs are at the end of the panhandle, this is all of west virginia squished into a square shape
---
I am on my way home from vacation but have been asking my buddies about it. We all have generally the same playing habits and I was asking how it has been going. I was pleased to hear that after a few hours my buddies were already rank 11. I have been saying the whole time that I imagined we wouldn't have any trouble reaching max because we all just naturally gravitate towards grinding challenges and higher tier public events. I will say I was a little worried but it sounds like the number crunchers at Bethesda did their homework and average people, those who work and play in their off time, need not worry. Most people end up running queens and other public events because that is the current end game and it seems those that do will be fine. It was a good move to include the public events in the SCORE progression. I think without it there would have been issues but I have heard nothing but positive remarks from those I play with. Good to know we can continue dropping queens, shell shocking imposters, and doing our thing. 
---
Cheers stay safe.
---
The Chinese Stealth Armour is especially useful in the Radiation Rumble Event.  It makes it extremely easy to get the irradiated ore without worrying about combat.
---
Wow.  Love the idea of fusion cannons on my rooftop!!!  Upgrade the turrets?! ?! ?!
---
Wicked pissah idea
---
Sorry to hear this, what happened and what you went through. I'm glad that this game and the community has taken your mind off the bad things that has happened.
---
Now I wanna watch the Warcraft episode of South Park for that montage.
---
It really is
---
Found skin rug buildable of wendigo collossus also
---
Interesting, guess i dont need the NW ones after all
---
Hands down the best place for cobalt is around lake Eloise.  The only problem is a lack of stabilizing materials there.  There is a fissure site that you can pull ultracite from but unless it is glitched you won't see too many scorched.
---
but like, how to you 'confirm' the trade. the only options i see are 'offer this item' and 'request this item'
---
Also under-16 Chess champion
---
Where did you find this stuff? Sounds like rewards from the upcoming event.
---
Im nuno_2 
---
I was level 79 80 or 81 cant remember
---
Also i just had built a jetpack so i was using it a lot 
---
And i had an explosive gatling gun
---
Indeed, play the game you paid for and enjoy it, but you didn’t buy an endless supply of free daily and weekly atoms. 
---
I for one believe in supporting the games I love so that more can be made, but you do with your money what you will. Good day.
---
It’s from the event that not available yet
---
Watch the angry turtle video posted above by Rammadeus, it explains the whole subject in great detail.
---
raider and mini nuke? i feel like i‘ve missed some lore. ahhh.
---
Fallout 4 and fallout 76 are tow completely different games
---
It’s a Halloween skin from challenges during then, update 20 had unlocked those and Christmas ones
---
It's a Halloween event reward that's being given out inadvertently right now after gaining enough NW xp.
---
So all of them are Available?
---
You weren't a 1st member then. You shouldn't get past NW event prizes just because you play and are earning XP after the fact, either. It'll probably come back around at some point. Be patient.
---
Sadly this only has 50 upvotes. This is 100% correct but the community gives them a pass anytime they do anything. Even if it's a half ass effort.
---
They totally just fucked it up and threw it out. You're right, the slower weapons need more damage, melee needs some benefit, faster weapons need to be dialed back a bit. I'm no expert on this though.  How does NW balance things.
---
I would stay in survival and never bother anyone that didn't want to be bothered and I would be happy.
---
Best part about public teams is you can now join back to colloct your loot after the game crashes.
---
The perk system is more intuitive in 76.  My advice for a beginning player is to watch this video, because it explains things way better than I can.  It is live and 5 hours long but the TLDW version is to put points in strength and agility, max out concentrated fire ASAP and use sneak and headshots to your great advantage as a beggining player.  Hope it helps.

THey re (or were) useful for the atom challenge of consume candy/cakes/pies.
---
IDK if thats still in the season challenge list.
---
I am very sorry for your loss. I lost my father over a year ago. You need to know good times do come. Stay strong.
---
They can only be attained thru distant thunder
---
Yes, until Bethesda patches them back out
---
It makes perfect sense. Workshops are PvP areas. Just imagine how much easier it would be for grievers to get there.
---
Not exactly unique, it's a slightly lop-sided sidegrade (higher damage for lower range compared to combat rifle).
---
Instead of cult of the mothman cult of the Todd-man
---
If your not a pvp person activate pacifist mode then just farm events while on a event based public team for a xp boost
---
Are they worth something?
---
Griefing isnt as prevalent as the early days. But this game has something rely awesome, an amazing community of people ready and willing to help
---
Your character data is stored server side, so not possible.
---
Even in a SP game saves are kept separate from the game files for reasons like this.
---
The headless ghouls have been replaced with headless scorched
---
I don’t know
---
Ok so what happened then? Was it his PS4 or did he accidentally delete them?
---
I would guess they want them now because of the Brotherhood of Steel content on the horizon.
---
A lot of your familiarity with 4 will port into 76.  It would be much harder to pick up 76 without that.
---
I have the same exact problem.    And, because i use an xbox controller on my PC, the sound cuts out completely and the controller vibrates.    Beth support does have literature on this problem...but it;'s basic...Change to 16 bit 48k...update driver, etc.     But i never have a problem with anything else.     So i don't want to change my system around too much.
---
There really is no "wrong time" to join, so you'll be fine.
---
There's really only two stumbling blocks new players can fall over...
---
1. Areas of the map are level specific - where you start is low level mobs and shouldn't cause much of a fuss. However, the game does not level-gate quests, so if you stick to the main story you will be sent into areas significantly higher level than you, and trust me, it's no fun being a level 14 wastelander being swarmed by a pack of level 61 ghouls. Google a map, check the levels, and try to spend more time exploring the starting areas before ploughing on.
---
2. Be very careful when you level up. First, select a SPECIAL stat, then choose a perk card. You do not have to choose the same type of perk card as stat, ie, you can choose Strength stat, and then choose an Intelligence perk card. Be sure to choose stats and cards that best suit your preferred weapon. Personally I love me the heavy guns, so I went with Strength points so I could get the 3 Heavy Gunner damage-increasing perk cards. You can make or break your character by levelling the wrong stat. You CAN respec your points once you hit level 51 - each level past 51 lets you swap SPECIAL points around or choose a perk card. Resprccing can take forever, so plan ahead.
---
Other than that, pick up EVERY weapon and armor piece you can find, and then scrap it at a workstation - you can learn mods for that specific item by scrapping, and then craft yourself better gear.
---
Welcome to Apallachia!
---
And there’s me in a fully decked out elder power armor wondering wtf is going on
---
I have no idea as I haven't seen the post.  Could be a number of things.  Or he's just making stuff up.  It is Reddit after all.
---
it's essentially fallout 4 with a multiplayer mod slapped on it. 
---
I love it! 
---
Try and not spec into 3 different weapons. You kinda want to get 15 points in whatever stat your weapon is. str for melee/shotguns. per for rifles. agility for pistols etc. 
---
pick up everything. always scrap junk before storing it. Join/start a building team as you get bonus intelligence and more int = more xp. 
---
Take your time. Explore. Things get too tough go away and level and then go back. 
---
a point or two in Pharma farma (luck) early will keep you in chems. 
---
Melee is overpowered early game. Saves ammo as well. get yourself a good melee weapon. 
---
Capture workshops. you get xp, loot, chems and plans. you can then either defend or let it be taken by the enemy. it is easier and quicker to take it back than defend.
---
This.  Activate Pacifist for sure.
---
And treasure maps.
---
Im so sorry for all of your losses. Keep your head up.
---
It saves my last choice w a mouse..?
---
You still get diseases even with Herbivore?
---
I have played with him before and don't think he would but Idk. Just rn I'm a lil scared to play if it's deleting accounts, especially since I only use 1 so all my work gone.
---
Those I forgot about them
---
TZ Map from Nexus Mods is a great altetnative.
---
16bit 48k is low is it not? Have Beth said having this any higher can cause issues?
---
I had that happen to me with a PA jet pack awhile ago.  Dont think its just new and for the ghillie
---
I jump in front of them and press the store button again.
---
They are harder to find and now the duped ones are drying up.
---
It’s from the new event “ Something sentimental “ which will be available on 4Th August with Patch 21
---
You don't. Because, Bethesda. That's precisely the issue.
---
I'd also hazard at SE having more people working on it too, as well as an almost infinite money pot. 😁
---
But yes, pre-ARR the game was a huge mess from what I've seen, but look at both FFXIV and NMS - how they both started and how they are now - and look at FO76 too. Not as big a transformation, but they're working on it.
---
If this was EA they'd have done fuck all. 😅
---
The scrapbox and the survival tent alone are worth the price of admission.
---
Well if it was an issue it would be all over this sub and this is the first I'm hearing of it.  He probably accidentally deleted it or something.
---
That’s what you get for not giving Todd your money
---
Hopefully. Thnx for clearing it up.
---
Yes this is the way I think too. I was upset and pretty much called update 20  a 80% failure. Only thing that saved update 20 form being DOA is the public teams system.
---
Id rather have atoms to spend on things I wan5 vs having some board game give me random stuff.
---
I find this calculator to be on the money.  It has predicted my progress well so far.
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)
---
T-60 plans (the armor itself) is the rarest power armor plans to get (excluding Strangler and T-65) it took me a while, but i unlocked a full set of the plans from treasure notes.
---
Cryo grenade, ohh yeah
---
F
---
Pro-tip, just don't use the ammo converter.
---
Or is making it up so people will pity them and give them free stuff.
---
You will have fun next month with an new public event fighting wendigo collosus as a Boss
---
Usually goes around 4000 caps on trades.
---
LOL. Upvoted for gigawatts.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
You go after hearing about the boat offering rides. Lots of strange things happen. My second favorite fallout DLC
---
Buy a bunch of B2525 handmades on ebay and then trade them for stuff you want
---
Agreed! The rewards/risks are so minimal, I wish people wouldn't sweat so damn hard, because it might actually be fun to throw down in a nukashine brawl, or a grenades-only fight. Would love to have a thunderdome at my camp for just the occasion.
---
No excuse. Diablo 2 had a trade system
---
The math and the calculator made for this tells you otherwise tho.
---
I am the same way lol I got mine the first year and have worn it every second I haven't been in power armor
---
Idk tbh I played with him a few times and he didn't seem to be like that but tbh I'm. I hope he is tbh.
---
Agreed. That’s how it works in 4
---
Maybe, but you're better running monster mash as the rewarded candy is weightless and you get a few hundred for doing the event.
---
Probably a bug.  I've seen a few servers like that with nothing up for extended periods, even Manhunt which seems to pop extremely frequently.
---
Stepsister... *triggered*. For whatever reason.
---
And over that year and a half you’ve had the opportunity to earn 10,000+ completely free daily and weekly atoms. How many more free atoms do you feel you’re entitled to?
---
It happened to me a few weeks ago when dailies were still for atoms.  I went into NW before going into adventure mode and it checked them all off. 80 atoms gone.  I decided to eat it but if it happened again I wouldnt be happy.
---
Bethesda needs to put varaitions of the jukebox in the build menu.
---
Once you know the plan then you can build the jukeboxes once you complete the associated event/quests.
---
Completing bivs nukashine quests will give you p his jukebox
---
Completing one violent for the first time successfully will give you the sons of dane jukebox
---
Completing and reaching level 3 in NW will give you that jukebox.
---
Best in game community I have ever seen you'll run into your fare share of griefers but if that happens find a high level player (like myself) and we will nuke the hell outta there camp for ya
---
As someone who has spent 100 hours server hopping looking for the red asylum i can guarantee that changing servers spawns different uniforms and hats. 
---
As long as you don't get the same server of course which usually happens to me when it's 4am.
---
Look at my reply to someone on your comment and watch the video. The math doesn't tell you otherwise, your math must be wrong.
---
Interesting good to know
---
They don't play their own game. Period.
---
Adrenaline perk
---
I don’t think this is just fallout. I think this is just the internet. 
---
But yeah I hear you
---
Did you think you had an online girlfriend....
---
Nice.
---
&gt;Yeah I understand if you can't play all the time you are at a disadvantage, but that's the same with any season pass on any game that has one
---
Can you give a couple of examples of games that heavily incentivise daily play over playing a long session say once a week please?
---
You made a whole new account on reddit to troll and this is the best you came up with?
---
You hit the nail on the head.
---
Don't go to Thailand pal
---
lmao someone got trapped
---
Can confirm PS4 also, so not platform specific.
---
Yes this calculator is a great thing! 
---
Sadly it says I will not make it lol
---
The big problem with two-handed melee in 76 is that all melee is apparently hardcoded to only strike one enemy at a time.  It's not like in 4 where swinging a Super Sledge would clobber everything in your field of view.  It removes one of the biggest incentives for going in the 2h direction.
---
I also find that the interval for when the game queues the next melee swing is overly generous.  I've died frequently when my character decides to swing again before blocking or using a Stimpak.  The game has no concept of an action queue, but melee swings seem to take precedence, even when they haven't started.
---
On the flip side, one of the big differences from 4, for the better, is that enemies don't block nearly as often.  In 4, they would constantly shrug off rocket-powered concrete blocks with the back of their arm, *unless you weren't looking at them when you started your swing*, which really goes to show how badly programmed it was.  Aside from looking ridiculous, that mechanic did nothing but prolong the fight unless you used VATS on every enemy, because VATS overrides blocking.
---
100%
---
I'm going to have to massively cut prices in my vendor. I just need space at this point.
---
Maybe I'll just do a 4th of July sale. Lol.
---
Meg, have you looked at our caps lately? They've got skulls on them.
---
r/hiddensausages
---
They only thoroughly test Atomic Shop content.
---
Everything else gets thrown in the "fuck it" bucket.
---
No the last choice you made in the terminal is auto saved so when you click through the menu again, it will automatically jump to that ammo.
---
Clicking your mouse just skips the text loading animation
---
the story parts of wastelanders are completely free. the special edition only comes with cosmetics. any edition of fallout76 is gonna be on wastelanders.
---
So does Borderlands now, but both were built on multiplayer. Fo76 is a single player game forced to be multiplayer, Fallout has always been a single player game. If they added a mailing system I'm sure it would be taken down in days due to exploits.
---
yeah that bug is annoying as shit.
---
Does it change anything if you loot what you find?
---
This would be a great way to implement them.
---
it was 
---
RIP
---
In the floor decor category when building
---
U have to press y in order to make a critical hit when using Vats...... Lol
---
Nein.
---
Ive been a 1H melee for at least a year.  Seems to OK to me most of the time.
---
I don’t vats in melee, and I tend to stand and fight - doing that, most enemies come to me.
---
My goto is a vampire switchblade -  I don’t stop swinging until the enemy is dead (or plural if it a mob) - I can probably count on one hand the times I’ve tried to block.  Even when a SB landed in front of me - didn’t block, just kept swinging that switchblade until it was dead.
---
 I agree, scorched can run backwards way faster than you would expect.  If they run too far, I often ignore them and keep going wherever I was headed.
---
Yogis and SSQ i rarely melee - I carry an auto-weapon for them and things that fly.
---
I don't know when or if it's changed - only that it's been this way for a while.
---
So I just had a thought... Why is the silver submachine gun ever been added to the game? As a weapon drop or atomic shop skin? I would seek out an SMG to use if I had that skin for it. Bethesda really should add it.
---
(Only thing is... Should it be an atomic shop skin? Or a unique weapon with pre determined legendary effects like the Fancy Pump Shotgun? I like the idea of another unique weapon to grind for and use as a bartering token, but I think I’d much prefer skins than new weapons, so I could add the skin on any god roll SMGs I find.)
---
Nice
---
Yes. It is a very stupid mechanic imo. Really throws off your game play, well mine anyway
---
It's not too complicated, but without FO1st, the stash limit is frustrating.  There is still a stash limit, but junk stash with FO1st is unlimited.  Many use an alternate character to load excessive stash.
---
So the shots when I head shot for 2113 as standard and then they jump to 2450. That’s not a critical?
---
Com on now. Tisk risk. Don't go wishing QoL perks into existence 😂😂 this is 76 after all lol. 
---
But yeah. Like when you scrap stuff. I agree 👍😁
---
This just happened to me too! Gutted that I couldn't finish it on my own. Upvoted for those lower(ish) levels like us to hopefully see and avoid.
---
That's the problem. You just have to hope the other person doesnt grab your item for free and back out of the trade before you get their trade item.
---
It’s pretty difficult to grief someone, I wouldn’t consider the game particularly complicated… a lot of similar mechanics to 4. Some things are new, like breaking down junk, but its easy enough to get the hang of. Also you need to repair broken weapons and armor at workbenches. 
---
Also I think it’s still pretty early in the game is lifecycle so don’t worry about that.
---
yes you have to manually hit y to do a crit ...but headshots (the yellow damage numbers) are also concidered crits as far as buffs that buff crits go ...so if you are a commando build you just hold down the y button the whole time you are shooting to keep using your crits over and over
---
Put your score into this calculator https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf for me it says I will not make it unless I grind the repeatable 5-6 times a day which I don’t have time for. 
---
So yes I’m one of those who will not make it.
---
I'm on XBOX, I wish we could get mods.
---
Ah. Ok. Very weird then. Mine are still that circle thing. 
---
Maybe it’s a visual glitch?
---
Ok. Right now withought dojng that I flatten a sb in 2 seconds and maybe 8 shots. How bloody fast am I gonna do it with crits????
---
Well once u press y in vats, the next shot will be a critical hit. No matter if it's the head, torso or limbs. It'll increase by (I think) 50% of the original damage unless u have perks like better criticals in the luck category
---
they wont.
---
someone told me that if you take a uniform from one of the 3 spots another wont spawn there for 20 hours. 
---
I haven't found this to be the case.
---
If you are on PC part of the issue with nukes is the UI is broken and will launch the nuke where your cursor is on second confirmation even though that isn't where you placed it on the map.   
---
Throwing is usually highly subjective so I'd rather that be left out. Usually that option gets spammed by people and just slows down the turnaround on other reports that actually matter.
---
Yeah I just respecced as adrenaline is screwed figured I may as well go crits
---
Ah could I have it for my low level character? Being able to get lead for him from lucky hole mine would be a huge help to me.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
On fallout out of all places......
---
My first win was a surprise. I was trying to get to a safe hiding spot when i saw a person walking near me so i shot him with my scoped lever action rifle and he died and popped that i killed the last guy and i won.
---
Might as well. That's what I'm doing with my gunslinger build
---
Sorry I’m working bud. I will when I have the time!
---
Only if it's also accompanied by a Viva Piñata sound effect.
---
That’s a fair point but I play on Xbox one, the bug might exist here too but I’ve only ever launched a nuke once in NW and it went right where I picked.
---
You have been missing the critical hits.    
---
Ideally critical hits are guaranteed hit as long as hit percentage is &gt;0   
---
I heard that they bypass armor too, don't know if that is true.
---
3 star stalker’s fat man
---
lol well wouldnt do you much on a creature that you can kill that fast but those crits will add up on imposter or SBQ
---
Had someone do this while I was fighting the Queen i jumped straight on the mic and asked the dude to please stop because I don't want to leave then he/she proceeds to buy just about every item.
---
the map is really weird, its like the majority of the whole state warped and shrunk down. really weird proportions.
---
Yeah I built a new base right before update 20 dropped and decided to hook my vendors power to a garage door, so when i turn them off it locks them in, i guess if someone was desperate they can probably glitch through (assuming you can glitch through garage doors the same as others)
---
The daily Scrip limit ranks pretty high up there.  Mostly because the new Bullion grind creates a whole new supply-and-demand for it, but they left that 150 limit completely unchanged.  Like, "lol we got it right the first time, no need to adjust it when we add more things!"
---
I'd imagine it's especially bad for those who are crafting things like Plasma Casters and Gauss Miniguns - the weighty stuff - because their characters are just screwed into tomorrow if they roll a bunch of 3\*s that are worthless.
---
No prob, I'd recommend watching it. Alot of people are working it out wrong. Also take into consideration the double score weekend and double XP event. I really wouldn't worry about getting to 100.
---
Off to find a big monster to twat!!!!  So I hold down Y and fire in vats and big numbers should appear or I have to press it each time?
---
Anyone can buy your stuff. Store your vendors. All disconnecting power does is take you off the map
---
Aren’t they already easy enough to kill. I doubt 10% is gonna make any difference
---
I think GameStop still has it on sale preowned for Xbox for 9.99. That’s not too big of a financial commitment in case you don’t like it.
---
Is that what "A colossal problem" has been renamed to?
---
I just semi tested it, and it seemed like it was different spawns, but ill do a more thorough test when i have more than 5 mins to spare. Any idea if it is account or character based?
---
VATS critical hits are just an extra wee tickle added to normal body/weak spot damage.
---
Unless you're running a hard hitting +VATS crit damage weapon, with all the VATS crit related perk cards all maxed out, you haven't really been missing out on much.
---
BETHESDUH..BETHESDUH never changes.
---
I had to destroy 2 more liberator bots for 1000 s.c.o.r.e. so I fast travel to vault 76 to take out a couple and when I get there they were already all dead so I hopped out of the server and then loaded back in and immediately turned and killed 2 liberators and check my score and it showed I completed the challenge but I was NOT rewarded my points.
---
Well I am now!  Vats perks on and running a 50 vats handmade and fixer both bloodied.
---
I think the scrap box should have had a limit for non subscribers, like 1000 for all common scrap, 100 for uncommon scrap, and like 25 of each flux. So you couldn't exactly hoard an ass ton of stuff but you have enough to do building, crafting, etc. While the survival tent and unlimited scrap box are still for first members.
---
it's gonna be "free" in 5 days if you have xbox gamepass (also on pc)
---
It would make it easier for us all to get there. Which is a good thing.
---
For ss underarmor: +4 STR +4 END +2 PER 15 DR / 15 ER / 15 RAD. Pretty much the best underarmor available right now unless you’re stealth rifle/pistol build
---
its about medium complicated.
---
there is a learning curve, and many systems but builds and mechanics in this game arent like POE or anything like that.
---
Noticed a few areas with things added, they'll probably add more when the &gt;!steel dawn!&lt; thing happens, so it might be best to relocate now to avoid further annoyances
---
You do get a nice reward the first time you complete it.  I used it as a primary weapon for a while.
---
Sweet. 48 days here lol. 
---
Nice link mate 👍
---
This would be fine, but public events aren't giving any SCORE right now
---
I started selling or dropping... can't keep up.
---
If you are on PS4 I can craft some for your Camp. Otherwise all the luck man!
---
Or better yet, remove this useless prefix from the loot pool altogether.
---
I love we're at the "log out or the game will break" level of incompetence. This really is one for the record books.
---
Trapped, far from it pal. I'm not dumb enough to believe these idiots, I'm just calling em out bc I'm sick of it. There r kids on there for f*** sake. Tricking ppl so u can steal their stuff... pathetic. These comments r the example.. just rudeness. Does it make u guys feel cool to downgrade ppl or something, bunch of freaks.
---
Why add skins? You are just gonna be stealthed anyway.
---
Yup 
---
Something Sentimental it’s the quest leading to the colossal problem Event
---
ah yes, the bloody poops following the hot dog eating contest, fond memories
---
im half tempted to take my AR up there, strip it down, and show them what the fuck a rear sight block looks like (missing from skin)
---
from what i have seen.. sadly no
---
How much xp is needed for the glow in the dark costume ?
---
This isn't correct.  At least not according to an actual map but that might be Bethesda's doing and not OPs fault.  Look at an actual map of West Virginia and based on Pennsylvania's line in OPs picture and in reality you'll see this can't possibly be correct.
---
For reference:

---
Did you know players can unlock all of the scorch killer receivers at a terminal inside the Charleston fire department once they complete the quest for searching Big Bend Tunnel for survivors.
---
you can just hold it down (especially for commando because of how fast it fills up ) but for single shot guns i just press it when it lights up
---
Show them what right-handed weapons look like, too.
---
i have found uniforms on my main and swapped to an alt and picked up the uniform. I don't know why i swapped to an alt.. but i did. 
---
Even if you don't find a red it's still a good way to make money as the others have value. In one day i found a pink (10-15), 2 greens (4-5k), 2 blues (3-4k) and some browns. Blues sell better than greens.
---
The damage rubberbanding has only gotten worse over time.
---
It used to be something you'd get with shotguns, especially explosive ones.  But it's progressed to the point where even if I'm backpedaling while firing my rifle - not even commando, just one shot at a time - a great deal of those shots trigger the rubberbanding or fail to inflict damage at all, despite the damage numbers claiming that I am.  Heck, I could be all alone with a single Scorched, VATS headshot it, see the damage number, and their HP ping right back to 100%.
---
And when you're melee, heaven forbid you try to strike an enemy while chasing it.  You see damage numbers, but the server rejects them, probably because it has a different interpretation of the distance between you and the target.
---
Becareful you may upset other people stupid sensibilities
---
You'd think that after such a loss you'd use games as a ditraction but it never really works that way at first. I lost my mother suddenly this november and didn't play for a month after that. I dunno why. Even games were too much.
---
Sorry for your losses man, I hope you start feeling better soon.
---
Yep same thing happened to me because someone in my public team launched a nuke. Wish I knew beforehand cause I was saving the quest for later as it was the last main quest afaik (I've already done the Wastelander questline).
---
Didn’t know I had to play as a guy on Fallout. I musta missed that rule. I did, but just wanted to change it up a little. Not that you need an explanation. You play your way, we’ll play our way. You do you boo.
---
Yeah, and teammates can see your unpowered camp and port there free of charge.
---
The one thing ive had a problem with is the time gates. Couldn't care less about lack of real item for item trading, couldnt care less about how grindy things are to get, couldnt care less about the non tradable endgame content, couldnt care less about anything that isn't restricting what i do just because of what day it is. I hated scrip when they added it because of the timegate. I hate caps because of the shared cap pool which made the timegate for caps unbearable to me. I hate the score system because of the mainly (except for the ONE xp weekly) timegate focused challenges. This isnt a F2P game so why are they timegating all the endgame aspects when all i want to do i play the game and not have to hop off early becuase my stash is full of legendaries/ ive done all the dailies. It gets to the point where im off the game maybe an hour after i get on, because all the real progress i can make is done for the day. Sure i can do events or... Walk around i guess? Most of the events dont give good rewards to endgame players/ dont pop up enough to justify sitting there for half an hour waiting for  3 legendaries i cant fit in my stash from uranium fever. I just don't get it, if there werent timegates id be on almost all the time.. Its like they want people to hop on for 20 min just for the number, like they dont want you to actually experience the game. If theyre still adding timegates by the time my fo1st is up im done with fallout and bethesda.
---
Time to change your build.
---
if you dont have ghillie and had 1st the brown ranger outfit works if you position yourself right
---
Makes it harder to sell, scrip, or drop it by mistake.
---
I find your lack of maths.... disturbing.
---
Ouch. Your prices were too good...
---
Have you killed and looted any raider/blood eagle thieves? You randomly come across them when people start the quest and haven't finished it yet. Looting their stolen equipment might make it available if you speak to him, that's my best guess. My quest has always been bugged since I never need to get him anything or the quest is available multiple times a day.
---
Yes, but thank you for the suggestion! The goal is to have a copy of every physical plan that can be traded in-game. It's quite unfortunate that those ones exist in plan form as they're easily obtainable via the terminal, but quite challenging to find otherwise. They're definitely a lower priority for the plan mule, but I would like to get them eventually regardless.
---
yup, currently logged out, waiting for the clock to tick over to 5:01pm
---
I know this sounds ridiculous, but I've managed to get a Gauss Rifle from a scavenger after giving him 20 bobby pins, however I'm on PC.
---
There's no Wheeling, Moundsville, etc. Berkeley Springs is the Eastern panhandle, but we are missing the entire Northern Panhandle. Wheeling would be great because it was the state's Capitol originally, and has a big casino on an island in the middle of the Ohio River, and Moundsville has the haunted penitentiary and a huge Native American burial mound, and there's a lot of other places that have important landmarks that would be interesting to have events and quests based around!
---
Imagine having  Cryptid Hunt in the haunted decommissioned penitentiary, while Mothman Cultists watch from a fortified burial mound? Or just have settlers rebuilding the casino, and now we have gambling minigames?
---
So in other words you tried to simp over an egril and got trapped?
---
YEAH!
---
we need a bank in each faction camp that is account wide
---
we need more repeatable reputation quests daily
---
we also need reputation boosters that either gets rewarded through the season track or a chance drop from legendaries or purchasable by caps .. like 1 day, 3 day etc boosters that only lose duration during game play
---
and the cap limit really is absurdly low
---
we need more options to spend caps OTHER than fast traveling which should also be removed!
---
Same here!
---
The physical plan is a rare event reward isn’t it?
---
Cause there isn’t anything else to do
---
I think it would show a lot of goodwill to raise it even a little bit yes, and it’s funny you mention the new guns, I literally two days ago decided to unlock the Gauss mini and what you said is EXACTLY the reason I haven’t tried rolling harder for it- I literally can’t. 
---
My stash is already brimming with 3 star stuff I’m waiting to scrip in, using, or selling. I could cut out the selling but I may as well list it until I can clear my backlog of actual trash 3 star stuff, and then when I do roll the mini I can’t sell them only scrap or drop, so we’re back again to no scrip to do it, along with all the other stuff I get daily.
---
I’ve been at the point for a long time I drop anything that’s not 3 star unless it’s great rolls, but it’s already too much and that’s with 1st. I can’t even IMAGINE the pain of trying to juggle all this limit shit every day with a stash you have to also use for your scrap. 
---
It’s mental and I can never clear my backlog especially now I’m grinding legendaries or events for score now too. If I then go and craft 8 mini guns I’m gonna be screwed 😁
---
I lost my mother this november too, in a totally unexpected manner.
---
It's horrible at first but it hasn't been too hard to come to terms with it. The worst thing of it all for my was seing my two 90+ year old granparents lose their daughter.
---
Among other thing this game came through, it helped to make things start to feel normal again.
---
Do they only spawn on the 3rd floor in the shower/bed areas?
---
There likely will be other ways to obtain it in the future.
---
10-weeks is a decent amount of time to earn it (you will earn it within 3 weekly quests)
---
It isn't really a brilliant reward anyway.
---
I'm on PC but thanks anyway for the offer. Great community in this game for sure!
---
And yet, according to everyone here, they had to stifle the flow of free atoms because they're not making any money on the Atomic Shop.  I kinda feel like both of these can't be true.
---
How do you figure this game is putting up NBA 2K20 numbers with 1/6th of the sales?
---
For some reason, I have this *weird* feeling, not sure why, that after a season has pass, all those skins and CAMP items will end up in the Atom Shop's rotation a few months later.
---
The Fallout series certainly has a lot of soul.
---
14,000 according to this.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
Oh right on dude, but I meant the untradeable gauss weapons like the gauss shotgun and minigun
---
luckily they only rot one at a time so if you have around 20 and resupply at your base occasionally it usually isn't a problem although it will be if you don't reduce their weight with perks
---
Griefing is gone unfortunately.
---
I'd say this is completely out of control at this point.  I've found that the instances where someone melts the Scorchbeast Queen or Imposter Sheepsquatch with a hacked gun now represents the majority of battles with them.  You just expect someone to do it now.  It's rare when they don't.
---
And some of these things - the 50 cal that shoots airstrikes... the Gauss Minigun that shoots Cryo projectiles... the ridiculous "Handmade Pistol" with the Beam Splitter on the end... none of this stuff should be recognized as a legit combination, and for the game to have no capacity to detect that, let alone have them sweep through inventories and remove illegal combinations, is appalling.
---
This. Swapped mine out till they fix it.
---
But that would make sense and you know Bethesda doesn't want things to make sense in their games
---
incorrectly though making drawing state lines impossible really.  Morgantown, for example, is north of Grafton in real life.
---
Flamer is your friend.
---
Almost....
---
Explosive bait repprtedly makes her land.
---
The cap limit, stash space, and the fact that all characters can not access the same stash is something that never made sense to me. Something else I find strange is the way you respec characters. It’s a grind if you want to change things up even more so for a newer player that’s getting a feel for the game. Seems like time wasted.
---
I see Mad Dog Malone had some visitors.
---
I have only found one since the update and i do think it was harder. 
---
before the update me and 2 pals found it in the grove. I'm junkies gauss shotgun. One of the other guys has a gauss minigun (not junkies or bloodied) and the other guy doesn't really hav a build. We killed it in a few minutes. 
---
Last night i took on one with 4 other people and 1 was definitely bloodied. I reckon it was at least 10 minutes. More like 15 before it died.
---
tried it, you literally see her hovering over someone standing in a tree or on top of a tent, using a heavy gun.
---
the Palace of the winding path is based on a location in the northern panhandle
---
Oh, well as I said I have not been able to play yet since I have been gone this week. Noted though. I was merely saying what I have been told/what was stated by Bethesda. Hopefully they get the public thing sorted quick. Seems like an easy fix, just either switch XP to score or add score as well. 
---
Thanks for the heads up! Again sorry for the misinformation.
---
You shouldnt have posted this, now you get all kids crying around...
---
I'm pretty sure the majority of them have daily challenges do they not? Fortnite, Apex and Warframe are 3 that do off the top.
---
I said in another thread that Beth should add a catch up mechanic like Warframe does with its nightwave. If you do all your dailies it will unlock the previous day's if you missed them - allows you to catch up if you can't play every day. This is a little more flexible for people who can't get on daily.
---
I use the Bethesda launcher and had this a few times.  Try playing it then locating the game files.  usually it then installs in seconds, but what its really doing is pointed back to the file path.
---
Sweet, on track for 68 days lol. It’s going to be tight
---
Blue ridge mountains
---
the PA exacavator quest difficult why? I don't get it, I did at lvl 40
---
I have a stealth commando build, but I got this on my heavy weapons character lol.  My stealth commando has a Bloodied Fire Rate Handmade already. I have to decide what to do with this one, transfer, sell or use as a sometimes/backup weapon.
---
No worries, I know you're just working with the info you have, I just didn't want you to he disappointed when you start playing
---
I have to ask... did it take more time to come up with the actual analogy of Tiffany vs the actual complaint?  :D  Or, do you actually know Tiffany?  And if so, is Tiffany a stripper yet?
---
Make her dusting AoE  larger, more frequent, and quintuple the the DoT. Want to stand around like an idiot, messing with her pathing so she stays up there, because you can't be arsed to kill a radroach or mongrel gnawing on your bloodied build ankle, then fall over dead.
---
I just server hopped the Grafton Monster.
---
Yeah I hate it. I don't know whether it's worse when it's a high level that probably knows what they're causing or a bunch of lower levels that won't listen when you try to get them to follow you. 
---
With the latter it's generally quite easy to get her to aggro you, but the former it's quite difficult because the higher level is just spamming as much ammo as possible at her.
---
Mah Shemmy Took A Chit
---
I’m a stealth commando, so nothing that nerfs...Perception and Agility, right?  So what addictions would you suggest?
---
What’s the biggest reward for the season pass? Not interested in skins or outfits so what makes you wanna do the challenges
---
“...everyone and their Collectron...”  excellent turn of phrase!
---
Cheers! Appreciate it!
---
They said they aren’t planning on doing that, obviously plans can change though
---
For me, I was about to move on to another game, but this update has me wanting to play more.  I love the public teams and hope they expand on it.
---
Its a complex story line, especially if you choose to actually follow them and not try to power level all the way through to the endgames.
---
Hard is relative - you will often feel underpowered or overwhelmed (especially if you go to the middle and east side of the map before Level 40 or so.
---
Once your level gets into the 30s, then it gets easier.
---
My advice is take your time and enjoy the story.  The rest will come.
---
I don't care that they play as girls . Ticks me off that weirdos and cheaters pretend to be girls so that ppl will give them things and so that kids feel more comfortable being friends with them. When in reality it could be a 35 yr old man, or a creep or something. Thats what I'm talking about.
---
What a horrible idea..
---
You don't need to get score for events and was never intended for that to be the case. To be honest with you the new events system you can get XP pretty easily in an events team to get enough XP to level up the XP challenge anyway.
---
Who pissed in this guys cereal
---
I wouldn't say I'm having these same problems but I do agree it feels clunky overall.
---
I play very aggressively as melee. I am always charging at the target and I have worked to get my timing down. A full sprint power attack with my meta build is around 2k on most enemies and I'm not even max spec. 
---
For me, the pros outweigh the cons. The damage is amazing, the thud of contact is cathartic and being the one on your team rushing around one shotting is just good fun.
---
I agree that when you are being attacked it's all but impossible to move to get a clean hit. It's like they mesh into you and you just can't land a hit. Plus, considering that you are swinging a giant rocket propelled hammer or other meaty weapon you'd think you wouldn't need the reticle exactly on your target...but we'll, here we are. 
---
I will stay melee for a long time though. In spite of it's difficulties I just can't go back to a rifleman build and love not being tied to my tinkerers workbench making ammo.
---
One final thing. There is a skill that staggers enemies when you charge into them. USE THIS! You take control of the combat momentum and have a second to line up your shot. It will help you with your range, timing and power swing line up.
---
Thinking about a purchase. How is it? Arethe ironsights bad?
---
Thanks! it says "done downloading in 3 minutes."
---
Thought i had to reinstall the entire game
---
Almost Heaven... West Virginia....
---
Bah, I did not payed attention. The very first time for me, 4/7 daily autocompleted and I lost 1250 score. Now I have to grind a tiny bit more XP to get that lost score points. Sigh.
---
Yup and it looks the same no matter how you mod it
---
You found something ironically. 
---
You’re being sarcastic and mocking people about people  having a genuine gripe and bug.
---
Weird flex.
---
I've been doing a lot of events the last few days to the point I have to switch back to my ultracite GL as I'm chewing through far too much 50 cal to keep up with the lead/acid/gunpowder supplies.
---
I must chewed through about 30,000 rounds since Tuesday.
---
Aye. There's also a spawn for the possibly the rarest plan in the game in fort defiance. Cranberry Bog healing salve. Can only be found in mirrors apparently.

It doesnt matter if a game is shit ir if 90% of the player base doesnt like it. If anyone likes it, let them. Fo76 is broken as hell and has a lot of issues but its still fun to play with friends and enjoy the experiences you make while playing the game
---
You had me there
---
Skins, camp items, repair kits, caps, scrip, bullion, atoms etc.
---
Take a look at the menu in game, if nothing appeals to you you're safe to ignore it and not bother!

I mean he ain't wrong, but when you up there tell them I wanna hear an npc say exploring Appalachia sure makes you wish for a nuclear winter!!!!!

My condolences OP but dang is your last name Sutton?
---
Yes! I knew it wasn't just my imagination. He was actually challenging! Way better than how weak he was before!
---
Meth Gators!
---
Np, glad that worked :)
---
I tried it after j I hit level 25 and got my ass handed to me down there. Forgot about it til recently and did it in my late 60s (better late then never, eh?) and finally finished it.  After I had to go back out and farm more screws as I didn’t have enough. Then had to go back out and farm black titanium because I didn’t have enough. PSA: take note of ALL components needed for all pieces. You can thank me later. I really do want to revisit that place some time, I just did a run through down to the lab to make the armor and didn’t fully explore the place. I still need to do that.
---
Hell yes. I didn't met him before update, but i wanted to find him before Colossal Problem event release. I planned to launch a nuke today and launched it on Overgrown sundew grove location  and luckily after we finish the SBQ and came here i met him. I was in a public team and 2 of my buddies come with me. I took almost AN HOUR for us to kill him. We here 3 and later 4th member came up. We wasted a lot of ammo to kill him and i won't search for him anymore for now. But now i can't wait for Colossal Problem release, i think this will be great event!
---
No but there are perks/chems to decrease the price to 18k i believe
---
the only problem with melee is the hit not registering the rest is okay, i use a 2 handed s.sledghammer and the range isn't bad and the back wall you just need to jump in theyr direction and hit mid air, but fair point on the server delay is bad not registering and to be honest power atack you only use to kill huge things or slow enemies not rats and scorch.
---
block why do I would use if I can soak all the damage on my armour.
---
My controversial opinion is that there should be a server/game mode that nullifies all legendary effects. It’s impossible to have a pvp gunfight when legendary effects make 1-shots not just possible, but incredibly easy on most any other build.
---
Just builds against builds, that’s all I want.
---
Thanks so much!!
---
after legendary run ends, Plan: ammo converter is the only reward from dailies
---
yeah, but if you try to match up locations you get a map that looks like this: https://imgur.com/rw8i8EL
---
I used river that were undeniably state boundaries to draw the majority of the borders, and figured lines that best fit for the rest
---
Fortnite allows you to catch up on 3 days worth if you miss them as well. And all three of those games are free-to-play.
---
Something like that would be perfect. You get daily challenges, but if you miss them they unlock when you finish the current days challenges. That way people who play once a week would have the same rewards as people who play daily, so long as they put the same work into the challenges. 
---
The current model is just encouraging playing every single day, and you lose out if you don't, which has the potential to be a problem for people with addictive pre-dispositions.
---
Player vendors are your best bet. Try the sub where players trade/ sell stuffs.
---
player vendors, you can buy single use serums for cheap, if someone is selling them
---
Yup, lost 1250 score.
---
FYI those are the recipes for that price.
---
I ate all my Ammo since Season Drops.
---
Guns keep Breaking. But I do feel I use them much more now. I also like to convert all these useless shotgun shells and 5.56 from enemys into Nuclear Firepower.
---
Alright. I swear I read on Bethesdas notes that SCORE would be awarded from the daily/weekly challenges and from public events. I took that as all of them that are free to fast travel to, the ones marked with a ! Or at least were marked that way. 
---
I haven't had a chance to play so I was just going off of what was given. Another user said they are bugged and do not give score. Hopefully that gets addressed or restated for clarification. That could ease a lot of worries people are having, or make more I guess if it wasnt intended to give SCORE.
---
It’s on sale preowned for Xbox now on GameStop website for 9.99 today.
---
I played for 4 hours the first night, and made it to rank 5. I work until 6:30-7 some nights, so that doesn’t leave a lot of time, especially if I have other obligations, and I gotta eat somewhere in there. My point is that it should be set up in a way that lets players catch up on the weekends. My other pony was that I have other games I like to play as well.
---
If you submit a ticket to Bethesda I think they are giving 150 atoms, which would cover the missed level.
---
Check their post history, they aren't okay. :(
---
Funnily enough you could’ve said that in your OP too. You’re the self irony king.
---
Yes a great event! Much needed strength added to Colossus!

Client responsiveness. Walk into a new cell? The game freezes up. Open the favorites wheel or examining an item? Game freezes up. Dare to open the map in NW to check the storm? Dead because I'm frozen in place for 20-30 seconds. 
---
Normally in these games it only happens when you have too much inventory, but I travel light and carry only things I'd be dead without. I'm getting loads of inventory lag since Wastelanders droppe, too.

Agree with you mate. This post is by no means saying it's a perfect system, it's addressing the misinformation of people telling others that it's impossible to complete even if you do every challenge, which is the wrong information. I get it Bethesda aren't perfect, but no games company are going to make a season pass that is impossible to complete without spending real money/in game currency - that's madness.
---
Are you using the Speed Demon mutation? It makes you more thirsty. Other mutations might too, can't remember them all. I'm running 7 but I have Class Freak rank 3 and I am thirsty as a bitch in game so I think you're right about there being a bug.
---
Thank you. Ill give it a try.
---
Happy cake day, that's your gift from Todd.
---
 Yeah had this too. 
---
Not good.
---
I'm level 15 in the pass, my math doesn't seem off for my personal play habits I guess. Thanks for the downvotes, see you turds from tier 100
---
Didnt buy for a long time

I LOL'd, then on a serious note, I decided to Google (bc Florida) and was not disappointed.

You're still doing it champ

i think its called "catfishing" now?
---
Patience and understanding may be amicable, but gets us very little. This sub was, by and large, very patient for the first year or so of the game, and received little in return. Occasionally we get a feature we asked for, but it’s just as likely to be one no-one asked for. So there’s little rhyme or reason there. 
---
Saying we should be more considerate, because we don’t know how hard it is to program, is the kind of sentiment I’d agree with on an indie game. This is a title from a AAA studio who, if they wished to, could lend the team some staff who are experienced hands with the creation engine. But they won’t, because those staff were all put onto upcoming projects which will not tolerate unnecessary delays. Minimum viable products don’t suffer because it’s difficult to program, they suffer because the support was never budgeted to be there in the first place.
---
My girlfriend was not online at time of refresh, had not played in the last two days, and she had never previously played nuclear winter. She had three completed dailies when she logged in after work last night. It appears bugged to us.
---
NW is not for me, man. I gave it a shot, not my bag.
---
Don't have shitty ideas and you won't have to worry about being shitted on. Welcome to the internet (and pretty much the rest of the real world), where not everyone is going to pat your back and give you an "att'a boy" just because you say something.
---
Same here.
---
Same. Utter bullcrap
---
Kinda funny how the only way to remove gear from the sell/scrap/scrip list is to apply a skin you get from the atom store. Almost like they want us to spend money.
---
Honestly, looking at the content IN the battlepass, I find it far more likely that Bethesda realized there's no way they could sell that stuff for anything more than a token price. The ghillie armor skins are bugged to hell, filler (small amounts of currency ie caps, bullion), trash like fireworks, take up huge sections of the board.
---
Looks like it’ll be hard to be proud of
---
Really? That’s kind of a shame and an unfortunate consequence.
---
My buddy and I have played 1 NW match together prior to yesterday, which we lost. After completing the challenge yesterday, the lobby of 49 went down to 19 within 1 minute, and it took our team 20 minutes to win. Easiest win I've had.
---
And is pretty far off from where it would be, it's based on a place near Moundsville, which should be north of Tyler County, not all the way east. They simply didn't include the northern panhandle, that is all I was getting at. They included one location but put it in a pretty arbitrary spot, instead of adding a thin stretch that would have people asking why we just don't have Pittsburgh as well.
---
I think it's good as it is, owner can ft there and everyone else needs to walk.
---
It's one of the reasons why I ended up having multiple characters - to deal with the case of someone getting a 3\* Missile Launcher with 38 Scrip left in the machine for the day.  Typically, at least one of them will remain playable, which definitely comes in handy for this Legendary Run event.
---
I dropped a couple of junk items as he was threatening me, and he said " better get out of here now" or something like that. Became aggro a moment after that.
---
If you’re not sure what something is worth, check it out on the Fe76 website. The prices may not be super accurate, but it will keep you from giving away really valuable stuff.
---
Lots of folks don’t do this, which makes shopping a great way to find good stuff. 
---
Start making a lot of caps. Occasionally you’ll find folks selling weapons or armor for 25k that are worth 25k.
---
Get a mic and talk to folks; there’s a lot of players with oodles of interesting stuff in their stash boxes.
---
Be very cautious about trading. The trading sub is filled with stories of folks who got ripped off, but it also has folks who will act as go betweens.
---
Queen*
---
That is why the game exists, yes.
---
I´m getting xtra f\*ked because im getting events completed when the daily´s show up and they´re already done!!! I´m getting robbed of SCORE points due to their damn bugs!
---
Is anyone else experiencing this!?
---
Yes. The lever gun plan comes from ash heap events/missions and maybe dailies? It's best farmed by repeatedly making new characters and immediately completing the mission Personal Matters. The double barrel plan is savage divide events/missions/dailies. I don't know of any tricks to make this one easier to farm, it's just plain rare.
---
I don't even see those three in my list of dailies.
---
I ran into him yesterday too. Saw lol 8, thought it was a random Mr.... well anything else. One shot with my shotgun aaaaaand dead. I looks down... Wait who the F*#k is this !?!?!? NOOOOO!
---
an AR-10 skin with markings indicating its chambered in 7.62, for a AK that shoots 5.56 that should shoot 7.62. with a bolt carrier that doesnt move, with animations that clip with the magwell/lower receiver, with no rear iron sights, and using the ak mount that clips for the reflex sight instead of a fucking spacer.
---
just another entry in the series of fucked up bethesda guns.
---
some classics include,
---
the left hand bolt abomination of a hunting rifle
---
the front sightless 10mm submachinegun that uses completely different 1st and 3 person animations
---
and many more!
---
I play on PS4 as hotwafleman (spelled wrong because I suck a typing with a controller).  I sell them for 250-300 caps.  Right now only have Speed Demon available.  You can vendor surf and find most anything you’re looking for, but don’t pay 500+ for them.
---
The silo run is guided the same way every time you do it. So basically you didn't miss anything besides the "quest completed" message at the end of I Am Become Death.
---
Okay.
---
To be perfectly honest I didn't watch the video,. until now. Could use a tl:dw: "Season 1 probably isn't 10 weeks, its probably 76 days". 
---
Makes perfect sense, of course they'll make it 76 days! 
---
My main gripe is the daily play incentive.
---
it does not include rear iron or glow sights. if you dont have a scope or reflex sight, you will just have the front sight post, which will be misaligned.
---
If you are in game during reset it does this
---
I’ve got 2, first is from release where I only got to level 78 and the game was in a pretty so so place so I did as much as I could and left until I came back for wastelanders with a new character. 
---
I would definitely do that but I really can’t be bothered switching for the most part, but I did definitely get to points where I was close to over encumbered and my stash was full too, so I had to log off or drop a load of stuff. 
---
I finally cleared that out and usually in around 650-700 in stash these days, but it wouldn’t last long if I didn’t drop so much, and I’d definitely be screwed beyond belief without the scrap box just on scrap alone let alone the daily legendary item juggle.
---
u/CrazyOO1
---
That's what I use it for. It should be known that if you see people wearing it at that event, let them be the runners for ore. The heavy hitters should stay back and protect the NPCs. Most of the time it works and it's a super easy event. As a runner though, you do sacrifice some legendary loot as you're not always there to get a hit but that's changing now with public teams. If one of your teammates are a gunner in RR, you'll get legendary loot too.
---
Dont even get me started on the hunting rifle I mean seriously what modern day fire arm ejects its cartridge into your face
---
I completely agree.
---
Unique items like these should be quest rewarded. Bringing in even a small quest would be a much better way of obtaining it. Like how it was done for the brewing station and backpack. 
---
I said the same about the fridge too. Its a shame the main focus on unique items is tied to the shop or pass. Its immersion breaking for one.
---
it's passive aggressive payback from bethesda, for all the people trying to stay logged in, or bug logging in during maintenance...
---
nah, no idea, just more crap nonsense to list of crap nonsense
---
I would have liked to see something with the mound, moundsville native here, so much creepy potential with the mound and the prison
---
Thanks for this, the more people that give a description the better we can understand the issue. 
---
Another possibility that has come to light is accessing the atom store (or maybe the Legendary Run board) before loading in?
---
They make it hard to want to play this game.
---
Yes, happened an hour ago and I’m gutted! After saving up a small fortune to buy another serum recipe I went to the bunker to buy it, and thought I may as well progress the part of the Enclave quest that said I should explore the command centre. I did just that and got inducted into the secrets of launching my first nuke! I was stoked. Decided to head back to my camp to reequip and got the quest completed a short while later as someone on my public team launched a nuke.
---
"Opportunity" as if most people played the last year and a half straight at least a few hours a day.
---
Or, at the very least, having a box you can use to pass stuff between characters like Borderlands has.
---
If you have 1st and Private Servers, you can already do this with world containers, so this would just been a formalization and more foolproof version of that idea.
---
Because with the Bullion grind especially, it is *absurd* that you are not allowed to share weapons or armor between your characters.  Don't want to let players trade or sell rare things with other players?  Fine, whatever.  But within the same account?  That's arbitrary and dumb.
---
I’ve watchedThe video mate. 
---
And with an additional xp boost weekend i clearly see you point now. 
---
And thank you for keeping the discussion friendly. 
---
Means a lot to me. 
---
I think I’ll have some soup as well now (as the guy in the video) lol.
---
We’re you playing the hour before the reset?
---
as someone who spent a good part of their childhood shooting boltguns, this games rifles pisses me off so much. i WANT to use the hunting rifle, i even have a B/25/15 that is functionally an amazing rifle, but i just cant deal with the jarring animation.
---
it definitely summoned less spawns this time as well. Maybe did it 4 times with 4-5 wendigos each time
---
Fuck, fuck, fuck it!!
---
Seems like an unfortunate oversight on their part. I mean whilst it’s technically true it’s repeatable and you get the quest again. From getting a nuke card etc, it still kinda diminishes it (at least to me) if the first time is done that way.
---
Let's be real. Most of the ideas or suggestions are flawed one way or another. Either they would conflict with other parts of the game or the gamedesign itself, or they are just ridiculous like needing a ton of work for a tiny improvement.
---
Most of the suggestions are useless and instead of answering and elaborating on them why they are useless, its wiser not to react at all.
---
Your hand also merges into the gun when you read because they didn't adjust the animation to account for the relocation of the magazine.
---
Any scope you put on it looks like it was melted into the frame.
---
Iron sight useless as your bullets drop well below the sight picture.
---
Do not buy!
---
Are there only two visible or are the rest visible but look like they're already done. 
---
If only two are visible, DO NOT complete them yet. Relog and they might come back. If you complete them before relogging it won't count for the Gold Star and you won't be able to finish it today.
---
logging out then back in does nothing, right?
---
bethesda's fix idea: you just need to Stop playing the game as intended to play the game as intended
---
(angry nuke zone wind noise)
---
I MEAN, it can help but looking at it from another light?
---
There’s 10 weeks, so really only think about hitting rank 10 this week? :&gt;
---
I've got a similar b5015 but the disengage per shot just bothers me
---
If you're ingame during reset this happens. Just log off before 12 am EST.
---
Haha no problem mate! More than anything I just want people to relax and feel that there's so much misinformation getting thrown around. Enjoy your soup!
---
Four of my dailies were already completed.
---
Sadly it isn't enemies I am worried about. Due to the nature of the damage to my house it is apparent that a player is doing it because all that is damaged is a single roof and the fusion generator being hidden below said roof.
---
Sheepsquatch mascot outfit
---
I did now i laugh at my nw enemies when they loot my corpse
---
I remember them from yesterdays dailies. Someone said if your logged in when it resets this happens. So maybe the bug is that yesterdays dailies get stuck in todays.
---
email complaints/tickets do nothing, i'd old school call in to complain, but i fear their "on hold" music is the fasnachts music
---
Hell, you dont even have to disassemble it to show them the rear sight
---
Relog. Do not comlete ones you can see yet! If they aren't visible at all they might come back by relogging in. But if you've already completed any they won't count to the Gold Star and you wont be able to do it. 
---
Hope you read this in time.
---
So a Build group is better than an Event group for XP? I was starting to think this last night.
---
red asylum outfit with the responders backpack
---
I love the vault tech pant suit and the fashionable raider outfit
---
unfortunately if we ever get the anti material rifle it will be the same way, they will use the creation club one, and it has the same animations.
---
No, they aren't automatic.  Criticals only happen if you use VATS, fill the critical bar, and invoke it before firing the next shot.
---
Sometimes the damage numbers on an enemy will appear yellow in normal play, but that is *not* representing a critical hit, even though those are also shown in yellow.  All that indicates is a weak spot on that enemy.
---
Of course I was...
---
Good write up, but I still cannot make changes to Monitor Technology in Nvidia control Panel. 
---
Yes my monitor id G-SYNC. Had a nice little NVIDIA G-SYNC sticker on the bezel..
---
Yes indeed mate. I hear you!
---
And thanks!
---
Have a great one 🙏🏼
---
Checking now, but the 5/5....
---
Agree, I just went to facts but personally would be disappointed as well.
---
I tried. The second i saw it i shut down my xbox for q few min and relogged. They still show completed unfortunatly
---
Thanks for summarizing my point! Really hope post-wastelander joiners such as myself see this post now that public teams are essential.
---
Good 😯
---
Building crew is great for me. I am finishing quest missions with 2 of my four characters. With +4 in Intelligence and full set of unyielding. I get a big boost of XP just doing almost anything.
---
Yet to see this one , you got me intrigued.
---
That's not going to happen, lol :)
---
But thanks ...
---
The amount of score needed per level goes up per rank, so as much as I agree with your sentiment, in the later levels you won't be able to rank up 10 times in a week. It's normàl to be ahead at this stage and then progress will be slower later. All still doable though!
---
I think they're just going for geographic relativity, not real-world fidelity, working within Bethesda's design.
---
I like it but my commando char is VATs reliant. Hadn't noticed the iron sights lol
---
They should shut the servers down before the reset if this is the cause. I’m out 1k points because I was trying to get some gaming in before all the 4th plans I got today.
---
What’s your first favorite?
---
Just cuz you got trapped (or whatever), no need to bad mouth the whole community.  And, did you really report this to Bethesda?
---
Didn't help. I just renewed my membership this morning too.
---
Buck Fethesda man. I'm sick of this sh!t. This is the second time its happened to me.
---
check audio settings in-game and in the xbox itself
---
Players just adapt to the possibilities provided by the game. If its not to your liking, ask the developer to do something about it, not the min-maxing players.
---
The Pitt, zeta was my 3rd
---
If duping was the reason, paying for fo1st wouldnt remove it. Could easily make the scrap box a non premium item if it actually solved anything.
---
It's a pure monetization strategy, they know people horde, they know some will pay to horde (sadly me).
---
Of course, I fully understand how you feel!
---
Swimsuit so I can show off my wicked marsupial- mutated gams and yet still pull off casual chic whilst catching some nuke rays by Deathclaw Dennis’ island. 
---
Pirate hat and sunglasses accompaniment mandatory. Dennis has an aggressive streak over visible hairline.
---
I'm level 72. It seems like itll buff the low level enemies but everything else will stay the same. Making gameplay not change at all. The game isn't hard to begin with which I wish it was more challenging. What will the update do? From my understanding itll just make the game easier for everyone under 50.
---
I think she saw everyone dying around her and made this as her last will and testament in case she died too
---
Well that sucks! Thank you for The response
---
i do not think it can handle making cores, or people would it to make cheap fusion cores
---
y dod u have 67 missles to begin with what
---
had something similar, i abandoned them all, and did them as i got them. 
---
got tired of yelling at Chloe in berkeley springs for 20 minutes about leslie
---
It was on their website but worded badly which made people think that was the case. Afaik it's been addressed and they've already said you won't get score from events. As I said previously though, you don't need score from events so it doesn't really make a difference.
---
And those are they favorites from all fallout games? Not just fallout 3? From fallout 3 My favorite was probably Point Lookout because i thought the enemies were really cool.
---
Yeah, compared to the problems other players are currently experiencing this is probably not that big of a deal - just an individual hiccup that will hopefully not happen to many other newer players.
---
I was meaning the person I replied to. There's an issue with them showing as completed, but also with them not showing up at all, as in not on the list whatsoever. Relogging fixes the latter, no one seems to have found a way to fix the former. 
---
Sorry to hear it happened to you.
---
FO76 will take a little getting used to, but stick with it.  I’ve had only good interactions with other players.  If you meet a problem player, just block them.  Also, there are lots of YouTube vids to help with anything else.
---
Super buffed Gatorclaws? My body is ready.
---
k
---
But they said they fixed this in the patch notes...
---
Lol idk just kept them. I got scap box.
---
Is literally anyone going to use the ghillie paint for anything other than nuclear winter?
---
sometimes drop from SBQ, but it helps if you launch nuke and you gotta get enough damage on the SBQ to loot
---
The nice thing is that any XP you gain now will at least be a head start when Halloween comes around again and that outfit is available again.
---
Yeah as do I. I would’ve had no idea being way past that point, but if it saves even one person from the same thing who’s into the experience, it’s worth sharing so thanks.
---
I actually did the switch about 3 weeks ago.  Was ecstatic when they quietly buffed it.
---
Yes. Yes it would. As any good reward should be tied to an NPC quest...but...programming, development.
---
She definitely wouldn’t have died from old age. She never came back to the bunker or finished her work, her assumption simply was that the reason she never came back was because she died. It’s possible she’s still alive or a scorched (if you call that living) since you never find a body though.
---
Plus I'm going to add if people do spend atoms to rank up do it at the end. You'll get more score for the atom so to speak.
---
That's true.  I think that Bethesda is taking the wrong path through this, though.  They really need to focus on quality over quantity and set up a testing team that evaluates content from a player perspective (is it fun?)
---
I switched before the update. Found how much easier it was to have 2 melon plants and never worry about food lol. And now with fert bombs its even better. I have no worries, then they buff both mutations so if I want to farm relish it's even better
---
Got it. Im just gonna log out before the reset next time and than log in after.
---
I think you will find the community and players super supportive and helpful. There are some griefers but they are few and far between.
---
My advice, to make life easier is to establish a stable food and water supply. I built a camp for food and water basically. Having that stress removed opened up the game for me as I always had a fallback. Corn, carrots, razorgrain all can be made into soup which satisfied hunger and thirst.
---
Use player vendors to your advantage. We sell a lot of gear for lower levels at a good price because we want more people to enjoy the game.
---
Early on I had someone see I was low level and dropped a bag full of plans, purified water and food. When I see a newbie in my camp I will do the same to pay it forward.
---
Hope you enjoy the game! Welcome to the community!
---
I guess when she recorded it, she assumed the only reason anyone would be listening to it was if she died and they entered her bunker, she wanted the work she started to be completed and I guess she figured this was the best way to go about it.
---
How bout they bring back adrenaline first
---
The swimsuit had to be the most comical out there.
---
My only question:  what is the carry weight or str food for herbivores?
---
This makes sense why people leave the Build team when an event pops then come back. Is there a way to change you team type so you can all stay bonded together? Or do you have to build it back up every time you join a new team?
---
I wouldnt follow this advice. Their are so many ways to play. Personally I dont use power armor, I dont sneak,and I dont use vats. I just like to shoot stuff with my semi auto rifle and loot things, so what he has listed above is no use to me. I recommend you find a playstyleyoy like and do the things you enjoy then around 30 or 40 when you have a decent idea on where you stand you look at a fo76character builder website and play around. After 50 you can fine tune your build. The game isnt hard so you cant really fuck it up so do the things that make you happy and what you enjoy.
---
your closure was stolen
---
Haha yeah. I have a photo loading screen from my first character near release, of my dude stood up to his ankles posing in the water in the swimsuit in the exact getup I mentioned above. It’s glorious and makes me happy every time I see it.
---
All fallouts. Every time I play New Vegas or it’s DLCs I get the interest of the concepts drowned out by the dullness, I know its not a popular opinion and I like the ideas and concepts from New Vegas. I am waiting for the remake with the fallout 4 engine since I missed playing new vegas when it came out.
---
I like Fallout 4’s DLCs for their locations and fun gameplay but they did not have very unique end story world impacts like they like to lead up to.
---
I only have the pink T_T 
---
Well it's this backpack https://imgur.com/h1Mw8Qg (but it fits properly)
---
and this uniform
---
https://imgur.com/MClL6rM
---
it POPS!
---
The hardest part for me was that dang Assaultron in the lab.
---
BOS combat armour with the BOS underarmour and Polly Head looked pretty awesome. I'm currently digging the drifter outfit too.
---
Just another item to prove the devs don’t actually play the game.
---
Lol, indeed!
---
I re placed the parts with items clipping through it and it went away
---
makes me want a ye-olde turbo controller for this nonsense...
---
(sets up 10k of the .38 ammo to sell, turbo button on... goes to bed)
---
Unfortunately, I collected wood before I realized that it was a daily. Relogged and they went from invisible to completed. RIP
---
Same. Apparently I can't fast travel to unknown workshops and they won't even show up on the map
---
Yup me too.
---
Vault-Tec knew exactly what every single one of their vaults were doing. They wouldn’t trust themselves with surviving a war in say, Vault 12. It would make sense for them to also not trust the government too much.
---
Thank you :)
---
Oooh! He added the double xp and score!
---
This looks a lot more promising now, I'm going to miss almost an entire week either starting tomorrow or Monday, depending on if I have time before leaving tomorrow to knock out those dailies. Am not quite hardcore grinder but not super casual player either so I imagine with repeatables I'd be fine, just had a concern or two.
---
You’re probably right. Those quests were just depressing as fuck though.
---
"It's hard to argue with intelligence, impossible to argue with arrogance."
---
Bathrobe, tinfoil hat, and fashionable glasses.
---
you can get skins for the pip boy
---
Thank you also, sir!
---
All of these are good, but I prefer the more traditional wasteland wanderer look.  My favorite is the Hunter's Long Coat and Pirate Hat or Black Prospector's hat.  I do wear the vault pant suit sometimes for kicks, a lot in fasnacht.
---
That's rare? Oops. I dump all of my Ultracite plans in my vendor for like 100-200 caps. I may have sold that one before but not positive. I'll be more careful next time lol.
---
Oh god
---
Fucking ghouls just can't handle their high radiation fluids. Sad.
---
but you can change the miner's hat lamp to different colors, that's just as good, right?
---
/s
---
It was a joke. Rifles can be bolt, lever, or break action, or be semi/fully auto. Just kinda funny that you said you have a rifle that uses two completely different ways of prepping.
---
thanks for the reply. in game is on auto ('team' didn't effect it either)
---
xbox, i don't think has any in-game chat options iirc. only party chat options (which is why i can really only party chat) it'd be nice to atleast hear others though.
---
so it's supposed to come through my TV with no headset plugged in though eh?  good.
---
She did look at the run board, i remeber she was going through all the reward tiles. I'm not sure if she checked the atom store before logging in.
---
If you decide to sell it I'll buy it lol
---
You think this is bad, head on over to /r/RedDeadOnline
---
Seeing "Bethesda Replied" on things like "Check out my CAMP build!" at least give off the illusion that they're considering feedback.
---
Don't go through every menu over and over each time after a conversion. Convert the ammo type you want, and *go back* one screen. Repeat until done. Literally two clicks.
---
I bought a junkies gamma gun just got this reason. I don't PvP but I love to melt trolls. Or I'll find their camp and if it's in a high level area I'll go aggro a bunch of enemies and hide in their camp while they wreck it trying to get to me. Works especially well if they're near a fissure site. But it's amazing how far a SB will chase you if you put a couple of shots into it from time to time to keep it interested.
---
Yeah, 4 are autocompleted. 3 normal and the Gold Star (that needs 5 completed). 1250 lost.
---
I had to do 13 times the repeatable to earn the lost ones. Sigh. Time to farm XP.
---
Destiny 2, as far as I remember. Certain events are easier to knock out in longer play sessions but some of them needed daily interaction. Was it Festival of the Lost last year? the year before? Although I'd acquired the important things I was still missing a handful of the masks. And the one with the sleigh, I never finished that. But I also have not been playing D2 for some time now so things may have changed.
---
bethesda just assumes we stole fizzy lifting drink. so we lose, we get nothing.
---
I feel like this question is a "hold my beer" moment waiting to happen.
---
See 4 your self
---
Okay, thanks again.

It’s just smart in Bethesda’s part.  This is a social game as much as any other.  It’s wise to encourage people to get together and make friends.  The friends I’ve made in this game have kept me around much longer than the dumpster fire of a game warranted.
---
Weeeeeell participation was low because the raids were laggy to the point of being unplayable on public servers. With survival gone they'd really only be feasible on private servers, which defeats the whole point of public teams
---
A friend of mine was fussing that completing the daily challenges was a pain in the butt.  Knowing I'd thrashed them out quickly earlier that day, I asked him what he needed help with.  It turned out that just while playing normally, he'd completed all but the NW one already.  lol  We had a good chuckle and he admitted he was worried over nothing.
---
I need to check the list of bonuses,because I don't remember if there's a +crit meat. But I like meat bonuses so far. Tasty squirrel is easy to craft as well
---
It's so that they can release skins for it in the future.
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah, exactly the same for me. Strange that the gold star is completed with 3 "done", and it needs 5...
---
I nuked whitesprings on private solo last night and started tracking the XP it's fun watching progress.
---
Its happening to everyone, they broke something in patch 20, I haven't seen any official word from bethesda on it, but hopefully its not a hard fix
---
Oh totally. I’m not sure if we ever find her body do we? Someone said they thought she could still be alive but I think she probably just got gobbled up by a scorchbeast.
---
Yeah, having a pc is pretty nice.
---
Explosive bait their camps, its what i do. They do the punji trap, i drop 10-15 explosive baits on their vendors and camp items that cost alot like decom
---
Tattered field jacket is my favorite but as far as stuff that actually looks "good" I like the insurgent outfit with the raider nomad hat
---
well only 3 of mine autocompleted lost a 1000
---
So your advice is don't prepare, ignore the advice of one of if not the most educated players in the game, don't sneak, don't aim for the head and don't follow the main questline.   SMDH.
---
They gonan release a premium version that has the option convert all, i guarantee it
---
They specifically say hud and pip boy though
---
FYI they already said they are going to rework the interface...
---
If it's any consolation, there's a challenge tied to actually being the one to Launch the Nuke - so technically it's not actually "done".
---
That Wouldnt have worked because the guy was smart enough to only place wooden stuff at his camp (already tried once). I see him visit the enclave for Decontamination showering.
---
you should be able to do alot of things in this game, like fast travel, use adrenaline and do challenges but obviously what we should do and what we can do do not align with bethesdas business model
---
Veteran ranger gear. Duh. But the hunters long coat is also fantastic. And the greaser jacket and jeans. Now if only we could get a Tunnel Snakes, Kings, or Atom Cats jacket...
---
I agree with your main point. I just bought the game a couple months ago and I’m only level 22, but none of my friends play this game so I either have to meet up with randoms(not a huge fan) or solo everything. I’m told to get to level 20 to continue the wastelanders quest line, only to get slaughtered in almost every location it tells me to go to. It’s insane that every new location I get to, there’s 6-9 scorched that are 12-15 levels above me, or a manageable group of feral ghouls except 1 random level 65 that slows me and murders me in 2 hits. I’ve been a fan of fallout since the first time I saw fallout 3 but I can’t get into this online forced to play in groups experience for a series that’s been a single player game forever
---
Until you get a noob level 29 on your public team, die in a nuke zone because you don't take out a queen mirelurk yourself trying to let the noob get a tag in, only to die (she gets to close and i have explosive, long story) and said noob takes your mass and fluids.  smh.  just like in real life you have asshole and cool players in the wasteland and you might never know until they steal your shit.
---
Steeped fern flower tea for strength. I don't know if there's a carry weight one though.
---
That's correct, but they said in future ones First members might get special rewards/an advantage which is pretty standard as far as battle passes and other seasons go
---
A picture taken moments before disaster.
---
Didn't know you could get a bathrobe .
---
From the little bit of reading I just did it does look like that was similar. Although there was mention of getting the same currency as the daily challenges gave in other game modes. Which at the moment 76 just has grinding xp. Hopefully they switch it up to (or add) grinding events as well.
---
Does not work.
---
or you know better frame hate and less lagy
---
Then just give it to him lmao, think of how much effort he put into trapping his base. He has a low locust of control in real life and needs to lash out in an environment that he holds control i.e only in games. If you listen to their voice its either they r mid teens or mid 20s so they live with mum or work a dead end job. Let them have a little joy in their life.
---
I love the paramedic suit. Any armor put on goes directly under it so its concealed. That along with the police cap looks great!
---
How long does it take to get to level 5 and get the ammo converter?
---
Same here I had 4 of my 7 completed when I logged in. And I wasn't Logged in for the reset.
---
Bloody build.
---
Try around ‘tomorrow of the world’ near the train station.  I built a camp off the side of the road over the water.  Kinda looked like a Dollar Store Strip Mall area.
---
Well that’s a relief, anything is better than nothing! Cheers bro
---
It's really too easy.  Just start the match and walk away.  Come back later and start another.  I got it in 2 days of doing this casually it can be done faster if you actually go and hide in bushes or whatever.  Just be sure to turn off team fill so you dont ruin anyone else's fun time
---
Were you online at reset time 17:00 BST, 12:00 EST (50m ago)
---
May I ask why having a bolt on the inner side is that terrible? Sure it easier to chamber the gun with your primary hand but i feel like I personally would be more comfortable with keeping my hand on the handle and rechambering the gun with my other hand, having more control of the gun n all. So is it like a preference or a habit thing or something or is there any other reason why the bolt should be on the outer side. Im in primary so I dont know everything about guns and stuff but im gettin there, i get the basic concept of a bolt action
---
Just call it Scorch Birthday Party
---
Pistols are underpowered and if its non auto its literaly a bb gun in this game
---
Lewisburg used to have ghouls, super mutants, scorched or liberators....not it’s only ghouls.
---
Nope. Mine still fire exactly the same.
---
yea, in the other games you could change the hud colors and pipboy interactive display to whatever color you wanted (blue, red, orange, etc)
---
Just log out and log back in.
---
I'd found they'd fixed the lag a little after the initial problems turned most away.  It was the card scanning and pipe repairing that were issues, and they were similarly laggy to nuclear silos for me leading up to their removal, very frustrating on a bad public server. 
---
Silos run mostly fine for me now without really any lag in those quest objectives, which could be the case with raids if they returned.
---
 Getting 10 percent xp buff eating canned meat stew with carnivore
---
Haha yeah they are really easy so far and you'll just get them playing normally. I haven't been doing the NW ones but I'm still confident I'll get to the end without doing them ones.
---
It's impossible to accidentally delete a character.
---
The game isn’t designed around social play. The events, mobs, nothing scales to the massive player numbers and ridiciulous amounts of damage output. It’s essentially a single player game with a tacked on coop component.
---
In any case, what I want is doesn’t remove all that. The game just needs to offer content to people who don’t care for grouping. I can do everything in Division 2 solo except one raid dungeon, the game doesn’t push me to play with others if I don’t explicitly ask for it. I solo, sometimes I group with friends. Either of these aren’t exclusive.
---
not long. i think i got it on the first day it came out.
---
I did bit of searching and did not find any plant based carry weight food unfortunately, its the only thing stopping me getting Herbivore mutation. Such useful buff and easy +20 carry weight by just grilling bit of stag...
---
Were you online at the refresh time? If not did you login within 20m of refresh? If not did you last log out of NW? If not did you check atom store or legendary run board before loading in?
---
Looks pretty good, only thing I would change is the Kentucky and Ohio state line. The Ohio river doesn't go through Kentucky, it forms the northern border of the state. But then again, nothing on the Fallout map lines up with the real world locations.
---
Ye idk because I only have 1 main
---
Were you online at the refresh time? If not did you login within 20m of refresh? If not did you last log out of NW? If not did you check atom store or legendary run board before loading in? 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Absolutely perfect lol.
---
Imagine a fallout game actually made by the fallout community
---
2 clicks over 5k worth of ammo is still insane
---
I'm in teams every time I play.
---
Imagine putting out an update with bug fixes that introduces more gamebreaking bugs than it fixes. Do you guys even have an actual team of developers and coders?  What was your thought process on the user interface of the ammo convertor? Do you guys hate your own game?
---
Adrenaline, all my characters use it. That's 25 perk points being wasted . I'm not moving 25 points. There is nothing to put in their place. It takes a lot more ammo to kill large groups of enemies when I don't have adrenaline. I spent a great deal of time making my builds efficient. I'm not going to downgrade my builds because the developers are incompetent. I will not play until my perks are fixed. I don't give a shit about seasons . I wasn't going for the rewards anyway. I needed nothing, I very much enjoy my time playing. But it is insulting that they break players builds, and do nothing. This is hotfix worthy. Maybe folks with only one character see this as no big deal. But I love each of my characters, there is no main. They are equally awesome.
---
Weird I was sort of analysing the same sort of thing today 🤨
---
The Caravan Outfit is amazing with the blue ridge gas mask, but The Keeper Outfit goes surprisingly well with so many masks that it’s the most versatile.
---
1, 2 days, depending on the amount of challenges you completed, the actual playtime needed might be just half an hour.
---
You have to select delete, then it makes you type the character's name.
---
I've got 1st on my main account and at this point I had forgotten what it felt like to play without it. Then, on my mules alt, I decided to level up one of them. Oof. It's genuinely unpleasant to lose the scrap box and travel tent; just whether I should pick up some loot that would put me over-encumbered knowing I'm a long walk from a workbench/stash box becomes a stressor, as I know I need the scrap, but I'm used to being able to take everything not nailed down and then drop my tent just outside.
---
Back in my day we called them SLRs. Stuckup Lesbian Roleplayers. We also laughed at the people that gave them free stuff because they thought they had a chance at some cyber or real life sex.
---
i kind of like it, when you know what to expect it’s easier to plan out. 
---
If you know a string of areas with Scorched, Super Mutants, or Ghouls, you can hit them up in a row. Makes things like Ghoul Slayer more useful since it becomes less situational
---
I mean if the score system is glitched everyday, you are definately not finishing the pass
---
Really? I though you'd just have to press a button.
---
Not long at all. Do all the dailies and maybe 1 weekly challenge and you will be there.
---
Endgame it’ the other eay around, you can’t shoot anthing except SBQ. And soon even not that because more people abuse broken magical guns so it dies in like a minute now. Everything else vaporizes as soon as someone sees them.
---
I assume many people playing this game are gluttons for punishment.. so, yes..
---
it isnt very common but it happens...
---
either the treasure hunter outfit or the fashionable raider outfit with the fashionable glasses
---
not to say that the UI is great, but I mean why save thousand of ammo you’re not using?
---
The sad truth
---
Fly Boy outfit and Patrolman Sunglasses. Classy.
---
Oh you guarantee it? Well then
---
This should be their priority to fix and have a hotfix for it asap. It is ridiculously unfair to have challenges not award score and I've never known this to happen in any other game. It is not acceptable whatsoever.
---
I’m a fan of the Caravan Trader outfit with a Rusty Raider Skull Gas Mask. Devil Horns look really good too. I really like the Steel Workers Outfit with Devil Horns on female characters. Then I usually use the Shell Shocked backpack too, or at least I think thats what the name is 😅 im kinda new so still figuring it all out, thank you for asking this question on the feed, I was super curious as well :)
---
Season 21 of diablo3 just started, no dailies. Just a list of goals to be done at whatever pace.
---
Just to add on to this.  It’s pretty obvious you’ve never played these games.  It is fairly easy for people who want to catch up later in the season because these games add persistent weekly challenges, and various ways to get battlepass tiers as the season goes on.  So in those games it is possible to get to tier 100 in the last 3 days of the season with enough effort.
---
Yesterday logged in 40 mins after reset all was good.  Did one daily.  Logged back on in 4 hrs 3 more where auto completed.
---
I have a TS/33/+1a 10mm that's pretty good for mopping up low levels with absolutely no perks. I think the reason gunslinger builds aren't popular is because they're perks are in Agi with all the sneak perks. So it's difficult to get them to the same level as other builds.
---
I have very good news! I traded the handmade for a b2525 fixer. Its yours whenever you're ready! :) IGN Roman\_Adler
---
Sounds pretty good if your only converting a few bullets.
---
Getting a 10% XP boost for picking up one wood and one cranberry!
---
I'm 100% sure that they will do just that thanks for your thoughtful input.
---
It doesn't help that the daily challenges are broken, and support refuses to help and just locks our calls for help!
---
Public teams have been received very warmly and helped events and the game in general become far more alive.
---
I played pistols just like that from beta until a few months ago. it’s extremely fun, but relies heavily on headshot critical and concentrated fire. Don’t underestimate Quick Hands either. I loved playing the build for as long as I did as it was rewarding, but challenging. Vats crit, gun fu, quick hands, concentrated fire, and to enhance that you could throw it some stealth for more damage. Hope you try it and enjoy it!
---
For trading, giving away, and stuff.
---
This is why some others and I are playing with our BE Gatling Plasma and some others don't.
---
You're right, aside from Warframe I haven't. I just googled games with daily challenges on a battle pass. I've already said I think this should have a catch up mechanic akin to what you say they have.
---
OH WHAT THERE IS A TINFOIL HAT?! Must. Have. Need. Brain. Protection.
---
On your second log in did you check the atom store or legendary run before loading in?
---
Supermutant lewisberg was a pain when I first showed up on my.underleveled first play thru.
---
This players are the nicest people, a person donated my first power armor, a person gave me utracute blueprints, a person  who helped me clear some enemies that couldn't beat, a person who give 30 stimpaks, a person who gave tons upon tons of healing items, and a person who got me stacked on ammo. That's why now I'm making sure that I help low leveled players buy giving them supplies and even power armor.
---
Maybe you should try it out yourself - experience a similar amount of physical activity as your character and refrain from drinking alongside. 
---
It may be no fun for you to play how drinking is implemented currently, but the argument you draw - realism - to me seems one of the very few, which I would refute.
---
They’ve been hunted out by all the foreigners
---
The outfit is available again.  They borked NW rewards with update 20 all the rewards are dropping these survivor ones, Christmas, and Halloween.
---
Mabye I was just jumping on for a trade so If anything i woulda took a peak at the board game
---
and use level 2 starched genes and then they’re pretty much permanent
---
My guess: It'll likely come around between September 15/29th (Both are on a Tuesday) or at the most: October 6th. That's a likely estimate when Steel Dawn will come around.
---
It makes me sad that to get the ability to build freely, i need to pay money for the storage of the parts needed to build freely
---
Was the top of the world once snowy hench the Ski resort? If so this is genius and my love grows even stronger for this game
---
That happens when you find a new server, it seems to be a bug. If you quit the game entirely and reload it, the workshop icons stay the same.
---
I was online in Adventute mode at reset timey like every day. I was not in the Atom Store, nor on the Board. This bug only affected me today, the very first time.
---
Leadership bobble head too
---
I saw a level 230 something running what seemed to be a revolver build at project paradise the other day. 
---
I can assume it was for a dare or to challenge himself because pistolas really aren’t good. 
---
I run a heavy bloody build with just 3 points in rifleman to swap in for my bloodied explosive lever action, and i basically run and jump and hop about like an idiot like you describe, only in not gimped by a pistol. 
---
I reckon it may be fun in a “I am so angry yet determined” way but I definitely don’t believe it’s anything close to viable.
---
Everyone playing on PTS: Hey Bethesda can you please improve the legendary perks?
---
Bethesda: Yeah why not?
---
Everyone: Finally! Bethesda is listening to people 
---
Bethesda: We've made it so you have to pay to switch your legendary perk cards, enjoy!
---
Seriously though nobody asked for this and it's really annoying...
---
since the patch, the gauss pistol feels nerfed, even with 2.5X covert op damage and demolitions. first shot in vats is reliably a miss. and it feels like it breaks even faster (even with gunsmith). 
---
explosive bow and arrow feels buffed though, yay.... 
---
(fasnacht music in distance, runs screaming into the night)
---
I have an alt that's a pistol build and even with a bloodied gauss pistol set up it's not that great. I'm hoping if we ever get a rebalance overhaul pistols will get significantly better, and it's still fun, but it's not very efficient. The main complaint I have is pistol perks being mostly agility which robs of you of other stuff you need due to lack of slots.
---
I think everyone should just get unlimited scrap space and the 800 for everyting else
---
I did think about it before posting. Do drinks still get the extra buff with herbivore?
---
All I want from Bethesda is to more appropriate introduce community requested features.  They could earn a lot of goodwill from me if they stopped putting everything we ask for in temporary claim windows on the Atomic Shop, or in the season stuff.  I just want to see the patch notes one day and see "Added X new CAMP item blueprints to vendors and loot list for players to find", or a completely new weapon to the game.  
---
No catch, just a bunch of stuff for us to find as a freebie, and I don't need to go to the Atomic Shop to claim a "free" item because Bethesda actually did the sensible thing and added more to their game for the sake of improving it, like any developer should do.
---
That's all I want from Bethesda.
---
I agree that it's frustrating because I use adrenaline on both my characters, but not really sure how this is related to the subject. I'm also not sure why you'd need to respec 25 perk points.
---
The raids need to be imrpoved though, would you like to play an rng time based dungeon, half the time u cant finish because of glitches or because the time limit doesnt physically allow u to finish
---
Thanks for replying.
---
GO AWAY. This is not a user problem so dont come at it from that angle. Users logged in playing the game should not have to walk around land mine level bugs.
---
I was online at the time of refresh (5 o´clock GMT), was doing the Guided Meditation event, and dont know if i refreshed within 20 minutes.
---
But i wasnt in NW.
---
When you change hud colour in settings file, does the light from you pip boy (i mean when you long press tab) also change?
---
That’s exactly how I play. It’s been months since I’ve played without being over-encumbered. I have to use excavator power armor to fast travel anywhere.
---
Ima keep it real with you, there are tons of glitches that need to be fixed. The games mechanics revolve around bugs, its ridiculous
---
It's probably not a popular opinion, but sometimes i think it  would be better if they start over with the game like Square enix did with Final Fantasy 14 a realm reborn. I mean it's a hard decision and the chance that they'll do it is basically zero.
---
The only problem being that if you used all 9 damage perks you could only use adrenaline 5 and gun fu 1... No action girl, no sneak, no covert operative etc. Plus VATS in this game is just an aimbot. At least in the older titles it would slow/stop time and add a cinematic camera.
---
I was playing during the reset, but I don’t really see how that should matter. The studio claimed to have fixed the problem in the patch notes (shocker, it’s not fixed), and there shouldn’t be a laundry list of work arounds to make this game work the way it should.
---
Is the answer really that no one is playing fallout anywhere in the world for 30 min so that the challenge system can properly reset?
---
yes, billy mays seal of confirmation
---
A youtuber pointed out, that the current new weapon skin conflicts with the used weapon modell.
---
So instead of asking for more, I would prefer the developers to improve and refine the implementation of skins, so that they are not inferior to the standard appearances...
---
I'm around Level 15 if that helps. I did all weeklies and all dailies except today's NW Challenge.
---
I started a new character and decided on a Bloodied non-auto Gunslinger. L78 now and still using pipe pistol as the main weapons of choice
---
Disregard the naysayers as it can be effective. Just like any other build it relys on effective perk management and good legendary effects for the best results but atm I'm just got a quad pipe revolver and standard bolt action pipe and can deal more than enough damage to take down most enemies with ease, particularly from stealth/caution. I'm also hitting SBQs enough for consistent full rewards which I've heard described as 'impossible' with any pistol let alone basic pipes.
---
Nope. There would probably be a lot of moaning if that was the case. You have to click 2 things to buy off the atomic shop a people are still asking for an extra verification because they accidentally bought something.
---
but I guess the point is, is the issue with the UI exasperated because of the hoarding of ammo? will the UI be more manageable when you don’t have a stockpile?
---
Like once your stash is down to 0, you can just go back to the converter and much more quickly go through the 10’s of ammo you have.
---
Not that i like the UI, i just think it’s worse for anyone who had a lot, but once it’s greatly reduces, it’s not as bad (based on my own experience with my levels 186 and 100 vs my level 10
---
Dual wielding would be super fun if it was like akimbo in payday 2 imo
---
It will make the whole map scale to your level, so it makes every event, daily quest, legendary enemy, area etc. useable in grind for all the players, no matter whats your level.
---
At least this is how One Tamriel worked.
---
Bonds are kept with players so long as the don't leave the server
---
How about taking care of everything, how about ask them to be more competent and think in a competent way.
---
They just appear to be dropping at random at the moment.
---
Mutant slayers and ghouls slayer prefixes will probably never be useful, why only do 30% more to damage to a specific creature when you could just get a 50% dmg boost against every creature? 
---
Maybe for early game but it's early game I doubt you find many legendarys
---
I have some friends that pvp each other with non legacy weapons. We go to private server and split up, make teams , set up workshops. It's all really fun when you take the legacy weapons out of the fight. Legacy weapons are only good for two things , being a griefer, or killing griefers. They have no place in fun pvp.
---
1st time through wastelanders I laughed.
---
2nd time she was annoying.
---
3rd time I wanted to put a bullet in her head.
---
I love how they arnt even commenting on this issue.
---
ok
---
Five characters
---
I have to cop to skipping most of the silos. It's been a long long time since I did one legit but I do remember how frustrating the mainframe cores were
---
I just hit 15 after getting two of todays dailies done. I know i have gotten quite a bit from XP, just not sure as compared to the whole where it should be. That does make me feel a bit better about it now though.
---
why is OP.....?
---
Same here just ticked over to 16 as I killed a legendary while taking a workshop
---
Id buy that but i would not wear it lmaoo
---
Yes it was great
---
Yeah, getting people to play daily I think might be really counter-productive, as it just encourages burnout, and with that comes people not playing at all, and thus absolutely no atom shopping.
---
The atom shop updates just once a week. Thus, as long as people are logging in once or twice a week, they are getting their sales. Just make a longer list of weekly challenges, and everyone's good to go.
---
Ah gotcha. Sure they'll fix it... Eventually...
---
It's DVD quality and as i understand it (i'm not  tech guy) but Fallout is still using the same old engine as they did back in 2007 or so....   Todays machines may be too fast for their engine???   Honestly i don't know if that makes sense...Maybe someone else understands this stuff better.   But i think of it like putting a corvette engine (your pc) ... in a lawn mower.   The lawn mower being FO76
---
Looks like I'm doomed already.
---
Thanks for this answer. I am a bit bummed that I can't use my xbox character on PC even though I own it on both.
---
And I feel this is a serious issue that is being overshadowed by the score complaining, trying to make sure it's not forgotten.
---
I like the responders paramedic jumpsuit and bomber jacket. They are just clean and good colour scheme
---
It has been as engaging as watching the game on Twitch and I explained why. The name needs to scale its challenge to player numbers before it begins cramming more players onto the same challenge which dilutes the experience. That makes is effectively dead as people cannot do stuff. They just stay around and stuff happens. At that point, it stops being a game.
---
you sit here and make jokes while a little girl is in trouble?
---
Calm down and direct me to the part of my post that suggests this is the fault of the player.
---
I am trying to ascertain if there is a correlation between actions people take and the issue occurring, so I can avoid it myself and advise others to avoid it. Until it is fixed.
---
I completed the weekly challenge to kill a bunch of robots yesterday and the game didn't reward me score for it. I was nowhere near the daily reset time. Not wasting my time with this broken trash, I have other games to play that actually function correctly for more than 5 minutes at a time.
---
Imagine using non-primed ammo
---
Because they are reusing assets, ambient music, meshes, and stuff.
---
It's very obviou5 when you are in a cave.
---
FYI Im not saying the whole community is horrible but there are sooo many of them that it's hard to know who's real. See ppl getting ripped off, seeing ppl who cheat constantly, abd seeing the rude and disgusting comments some of them say to girls especially....just tired of it. Guys stalking girls on there, pretending to be a girl...that sh*t is weird af. Then some of them gang up with multiple of them.  See it happening to my friends that r girls all the time. And yes it's been reported to Bethesda by those ppl with no outcome. I've even heard of some of them threatening girls lives and other sorts...it's messed up.
---
I feel like this would require too much effort for bethesda to fix and it also holds no monetary value for them so while I completely agree, I dont think itll ever happen
---
Hopefully word spreads, even during an event all the xp from the mobs has to make up for the extra event xp.
---
Oh I did.. and it twas satisfying
---
But yes , your point , score, I'm sure it's as easy to grind as any grind, didn't even look like a grind from what I've read . But some don't care to put in any work, they will always cry.
---
I big time agree they should be improved!  The removal was just the exact opposite of that, if the raids made it to the PTS we might have more awesome group content right now.  
---
I think the time limit should be removed altogether, and with some testing we could iron out those random raid ruining glitches.
---
I just hit 14 but I had probably missed on 10 dailies because of the game auto completing my dailies and not giving me any score.
---
I have the black skull mask. It should be good. 
---
Should...sigh
---
Lol as if we can take anything they say as not being subject to change.
---
Yes also with caves!
---
But imo it doesn’t really matter that it’s reused. It’s all the great memories coming back
---
I'm the same way too except I bought the Toothy mask before Fashnaut came out again and I didnt participate the first time and I bough it from a vendor and I wear the Toothy mask and haven't taken it off in a year and wont take it off
---
Not at all suggesting it should be like that. Just trying to figure out the triggers of the bug so I can avoid it and maybe even highlight it to the Bethesda reps on here.
---
Forest camo jumpsuit is what I wear the most
---
I would agree with this if people weren't being screwed outta score by their dailies being auto completed when they log in and not giving any score at all.
---
Wait some people don't just hoard everything?
---
It looks that way when you spam reply to every single post the same thing by grilling everyone on if it was something they were doing to cause this (meaning their fault or not).
---
There's no river boundary between Maryland and west virginia where they both meet Pennsylvania though is there?
---
The game i paid for had daily and weekly challenges that gave atoms, it was one of the reasons i bought i the game, I liked that it wasn't trying to force players into spending more.   
---
" I for one believe in supporting the games I love so that more can be made" As do I, I don't however reward people who can't keep their word, but you do with your money what you will. Good day.
---
Well I really don't like that the caves sounding exactly like the ones in Skyrim. It's a different game, I want different vibes.
---
Lvl 17, have lost 1000 atoms to buggy reset.
---
Ohio is for lovers 😍
---
In my honest opinion, bethesda is too focused rn on daily users, they are trying to get players to play everyday for a grind instead of providing actual content to create repeat players. Its sad because the game has amazing potential just terrible execuetion
---
Just got a yellow asylum dress thanks to your information, thanks so again so much!
---
Fingers crossed the daily ops on the roadmap will see 94 cracked again
---
Shit up and take my money!!!
---
I got arrounf 900 Score points from leveling.
---
Are you on PC?    
---
I don't play MMOs and 76 is kind of getting me back into it but I doubt I'll ever be anywhere near a top tier player.    
---
Gaming can be a way to cope with loss such as yours and as long as it's in moderation it can teach us all a few things. If you are on PC I don't know how I can help. My main is only level 51.
---
We bumped into the ceiling which now needs to be washed and sterilized!
---
I am 14 and haven't done the dallies yet for today.
---
Congrats. That's worth 15k+ btw.
---
I have one but i've never found one. Someone gave me mine.
---
This isn't the only way to get the bug. It just happens sometimes. Log in last night to two of my dailies done, one being complete 5 of them. It just isn't being logged in at reset
---
That's not how I meant it, but I can see how it would come across that way I suppose.
---
Of the 50+ people I've asked in the last few days there were only a couple of people that have said they weren't online at refresh time. Of those that said they weren't they all either logged in shortly after, accessed NW the last time they played, or accessed the season board before loading in.
---
O was thinking of doing some form of proof experiment by trying those things myself, but would risk losing my dailies by doing that.
---
Why? They haven't moved.
---
For real, i love this game but it could be so much more
---
😄😄 Sounds like you came across Fallouts version of the Grim Reaper.
---
I'm realizing this to be true. Mainly because the space between events is large and you can find tons of enemies that are high level. I was getting 2k XP per sentrybot at Whitespring yesterday... Sometimes there'd be 4 of them for 8k XP (almost all you need to get the rotating weekly done).
---
You can't use it in NW 
---
At least you can't with the wood 
---
I havn't gotten the marine or scout yet to test those though
---
nice
---
marsupial mutation in adventure
---
Just hit level 22, been doing a lot of queen runs
---
The truth is that Bethesda is observing player progression closely and collects data. They can easily tweak the progression gain of players anytime. So nothing is set in stone.
---
However looking at the rewards in the season pass, I think it should be hard to obtain and not be easy for everyone. 
---
The demand to make it easy and obtainable casually is detrimental. First of all there needs to be some way to distinquish between more and less committed players. If everyone has and gets everything with little effort, then there is no reason to play FO76 extensively.
---
MMO need to adhere to this truism... players who play more, need to get more than others. If everything were just a joke, then there is no meaning.
---
lol
---
Real nice lol
---
It's only in NW. Marsupial mutation in adventure
---
Yes! Yesterday i stopped playing somewhere in the savage divide(cant remember where exactly)and when i got back to play I spawned in the crater
---
18/100. missed 1500 score on day 2 from auto competes
---
watch how the player pulls the gun up and then reaches over to access the bolt, if the bolt is on the correct side with your dominant hand, all they operator has to do it move their trigger hand to the bolt to cycle the action, keeping the rifle more in line with the target.
---
the rifle in fallout 4/76 is designed to be operated by a left handed user.
---
well nobody is 'forcing' you and there have been a lot of 'should not be the solution' with 76 and Bethesda management but it is what it is for the time and nothing *we* can do about other than asking Bethesda to actually fix it.
---
How do I get the mutation?
---
Yeah, thats how they try and hook you in then keep you going
---
Remember too there is the repeatable experience weekly. So just play and you will get score.
---
No, I pushed It ;)
---
drink the serum, or bathe in a toxic river for a chance.
---
They blend in, it's fine for experienced players that know where everything is, but if you didn't know where the workshops were you would have a hard time finding them on the map based on their appearance.
---
Wait. Are you really telling me that my clean miner's hat can be modified on the armor workbench to project a different color?
---
Queen runs give extra from xp?
---
Player vendors sell it for 2-300 caps or you can buy the plan from MODUS in the science wing in the Enclave bunker for 18-20k caps
---
Disagree completely. If you look at a map and compare locations of ingame cities to real life cities, I would argue that the Fallout 76 map is only one section of West Virginia, not the whole State.
---
I live in Maryland?
---
Ill try that later on. If it is a bug then hopefully it goes back to normal when they fix it 6 months from now.
---
still no text chat after 1 and half years of requesting.
---
I stayed logged in and my challenges were fine
---
from what i have heard the scorch beasts are just re-worked skyrim dragons
---
Not sure if it's the event itself or just the xp award triggering. I run in a building group with all the xp boosts i can muster and get the xp score pretty frequently
---
Your young eyes should not read most of the content on this site, very R rated....
---
Lol really?
---
They do kind of appear out of nowhere like the dragons lol
---
You would have to constantly rank up in nuclear winter to unlock “perk packs.” Once you unlock perk packs you will then have to pray to the RNG gods that you’ll get one of you don’t then lose hope because every time  you get a duplicate you get perk points. Once you obtain enough perk points because you have the worst luck ever you then can purchase the frog legs. Keep in mind, both adventure mode and NW are different from each other. Even if you unlock frog legs, your character must have 9 agility points in adventure mode. That makes things even more complicated because you then have to hop on adventure and possibly ruin your character build just because you want the perk card in NW. I went ahead and just made a whole new character specifically for NW. Anyways, in adventure mode frog legs is just a mutation and it’s known as “marsupial.” You can find plenty of marsupial serums in peoples vendors for decent prices or really good prices. Good luck man :)
---
Here's my theory:
---
One of the daily quests is thrill of the grill in which you have to hunt meat for the Mr. Handy at helmlock holes. Once you've placed the meat there you then have to get vegetables which are tatos, corn and carrots. Now obviously being a daily you can set up the veg so you can harvest it before you start the meat part of it thus completing the daily in one go. The hardest veg to come across to plant is carrots.
---
So if your camp has no veg growing he may have left that so you can plant the carrot and get up to the 5 carrot plants needed for the daily.
---
But that's just a theory.
---
I get this too. I’ll hear a pop sound and audio will just cut out from the game until I relaunch. Strangely enough, I can still hear other players talking in area chat
---
It's happened to me for at least 2 each time, so helpful...
---
sometimes you can for free. sometimes you have to pay
---
yah im wit u on that. There are tons of thinngs to complain about in this game but the community is definately not one of them. People are honestly just tryna have a good time. Mayb its different on console but as a pc player thats lvl 250+, i can say ive only been griefed maybe once or twice and it was funny too so
---
I hear you. Makes sense
---
I dont know, but I am going to plant it now
---
TLDR
---
Yeah, it’s happened to me quite a bit. It’s happened while playing NW, by going into atom shop before going int adventure, and now playing through the update. It’s always good to be pragmatic, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up :)
---
Fair enough. I actually prefer it this way but I see your point.
---
Thanks for all the upvotes :), and i have no legs cuz i'm crouching lol
---
yes
---
I love how everyone just learns to adapt to the glitches since bethesda never fixes them. Shoutout to having to play around the fast travel glitch for the last 3 months
---

Had that happen to me some days ago too. Was trying to fast travel to Foundation, ended up at a bunker somewhere in the Mire.
---
Nice dude, it makes doing things alot easier negl
---
Last night it was just a visual bug for me. It said I would have to pay caps to travel to an owned workshop, but no caps were actually taken from me. Weird.
---
I know I‘m boring, but for me it’s leather coat and assault gasmask :‘D
---
Always been 15/30/45
---
I have never had to pay once i owned a workshop though. Its definitely supposed to be always free to travel once you own it. I see the icons have been changed too.
---
I get this alot but its not intermittent, there is just no sound until i relog even tho music is playing on another app
---
I'm embarrassed by the amount of hours I have in this game.
---
I can't believe that I'm still learning stuff like this..
---
What kind do you have?
---
wouldn't mind seeing a willie wonka thing in fallout 76, there is already a golden holotape after all
---
Somewhere on the sub one of the community managers said Adrenaline was broken and they're looking into it, not sure about sneak though
---
What was the refresh? Did they remove the nuclear winter bugged rewards?
---
Willing to bet they chose this season's theme to make people take notice of Captain Cosmos for when they integrate him into the Unstoppables so they can do a superhero season  à  la Avengers
---
no doubt about it.. adrenaline is borked
---
yah it gives 60% atk for 30 seconds and resets on any kill. But since its broken rn and considering it took them months to fix gun fu and concentrated fire is still broken, i dont think itll be fixed anytime soon
---
No thanks. It’ll just result in people loading their vendors with garbage so they look more appealing on the map.
---
Same, but it's an easy challenge you can finish in 10 mins
---
Go troll elsewhere ya child.
---
Ok, I think people were confusing the XP repeatable for events giving score to start out. Just have FOMO going on and dont want to be sliding back too far.
---
I'm around 17 going on 18. My fiance is flying through it because she keeps staking up that repeatable 10,000 xp weekly
---
Keep them for the gumdrop challenge i guess, maybe sell a few tho lool
---
Whom is Ra-Ra?
---
Ah, so the main reason to use the bolt with your dominant hand is so you can hold the barrel grip with the other one which would make it easier for the operator to keep the barrel aligned with the target while rechambering, correct? Thought of that too while writing my previous comment but I figured a bolt action rifle would be heavier at the handle since theres the whole stock and receiver and all so i thought the correct and easier way of holding it would be by the handle while rechambering.
---
I was attempting to use a vampire explosive pipe pistol for awhile and it just feels so underwhelming - the 10mm handles better imo and it benefits from gunsmith.  Pipe builds are really underwhelming in this game
---
That is the way.
---
You need to remove starched genes
---
no team pvp anymore thanks to people complaining all you can do is grief now lol
---
I was looking for radstags in the toxic valley but for some reason only fireflies were spawning
---
I been getting the long server connects and laggy servers since update but im on pc
---
I would love if we went Northeast in a DLC and could do really cool stuff with Dayton Ohio and Wright Patt Airforce base with all the alien rumors that surround it.
---
Or any other vault. I heard they may even leave Appalachia for those daily ops which could be really cool
---
Worst part is they fuck u, leave next morning and never text u back :(
---
Probably not a bad idea. Someone posted a video explaining it better just an hour ago, only just now saw it though, says if you do everything, you will be at 100 2 weeks early. I think i have to sit down and just run an excel that says minimum level vs days through event.
---
When I logged on yesterday it had completed the audiotape task but it also awarded me the score (this was all during the loading screen).  So it’s possible it is rewarding and people just aren’t seeing it as it bugs out
---
I'm currently running the new aviator jacket, the settler mechanic hat (I'm a sucker for dai caps), and the Enclave eye patch.
---
seems like it the same for me then, just tried and it did show cost but didn't take caps.
---
Does the black skin from the season pass not go on it?
---
The benefits of a public team are really that you get some buffs (depending on what the team aims are). If you usually play solo, or your mates are not online, then you can get (for example) 100% xp boost doing events in an Event Team. If you happen to like playing alongside someone in the team, add them as a friend so you can join their server and maybe hook up again another time. 
---
The bonding in public teams determines what benefits you get. You'll see the blue bar growing above the names of others in the team, and the chart above shows how may you are bonded with and what buff you currently have. Takes a little time to get the bonds, but not too long. 
---
Bethesda have provided some protection against the reasons players traditionally refused to team with random players. Those being you can't drag teammates into unwanted PvP, cannot build in teammates' camps, can't take from locked extractors or purifiers or open locked doors, etc. If you want to be able to do that stuff (as you would playing with mates) then team privately not a public team. 
---
Does that answer your questions? If not discuss further ...
---
I logged out today about ten minutes before the reset and logged back in after just to make sure that didnt happen to me.
---
Pretty sure FO76 is an 18+ game. Already on the phone to the FBI.
---
Ty fellow Bush wookie! This may be the news way to survive against the blood hungry try hard gauss shotgunners 👍
---
Longshoreman outfit with the yellow slicker hat... My absolute favourite one
---
Np friend, hide wt the bottom with ghille suit head and u should be good. Long live the wookies
---
I see the rank up option, but it is greyed out for me. Is it stoping everyone from this?
---
That was one of the first things I tried haha. Didn't work.
---
Happens to me too :/
---
That the state of gaming in 2020 , you could say that with all the gaming subreddit. It not that they won’t listen is that they have data backing up what they do and we are entitled POS 
---
we are the very loudest and vocal few but we can’t the whole fallout76 community.. so they can’t cater to the few. 
---
Look at the the score system and removal of the daily and weekly challenge. It was mostly ignored by the majority of the playerbase So they decided to fix it and give us cosmetics rewards instead atoms and now the game is way more active , people doing events etc etc because of it
---
Yeah it would be great if they could clarify exactly what rewards score. Either way if you can find a good team who drop lots of nukes it's pretty quick to level up
---
Take your pick lol.
---
That's a weird way to spell Robert A. Altman
---
Honestly the closest equivalent to this game model I've seen in a highly active community long term is MapleStory.
---
well it's tough to decide what actually exists in the lore, between believable lies and the wanting desire to find new and interesting content. 
---
Ran around hopped up on Nukashine and a shovel hoping to nuka-spawn on the unmarked grave... but alas
---
also. Even if you are on a public team by yourself you can use team charisma perks to get the benefits. 
---
Also team mutations like herd mentality work.
---
Will do, worried about leveling up too much now, and then having issues leveling up to complete a daily later.
---
Be nice to her.   She will eventually take Megs place.
---
yes, its ideal to have your muzzle level when cycling the action, makes it easier hit the target in repeated succession.
---
&gt; Its definitely supposed to be always free to travel once you own it.
---
Any source where Beth said this?
---
MeepSquan
---
Things have changed since the update. Either it's meant to be free still or you have to pay. Either way it's borked
---
You can always start a new character if you have any slots left, you can level up really quickly at low levels. Score counts across all your characters
---
Yikes .... I thought people played games 4 fun
---
I assumed that if she wasn’t present in the bunker physically tell someone what happened, then she had assumed she, Abbie, had succumb to something and either perished, or was unable to return.  Sort of like the saying “if I’m not back in 30 minutes call the police, or call xyz”  She foresaw her own demise.  
---
So basically, she recorded them knowing that it would be unlikely she would be able to complete all the scorch tasks and make it back alive if she did indeed attempt so.
---
PC versions of the game (so far anyway) have cross launcher saves. things that do not transfer over are Atoms and 1st subscriptions. those would have to be spent on the old launcher
---
Unfortunately not by the looks of it, in the description it says it’s a combat rifle skin.
---
Also as mentioned in the comments, the fixer doesn’t even have an ‘appearance’ category on a weapons workbench
---
Due to it being a glitch the drops are entirely random.
---
I love BoS engeneer outfit, It looks pretty steampunk
---
Ok thanks I just never found it.
---
Lame.  I’m on PC.  You?
---
Adrenaline is broken, yes.
---
I haven't noticed sneak-damage being worse than usual.  It's always been a gamble.
---
No.
---
ps4
---
I feel like when I’m in cautious mode and still firing I get let sneak attack procs then I used too.
---
If you've done everything, you should have got 17500 which is level 15.  Anything over is from the repeatable quest.
---
Yeah i wondered what that blue bar was.   The other 3 players were I guess bonded...so i was a third wheel...or 4th...whatever.    
---
I was expecting to play together as a team to achieve a goal.   But it seemed like everyone was out on their own...playing solo...and i would receive caps when they completed something.    So i could literally work on my camp, and collect caps i guess :)     
---
I guess my question is, is there a certain quest line for public teams, or is it just that you team up and do whatever?
---
From what I’ve seen it’s 14k xp after you unlock the combat armour paint.
---
Unfortunately there isn’t an indication on how far you are in the challenges menu
---
Well my parents got divorced like a week or 2 ago and my dad had to move out. Ironically I get to spend more time with him now and he's probably gonna take me shooting for the first time this weekend, hopefully there will be some bolt actions I can try.
---
I got a Halloween skin randomly this morning from some event.
---
I've joined a few casual teams and never met up with the other players, just doing my own thing.  No problems.  Some perks are shared and bonds are formed.
---
Event teams seem to hop event to event, and from what I saw, some players just sit there not contributing to collect XP and items.  But overall good for the teamwork.
---
You develop a bond over time and when you have full bond with players you gain percentage bonuses to whatever party type you’re in
---
Even if the point system was working, what is the point exactly? 
---
Do you really have a desire to do jail break for the 90000th time?
---
See ive used mines here and there and never seen it as useful (but kept it cause its explosive) but not all of a sudden it fires like mad
---
Well shyte. I just assumed. Dammit Beth!! No adrenaline and this?  Grrr!
---
That doesn't become available for two weeks after a season starts.
---
I think I'm livin on a stateline lol
---
Scrip
---
If you do everything you won't have enough after 70 days to get to 100.  You need the repeatable quest to get there.
---
Of course with double score weekends or double XP weekends that will go quicker.
---
It does not. Makes me sad.
---
 I had the same problem. At the time the challenges restart, I was online and four automatically appeared as done without giving me a point. I had read a message yesterday and made sure to write down what I had just in case. I was at level 15 and I had 225 points to go to 16. That remains exactly the same. It is impossible to understand how they can make so many mistakes. They are a complete disaster. Without further ado.
---
We aren’t able to use atoms to rank up until two weeks into the season.
---
Ranking up with atoms won't be available until the start of the third week.
---
There was a post by another user recently that said it was 10 weeks 6 days, and doing everything should be completed around 8 weeks. He has a video going through it all. Ill have to find the link and add it here.
---
Mothsquatch, so cute.
---
I'm more than half way done already, and I'm not doing anything but grinding out the daily routine.
---
Scrip or sell them.
---
How long does it take?  I was in a team for over  2 hours last night and didn’t get anything and today I ended up being the leader and the new players that arrived in the team got one soon as they joined?
---
Do I have to be near the team members for certain amount of time?  If I joined a team and I don’t get the bond, do I still get all the benefits etc?
---
First thing I do is scrip them, then sell the rest. If I have any left over that are low stars, I drop them off at vault 76. I usually keep the three stars for the next day.
---
really glad you asked this,i was wondering the same thing,but felt stupid to ask :P
---
Thank you.
---
Well the main selling point of FO1st is unlimited junk, and private world. I agree with you somewhat but they need a constant flow of revenue otherwise no more FO76. On the flip side they really really need to up the benefits of FO1st, nothing like scrap boxes or lunch boxes but I definitely want a static private world that I can take control of and do as I please. Hell I want an offline world that allows me to have console commands but my progress isn't saved, imagine the bug fixes that people can find if they can successfully recreate bugs in a controlled environment of a private world. The possibility are endless. I even think they need console commands in the PTS so people can BREAK the game to fix it better
---
For weapons, agree.  But for armor, a straight 15% damage reduction per piece adds up (especially if you double it with Sentinels on the gear for a chance of additional 15% reduction).
---
Really good gun, congrats
---
Yes, you should. That'd be great. Also, being able to change the headlamp on the T-65 PA.
---
Haha it’s confusing the hell out of me 😂
---
Well, guess i have to go with event teams then
---
Your comment fills me with hope. I just rolled an alt and wanted to go pistols and I was starting to become regretful in my build choices after reading some comments here.
---
Any tips for a young gunslinger?
---
Beckley is Huntington in the game.
---
☹️
---
Well, yeah. We could just figure out how to get around it, not be vocal on Reddit or elsewhere, submit tickets, and wait for Beth to fix it in 2021. ;) Until then, a lot of people will need to spend atoms to finish the seasons, even if they’re trying to do all of the challenges
---
"Floaters" were actually in the original fallout games. Though they were more like floating flatworms than these... things Fo76 has
---
Added with wastelanders worms infected by the super mutant virus they've been in previous fallout games
---
Logged in today to have all but 2 S.C.O.R.E events auto-completed thus earning no points...fix this Bethesda.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Floater](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Floater) has more info on the originals
---
I don't pick up one/two stars that weigh more than 2. I scrip what I can and sell the rest in the vend super cheap so other people can get their scrip easily too.
---
How about not getting so bent out of shape on a video game and wishing someone to lose their job because heaven forbid you have to take more than a couple of minutes to clear the ammo you’ve been hoarding.  
---
If you think they are so shitty at programming, just fucking quit playing then.
---
depending on level/star count,
---
but i'll drop the lower ones (Lev-15 1-star) at the overseer camp by the wayward.
---
I also check that fallout76 info page on something if i'm not sure the value and want to C.A.M.P. vendor it (Anti-Armor bow sold faster than i thought.)
---
after fasnachts, i flat out dumped stuff after the event. 
---
But, now i'll think about the RustyPick register...
---
Reminds me of those plastic penny trays at the convenient store: Take-a-penny Leave-a-Penny
---
Xbox is laggy AF since the patch. Even the Pip Boy is slow
---
They've always done that. I mostly keep them handy for SBQ and the imposter and while I'll use whatever I've looted as I'm only after the effect I've always recommended the quad prefix as they burn through 25 rounds in a second.
---
How would you tell the survivors from the ghouls?
---
EXCELLENT point, I kinda forgot about that :&lt;
---
bruh just check out the ui for the ammo convertor and youll understand that no one at bethesda plays the game
---
They were in the original two fallouts. They're the stuff of nightmares, especially the level 73 fire ones. I'm bloodied and I can still tank most stuff more or less endlessly, but those things scare me to death and present the only "real" threat left to me (other than cave crickets and assaultrons). 
---
They have my healthy respect, the floating infected supermutant ballsack escapees,
---
I sell decent anti armor/junkies/bloodied/instigating/tse well below market value in vendors. Save great stuff I don't use and seek package trade for god tier on market sub. Everything else is scrip.
---
Planning, self-control, and some smarts are the best ways to manage the stash limits in this game. These are some of my strategies: 
---
Plastic is a bit tricky, but it's everywhere, and it's one of the few things that I will actually pick up every time I see it.
---
Steel, is pretty easy to come by. Look around where your camp is located at, there's probably an iron vein around it somewhere that will provide you some quick steel if you run through whatever is in your stash.
---
Adhesive is easy, especially if you buy the Turbo-Fert Fertilizer machine from the Settlers. Just keep some corn, mutfruit, and tatos in your camp and you can make some extra adhesive anytime you need it.
---
I've never subscribed to FO1st, not even for a trial. It is frustrating to constantly be hitting the 800/800 limit. But it can be done. Two strategies...
---
Don't pick everything up. - This is difficult at first, but it gets easier.
---
Bulk your scrap - I can free up so much weight by bulking up the scrap I bring back.
---
Get rid of things you're not using./Don't hoard things you don't need. You're never going to use 1000 pcs of Cork scrap or 1000 Fiber Optics Spools unless you're planning on crafting 50 Gatling Lasers for some reason. 
---
Gunpowder. - I bought the Ammo Mill from the Raiders, and it's greatly minimized the need for me to keep gunpowder on-hand, and thus eliminated one weight factor from my stash. 
---
Screws - People are always running out of screws, best way I've found to avoid this. In addition to picking up items, buy them in bulk and toss them in your stash. Even if I don't need them, I buy a few of them every time I visit a vendor and stash it. I haven't ran out of screws in months. I use the same strategy for most of the materials that I need for whatever I'm crafting at that time, plastic, steel, aluminum, lead...you can buy that in bulk and put it in your stash for when you need it. 
---
Weapons - All of those Bloodied Gatling Lasers in your stash that you're not using? Someone will buy them from you so you can feed your crafting or ammo supply purchased. Do you really need all of those pipe weapons you're not even using? Take a hard look at what you're sitting on that you're not using and get rid of it.
---
The bond that displays over other players names are your bonds with them, once those blue bars fill you have bond, you can have a maximum of 3 bonds and do not have a bond bar for yourself
---
The ammo loop is bad enough that all my builds end with having a heavy reliance on melee weapons
---
Temperately swap it out for sneak damage cards, it'll make up the differnce!
---
Fallout new Vegas had them
---
If she does taxes she is better than most.
---
I also wanna know this as well
---
I could be very wrong on this, so please correct me IF I am! I think i heard some where that they exist in one of the earlyer games.
---
Cheeki Breeki
---
...it's not happening to me...?!?
---
I've still got white icons and travel for free to workshops ice taken.  I've heard people saying it but I've not seen it.   
---
Someone did say that it was only if they changed to a DIFFERENT server after being on the world, I rarely change after being there so it may be due to that?
---
If you place the turrets right then yes they will fiin he metal supports at he corners facing outward. Something to note is I also originally placed my camp device higher up into the station so I could build higher. If your vendors are up in the structure, I don't think you have much to worry about as players will probably spawn on the ground. Have a friend test your player spawn by ft to your vendor while not teamed.
---
I fast travel to a low lvl on the map and drop them along with stims and ammo n stuff
---
Oh lord, how do you?
---
Hence why you wookie and do smthin else for the duration
---
Eh...Destiny 2 had a few things daily-routine things but for the most part, you could just play at whatever pace you wanted.
---
Isnt fallout rated m
---
just use four leaf clover, it have 8 chances to proc per shot what makes frequent crits super easy, you don't even need high luck
---
Bloodied gunslinger silenced, pipe pistol. Unyeilding keeps you in sneak, so I run gunfu, super fun build. Lvl 200 keeps up with any of my other builds, sbq, project paradise, ect
---
If ur comp goes asleep with fallout running, it uninstalls itself
---
If u pay less than 15 bucks yah
---
Definitely true
---
The ironic thing is it's all about money, but their focus on daily participation offends and pushes away the people that work during the week and have the most money for their hobbies.  They try to monetize it like their mobile game, but people can't check their PC like their phone.
---
Soon we will have so many daily chores to feel bad about missing that even full time gamers won't have time to play how they want to lol
---
But you're right, the potential is there and my hopes remain high
---
Urgh, ok thanks.
---
Ah right, that makes a lot of sense now then. Thank you.
---
I use insurgent with Black cowboy hat and plain backpack. This plus my hunting rifle and i feel like real wastelander.
---
Scrip what i can, when overencoumbered i play with other accounts until sunday night. During work days i just log in, scrip and sell what i can then log off. On friday i am all good to go again
---
The Pitt DLC
---
Bullshit
---
It was like a month ago too that’s where i picked it up lol
---
I like skins but I don't use them because they don't show up in trade menus. I understand they aren't tradable, but let me at least me show them for trade purposes.
---
Lmao you took that whole firing the dude thing seriously.
---
Dude you got issues.
---
I picture a Fallout in Atlanta, and then when they do the preview trailer you see a burned out Olympic Park, World of Nuke and other Atlanta landmarks set to a sad girl singing the Coke song
---
This challenge may be the first I miss, I don't mind doing the other NW but this is just too much meh.
---
Asking where in the lore these fit is one of the stupidest snall minded questions. Even if these didnt exsist already asking this question just stunts the writers creativity. Like how are you supposed to add new things to the franchise if everyone is caught up asking " uhhhh ive never seen that before why is that allowed?" Get over it.
---
Had it too. Had to re-do the whole part, what a bunch of incompetent amateurs at Bethesda 🤬. 
---
I logged out, logged back in, dropped my own pulse grenades just to be sure (maybe they bugged out). 
---
But the second time they did spawn - buggy as hell tho. When I defeated the 3 star robot - after picking up the 1 star legendary - he disappeared from the map.
---
Man F**ing bethesda... I want a refund lulz
---
Most MMOs save the good stuff for *challenging* content.  If you want any distinction between players to, "mean" anything, that's the only way to do it.  
---
No head-turning, attention-grabbing gear in any MMO I've ever played was acquired by logging on and ticking off a list of menial chores for, "x" amount of days.
---
Exactly my thoughts. That would be pretty terrible.
---
Winter jacket and jeans (not NW one) with camo bandana.. or Treasure Hunter outfit, Ghillie hat with Vault 94 mask for extra leafage.. 👍🏼
---
Assaultrons used to be a issue, but I've found running a bloodied .50cal melts them like nothing else, even the bastards in the silos. Just gotta nuke them before they fire their bullshit beam of balance ignorance
---
i started like a month ago, when i run into quest bugs i usually just give up and try again on another server.
---
I'm seeing today's challenge as a write off.
---
I use it on my stealth sniper and I absolutely love it. Now if they’d only let us wear outfits with it it’s be even better.
---
Dude. This might be what's happening to me..
---
So if you started from day 1 you need to do claim 4 rewards a day which is annoying since its 2 1/2 weeks long for the season right?
---
Hunter's Long Coat with beret, fez, bowler, or tophat. Neat and classy. Imho.
---
Have you tried herbavore with cranberry relish? The relish is +10xp base so if that doubles than it could be a good time
---
I mean, it has parts from each edge, like harpers ferry is the most eastern point, and huntingdon (camden park) is the most western point of the state, and are both in the game. Then the palace of the winding path is in the northern panhandle and welch is at the pretty close the most southern point and those are in the game as well
---
The season is 10-11 weeks long.
---
Should of made it so we can go to The Pitt
---
There are plenty of other ways to get junk than workshops.
---
Vampire gives no damage bonus, and low rate of fire makes them very meh. Silenced pipe revolver, bloodied, instigating, quad or AA, depending on your build and playstyle.
---
Mind blown. Every little thing about shotgun and its interactions this game is awesome
---
Sorry I wrote that wrong. I meant 2 1/2 months long
---
That one of problem with this "buggedfixed" pile of game. "It just works" good enough most of the time, so reproducing such errors is nearly impossible.
---
Same shit with the 5pcs of unyielding... Everything says it's enough for sneaking, except that one time the mobs see you and you need the chameleon piece and the perks.
---
Your fine bro dont sweat it.
---
i dunno why you got downvoted that’s obviously where the inspiration came from lmao
---
the potomac river is the state boundary between maryland and west virginia
---
I’m not the one who got so bent out of shape I came on Reddit to make a post about something that countless other people have complained about, because somehow you think your input is \*that\* much different or important than the everyone else who said the same thing.
---
They're not bad now!  Flows through quickly on most every public server.
---
I skip them too honestly but not because it's currently broken or laggy, just done them so many times and it saves me 10 minutes and some rad chems
---
Also pretty much run three in a row when I run them lol so that'd be a lot of cores
---
Yep, I went to one event and as soon as I got there, I got disconnected from the server. Second time today.
---
50+, The loot scales to your level and max gear does not drop till 50.
---
Tasty squirrel stew is the carbivore counterpart. And the ingredients are on path of my xp runs.
---
Scrip but I'm maxed out right now, so past couple days just selling them to npc vendors.
---
I can see. I see that quote still stands.
---
I do what I like, including making fun of brainless people who designed that thing, or people who gets all serious about "fIrInG tHe GuY" like you lmao.
---
Dude you need a doctor lmao.
---
Yeah I mean it's not like they're a constant problem, they're just the thing that can melt you instantly as bloodied especially if you're using a spool-up heavy weapon and they do that bullshit where they endlessly fire that fucknig head laser with no interruption. 
---
I also do it to myself, as it's become habit to swap out serendipity for super duper when crafting, and a lot of the time I'll forget to swap it back in... Though I feel I an't swap anything else for it otherwise I'll.... Forget. Hm.
---
you needa do 14k exp but there seems to be a glitch where the christmas and halloween receive exp differently. I got the 3.5k christmas drop and next game got the 7k halloween drop. Its definately not random tho
---
Workshops were designed for pvp, you get very little resources from them. Anything you can get from them there are far better means out in the world.
---
Yea I'm on xbox too and someone dropped 60 of them on my porch, I was pretty happy not gonna lie
---
People do thrill of the grill?
---
Is this just a guess?
---
I'd lecture you about playing an 18+ game... But I had gotten into this series well before I was 12.
---
I'm just happy you enjoy the game. Despite everything, it is still a really enjoyable game. It's also nice to see that Fallout still pulls in some of the younger crowd!
---
So you’re a sociopath
---
And I’m the one who needs a doctor?
---
So this is someone accurate. I just did a 2-week tour of West Virginia visiting different locations in real life that are also in game. And it's absolutely true that everything on the map is jumbled up compared to where it is in real life. However Bethesda did a great job of nailing a few of the locations.
---
If there's any interest I could put up some pictures so you can see a contrast to what it looks like for real.
---
Mothman too but great advice dude
---
I’m actually playing as a Beserker on one of my alts. Using the stealth suit and a beserkers explosive Fixer I do just enough damage to the queen to get the flux drop. I’m currently lvl 53 and am having a blast being in stealth and can 1 or 2 head shot most regular type mobs. Definitely a squeeze of lime to my mains heavy gunner
---
If only Bethesda could fix all the bugs in this game though...
---
I think the big difference to me is, in every other game the battle pass isnt the end game. Most of the Brs, have a gameplay loop of drop kill win or lose, there isnt an end game. The battle pass is there to make you look pretty, they dont need extra content you arent dropping in looking for lore. Fo76 doesnt have the kill die repeat aspect, its season pass is it's current end game. Forcing daily play just isnt an option for alot of players, also for the record the other games are much more forgiving.
---
I bought a crazy guy mask for 106 caps... ya never know what hems youll find.
---
Just got mine today.  Took a few hours non consecutive as I took a few days off.  For me all the other rewards unlocked in order.  Stopped after getting it so all that is left for me to unlock is the last Christmas reward but I am not dealing with that mode longer than I have to.
---
If you're on PS4, can I have your stuff? Just guns tho my stash is full of junk already.
---
Dota 2, to get all rewards you have to invest at least $100-$200. 100 if you play 5 hours every day, 200 if you play 5 hours a week.
---
PUBG you have to play at least 5 days a week for a total of 5-20 hours depending on how good you are at the game.
---
Gues ill try nuking the lake
---
Now that would be awesome!  Sounds like they'll be instanced if they're leaving Appalachia, definitely the content I'm most excited for.  
---
Love the new colossal problem event, it's instancing and extra-combat features have my hopes high for the future!
---
You should google what does that mean, you need a doctor for that shit IQ.
---
I scrip them, then offload any extras on to my mule for future scripping.
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever excess junk and chems I have acquired since the day before to make daily caps limit with vendors..
---
So technically by this map my base is in Pennsylvania. Nice.
---
Ugh... I blew it and didn’t do this yesterday. I have 0 NW intelligence, not my cup of tea
---
You mean as in there was no extra content?
---
Carts didn't have DLC. Neither did PC games games for a good long while. You bought paid expansions....
---
And it doesn't matter what it was like whenever in the past. Things change. The gaming industry changes. Deal with it. Or stop buying games?
---
&gt; a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior *and a lack of conscience*
---
Bolded for emphasis, it describes you. That’s what you sound like.
---
the marsupial serum is probably what youre after..
---
should be 300-500 caps at a player vendor
---
Submit a ticket to Bethesda, they’ll ask you to try a couple different things first that more than likely won’t work. Once you’ve done what they have ask you to try tell them it didn’t work. They’ll then unlink your account which will fix the friends list issue.
---
Good.
---
Lol I was not brave enough to risk my loot.
---
Great info.. I’ve never played in teams until this week so strange in numbers and herd mentality has never been in my radar
---
The marsupial serum. You can find them in player vendors for 250-500 caps. ☺️
---
I drop the stuff I cant scrip or sell for other players
---
I will have it on week 9 and only leveling my main 10 more times (using a sub level 10 i will reroll weekly)
---
Plant lots of tatos and mutfruit, harvest them with the green thumb perk equipped and then sell them all with hard bargain 3 to a robot vendor. Also collect purified water from every camp that's nice enough to not lock their water purifiers. Those items will sell for a decent amount of caps and the crops will regrow while you're playing the game normally. I made great money early in the game doing this.
---
They are Floaters.
---
They were originally introduced in Fallout 2, but they looked a bit different.  They were flatworms mutated by FEV, but their top-heavy mouths hovered off the ground.  The ones in 76 look more like jellyfish, but I believe they are supposed to represent the same creature.
---
yeah, let the kid have his fun.
---
&gt; Weapon: Anything auto and explosive is key.
---
I'd just like to add, if you can't procure the above (afterall, it takes the right legendary roll) then there's also a viable non-legendary alternative; an auto tesla.
---
A tesla rifle with an automatic barrel will tag every enemy in the vicinity, and you don't even have to aim it.
---
I like to pull it out during a SBQ fight when she spawns all her adds. While it doesn't do a massive amount of damage to them, when they do die you get crazy amounts of XP.
---
That's not a sociopath, don't mix up psychopaths and sociopaths, and I quote
---
 "Doctors don’t officially diagnose people as psychopaths or sociopaths. They use a different term instead: antisocial personality disorder."
---
So yeah, you can't even google, what a shit brain lmao.
---
Upvote for the Build Team! I’m playing my low level Alt as a beserker and am just raking it in
---
Selling Point and MAIN selling point are wildly different and you're just trying to back track. 
---
Multiplayer Fallout! &lt;--- Main Selling Point.
---
FREE DLC&lt;---- Main selling point. 
---
Some free premium currency? Minor perk at best. 
---
Why don't you just be out front? Why hide behind excuses. You want things free. You think you deserve it. If they left atom challenges and introduced a paid battle pass like all the other types of battle passes out there, you would have whined just as hard.
---
i usually just eat a nade in adventure to help people with this for tadpole
---
I’m in the U.S I should be able to get on in a couple hours once I get home
---
I have no friends.
---
You’re mischaracterizing ppl’s concerns. Ppl were upset that daily quests are auto completed and, before Beth said anything about bonus xp, the math showed that reaching the end was difficult. It’s great that you can grind for hours each day but most of us can’t.
---
Thanks for this!
---
yeah that's great, unless you have no friends...
---
Thanks I will try to find a vendor who sells it hopefully
---
Empath is worth getting as well. Unless you're bloodied. You take 8% more damage BUT your team takes 33% less.
---
Yeah, I'm someone who usually holds on to way too many items in games.  I briefly considered getting FO1st but...paying a monthly fee to horde items that I'm clearly not using (hence having so many of them).
---
Threw all that shit on the ground and the problem solved itself.  Realizing that most items in the game are either plentiful or useless made all the difference.  Honestly, the longer I played, the less appealing FO1st looked.
---
ok so i fixed, just uninstall the game and reinstall it
---
https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sociopath
---
What I quoted is literally the definition of a sociopath.  Trying to be coy with your response doesn’t change the definition of it.  Should I pull up other definitions of sociopath for you too?
---
You mentioned everything except scrip, which is probably the most important resource unwanted legendaries provide. Especially late-game where you have to buy legendary modules for crafting.
---
Yes, I know, but people still say the game is bad even after wastelanders.
---
Yes yes, I know, but the thing is, people still say its a shit game even after wastelanders.
---
Warframe has a catch up mechanic though.  You can basically jump on the last week and still get done with nightwave (battlepass).  The seasons also last 4 months or longer.   just saying
---
What if I just play the game and not care about a checklist?
---
Just want to add Bird Bones synergizes well with Marsupial.  Look at the serums on the wiki and check out ones you’d want because often you’ll find vendors who have all or most serums.  Make sure you have rank 2 starched genes first.  Then you’ll probably want Class Freak to reduce negative mutation debuffs.
---
What mods your weapon has effects ap use. Aligned is best for it but will lower your weapon's health. I normally go with an aligned barrel and forceful stock.
---
The max you can do is 110 per round. None of the perks or buffs matter once you hit 110.
---
Fort defiance has one I think
---
As mentioned above the train station bot vendors have a daily cap"buying" limit of 1400 caps. Bot vendors will buy basically anything but ammo and plans.
---
Under charisma start maxing out the perk Hard Bargain to get better prices when you sell or buy stuff from the vendors.
---
If you are able to complete this selling routine every day or 24 hours you can make 9800 caps a week alone without vending machine sales.
---
Many early players will sell water and guns they loot from NPC to make this daily limit.👍
---
Wait, is a New Vegas rework in the works (so to speak)?
---
now I know why they call youtubers influencers
---
In addition pick up every material you can and sell it in your vendor, players buy most of them at 3-4 cap per unit
---
I was talking more about the game in general, to show how all multiplayer games are built around slow daily progress, not just Nightwave.
---
No problem!
---
Only the daily challenges count, daily quests do not.
---
Not sure honestly, could’ve hit you with a karma syringer before he attacked.
---
Fan mod, looks good and the re recorded lines sound very natural
---
Yeah, but theres people still saying that the game is bad even after wastelanders, which seem like people who never played the game
---
Yea I love how warframe has it set up.  It helps me not get burned out.
---
LATELY?!
---
sure but there's still people shitting on the game.
---
I still need the challenge if you want to join me
---
ouch, that was a big spoiler. Still, got me hyped for it.
---
Yep. They’re bugged. Whenever I do events with the “!” In them though they seem to work but there has to be other people in the event or you don’t get credit. Hope this helps.
---
You'll probably get quite far because you'd unlock the majority just playing the game.
---
I’ve been playing since BETA and I’d still not call the game quite good yet. It’s enjoyable, and it’s not as bad, but wastelanders did not suddenly make the game good. The game improved, but it added 12 hours of content and then you’ve done everything except the time gated grind crap they love implementing. If you’re just starting out then this game will be pretty good. But once you’ve done everything, it gets insanely repetitive with little more to do than the same things you’ve done over and over and over
---
Most were duped. Some (very few, honestly) are still remaining legitimately.
---
Go to C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76
---
open Fallout76Prefs.ini with Notepad
---
find line iPresentInterval=1 and change it to iPresentInterval=0
---
if you don't have this line in your .ini file just add iPresentInterval=0 under \[Display\] section
---
save changes to the .ini file
---
Huh,that's not so bad! Thx! 😊
---
Ya we only do sleeping sliding ghouls now.
---
It's excellent for high health tanky builds. Throw and automatic receiver on it and you'll barely need stims again
---
This is so good to hear. Anyone on PS4 want to do this?
---
Got ya.  Np.
---
I did it once and questioned why anyone would ever do it as a repeatable after that.
---
Yeah well, might end up hating it sure, will wait for new content till then.
---
I focus on a water farm. I have 10 industrial water purifiers at my camp, so every time I clear it out I have 50 water (can get more if I sit there and clear them more often). 
---
On top  of that, I tend to have huge piles of Rad-X and RadAway, which I can sell for a ton
---
OK, feeling like a noob now but what’s the difference?
---
that sounds great, you might have to walk me through how we actually do that though!
---
Lmao, someone actually looks up on dictionary.com instead of looking for it on an actual, medical related site. 
---
You are like looking for donut recipes in a gun store, you need to be smarter than this, donut.
---
Thanks will look into it, all I really wanted was to jump high lol
---
Congrats. I’ve got them all EXCEPT for the Ultracite targeting HUD plan... anyone got an extra? I’ve got stuff to trade
---
&gt;Tbh if you can play an online/multiplayer game only once a week, better just stick to single player
---
Or have some self awareness that you aren't gonna unlock everything in a morpg if you can only play once a week, let alone a season pass scenario like legendary run, and that's really not the devs fault or yours. 100 lvl folks will have stuff 90s won't, 90 lvl folks will have stuff 80s won't. So on and so forth. If everyone got to 100, nobody would show off any of the stuff they got unless they just truly like how it looks. It would just be more of a "eh more junk" scenario. I play a boat load, still not sure if I'll hit 100, but I'll get as close as I possible can and get what I've earned. Not to say there isn't some balancing to be done but it's the first attempt at this for them so let's see.
---
Well not hearing it, just wanting more to do
---
Land with me somewhere remote -&gt; we build a platform there -&gt; someone jumps down and these other revives him -&gt; repeat. My ign is Suppengoof
---
Sought-after? Not so much. Damn handy to keep though. As already mentioned they're great for saving on stims.
---
There will never be a good fallout game again
---
It's incredible. I was a bit skeptical at first but now I see the proof. I'm high level and pulling 2-4 levels a day. That's unheard of for my level.
---
Marsupial is a game changer for sure.  Bird bones really added to it though for me.  Especially in power armor I don’t do the ground slam as often.
---
agree with wat was said.  I literally gave shitton of bulk junk without even using extractors, all I did was loot, hoard and scrapped everything.
---
Yes very good and much cheaper ammo wise. matter of fact I think I'll start rolling with this as a secondary for this reason. Thank you
---
I’m not so sure about that... the new screaming eagle skin is pretty janky.
---
The tab button is slow / laggy.  Hitting enter a bunch of times is slow and laggy.  I appreciate that you want to try and help, but the back button is still too slow for the amount of ammo I need to convert.  This implementation should have NEVER been released this way and is endemic of a systematic problem with how Bethesda designs things.    Some of the people involved in the design process are utterly clueless and shouldn't be in charge of a weed whacker yet alone be involved in any kind of design / creation process.
---
Having to do ammo conversion in small batches is stupid and punishes the user for wanting to convert one type of ammo to another.  Just give me a f-ing conversion rate, let me select all the ammo to convert, and f-ing take it.   If I have 10 kinds of ammo that I don't use, that should be 10 conversions to the "points" and I should be done with that step.
---
When I have all the points I can possibly make from all the ammo I can possibly convert, then I should be able to make as much of my favorite type(s) of ammo as I want until I run out of points and I shouldn't have to do it in tiny f-ing batches.  If there is a max limit one the amount of an ammo type I can make this way once I have a large number of rounds on my character, so be it.  Some limitation is fine, but it needs to not interrupt the flow of making.  I should be able to convert all the ammo I want to covert in less than a minute or two.  Anything more than that is absolute and utter garbage programming on Bethesda's part.
---
alright thanks! i'm thatvalindor, i sent a request
---
Im rocking a dual bar flaming chainsaw and it shreds ghouls. I found this thing lvl 15 and im rocking it ever since.. lvl 60 now. I wont do chunks of dmg on SBQ but enough to get loot from it.
---
shhhhhhhhh
---
I’ve pulled 3 perfectly preserved pies from the machine in the last ~10 days. Once each at the purveyor, Capitol building, and pleasant valley. 
---
I would trade in that luck any day for a decent fixer/handmade drop.
---
that'll be 500 atoms please
---
Aight I think we have to form a team in adventure first and then I get us into nw
---
I assume you're fine with it because Point Lookout?
---
That's completely on the other side of the state.
---
find a sub 50 char and dump them on them.    
---
   
---
always capped at scrip blender - it wont even take 4 level 3 weps each day - which annoys the everliving fuck out of me.
---
🤦‍♂️ don’t worry bro I agree with ya.
---
&gt;There HAS to be something for people who actually invest time or money in a game. Someone who is dedicated to a game or supports it with money should get better shit than people who don't.
---
I agree, but with the current system someone who plays 1hr per day is rewarded more (or at least more easily and less boringly) than someone who plays 10hrs in 1 day even though the later invested more time.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I apologize for just getting back to you. I was playing on reddit at work and things ended up picking back up. Totally forgot to reply. 
---
Since your allready using an existing character. I would say you could either do like graham and be all over the map each day or find a general location and offer different services. 
---
Lower level areas would benefit greatly from a roleplaying ammo/weapon smith. offer weapons crafting for cheap. Low levels would really benefit from offering weapons for cheap. Even repairs would be great. Iv been in the process of starting a melee build and the early levels its been a pain. Weapons constantly break. Most low levels won’t have weapon perks until around 10-15.  .38, 308, 10mm and shotgun shells would be great for selling/ giving away because you can just go to places like morgantown airport and beat up on scorched until you have enough to sell. 
---
If your serious about roleplaying an ammo/ weaponsmith. Are you missing any weapons plans? If your on PC i might be willing to drop off some for you free of charge if i have what your looking for. Currently in the process of cleaning out my stashbox and have duplicates of some.  I like seeing stuff like this happen.
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
nuke the wayward, the impossible achievement, since it's in the no-nuke zone
---
Hope it fixes the problem! It's so annoying
---
No. Definitely not. It’s all probably in your head. You should probably just go ahead and delete this.
---
What is your strength lvl? I have the excact same thing but with 2dmg and 12 energy per tick.. ?
---
Weird, I dont seem to have this problem, and I don't have fo1st, however I do try to get on for about 2 hours a day
---
I’m critical of the game, because I want it to get better. I care about fallout. Sucking it off won’t help it get any better. It was a main selling point. They made it very clear that they would give a fair amount of atoms. 2000 from now until September is such a little amount, that it’s almost false advertising. And the repair kits and scrap kits are harder to get, which makes it even more pay to win. It’s not that I think I deserve it, it’s that when I bought their product, they promised that the atomic shop was going to be strictly cosmetic (they changed that) and that there would be plenty of free atoms. Both of those are now lies and we aren’t even 2 years after release. They over promised and under delivered. If you can’t accept that, then you have been brainwashed. It’s our responsibility as consumers, to the businesses know what we want. If you truly want fallout to prosper, you need to give constructive criticism, not overlook the issues.

Think of the season from the perspective of someone that plays twice a week.  Under other games that have this kind of progression, you can get REALLY far playing twice a week completing challenges.   A season progression should not be designed around daily players.  It should be achievable by about anyone that plays regularly enough to be considered a regular player.   Players that play less than that should still be able to get pretty far even if they can't make it to the end.
---
Other games that have seasonality have bonus XP events, bonus challenges, and all kinds of stuff to help make the season more accessible for players that don't play every single day.   Bethesda approaches much of their design completely ass-backwards and ignorant of how their approach impacts players and acts all surprised when they get tons of blowback for their half-baked and half-assed implementations.   Heck, after this update I spent an hour last night insta-crashing trying to join different servers, updated my graphics driver, and trying all kinds of things.  When I finally joined a private server all of a sudden my client stopped crashing.  I had all kinds of reboots and other troubleshooting steps in there, but it wasn't until I joined a private session I could get around their instant crash on login last night.   This is the kind of garbage programming that is pervasive throughout the game far too often.
---
That bonding display is just a little odd in that it LOOKS like you're a "third wheel" (actually 4th? Lol) because the bonding bars, once they have the knot symbol on them, are only on the OTHER team mates. What it really means is YOU are bonded with each of the ones that have "tied the knot" so to speak. You can see when someone new joins that their bar takes time to grow, then you go to a higher level of bonding bonus.
---
There is no specific questline, as everyone will be totally different anyway. I'm level 262 now, so I wouldn't be impressed if the purpose of a team was to do some quest that I did over a year ago. Everyone at different levels. What is useful though is that if you start off doing Events and create or join a team to get bonus xp on events (Events type) then end up Legendary hunting later, just join a different team (Hunting) or if it's your public team you can change the "purpose" to Hunting.
---
Sent you a message 👌
---
Devs never played past level 20 what do you expect
---
Well, it's a lazy reskin, so you get what you pay for. I might've considered buying it if it had new animations.
---
If anyone is Xbox One I could use a friend to help me revive 👍
---
Free States Revolutionary is my personal favorite, followed by the NCR Ranger, Mountaneer Scout, and the new Flyboy set.
---
One is listed under challenges and the other is inside your pipboy
---
Ahh. So you’ve learned the way of the whoosh wookie. A favorite strategy of mine.
---
Daily challenges are the ones on the map menu that aqard score. Daily quests are the ones from your pip-boy menu.
---
Which state was in the pit?
---
ITT: OP is anti-social and wants the *multiplayer* game to cater more to his need for single player content. 
---
Somebody get Tood Howard in here to get this person the single-player content they so obviosuly deserve. Us other players are irrelevant.
---
Yep but we need to flood the game with Empath that way everyone will have it and we all get the positive buff and not the negative! It just works!
---
Thanks - I’ve just been going by the Data Tab in the PIP boy.
---
If you're on XBox add me and join a team. I'll come along and help on quests from time to time. Depends what I'm currently doing of course but often not doing anything special. XBox GT: TheNutrixx
---
I have it on there but mine is 2dmg and 12 energy per tick. Might the bug be the problem than?
---
To play off this Ghouls are chem freaks and they drop a ton.  Use Grape Mentats plus you Charisma selling perk cards when you have a bunch of items to sell.  The water above is 5 with just those buffs and I only run 5, but often have 100-200 at a time.  That is the 500-1000caps.  The rest as above is grenades you looted, chems.  If I am running short I always loot plastic and then bulk for easy added selling of junk.  I don’t bother to Vendor and pretty much every night I am loaded for the next day, I sell when I get home from work, and as I am doing events, refill.  Purified Water though is the backbone though!
---
The parachute drop bag in the atomic shop glitches in the ground.  You can barely see it.  So no they don't test atomic shop stuff either.  Lol
---
Make a scrip mule if you haven't already, definitely helps
---
OK that didn't work, let me figure out how to join nw as a team or do you know how to?
---
They won't do it. Despite having the money, developers etc. They're plans for 76 are a shitshow and its a damn shame. Why the hell aren't they following Zenimaxs ESO content.
---
Yep! You should be able to track them so they show up when you hit the map button as well
---
The Pitt is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
---
Riding shotgun event.

---
i have no idea :/
---
Some events have guaranteed or nearly guaranteed legendary spawns. Riding Shotgun, Uranium Fever, usually AWOL Armaments, if you're low level Leader of the Pack or Campfire Tales.
---
So we could get a swamp dlc filled with broken arrow incidents
---
That's me, this game makes me wish i had gone down the route of creating games because of what it could be. So much potential but seems like we won't ever see a fraction of it.
---
I hope another studio catches wind of the potential and tries to create it's own version of F76.
---
You aren't funny
---
Thank you
---
Whitesprings tends to have a better chance of them spawning. 
---
During the Sons of Dane event where you gotta make the noise, I think there are 3 legendaries that pop up.
---
And the Mole Miner event where you defend the uranium extractors has one pop up at the end.
---
Maybe choose at least 3 or 4 ammo types so u dont get ammo that u dont need but u still cant farm events for ammo. I agree with u about the weapons and armor tho no one wants them if they are just completely and utterly useless we should at least get some scrip out of them. Low lvl 1* armor and weapons would be just fine in my opinion, nothing much, but its still free scrip after almost every event so completing events would be a lot more worth it. Also these low lvl 1* gear i just mentioned should be moved to stash immediately after the event is completed since they tend to weight a lot
---
I just gave it away but I’d be happy to make you a new set. (:
---
Leader of the pack event up top left always has 3. Easy. If not, AWOL armaments, project paradise, uranium fever.... They're everywhere randomly in mob areas too, whitesprings, there's usually a cave cricket legendary at tanagra town.....
---
K we have to be in the main menu and then join each others team
---
For some people it's more fun to play hide and seek over a mode that's like 5% skill and 95% luck as with most BR games.
---
They are planning some expansions in the form of expeditions according to data mining and if that goes well they'll likely go onto bigger things.
---
Thanks - much appreciated!
---
It’s not only cosmetic, they sell scrap kits and repair kits.
---
Ahh, can't help you then.
---
I'm so lucky I died doing SBQ and all my junk dropped including 21 assorted flux 312 bulk lead 240 bulk plastic and someone looted it all before i got back
---
Do we know mainland Marylands environment? I imagine fog crawlers spawn in the sea, so getting to the mainland might not be too hard. 
---
Could even be they first evolved in the mire and traveled to far harbour.
---
&gt; Some events have guaranteed or nearly guaranteed legendary spawns. Riding Shotgun, Uranium Fever, usually AWOL Armaments, if you're low level Leader of the Pack or Campfire Tales.
---
Horde events as well, the leader of the horde will always be legendary.
---
After canceling my month to month subscription during the initial Fasnacht fiasco, I finally bit the bullet and paid for a year. Saved $56, yay me! It was too hard to play w/o the ability to store junk.
---
I mean....... if people spend their time whining about it on Reddit they won't get their S.C.O.R.E. up anyway.
---
Is it possible to change it in the fallout76pref.ini file? I thought I seen something that had to do with R/G/B for pipboy or the hud.
---
Ok perfect, I am lvl 97 so i can handle any area...I have always been nervous about project paradise, i have been told its very hard..lol and I do not know how to start the riding shotgun, the one time I went to the spot i googled...there was noting there...thanx all for the help
---
A lot of good comments, but Also, in your camp, at the tinkerer's bench, convert stuff to Bulk packages, and sell stacks of the unwanted bulk stuff to vendors for some nice caps (with hard bargain perk). 
---
Also, the extra health stuff, like a ton of Diluted Rad-X that's never used, sells decent. 
---
Figure out what ammo you don't use, and vendor that as well in your camp. (or convert it to an ammo that sells in bulk).
---
And the third link already told you you are wrong lmao, I read that like a century ago.
---
Idk, if it means I can call you stupid legit, I am fine with being one, since they are always smarter, better be crazy than stupid.
---
Ahh, would have appreciated it aswell! Thanks anyway.
---
We’re here for you brother!
---
You need a repair kit even at a workbench
---
Join public teams and ask if anyone has a mic, if not and you want a team with mics rinse and repeat. Usually they’re friendly people
---
It's like someone slipped you some Nukashine.
---
Apex Legends
---
Um... no you do not. You can repair with scrap. 
---
How long have you been playing?
---
thanks for that, i appreciate it!
---
no, i need those non legendary sturdy left leathers arms
---
I'd do it if it was close by to another quest like the vac tubes are at the water park. I wouldn't go out my way to do it.
---
Thanks you!
---
I'd do it for free.
---
Still need? i have yet to do it &amp; wanted to get it out of the way.
---
I'm enjoying it a lot, but I still see noone really wanting to do Project Paradice when it pops sadly.
---
Should i stop playing a game i love to protest?
---
Had 4 challenges complete when I logged in today. The funny thing is the complete 5 challenges daily was one already complete. How is that possible?
---
The plan let's you get fixer drops from the purveyor
---
Do you have an ETA on this fix?
---
Yes, the quests progress for one although you can "help" your teammate with the killings and that.
---
By having the fixer plan it has now entered the POOL!
---
It's the VATS that I don't enjoy. Either remove that from PVP or I'm rocking my SB all day.
---
I was logged in too and mine were fine, but my husband's got messed up. I've been logged in before when they reset and not had this issue.
---
So, time to stop buying modules and spend the script on 3* ranged weapons. Got it, thanks.
---
so it was okay for about an hour and then laggy severs, no blue screen just game stopping and then re signing in.  this was one of the worst days for me to play.  Hopefully what ever is going on will be cleared p soon.  Also on the east cost
---
was camp hopping, looking for plans and whatnot, as i approached the vendor machine, I was suddenly exploded, lit on fire, the launched sideways out of the camp, off a hillside, and landed in a fissure. 
---
said Camp was near that pumpkin house, be warned
---
soon
---
Which vendor sells this? Had no idea you could just buy the plan.
---
It was a player vendor.
---
This makes a ton of sense.  I wish more people understood.    People that play more often should be rewarded more.    Reaching level 100 should be reserved for those that put in the time.  If you don't make it, what are you missing out on?  Some skins?  Caps?  It's not the end of the world.
---
Sure, I messaged you my PSN
---
Ive noticed I get more problems where it’s really warm here
---
Which really shouldn't be done until we're reaching the end date so you can confirm you won't be able to grind it all. Also, later ranks needs more SCORE, so you'll get more value out of your atoms
---
I have a insane amount of junk and flux in my scrap box but I genuinely don’t care if I lose all of that at this point. I love this game I really do but when people are making money off people ESPECIALLY with this virus happening it means people have limited funds as it is. It’s not right.
---
Are you on PC?
---
If you want to participate in player vending take over a workshop with a level 3 safe (like the red rocket one in the north) and use the spike trap glitch to keep respawning it's contents. You'll get a lot of scrap to bulk and plans that you can sell for 200-400+ if you want to move them fast, plus you'll learn a lot of mods for weapons and armor scrapping the contents. You could also do this with an unmarked locations safe where you can build your camo but you'd have to find one.
---
Take over Tyler County Dirt Track and put collectors on the 3 silver deposits then go about whatever other business you have in the game. the collectors will generate about 60 silver per hour. 1 silver sells for 1 cap. print that money!
---
Are you complaining about it? If not, then why post this?
---
So it wont increase difficulty just make it easier for lower levels. Al least it will scale the weapons!
---
I've been in a depression slump too. For some reason, the public teams have made me feel a lot better. It's a good escape sometimes and the public teams and events and working together has kind of helped me through this slump. 
---
Thanks for sharing your story. You're not alone out here. Stay fighting the good fight!
---
Yeah, and with all the exp buffs (25% Cranberry Relish/Herbivore and Lunch Boxes), it ranks up crazy fast
---
In the nearly 2 years I've been playing, I've never had the need to use an extractor. I can not see the the absolute need to "claim" one, let alone 2 or more.
---
Yeah today I just got a bloodied 50 cal so I’m bloodied heavy gunner build now and it is pretty decent
---
My bad, after looking through my inventories... I have 8 explsovie railways, 3 Tse, non however are or do have 25% ffr.  One could see how I could get easily confused with my train collection.
---
I keep forgetting to use my lunchboxes.
---
The opportunity to purchase ranks for 150 atoms starts July 14 if I’m not mistaken. Bethesda gave us a 2 week head start against the rich folks.
---
Buy the ranks in the final days of the season. You might unlock serveral yourself without even trying to. Later levels are harder to grind.
---
Once I get my toddler to sleep I can hop on.

Perfect. Thanks. I’m under GottenMink74372 :)

This, I've never understood why people get so uptight over kids playing m rated games or r rated movies. It's not a big deal, I grew up on horror films and GTA. I turned out just fine. As long as the kid can understand the difference between reality and fantasy it's all good.
---
I appreciate all the downvotes nice to see how toxic the community I once loved has become 👍
---
Np, I’ll send you a message with my GT, I’ll message again when I get on.
---
I wish we could play a ghoul!
---
If I end up with a decent legendary eventually it certainly will be.
---
I have a vampire gatling plasma which I love to tank SBQ and sheepsquatch and imposter sheepsquatch. Just some time I can really burn through the ammo.
---
Honestly, I don't like that the workshop map icons has the exact same design as all the other map markers, makes it impossible to quickly and easily spot workshops locations.
---
Thanks. Much appreciated :)
---
Is it still there after patch 20? I haven’t seen it since it dropped.
---
There is a friendly wandering ghoul merchant, but that just a trade window interaction
---
Eugenie, the ghoul trader during riding shotgun also mentions a hidden compound of friendly ghouls, I'm hoping we get to see it at some point
---
That would be even better! It would only make sense , considering Skyrim &amp; ESO allow you to play as several different Races
---
More recent games include animal crossing and Fortnite. Both have a daily list of things you can do. Games in general are likely to push players to this style of gaming as they want to increase engagement in an increasingly competitive gaming world. There's a connection between how many eyes are in a game per day and sales. May not be the reality we want. It's the one we have.
---
Don't say that out loud. We need Bethesda to be making a new engine from the ground up, not reusing Fallout 4s which is just polished Fallout 3 engine.
---
Only the team leader can progress quests is certain instances such as interior cells (I think that’s what they’re called). If you try to go in the wayward on a team you can go solo or help the team leader. If helping the team leader you cannot do anything to progress the quest for yourself. 
---
In short: just go in solo :)
---
Oh, sorry. Could have helped. If you know anyone to play with send them a team invite and then go to NW,  no fill on - it’ll just be the two of you in a team.
---
Spawn at the Pub by Mama Dolce’s - theres usually between 2-4 stimpacks there; check the two (vending!) machines in the entrance, and the toilet mirror, as well as the aid kit under the counter.
---
Have the other player jump off the very top roof of Mama Dolce and hide in the bush by the tree while they do. When they land they’ll need reviving. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Just did it and took 20 mins (2 games as someone came along and killed us just as we swapped).
---
Really sorry for your loss, it's one of those things that you never get over, it just get easier to cope with.    I've known that feeling all too well, and at one point almost more than I was capable of coping with.  In 2012 My 14 yr old daughter was killed by this 21 yr old, completely drunk out of his mind, driving and texting p.o.s. who, because of that, veered over 10 feet off the road and hit my daughter. 6 months later I lost my grandmother, and then my father 6 months after that.   I will say that video games really helped when I needed to put my mind elsewhere.  Its tough, but it just takes time and you'll get through it
---
Shanendoah River
---
Well it's kind of featured in FO3. So we do know the environment at least 200 years later.
---
Go to the Frat  house behind the University mate, there's always one on the skeleton of a dead student.
---
You can stop sharing our secrets. Thank you.
---
That would be awesome to eventually add some sort of QuestLine or Event , kind of expanding on that
---
I'm gonna need some more info on that glitch
---
I believe Bethesda is already aware of this. I saw a community manager comment on it.
---
Fallout 4 mood? I'll look for it.
---
Ah, the pool. Guess I need to take a few hundred dives in the pool and see what I can drudge up from the bottom.
---
I sure hope so not kool losing this many points every day.
---
Also, three controllers glitching out...just spinning cant be an issue with the controllers
---
All the side quests? Pioneer scouts, mistress of mysteries, all the sheepsquatch stuff?
---
Unless they have a critical failure with their current engine they will be sticking with it. The company has used it since morrowind and making a whole new engine would take so many more years, plus having people become familiar will make it even worse.
---
The creation engine has its pros and its cons like any other game engine.
---
I really hope they do :)
---
There was a colony of friendly ghouls living in the Valley Galleria on the border of more/cranberry bog, but the brotherhood wiped them out, maybe there were survivors who started another colony and will hate the brotherhood
---
I may have out too much thought into this lmao
---
Agreed, it's harder to spot them when you need one.
---
There is a JuiceHead video on YouTube that goes over the mod.
---
How is using a SB "low" VATS is rediculessness in a PVP setting. It's pay to win like that, as FFr will win because of damage cap. Take out the VATS and I would go toe to toe in PVP without a SB.
---
Bush / diver
---
Roadtripper Blouse outfit. It looks great on my character.
---
Each season it is implied by the notes Bethesda released that you have to wait one week from theb pass release  to buy ranke.
---
yea looks like you got some shit luck but get into your hobbies and I think you can feel better. sorry for your loss.
---
This quest is so lame I can’t be bothered.
---
Maybe it only happens for some people?
---
exactly. 1 run through Lucky Hole Mine in the excavator PA can net around 600 Lead plus you get XP for smelting it.  way better than workshops.
---
The problem is that i dont know anyone who plays fo76
---
Two weeks
---
This! Arguably the best power armor, that I had to grind for, and the light sucks.
---
If you’re on PC I can help you..
---
Penny Hornwright is a friendly ghoul. And there are a few living in Crater and Foundation, though you can't interact with them beyond clicking on them to hear a line of generic chatter. It'd be great to have an actual settlement of them somewhere.
---
Tbh, I’m worried about finishing my weekly challenges before 2x weekend.
---
But yeah, if this sub could calm the f down, that would be great.
---
Bethesda have said that actual events do not give score.  Only the challenges that tell you to do events.
---
thanks!
---
Well, items with low drop rate looks impressive but is still the result of a grind.
---
try the ghouls in the burrows
---
The pool never gave me a fixer ... buyed a junkie  from someonefor 3k .
---
Take a moment to thank our hated stash limit for that. We would all most likely hoard if it was an option. Still helping newbies, but hoarding to an intervention needed level.
---
Too hard for them to implement :/
---
Yeah I don't have the money right now now for it but once I do I'm thinking about it. At first I was adamant on not giving them my money. I refuse to to spend real money on in game purchases when I already gave them my money for the game itself. 
---
But I just don't have room for anything and I'm so tired of constantly being at 785/800 and spending a ridiculous amount of time sorting through and organizing everything deciding if I really need it. I have my own apartment to organize and clean and sort through every day why do I have to do it when I sit down to relax with a video game?
---
Me too. Would like to know what Bethesda plans to do about this, this SCORE thing isnt easy to go all the way to begin with, let alone with getting our points stolen with bugs like this!
---
I got 1st and didnt renew because even the scrapbox wasnt worth it. Just prioritize what materials you actually keep and you'll be fine. In other words, you dont need 300 steel.
---
I’m sorry but what does the virus have to do with anything? If someone is strapped for cash, I assume they aren’t going on eBay buying weapons. 
---
If someone else is breaking TOS, I really don’t see how that impacts you. Report them and move on.
---
Sun Fasnacht Mask
---
I personally like the mountains to the East of Whitesprings, there's a small lake across the road from Middle Mountain Cabins that rarely spawns more than the occasional molerat or feral. Features include an NPC with a tent on the shore that'll share different recipes, a rare Nuka flavor in the tent itself, and the occasional Nukashine victim appearing in the lawn chair on the opposite bank.
---
I'd like to add that if it wasn't for my second Bethesda account on pc it would be even harder. When the mole miner treasure hunt came out, the caps needed to make these pales were insane. Having alts with max caps allowed me to burn through them. Having a cap on caps means you cap a players potential when such an event comes out. 
---
My alts having tons of crap legendary makes scripping less of a grind. I don't hunt legendary I just store them. I have months of scrip stored.
---
So 1st and alts increase my efficiency immensely.
---
You can get SOME atoms from the path of prizes, it's significantly reduced from what you could get before, but you can get some.
---
I've found loads of great spots West of 76.
---
Or up near the lumber Mill. Best bit of not having enemy spawn is no need for defence turrets. Which save a good chunk of budget.
---
Yea i am on pc it will be perfect if you help BUT only if u have time available
---
Please do
---
People are addicted to this game don’t act like they aren’t. Lol
---
Don't you worry, you'll be ok!
---
When I first got it, I hated the light. When I looked up if I can change it, turns out Bethesda didn't add the different light mods for the PA. Honestly, why put in a different &amp; the best PA in the game &amp; not have headlamps for it?
---
No it replaced the atoms, but throughout the score board you'll gain them here and there . You can still do character, overworld, and other challenges for atoms.
---
If someone chooses to spend real money on something like that then they are probably the kind of people who can afford to spend money on something like that. 
---
just chill out. It's gonna happen. Whether it's duped or not duped.
---
You can’t craft legendaries but now have the ability to get legendary fixers as rewards, particularly from the purveyor.
---
That's handy to see!
---
Plus they could fix the bug where the Powered Speaker's Pitch reset when you log off.  
---
Then i could finally turn on my Jazz Machine that lets users plays Giant Steps in my Camp.
---
Save them til double XP! Double XP, lunchbox and events team, you'll smash through the XP challenges.
---
Most of us learned that way. It is technically a PVP area. I remember claiming Hemlock Holes seeing this guy walk up. I wave he waves, he walks up to my face pulls out a gun.... and now I crouch in Workshops.
---
Can someone explain this. Must've missed it. Know the suit, seen it, but what is the scenario here to getting into a position to unlock ?
---
“You get what you pay for” 
---
Funny how that works, I didn’t pay anything for the fully customizable &amp; animated RU556 &amp; M16 mod packs in Fallout 4.
---
Despite the lazy reskin, I still prefer it over the original handmade. Got tired of staring at the same old AK plus, it’s nice to see a variant of the Service Rifle make an appearance!
---
ur right my bad
---
Just curious, did you just focus on just the main quests (Foundation/Crater, the Overseer), or did you try to hit the side quests as well? 
---
With just the mains, it should take around 50 hours or so (like 30 for the original, another 20 or so for Wastelanders), but if you get into the side stuff, there's easily another 60+ hrs there.
---
I guess if you muscle through, it can be done faster, but for me at least, part of the fun is taking it slow, exploring, finding the environmental storytelling Beth is best at.
---
That's pretty much the jist of it. I've been doing everything I can think of to distract my mind. It helps.
---
"respect the grind"
---
what a fuckin joke lmao
---
Yeah sure, but I can only do it in about 20 mins or so.. in the meantime send me a FR - beakerson. I’ll add you to a team and start a NW session. You spawn at the Portside Pub, run in and grab some stimpacks. I’ll spawn at Mama Dolce and go to the roof. There’s a tree on the left side of the building, I’ll jump down there. 
---
If other people spawn there we may have to leave the game and join a new one.
---
Vanguard will give you diminishing returns, because you will sustain damage, thus lowering your DR / ER....you’re better off with damage reduction types.
---
I run a full zealot set when fighting the Queen and it’s like she’s tickling me.
---
Basically only get atoms from other challenges and not weekly or daily challenges anymore. Like learning recipes or killing certain enemies with certain weapons etc. Or buying them with your money now
---
It’s more of the fact that legitimately people scam people out of the money most of the time.
---
Same. I miss my crappy pistols.
---
My Vampire Gauss Minigun allows me to solo Encryptid.
---
Imagine if we still had a limit of 400
---
The Fixer still outclasses the majority of legendary combat rifles simply for the inherit increased damage %.  So I wouldn’t sleep on it.  DPS wise I use it more than my hunting rifle
---
Didn't have aqua boy but was being sneaky and obnoxious two days ago for the NW daily, spent some time in the water before emerging on land and evolving into "I am literally just standing behind this rock how are you not seeing me" until the timer was just about out. Then popped out for the team of four and flashed a heart emote as I was engulfed in the flame I deserved to die in.
---
Today's means I have to play it. I found out I...actually kinda like NW, so this will be something.
---
Thanks man.
---
Photomode in NW is even easier, Take all the photos in the lobby
---
I have to remind myself of that sometimes. Thank you for reminding me.
---
Oh just wait till the issues remain till the final end with little response from Bethesda.  
---
The shitstorm will be epic. 
---
\*gets popcorn\*
---
I'm sorry this crap is happening. It used to happen a lot when dailies were for atoms. Now the dailies/weeklies are needed immensely and this is happening. As stated the community manager made mention to this. Hopefully it's fixed and there's something given as compensation to those affected.
---
Also, don't give up! Don't let this slow you down. There's double XP and double score coming up soon. I know many here would disagree and probably downvote for this comment alone but I don't believe bethesda wants us to fail this. If this doesn't work less people playing means less money. This issue and the ammo converter trash system should be fixed to rescue the validity of this event.
---
Two objects that have no influence on the game what do ever. Repair kits are awarded when beating sbq
---
Np, see you online in about 20mins
---
But I wanted to go to the Toshy Station for some Power Converters!
---
Between 76 and Monster Hunter RNGesus is usually pretty kind to me. I got the Croc Backpack on my 8th treasure hunter and can easily craft any MH weapon or armor with my plethora of parts. The pool will give.
---
Yeah sometimes a slow, soul sucking grind in a huge sandbox is a wonderful medicine to escape the pain of real life.
---
It sucks the evil right out.
---
Thx for the 411 bud
---
Get the egg head mutation, boosts intelligence by 6 points and then if you get strange in numbers it’s boosted even higher. I rock egg head plus 4 pieces of unyielding armor so my intelligence is ridiculous, also the canned meat stew from the feed the people event and a maxed out inspirational perk I level up like 5 times a day at least
---
They do have influence
---
We're Xbox right now but thank you for offering. I love "double dating" in the sense that we all stand shoulder to shoulder and tear down a SBQ or two. I hope you're feeling better as well. This isn't something I'd wish on even my worst enemies.
---
Did you scroll all the way through your notes?
---
Is anyone available to do this on Xbox in like 6 hours? Kid is about to wake up from a nap so can’t play again until he goes down for bed haha
---
Without FO1st (and you don't need it) you become very good at being picky about what junk you snag. Screws, adhesive, acid, and steal are my most used items. Remember to break down junk before to put in you box. At level 343, some items slip buy not broken down (when not using my scrap box) I would suggest looking through and double checking.
---
I sure did.
---
A dirty one that plays jazzish static thats mostly static and no jazz
---
It's pretty much all you can do, y'know? Thank you.
---
As someone who is taking a break from the game, how do you even spend atoms to get rank?
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure Grafton and Morgantown should be switched etc but whatever lol
---
Thank you. I have my fair share of grumps too, but it's always the community that really keeps me glued.
---
I started playing a week after wastelanders so I don't even know what a raid is but I sure would like to know! I agree with you
---
I would already have two of them. Just need to get lvl 3 in nw if i havent already
---
People are idiots.
---
150 atoms a rank. Expensive.
---
She's been a solid rock through all of this, seriously. I wouldn't even be able to keep a level head without her. We'll be 10 years along next month. Thank you.
---
I have heard of that happening, I think it happened with one of my secret service plans, but I might have missed it because it was randomly there at a later time
---
If you sort by weight or value plans go to the top section of the notes list
---
People are murdering them more. They definitely still spawn a lot.
---
I just know I did it, it gave me credit for completion but no score.
---
You are on Xbox?  Feel free to send an Xbox message to GuardianAngelGG on Xbox.  That is my gamertag.  I know the recipe.  I mainly make them to max the vendor caps daily (it only takes three to do that).  I will log in and make a couple of serums for you, if you happen to be on soon (no charge, or anything).  If you won't be on soon, then we can figure out a time to meet up.  I mainly play solo on the private servers, but I come onto  the public servers sometimes, to gift excess stuff to newbies, sell things from my vendors, etc.  You may have to help me with figuring out how to meet each other on the same server, because I have only done that once or twice before, and it is a bit confusing.
---
Thanks. Did not know that.
---
Thank you. It's the little thinks that keep us afloat sometimes.
---
That is my go to gun. It'll clear rooms in seconds with Gun Fu and Grim Reaper's Sprint.
---
1st is P2W. I know because I am winning 76 right now.
---
That might explain why I saw someone launch a nuke out of the playable zone lol. 
---
Sucks man....
---
are you just now discovering what RMT is? is been around for ages. this isnt a competitive game so it doesnt really have much effect on people.
---
I'm sorry for your loss as well. It's tough. I'm glad to hear that good times are on the horizon.
---
Did you get the score at 3/5? That’s what has been happening. You may not even have noticed.
---
For real. It must have just been killing them to just enjoy this in the privacy of their own home.
---
Yes he’s very buggy for me. Sometimes no matter how long I wait I can’t trade
---
Bethesda: "You can just buy atoms!"
---
(angry noises)
---
Bethesda: "Fine fine, we'll just put it on the legendary run, but mess with dailies, so you have to log out and back in, helping us have a higher Daily Active User to show for it!"
---
(confused screaming)
---
I searched a good few times already because being out 2500 caps kinda sucks. Bugthesda strikes again.
---
The Purveyor's music has a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ambiance, at least for me.
---
For my first nuke I waited until the circle was small, the nuke circle was twice as big, and then launched and immediately ran into the firewall spamming stims. Ended up killing 12 people and winning the match.
---
It’s a soft cuddly creature that helps you....it’s a beast that will mess you up if you don’t respect it
---
I use vampires Gatling plasma and Gatling gun, I can stand in front of damn near anything and just fire to my hearts content. Only thing that hurts me is those Mr gutsys with the machine gun, tears right through me
---
How do you come to that conclusion? Many things that are outside of the map are actually in West Virginia
---
They could be it. All those level 300 bloodied builds one shotting them. Lol.
---
I just remember the difference in xp gain when I’m solo vs in a team
---
I'm sorry for your loss as well. Normally I use games and such to escape from the stress but you're right. It's just not been possible lately. I hadn't really touched my Xbox much since.
---
PvP in this game is atrocious. The only way to make it fair and skill based would be to remove VATS, all legendary effects, mutations, and perk cards. Unfortunately that'll never happen so PvP will never be fun nor fair.
---
Kind of look like crayfish to me. Giant, ill tempered lethal crayfish
---
I am sorry for you, you have gone through much more pain then me I really hope things do get better for you. I will pray things will get better for you. Again I am sorry.
---
Definitely does, are you on Xbox? 1/3 chance lol but I have a mule with a tonne of plans so I can see if i have it when I get on, if I do it's yours

Characteristics

Biology
---
Fog crawlers are large, mutated crustaceans, which were created as a result of the explosion of the Vault 94 G.E.C.K.. This explosion coated the area that would become The Mire with a highly radioactive fog, and rapidly altered the local plant and animal life. This fog emulated the conditions found centuries later on The Island, allowing many similar mutations to take place in the local Appalachian wildlife. The exact species from which fog crawlers mutated is not immediately apparent, though the most likely culprit is the crayfish, a creature which shares much of the same biology as fog crawlers, and can commonly be found throughout swamps and marshes in North America.
---
The different types of tail "fans" on different types of fog crawlers could determine their gender, as crayfish carry eggs under the tails or as courtship during mating to avoid injury. The smaller legs (swimmerets) on the underside of the fog crawler are a holdover from when it remained an aquatic creature, assuming it isn't still largely amphibious. It seems that at some point the creature's head had evolved a mobile neck similar to terrestrial insects, as well as morphed into a kind of arrowhead shape. They seem to have eight eyes, four in a straight line on each side of the head, with the one second from the front being the largest. They also seem to lack any sort of visible mouth.
---
They live in the deepest, murkiest swamps of The Mire, and are seldom encountered outside of the region. Fog crawlers are known to make deep, booming vocalizations as an indicator of their presence. They are also among the strongest and most tenacious foes encountered in their respective areas, combining excellent protection with a generous health pool.
---
I do the same thing, and I've received similar things. This community has really helped to keep me sane. It's been such a blessing.
---
Thank you. We're doing what we can.
---
I want to do it aswell. Can help others too
---
Sure send me a FR too.
---
Yeah same. I know one one who wants to play NW. 
---
at least the “gold” reward is given at 5/6 so you can skip. LUCKILY

It's a crustacean

I've been tempted to hit up NW again just to up my overseer points. Maybe I'll see you there. Thank you.

Thanks for the offer though. You're the hero Xbox players need if they experience the same nonsense.

Ok finished the thing I was doing so online now. What’s your IGN?
---
Idk about you but rubber banding only happens with shotguns for me, (don’t use the flamer) and the only ways for it to NOT RUBBER BAND is by USING VATS. When I don’t it takes 3 shots to kill bloated glowing ones but in vats it’s a 1 shot. Also my first normal shot will empty it’s health, I’ll look at it again and it’s at half all the sudden, I’ll shoot it again and it goes to zero then half then the 3rd shot will kill it, this only happens for me outside of vats on shotguns, in vats I’m 100% fine.
---
A monumental achievement! This is inspiration to Bush Wookiee’s everywhere!
---
I do it every time! I do all my dailies except the vox syringer once cuz it sucks ass
---
You can sometimes earn Atoms only 10 thought from certain challenges for the Legendary Run. Im not sure which count and which dont.
---
I’d say you do as well. 
---
But how will they know who it affected... that’s my main concern.
---
Thank you! Do you sell serums?
---
First time in a long time that I haven't wanted to eat. This has definitely helped though. Thank you.
---
Dear Reddit,

Please allow me to upvote posts like this more than once so more people can see it.

Any Redditor Reading This Post
---
How many you need?
---
It's not, but I know a Sutton in-game. She's had a tough time too.
---
If you're going to buy tiles at all you should wait till your closer to the end. Those take longer to get through and the atom cost is presumably the same.
---
It’s probably easier to just find a place with a lot of rads and just sit there until you get the mutations you want. Make sure you have maxed out starched genes first.
---
Depends on how much it costs
---
Lol nice you got the first real companion to follow you
---
Healing Factor and its 375% heal rate will help keep the death away
---
AC is much simpler but they do have a daily system. I'm not suggesting FO is perfect in theirs but it exist. Fortnite does have an XP buff if you missed the 14k daily. I dont mind the daily system in FO but what I do mind is wondering if the dailies will be there for me to do or if they self finish. The system lacks predictability sadly. I feel there will be some lessons learned from this first season system. Whether anything is fixed is another thing.
---
GothicBarbie25 is my psn. I'll give you some, no charge 🖤
---
I'm Xbox. We're both over level 100 but we're not super serious. We're pretty casual too. If by any chance you find yourself on Xbox, we'd be glad to jump events with you. It was pretty fun.
---
Thank you. The response here has really lifted my spirits.
---
Damn lol hope you can find one, I still wish we had cross platform support lmao
---
I'm always happy to help out cuz I know how much the bugs suck, and how hard some stuff can be if people don't know what to expect
---
Just exploring will give you many side quests and interesting things to do. Wander all the regions is my advice
---
Please make sure you do. Even if it's just something little and tasteless. Remember I went through a period of feeling so low I had no appetite and even a piece of toast or some rice would help. Look after yourself.
---
No wasn’t talking about that. That is unfortunate. All day the first two days people were talking about the board not giving you enough time to get to 100.
---
This **was** the way.
---
Stay strong. Just remember that there's things that are worth it out there and will make you happy. I forget this sometimes but it's communities, posts and comments like this that really help remind me.
---
Soooo after server hopping like crazy, it finally showed up.
---
So a lot of time when you launch and click confirm it will move the center of the circle to where you click confirm. It happens to me in adventure mode occasionally. I always try to remember to keep the mouse in the same spot and hit Enter instead. It's super irritating wasting nukes.
---
You have a problem?
---
My God...I'm so sorry. My heart seriously hurts for you. That is awful... I hope things have gotten easier for you.
---
I can make you some mate...need to bring your own flux though. Don't do Blastzones much these days.

Asking this sub to stop overreacting about something is like asking a dog to stop licking it's balls.
---
Awesome lmao glad to hear it, I bet it did happen with that secret service plan then
---
not really. Most players sell the seum for 250-400 caps. You can make that in a few minutes easily. 
---
I did it that way back in the olden days. Ended up with mutations i didn't want. And took forever.
---
It was simple they wanted the whole board handed to them instead of just playing the game. Dude making fun of grinding a game when he literally grinds reddit.
---
We might have to wait for the other players to clear out of the Mama’s.. lol
---
I've really dropped out of my hobbies as of ate. Hoping I can get back into it. Thank you.
---
I used it for the first time last night, and while it could definitely be improved, it wasn't NEARLY as bad as people here made it sound.  
---
Which, now that i think about it, is pretty much true of the whole game.
---
You don't even need that lol. I just levelled a nocturnal rifleman for science and they can do one in 2 or 3 hits. Has to be the right time of day though. I think it's one of those things were they're everywhere when you don't want them but nowhere to be seen when you do.
---
This game...I swear. LOL
---
Look for "One Wasteland" on the road map
---
Seems a few people have bothered to care here.
---
My bad i forgot to remove my custom ini 😡
---
There’s a friendly wandering super mutant trader. 
---
There’s a non hostile ghoul at the big bend tunnel. 
---
There’s a non hostile ghoul allied with crater. 
---
Point is, they’re there. 
---
Sorry if I come across as an ass with this reply it’s not my intention.
---
We're you playing during the reset? I've set an alarm on my phone to warn me to stop playing for 10 minutes.
---
Alas when I contacted customer support I got an automated response that ignored my problem, said they won't replace any missing score, then locked my support ticket!
---
Same, just now lol
---
lol no worries
---
For example "War Thunder". They have 2 types of marathons. 1st requires u complete 3 of 5 tasks per day during 2 weeks. In order to achive the final goal u can miss no more than 2 days. How long it takes to complete 3 of 5 task depends on ur skill as much as on ur luck.  2nd  requieres u to stay in the game in order to complete the f\*cking marathon where ur skill and luck doesn´t matter. The last one took me 2400 minutes in-game to letme get what I wanted. The whole marathon lasted 3200 minutes.  Of course u cant go to a battle and  at the same time do whatever u want outside the game. To understand how it works imagine that u have this marathon in NW. first, u have to wait when it starts (doesnt count as in-game time). second, if u couldnt hit anyone and died ur efficiency is low so it doesnt count.
---
I can name other projects with a similar mechanic but ur question says that u dont have a lot of experience in online games. If u want to know how to get what u want withing any marathon without spending all ur lifetime I tell u: Pay. 
---
As for fo76 there are a lot of exploits, bugged events and general possibilities to get it faster. cheers.
---
Does anyone want to do this on Xbox? Msg me @Holy0neKenobi
---
There's a fuckton of antisocial solo players on here and the forums. They are a very loud minority.
---
If they kick you they don't want you =0 
---
And i've never cared if someone doesn't have a mic. It's very rare i see someone with a mic icon these days
---
If you're respecing your characters rather than waiting for them to fix a fucking bug they've already said they're aware of then you deserve to lose all of those points.
---
Chill the fuck out.
---
At the moment there is nothing in the game that would make grouping up mandatory.
---
Also, if you don't have a headset connected and the voice-chat disabled, people will not see the speaker-symbol by your name, so they know that you wont hear them.

Yes, I was on when it reset.

Westek runs and Uranium fever. Collect every possible item from every corpse. Sell it all. It's pretty easy to Mac caps very quickly.

For real ESO has gotten amazing content and great expansions everything that’s been added has been some sort of grind with a small story attached
---
Do you want to join us now? Or after?
---
I'm thanking Bethesda for an outlet that has led me to a community full of the kindest and most generous people I have ever played with.
---
Whether we agree or disagree about the quality of this game in particular, the people it has garnered has been top notch. I can and will thank them for that.
---
That’s also my whole point by jumped the gun and assumed. Also my point about people who have the time kinda should get more for putting in more time....what world do you get more for less?
---
Lmao yep, it's really such a good game, but the bugs slowly eat away at your enjoyment lol
---
So many people have quit because of bugs like losing their power armour and such, it's kind of sad
---
anyone doing this challenge on ps4 and wanna help eachother?
---
If we can do it at the same time sure!
---
Yes, rad ant lager still gives +50
---
Sure, might have to take turns
---
A raider leader who’ve read newspapers speaking of a ”Florida man” doing a bunch of crazy shit and decided that he wanted to be like ”Florida man”
---
Not for everyone u know. it actually sucks to know but on PC is all good. I mean for now.
---
Thank you. I appreciate it. I hope you're doing well as well.
---
Ah we’ve just started, let’s do it after
---
Wait there’s a recipe for it?
---
Make a note on your phone, an alarm if need be, to warn you to logout when that happens, I've not lost any dailies since I started doing this. 
---
Good luck and keep complaining to Bethesda, kick up as much fuss as possible so they actually do something about it!
---
I rage quit and huffed for a few before posting on here. Now back to grinding this legendary run.
---
The game settings let you turn off all mic traffic, whether you have a headset or not. I can’t answer for team etiquette, but I think they get by without everyone being on mic.
---
No probs, one can defend the other 2
---
Alright np
---
True!
---
Sadly I'm on PS4 so I guess I'm gonna have to shop around for plans and mods. My camp right now is in the forest but most of my customers are still high level players but once I'm set up to start my store I'm hoping to set up bulk deals for like a modded hunting rifle and ammo or a full set of leathers. I just gotta make sure I have both the plans, mods and materials.
---
When you have that disadvantage, there are two options;
---
1) Use social teams to recruit a higher level to carry you.
---
2) Abuse shitty AI by using terrain. You will break weapons and waste ammo fighting Bullet sponges, though so watch out.
---
??????? I’ve played this game insanely less than you. Where do you get off saying anything to me in my post....
---
No one cares. I've been playing since beta and unless I'm already in a Party with my friends, rarely if ever are people on mic. I like talking to people but often don't for a different reason, because I'm a woman and don't need sweaty creepers being weird when I'm just trying to drop nukes and wreck shit. You're fine, no one's gonna get mad.
---
Nuclear divah!
---
You’ve been down too long in the grafton seaaaa!
---
Yeah it’s bit off putting. Me and my friend just been going through it solo, together (if that makes sense) 
---
Shame can’t share perks and stuff, but atleast can play together..ish
---
Definitely need 2 or 3 peole collecting to hit 100. I had the most frustrating experience a couple of days ago where we'd got to 96 and run out of respawns with 2 of us collecting. Not one other person would move from farming ghouls ( and there was about 10 people there, plenty in CSA ) and I had to just watch the clock count down and miss out on max reward.
---
Also comes from the guy boasting about 1700+ hours gameplay “lmao” what are you even doing dude...
---
I'm aware of that but that'll scale the mobs across their different models based on the player level. The problem here is player numbers however. A super mutant primus won't last longer than a super mutant skirmisher against a crowd unless they also begin scaling its HP based on how many players are in the event and they scale how many of them are spawned.
---
And by then Bethesda will add another whopping 80% damage multiplier via legendary perks. Even level 80 scorchbeasts will be killed in a couple of seconds I bet.
---
Yeah so on average you can collect a total of 40 ore (10 from each room) they will slowly respawn but even with a full timer you'd be lucky to get 50 total (an additional 10) you really need at least 3 people running
---
Yeah, used to drop randomly from the SBQ but they removed that from her loot table early on. You can buy mutation recipes from Modus in the Enclave bunker OR get lucky and find a player selling them cheap.
---
What I've learnt from asking people who report the pre-completed dailies, which I'm going to stop now as people are starting to think I'm blaming them and because the Bethesda reps on here have acknowledged the bug and said they're working on it:
---
1. Avoid playing at refresh time, and don't log in until 10-20 mins after.
---
2. If you log out of NW, log into adventure before quitting the game for the day. 
---
3. Don't access the Legendary Run board or Atom Store before loading into the world. 
---
Then the dailies should be reliably not pre-completed. Quite easy for me because I don't normally play at refresh time. I feel for those that do.
---
Don't know anything about herding them anywhere but the event, but the CAMP brahmin pen comes complete with a brahmin, much like how ally items cause the ally to spawn once you've crafted them.
---
In this post, there are players that were not on and did one daily and looked at the daily and then saw that they had more done than they did themselves so I don't know if jumping off is going to work or not.
---
More importantly, why the hell do they drop fiber optics?
---
Give me a reason why I should care.
---
If people want to spend $$ for a duped gun, let them.
---
I say the more those weapons find the way into hands of common players, the faster they get taken out or nerfed.
---
I agree with him, people 1 shotting everything while you watch the event be completed isnt gameplay. When people jump up and annihilate entire swarms of enemies there isnt a point to having a group. They need to rebalance player damage, or add somthing the whole group can do not just let 1 person.
---
Or old quest line 
---
Or sold by caps vendor
---
Or sold by gb vendor
---
I sell plans for like 25 caps each. Roughly around there because I don’t care enough to land on a specific number. But I really need to offload some, they make my stash way too heavy. I still can’t selll some fast enough though. If anybody on PS4 would like some add me at circletrigon
---
That is super frustrating. Is it even worth trying to collect with only 1 person?
---
From a lunchbox.  Did someone open one near you?
---
Careful you don't get your foot sucked by the pool crap cleaning machine
---
Player vendor. Usually about 10k on PC
---
Public Teams give you more XP
---
You can join our discord, lots of voice chat, help &amp; lots of events being run.

Seems like a bug.
---
As of update 20, all the seasonal and/or limited time Nuclear Winter Challenges are back online, and you can earn various Halloween, Christmas, and Survivor cosmetics by playing NW matches and earning XP.
---
That was a pretty good deal
---
I usually repair my friends' PA parts for free etc. But yes, would be good to be able to drop them. Too good, I suppose
---
I live on the cliff overlooking Watoga just outside of the Freak Show. It's a nice spot with an excellent view and my camp rarely gets attacked, but I do have to deal with the occasional Mirelurk Queen spawn at the Freak Show.
---
Buy Serums at player vendor for 200-300 caps. Sell them 500 at station vendors
---
Ok done, free again
---
This is the answer. There absolutely will be reskins for this item.
---
BOS, Responder, Mothman, Settler, Raider, Free States, Future-tec, Vault-tec and maybe Enclave.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if the assets are done and waiting to be added.
---
Thx man ily.
---
I’m not trying to convince you. It’s that people are getting scammed out of money. That’s why I care. That’s it, duped or not it shouldn’t be so valuable that it’s worth 600$. People pay for said weapon and then don’t receive it.
---
No problem at all, nice and quick and easy!
---
Thanks, I'd not heard of that one before and you're right I don't have that much experience in other online games. 
---
I am finding that most of the big ones people suggest have some kind of catchup mechanism that makes it so that someone who plays say 14 hours at a weekend has the same progression as someone who plays 2 hours everyday. Fingers crossed for Season 2 as by then I won't be able to play daily.
---
Untapped market
---
You're correct, they're in Fallout 2 as well
---
So how do we do this? Never played much NW. Do you invite me or...?
---
There is no group content, watch a lvl 200 jump up wipe a hoard, over and over again. Event is done you didnt need to fire a bullet, well dam wasnt that fun? You get way to defensive trying to protect a fragile game. On another hand why cant there be more solo content, why do you need to pay to enjoy the game alone without the lvl 200 insta wiping enemies.
---
Mountain Mama
---
Yeah, you can't complete the event otherwise.
---
Interesting that you mention borders because they're nonexistent right now. We're completely free to roam the outskirts of the map 😂
---
I like to keep one for tanking a pylon at encryptid.
---
It's all being done to push Atom sales when users can skip levels for 150 Atom.
---
Why else would they ignore a long standing bug, and focus a new system of monetisation that just happens to permit users affected by aforementioned bug to progress through the season?
---
Yup, just quit to main menu
---
What ya want for the blueridge outfit?
---
I believe you are of the wrong opinion
---
I found a ghoul radier at the Whitespring Clubhouse once.
---
Oddly, they got mauled to death by ghouls.

---
Will Excavator Armor double the ore drops? Haven't tried it since I never use PA
---
It's a bug, if you play nuclear winter and log out and dont log into the survival before the challenges reset they auto complete but you don't get the points and it's greyed out.
---
Just be sure to log in and out of survival before the challenges reset after playing nuclear winter

It isn't a glitch. The Christmas rewards require more experience overall. Every reward from Halloween can be earned with 14000 XP total, whereas Christmas requires 27001 XP. The Fur Lined Jacket and Jeans from Christmas requires 14000 XP /by itself/, while all other Christmas rewards are unlocked with 13001 XP total.
---
Thanks for providing better examples than I could. This is a great reply.
---
Done

&gt;take a load of buckshot to the face

Best part was fallout 4 where if you change your pip boy to red for example it makes your pipboy light red
---
Treasure Hunter + BOS hood + Skull Mask
---
I know like a new type of atom shop thing like death animations
---
I joined the event quite late yesterday with 3 others players already there. 1 minute left on the clock. All 4 of the NPC's still had full health but the ore was at 0. I tried my best but couldn't get to rank 1 so the mission failed. 
---
Wish there was a facepalm emote.
---
The greatest addition to the game ever, and I strongly protest it must be added as a legendary pern in the new card system because it's awesome. 
---
Makes enemies instead of exploding into goo with bloody mess, they explode into confetti. From the lunchboxes in the Legendary Run. 
---
It's particularly effective if you glitch Line in the Sand event and have every mob spawn in the middle. You go to town with an m79 grenade launcher and there's just literally confetti and bodies EVERYWHERE it's the greatest thing ever.
---
You can't do it for another 2 weeks
---
This might not be exact but it is pretty close.  I can get 50-60 alone, but I don't think I've ever gotten more.  Considering I have to keep stopping for combat and protecting the operators, I usually get in the 40's during the event on pub servers.
---
Ok just vote for Morgan town and then follow the instructions in my post above. The tree is on the right hand side, not left..
---
Like their pay to win nonsense promise!
---
Shenandoah river
---
That's a good idea, but the goo/ash piles we have right now are still causing terrible problems.
---
Once that's all fixed, I'd love more ways to die.
---
Not sure was during sbq fight
---
There should be an Imposter Florida man quest line! What would summon him 6 pack and white powder?
---
The response from Bethesda is "we can't replace missing score" before locking my support ticket!
---
Got it. Right hand side looking at the front door right?
---
Get busy collecting that wood
---
Bethesda ignored the long standing challenge auto completion issues for the simple reason that it incentives users to purchase or spend Atom to progress the season system once the two week timer resets.
---
Why else would they ignore a problem that has been reported for multiple patch releases, while at the same time nerfing the total of free Atom users obtain?
---
Loose lips sink ships.
---
Sounds awesome, like grunt birthday suprise
---
The Corvega Stonehenge up by 79. That’s the spot.
---
Ahh icic thanks for clarification
---
Wait til he gets a server where people role play characters with the N word pass
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
So the suit is a NW reward ?
---
Ironically, today I got the Christmas wreath and the Love Seat simply trying to pick up Legendary Run XP on Nuclear Winter...😃
---
I was kicking myself after Fasnacht for not doing the NW event that ran at the same time as I'd probably have gotten most of it....a poor move from Bethesda.
---
Yeah but you’ll see me on the roof, so don’t worry, just get those stimpacks from the Pub. If lots of people spawn at Mamas or the Pub we quit and find a new game
---
You can set your audio to team or area in the settings for the game.
---
I don't think they've been that bad, they fix some things but not others yes. It seems to me that theres probably only a small team of actual developers and that whoever's in charge still isn't 100% sure on the business model they want to follow.
---
Having said that the 800 lbs stash is problematic and would have definitely been increased by now if they didn't have the scrapbox.
---
Got it
---
Yea, I’ll agree with F1DL5TYX - reminds me of an annoyed, overgrown crawfish, or a cross between a crawfish and Caribbean lobster.  
---
Usually in the Mire, but occasionally found in the Divide.  The rest stop above Freak show and below the investigators cabin is one of the spawn points (rotates with other large critters)
---
You forgot penelope hornwright.  I agree though.
---
I do that and it's like nothing happens. I don't see an icon above my head when I talk either.
---
250 gold for the shielded plan now!
---
All you have to do is make a post here asking for someone to go with you- spawn in nowhere so you don’t die right away- build a platform - jump off - revive - repeat
---
No, it is only equipping the skin to the excavator power armor
---
yah ima delete this to keep it safe
---
It has an extremely high chance to activate if you shoot their corpse, and even higher if you sever a limb or blow up the head. So if you feel sad that an enemy didn't explode into confetti, just keep the above in mind. &lt;3
---
Wear only yellow speedos while doing this.
---
Cool map.  Boston was pretty well done in fo4.  Like fo76, it is relational and not precise.  Nice job on your map.  I spotted some locations i never found, which means i gotta create a team and go exploring....
---
I had this happen to me yesterday. So today I decided to log off before the reset. Logged on 10 minutes after reset and had no issues. 
---
Not sure if its the solution. But it worked for me today so I'm going to stick with it
---
Too*
---
And I dont see how I'm being defensive here. I'm just mocking op for crying about how the game doesn't specifically cater to exactly what they want. 
---
The only one who jumped in and got defensive is you. 
---
I have never experienced a level 200 insta-wiping anything, let alone an entire event in a single bullet. That's damn impressive considering 90% of events cant be completed that way. 
---
If you have such an issue with the game, then don't play it. Super simple.
---
Yeah. I never bothered with the daily quests until after I finished everything. But I want that forest camo.
---
Quit.. too many orhers
---
Thanks, It's been a slow process. But, it has gotten easier over the past few years.  Having to see my daughter like that gave me PTSD in a serious way.  I dont sleep much cuz I have terrible nightmares, but otherwise, life is as normal as it can get. I work full time, play video games wit my 14 yr old son etc.
---
Yeah..
---
Adrenaline is broken. Stealth being broken is just a meme that people spam after every single update for the past year and a half
---
Bloody Mess, Ragdoll physics and glitchy stretchy bodies are going to be your lifeblood for the next few years.
---
Don't forget to play Golf with a decapitated ghoul head at the Whitespring
---
Very pricey mate. Can't remeber exactly...20,000-ish.
---
Sure I was 16,000 with 3* on Hard Bargain perk and using Grape Mentats.
---
They (Usually) only show up around morgantown when someone starts off Collision course.
---
THe road between Monongah Power plant and white powder sports is about as far west as they usually roam.
---
It doesn’t matter if you don’t have a mic. I have played with a deaf person before and they just used text chat thru Xbox messages but it’s fine if you don’t. :)
---
Yes throw away money, a developer shouldnt ever fix thier broken product. Interesting thought why did anyone play at launch they should have just quit. I mean the game didnt need a single update right ?
---
Sheesh I only have 500😂
---
Oh wow.  I read, “until the server crashed...” and thought we were suddenly taking a bad turn.  Glad fallout was able to help you.  It is my tool to disengage from stress as well.  Cheaper than counseling!
---
such as?
---
first of all -- I've been CRASHING with events when in team. I'm so frustrated. I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this.
---
I have actually been having the same issue but opposite.  I mute my headset and the game hears me. I have had audio issues in and off since launch... Sorry for your troubles
---
I can't blame ya :P
---
I'm a bit disappointed in the legendary run, but I understand that they want to have some rewards only be available to those willing to truly burn through the challenges
---
I'm just dying for the fireplace door at rank 99
---
Open them.  They are most likely duped but nobody really cares about gifts.  You won't get banned.  Bethesda snuck in a weight increase on holiday gifts that really reduced the number that now exist.
---
Rockstar are just EA at this point when it comes to multiplayer so that shouldn't surprise anyone
---
I know like fire works or bats or when they disintegrate they leave thier skeleton and thier armor on it
---
Want anything for the outfit?
---
It's not as bad as people loading up their vendors with random base level pipe guns or 10mm pistols and wood armor pieces so their icon shows that their vendor is absolutely STACKED and they get all this foot traffic. That is 70% of the vendors I end up traveling to the past couple of days. 
---
The the FO76 equivalent of click bait.
---
OHHH PRESS Y BRO
---
I think level 8 or 9 on the score board is a 150 atom reward.  There are a few others further along the path.
---
But as other said - daily challenges now awards score points, not atoms.
---
World, character, and combat challenges still award varying amounts of atoms.
---
I'll try take him or just run from.him
---
i find them on player vendors for 500-750 constantlyyyy
---
Didnt think of that :)
---
‘....has to be the right time of day though’ 😂🤣👍👍
---
So I finally did the quest. The whole server showed up and I had no idea what I was going and couldn’t even live long enough to keep the fields going and quest failed 🙁
---
Looks like I’m going to be buying a lot of keycards
---
Ok good luck. I’ll be hiding in the bush by the tree
---
Unfortunately I can't look at the Holiday Challenges, but just trying to do SCORE bounties I've received several holiday items, including the Wrapping paper, Bats, and Jack o' Lantern weapon skins,  and the wreath, tree, and package camp decorations. So if the glowing skeleton was a NW event reward, you could theoretically get it as long as you can earn the XP before they fix whatever bug reactivated the challenges. (Anyone who knows for sure please feel free to correct me)
---
What platform and what are you looking for?
---
Well at least we know Good With Salt is working here.
---
i rock the urban enclave armor, mask, and the secret service backpack. feel like an enclave assassin with it. 
---
using hunters longcoat and usa backpack for this weekend to celebrate.
---
Its not a glitch. 
---
Halloween only needed 14k total, Christmas needed 27k total
---
Damn since launch. That's rough.... Oof hope I can figure it out soon
---
PS4 
---
Finally got my second character leveled and am working on equiping and whatnot.
---
The upcoming 2x SCORE weekend is only for daily challenges.
---
I had that happen and I was able to remove them if I removed them in the exact opposite order that I place them down in.
---
I managed to get on a team of whales, two players over 200, and despite needing to be revived 4 times myself, I got in 4 revives on them in my first game and promptly logged off after one match.
---
sweet you on?
---
2 people on ore from the start and with a bit of luck and you can get 100.  3 people and you need a slow down emote so people can farm some XP
---
And if you ever see Maria mad at a turret, find a new server.  She won’t start the event.
---
Medical definition and Dictionary definition are different things, having one does not exclude the other or make it wrong.
---
But if you want me to be PC, you have an antisocial disorder.
---
It seems like it come and goes for me.  It has been good for quite a while.  Seems weird again after this last patch.
---
going online now, whats your ign?
---
how about not having to try to fast travel 3 times every single fucking time. it makes me wonder why i defend this game to other people when something so simple is fucking shit. i understand why people dont like it. i cant blame them.
---
Do the leader of the pack event is guaranteed 3- 3 stars
---
I just think it would be cool to walk up to people and talk and even communicate with these new teams but sigh...
---
Public Teams would have made them more doable for a lot of people.
---
That's interesting I tried to pull everything up and it was a no go but I'll give it another try
---
The first few NW challenges were easy -- survive a total of 30 minutes (just hide in bushes as long as possible), use 3 stimpaks (I found stimpaks and then just jumped off low cliffs enough to hurt myself and stimmed), and place your CAMP 3x (just place quickly 3 times at the beginning of a match).  However, today's is much more difficult so I'm skipping that one -- revive two players.  Can't wait until Tuesday afternoon though!  That was amazing with the reward thing popping every few minutes it felt like! lol
---
Nice, good to know.
---
Not the same thing. Every race in elder scrolls has/had it's own civilization/province with eras of history. Ghouls are just people that got microwaved too long.
---
You obviously have good parents. My mother and I used to watch gory horror movies together when I was "too young" to see them and it just taught me to enjoy the finer things in life.
---
Bethesda Support is about as useful as a stud during a lesbian porno shoot.
---
smart I should have done that!
---
Agreed!
---
Cool. I've regularly shied away from NW, did it twice today and came in 8th and 5th, with no idea of the regular boxes or system.
---
I'll definitely dive in regularly now. Always wanted the initial rwards anyway.
---
I live in Pittsburgh. It's pretty much an hour drive to Morgantown.
---
I mule on the same account. Transfer items as needed on a private world. A little scary while transferring items but secondary characters on the same account still get the stash box and tent
---
Probably the 25k XP otherwise your heavily relying on players to go down and when they go down its probably in a fight so they'll most likely get finished
---
Shhh.
---
Hey! Yeah unfortunately it fails a fair amount because people either don't want to be conduits/don't know about it/or especially now just wanna farm XP on the robots, especially when they aren't the one paying for the card. Also a lot of bloodied turn up and don't wanna try or don't think they can tank the pylon damage. 
---
It's the only public event I've failed, and the only one I've failed multiple times from people not having a clue. Did you do the leadup quest?
---
Only ones I never picked up were the Nuclear winter Christmas outfit and beanie.  Any idea how to tell how much xp you need for them?  As I recall it was maybe 14000/21000
---
I mean, people are just playing the game, not keeping tabs on our exact ins and outs. We shouldn’t have to jump through all these hoops just for a daily reset to work as intended. The fact people are suggesting to set an alarm on your phone, and then even that doesn’t guarantee to work is just mind-boggling. This bug has existed ever since challenges were introduced, except it only ever used to be triggered by playing Nuclear Winter. Now it’s even worse, just triggering arbitrarily.
---
They no longer drop from the queen.
---
Like I said, look me up and watch for me on. 
---
Supply the flux and I'll make you it, no problem.
---
I did the same with a friend and I can also tell you you don't need stims ti rez your mates.
---
Funny enough two guy went right past me while my friend was reviving me...and they say the orange camo is too flashy and visible.
---
No crashing but extreme lag. And for some reason vats stops working (main character is a vats build).
---
I think I'm at rank 14 or so atm. I feel very behind despite doing all the challenges and many events.
---
The game is a slot machine and almost always comes up cherries or worse. Why do you think you keep playing it? If not for that sweet dopamine hit of a shielded marine under armor plan.
---
Have you ever been to any of the game's famous locations?
---
An entire gang raiding along the borders of Alabama and Georgia, the Florida Men.
---
Why thank you fine sir or madam
---
Yeah. I figured out what had happened!  When I had originally completed the quest line however many months ago the event had been run recently so it didn’t spawn for me. I guess it has like a 3 hour cool down
---
Oh hell yes. Vampire Gatling is my Encryptid gun. I have been able to solo it with that a time or two.
---
Crash frequency had become quite rare but had two today, one before the world had even loaded. \[PS4\]
---
It's not even consistent listing either. They are under misc on the world map, but under aid when you get there. 
---
I see you're PS4, pity as I have like 10 serums for sale right now and would've happily furnished you with whatever you needed. Good luck!
---
Who said anything about me thinking this game isn't in need of massive improvement as far as bug fixes, QoL, and performance improvements? Please quote where I said this game is perfect. 
---
And the game at launch was in a terrible state and thousands of players quit and raged. Its been a long road of patches and mistakes made by Bethesda, but the game is undeniably in a better state than launch. 
---
Stop jumping to conclusions based on assumptions of things I've never even said and stop being so dramatic.
---
This is definitely a bug. I was able to use the hi tech wallpaper for a month without actually purchasing it. When update 20 dropped I could no longer use it, thought they might have fixed it.
---
Guess not. Use it while you can! Even though I can no longer access the wall paper, it is still applied to my camp. 
---
I’m on PS4.
---
thanks for the trade!
---
I was online in adventure.
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug
---
Poor Squatch.
---
&gt;We need Bethesda to be making a new engine from the ground up
---
So you want them to delay all games by several years and probably completely changing the modding principles, which would mean that modders will take much harder time to adapt to the new game?
---
I'm at 12 but I missed the first two days, I would have expected a larger difference
---
I have been grinding the XP repeatable like crazy though
---
If you track that one, untrack it before making ammo -.- I listened to that thing pop up over and over for like half an hour
---
Seen as this bug is appearing to effect everyone arbitrarily they should probably just work on fixing it asap and then extending the season by however long it takes them to fix it.
---
I love this idea! It reminds me of The Kings in New Vegas ... it could be a whole faction of Florida Men!
---
Did you get score awarded at 3/5? There is a bug going around that does that.
---
Lucky!!!
---
I love the username.
---
Thats exactly what happened, will the points be distributed again once it gets fixed?
---
They can, but I'm my experience very few do.
---
Don’t give up hope man it’s all rng but you might get lucky I did had my fixer plans for maybe a week when I rolled a bloodied faster fire rate fixer been in love ever since lol
---
Yh It was the 1st thing I did after downloading the update.
---
The best PA in the game is ultracite (or strangler) with emergency protocols on the torso and a jetpack on the arm. Those are legacy now but the utility of the jetpack/protocols combo outstrips the resistance advantages of T65
---
It is indeed a 3 hour cooldown unless you server hop. Glad you got there, sorry it failed but it's worth repeating the rewards are great (sometimes)
---
That is true, you don’t need stims for team members, thanks!
---
Yeah. 800 Census Violence events later. And the day I got the shielded plans for the Secret Service.
---
Same. What's funny is I was racing against the clock to kill one more legendary cause I didn't want to miss out on the points. Killed it ten minutes before reset.
---
That first picture is amazing! Great work on that one.
---
Then you shouldnt tell people to quit a game because you dont like thier opinions.
---
You have to give those guys points for persistence.
---
They dropped?
---
&gt;Bulk your scrap - I can free up so much weight by bulking up the scrap I bring back.
---
Except 1 or 2 resources bulking doesn't reduce any weight. You lose 2 plastic per bulk hence why you might think that it frees space.
---
Sure you can play the game with 800 stash. Heck, I've even played this game with 400 stash. But it's like living on minimum wage.
---
My 1200 lead weighs 20 pounds when bulked
---
"Bethesda is aware of problem" has never exactly been a sure fire indication of "the problem shall be fixed."
---
Much (if not most, come to think of it) of the FO3 map encompasses mainland Maryland. 
---
As a real-life Marylander, I can be okay with the Fog Crawlers. Our state is pretty small so migrating from the bay is reasonable. Maybe they took the Potomac.
---
This. Piss easy. Up at the Fair Ground. Watch for it starting and you'll get three groups of wolves with legendary in all of them.
---
I usually just use a Grogak axe and stay still...let the wolves come to you...that way you don't those them in the long grass, they all fall at your feet. Stay by a large tree iff you can as a marker. Use a gun maybe to rouse them into attacking if needed.
---
Without a friend,the xp is faster. Specially with cheat unyielding.
---
I hope so
---
Yeah with the last patch. SS underroos are SUPREMELY OP.
---
You sang it in your head didn't you?
---
Use the psn message app?
---
Yeah bought them from Reg. sorry thought you implied they dropped from census violence..
---
If you already got the points when the subchallenge was at 3/5 I doubt you will get them a second time.
---
The plans also drop from the SBQ rewards even without completing the quest
---
I've been to Morgantown and the surrounding area a bit (surprised they didn't put in Cooper's Rock). Also Point Pleasant is not as close as it appears.
---
I didn't command you to stop playing lol
---
I said if you don't like the game then don't play it. You don't eat food you don't like. You don't pay for stuff you don't like, bills excluded. You don't listen to songs you don't like. And you damn sure don't endure food, songs, and products you don't like hoping the creator will magically make it more to your taste so you do like it. That's illogical and unrealistic. 
---
I don't like CoD, guess which game I don't play.
---
making a new character and getting them to level 3 is quicker.
---
Wait for the sale coming up.
---
Depends. If you have a friend to play with it’s easy enough to coordinate. You don’t need a stim to revive in NW and you can easily place a foundation and stairs anywhere to jump off of
---
you to thanks !
---
Good to know. Ty.
---
They're bugged at the moment paying out at 3/5 instead
---
It's a bug. I haven't found a sure fire way to fix it. Sometimes going to main menu will fix it, sometines I have to completely restart. 
---
Of course this is a big problem if you're in a public server without a friend to join back.
---
I see.  Well thanks for responding and helping me out.  Hope to see this bug get fixed!
---
Of course, 80s kid here. I love me some Falco. Even been to his grave in Vienna.
---
I know, I know.
---
In the immortal words of the great Peter Quincy Taggart: Never give up, never surrender.
---
Yea but that’s pretty incredible to collect an entire set from scorched earth before even doing BOS missions (IMO at least). Either way I would just get the free full set vs crafting. Should craft x-01 instead.
---
It is a bug, and I've heard it doesn't really charge you the caps, but I can't confirm because I haven't tried it yet
---
No game will ever realize its full potential, everyone has different ideas, there isnt enough time/resources to implement everything. And also Capitalism so money. If youre enjoying the content play it, if you start to feel burnt out just stop, dont force yourself to play and get toxic
---
I may just buy the Mothman paper legitimately. I really like that red and black mixture.
---
Did they change that?
---
I could swear it was just the helmet, not the "Miners hat"
---
NE of Watoga south of the abandoned bog town is a system of tunnels under the highway which work for a bunker-style camp
---
I was fighting a PA build and I wasn't ready for PvP so I was just using a bloodied handmade and bloodied gauss shotgun normally I kill most players in less then a full mag but this PA dude was so TANKY I couldn't move his health a freaking inch he had a Explosive gatling plasma which wrecked me... a lot 
---
So I decided to switch all my perks up, Cola nut, dodgy, secret agent,  tank killer and demo expert.  
---
I went all out and tried just about everything I could think of stealth boy's, quantums, Bloodied Explosive double barrel, Anti armor Explosive railway rifle,  quad faster fire rate handmade and a quad Explosive handmade i lost about 5k caps before I told my teammate I'm coming off for the night. 
---
So to answer your question I'm pretty sure you can do well PA
---
getting fo1st changed the amount im able to be entertained by the game per day as well. i have a main, an alt and 3 mules for different things. being able to hoard scrip legendaries, items to save for later builds and vendor items is seriously awesome. having thousands of lead and steel on hand to make ammo whenever is also super time saving.
---
I started a new character so I got a lot of grinding to do.
---
I agree. Of all FNV DLC's I only really like OWB - and that's for the humor and characters. The rest of the DLCs are meh.
---
Dead Money I like the least. Taking away inventory from players is a big NO-NO in an RPG. It destroys the sense of progression. And while Dean is a cool character, I really hate that he turn of us because of some random sentence said in the beginning.
---
Honest Hearts is empty. It shows that Obsidian cannot build a truly engaging open world and it feels unfinished. Searching for the Survivalist story is nice but that's it. I also expected from Joshua Graham, because he was quite hyped up in the base game.
---
And Lonesome Road. Nukes, Deathclaws and Ulysses. Cool concept, but I expected more. From narrative and roleplaying view, this is a mess. First it desperately tries to paint NCR as quite bad, to tarnish its reputation and present it as bad as the Legion (allegedly because Obdisian didn't expect players to treat the base game NCR as "the good guys"). Second, it inserts pieces of backstory for the player character ("badass experienced courier"). Finally the part where our character has to launch a nuke (without knowing the target) to progress makes our character into a moron...
---
All spoiled food still gives out diseases and food. Regardless of your mutations.
---
I love this idea, and I’ve actually been collecting weapons for this type of roleplay. I have an Instigating bow and a Hunter’s cultist blade, to name a few. Radstag hide outfits like you mentioned are a perfect fit. I guess it’s time to level up a new character now.
---
Did not work for me.
---
He didn't state that he was trying to craft a full set at once.
---
But yeah if he still has that quest open I would advise to get the free one first and only after getting X-01 to craft a new set if bored.
---
Yeah fo1st is quite attractive
---
Very important these are followed. We don't have the answers but it's worth trying these to ensure success. Thank you for sharing
---
Is she stuck in the washing machine?
---
Lv 25 no NW quest done but I’ve been grinding the hellll out of the exp quest when the run started I was in the late 120’s for level now I’m almost 190 I’ll be happy when it’s over keeping this pace is rough lol
---
Apex legends, Fortnite, modern warfare, pubg, rocket league, battlefield V. Literally any game with a season pass
---
So since everything is so close to the commenwealth and capital wasteland here are the fates of factions and creatures that would've either died or changed
---
Scorchbeasts and scorched: So the brotherhood and fallout 76 residents took out the scorchbeasts and scorched as we don't see any in point lookout or in fallout 3 as the scorchbeasts would have decided to move farther away from the first nest 
---
mothman: most likely lost too many followers and couldn't lay anymore eggs and died due to the cultists agressive nature and some people hunting them (raider punk)
---
the grafton monster: either died or we don't see much of him  
---
Although he most likely died as we don't see evidence of him reproducing and he attacks whatever is in sight (plus the Charleston monster dies easily to "super" mutants)
---
the wendigos: seemingly were feral ghouls fueled by a desire for flesh as the progenitor wendigo was a gourmand (cannibal) and was a survivor of the bombs another wendigo was a man trapped in a cave who ate flesh twice and also survived the bombs which suggests that wendigos are just cannibalistic feral ghouls and since cannibals are present in the later games wendigos have a chance of existence after 76
---
Snallygaster: I don't know here folks this one is a total wild card as we only know what west tek says about them
---
Flatwoods monster: since this is probably a zetan and we don't see them in mothership zetan the use of them in post-war America has probably declined
---
40 is no age to die.
---
Can’t go wrong there! It is a really nice wallpaper! If you have the cherry wood floors, they look great together imo. Plus all the other cool mothman decorations you get. 
---
That wallpaper plus the cherrywood floor and the torch lights from the bundle, it will really give you the cult vibe!
---
Going to main menu did fix it
---
I picked up a second account back when codes were the price of a coffee, so thankfully I don't have that nerve wracking problem, sounds like I would have gray hairs.
---
Mine is still open but I got the same generic response. If you went through the trouble to send them one ticket try another, this is complete bullshit.
---
Raider Pathfinder outfit from the Settlers &amp; Raiders bundle would be great for this too. Leather and bone, honestly looks more like something you'd see an Ashlander wearing in Morrowind than a post-apocalyptic outfit.
---
Is that EMOJIS?!?!?!?
---
.....whats in it for me
---
So you are angry that people who want to cheat are getting scammed.
---
That's the way live goes, people try to cheat and get taken for a ride.
---
Can't say I care about that either. And now I don't even understand why you are up in arms about this. You were not trying to buy, or were you?
---
Isn’t it 3? Unless you are counting the default skin in.
---
I sent them 2 tickets, both got auto locked.
---
The difference is cod has been predatory for a long time, fo76 is bethsda first really predatory game. People should keep complaining about this game, until it resembles somthing proper or dies. The sake of the series depends on it, what they get away with now will be in the next game to come.
---
Response from my support ticket:
---
We are investigating an issue where some Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 completed instead of 5 of 5 completed. In these cases, you are still getting your S.C.O.R.E., but you have already received it by the time you have actually completed the Challenge, so it will not display an updated score when you complete 5/5 on the Challenge. This will be resolved in a future update.
---
Pretty much everything is off from where it would be. Thats the point of the post I think lol
---
Why are you asking for being downvoted?
---
That would be a god roll right there.  Any time   I start getting close to the stash limit I swear the game knows and just starts dropping the heaviest most useless crap.  Luckily I run bear arms anyways, but I don't want to carry 5 broadsiders around either just because "150 a day is good enough!"
---
Oh what’s becooooming of meeeee...
---
You lost 5k? That’s wild! Does that mean you went against him 100 times? I usually give up as soon as I’ve been decisively smashed but to be fair I basically always get smashed pretty decisively. What was the guy’s strategy? Was he moving a lot or just keeping up sustained fire and following your movement?
---
Look for “Leader of the Pack” event. You can get three low level legendary wolves that way.
---
Nigga what
---
You will know that you made someone happy 🙏🏾
---
If would have been helpful if they had, from the start, mentioned double SCORE weeks and other things that give extra SCORE points.  The very failure for them to communicate these things is the real problem.
---
yeah i wanted to do that too but i was too excited
---
Doesn't really help in game but if you make an xbox party with just you, and turn on the Party Chat Overlay option, a little box with your name will pop up when you speak, that way you can at least be sure you mic works
---
If it does maybe try inviting them to a party?
---
Some people just don't like to talk too
---
yep
---
At least that is forty scrip.  Not sure how many 1 star 20+ lb weapons I have dropped at train stations at this point.  Hopefully someone finds them at least and gets some scrip out of them.
---
yep it sucks
---
this happens in adventure mode too
---
I use a vampire flamer there and I can solo it too.
---
I think youre in the range to do it and survive if you have the right guns/ammo and stimpacks.
---
They had to put Point Pleasant in though. Mothman must be appeased.
---
I can if you are on tomorrow morning and gmt time
---
Kind of. Think the lines are tried to be based off where the actual landmarks are as well. Real WV is layed out pretty much nothing like this imo, think it just made for an easier game translation
---
I can’t even get the tadpole revive achievement in normal much less NW. I feel you.
---
Going to do the same I think, been waiting for a good excuse to try out the bows and their related perks.
---
You still do.
---
And Huntington is in Beckley lol
---
They changed how it works it doesn't do the chime anymore but it does add the extra meat I think.
---
Obey video game laws and go for 3? I still have mine open some how, Think I'll submit another since its been hours since they regurgitated the first response. If they can't adjust our S.C.O.R.E. then they need to compensate because this was really hooking me into the grind and is a core game play mechanic now.
---
Honestly without the scrap box I wouldn’t even bother with any events where you may need to repair something. I assume that’s why so few people play line in the sand, uranium fever, load barring, and guided meditation. Though people tend to show up at uranium fever and line in the sand when they see two or more players already there
---
Hopefully you do not have to reinstall. Try pressing alt + enter key. Also check to see your laptop is plugged in and everything is working.
---
What's the cheat? Is it just having a higher Int score?
---
That's a great outfit indeed! Even the head, if you use it for secret rituals perhaps? A Radstorm dance maybe?
---
Anyone else Xbox looking at this too hoping for a partner ?
---
GT: DURZAT
---
Huh. All this time I've been thinking that there was a difference in the bulk weight vs. the weight of total unbulked and it's a Lie.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Didn't realize it was the whole state condensed actually. I've never been there and have never really looked at it on a map for reference since playing the game.
---
Somehow I doubt that if I actually went there I would be able to walk across the whole state in about 8 minutes....
---
It’s a multiplayer game, the whole point being players play and interact together...
---
Must admit I’ve been bashing Bethesda for many reasons on reddit lately. But hell, have I had some real fun with Radiation rumble events lately. And no stressing out to miss on legendaries. 
---
Wonderful. Very satisfying :)
---
Just bulk it all, if you need plastic, go to the schools and get all the plastic pumpkins or put on scrapper and go to west tek and pick up all the super mutants laser weapons.
---
Bethesda has apparently attempted to get the general culture and intellectual atmosphere very close to the actual geographic and social environment of the areas in each game. Keeping in mind that this story is supposedly written as science fiction from a 1940s perspective I think they have done a pretty good job.
---
I grew up in the 1940s, I live in Maryland (Annapolis) and years ago I had spent significant time in Vegas. I have played FO 3, New Vegas, FO 4, and FO 76  extensively and over the years have wondered the same thing. So I checked. Bethesda has taken some liberties with the exact locations of various cities, towns, landmarks, etc.
---
In FO 3, and references in FO 76, the characterizations of Pittsburg (The Pitt) and Maryland's Eastern Shore (Point Lookout) is spot on with a 1940s perspective. At that time Pittsburg was a dirty, grimy steelmaking hub. The steel factories cranked out millions of tons of steel with no regard for the environment or the health consequences of the people living there.
---
The real Point Lookout is in southern MD while FO 3's Point Lookout is actually placed on MD's Eastern Shore. Even today this area is considered a bit inbred (politically, not genetically) and out of step with the rest of the state (except for Western MD, which we'll get to shortly).
---
Having been through, and spent time in large portions of the MD, WV, VA area over the last several years, the geographic layout of FO 76 was a little baffling at first. Until I adjusted for the way Bethesda moved stuff around. But they, again, did get the general culture and social atmosphere right which is similar to that of MD Eastern Shore.
---
As to the appearance of or the migration of various creatures, that is just "poetic license."
---
The same way you get to 100 on survival without committing suicide. You grind and keep your chin up.
---
FYI nuclear winter is just about surviving till the end. Don't ever have to fight anyone to get the good exp. Sucks.
---
There’s a modern fireplace, but it’s like a standing fireplace, maybe it’ll be a secret to anyone who starts playing after the season ends?
---
Bulking is good to manage stash. Aluminum and lead weigh less. Nothing else does. I keep 5 or so bulk of everything, sell the rest.
---
35ish
---
Only if you have it equipped before the kill.
---
It still works, it just doesn’t seem to proc as much as it used to. I am able to hear the chime when it goes off, but I wouldn’t doubt if there’s some sort of audio bug.
---
The whole point of the ammo converter, and the run in general, is to distract us from the fact that they're cutting way down on free atoms.
---
Darn it! I'm on PS4. It would have been fun to play with someone who is also interested in roleplaying.
---
I agree!  30+ Agility (mutations, 5x unyielding, Strange in numbers, tons of mutations, new carnivore / herbivore that increases stats from food, ) really makes you SO sneaky the suit isn't required  depends if you have more agility perk slots, you really only need escape artist, and you're good to go.
---
Survivor, blood eagle, flatwoods and another has been datamined
---
Gears 5 has something very similar to the legendary run. Except there’s only 4 dailies (used to be 3) and zero weekly objectives.
---
Not well know fact but Angry Turtle confirmed you count as your own ally. So you take 8% more AND 33% less (total of 25% less with strange in numbers)
---
Damn i must be hella lucky 2 win so many games then.
---
Smiley and Allies keep breaking. Every patch, they start freezing me out again.
---
I think to gameshare you need to share personal information i might be wrong but if that is the case i dont suggest anyone doing this with a stranger. 😂
---
Just started playing recently and was surprised I couldn't customize my hud colors
---
If you didnt like it at launch I think you should wait 2 or 3 years or dont bother with the game at all. There is too much bugs going on, plenty of them from the release, everything time-gated and plenty of rng. If you can accept that as a fan, go on. If not - avoid this greedy incompetence.
---
I personally would just keep playing and swap to the stealth build. You will only be 30 levels behind but its probably easier than starting over if you are solo.
---
SHOUOD HAVE BEEN A DAY 1 FEATURE. THESE DEVS DONT CARE ABOUT US
---
Maybe others will read this and connect.
---
He’s not talking about people currently playing not being able to earn it, he’s talking about people who play after the season ends.
---
Bloatflys, ghouls, radstag.
---
No troubles. And don’t get me started. 
---
What’s funny is that I encounter what I’m looking for all the time on my other character.
---
There is a fireplace that isn’t a door. I have it
---
Fair enough I just don’t like thinking that somewhat new players are getting referred to gameflip to find legacy weapons and then getting scammed just because they’re interested in seeing what these legacy weapons really do. I’m not buying anything but I do browse the listings out of curiosity. And when I see 20-40 b2525 fixers for 2000$ or a 10 pack of be plasmas for 1500$ it urks me
---
i know it's horrible lol
---
You do it gradually over time
---
I'm not exactly sure how many times I died but I wouldn't put it past him to have killed me that much
---
His tactic was to sit on the roof then pop a stealth boy and either wait for me to come close so he could tesla me or wait for me to shoot so he could spray his plasma in my general direction.
---
once I counted his roof tactic by going higher up the mountain he'd jetpack around to avoid the splash damage from my explosive and try to close the gap between us or he'd fly straight up and just spray his explosives weapon
---
i did the math and broke down what i paid for the year and it was something like 29 cents a day haha. i dont agree with the fact that some of the features are behind a paywall. i enjoy the game enough to expand my capabilities and it was a great move for me.
---
I never realized just how small these fallout states are.
---
Solar vault armor.  Gives healing to you and teammates nearby even in combat.
---
On top of the other friendly ghouls there's a doctor in the toxic valley, Clarksburg maybe?
---
I'm also noticing more and more randomly generated friendly npcs I find are ghouls.
---
I thought only hunting and the event ones give xp bonus
---
I hear it happens very rarely and only to those that have their camp budgets glitched to hell. Justice?
---
I disagree with public teams not mattering, because double XP for completing an event is pretty damn good (event team) and the builder team is +4 Intelligence increasing overall XP gain.
---
I've not got unyielding on this toon but has 12 int on special. Then I use egghead, strange in numbers, inspirational, herbivore and brain bombs or brain soup. Also class freak to counter marsupial. I just killed a glowing fat boi for over 400xp and getting about 1200 for scorchbeasts. It's going to be mental at double xp weekend.
---
Here you have all the ranks and all the points required
---
There's that dramatic flare again. 
---
You missed the point again, it wasn't about CoD vs FO. I just used it as an example of a game I dont play because I don't like it. But I'm also not in the CoD reddit complaining about the game and things I don't like about it. Because that's not constructive or progressive. 
---
Bethesda can see and read all the complaints of everyone, and it might or might not change things. They will ultimately do whatever they are ordered to do by their bosses, who's number 1 goal is max profits. There are ways to voice opinions that aren't toxic and offer actual solutions, but that doesnt mean Bethesda will hand pick all the best ones. The state of the game is only ever going to be as good as Bethesda makes it. Our influence might affect it sometimes, but that doesnt mean you should attack everyone who disagrees about you with some things.
---
Its not working that way. You cant save points to get better perks before lvl cap or so, for example, if you are lvl and been saving points since 10, you may only choose cards for lvl 10, 11, 12 etc
---
I still don't get it, those that could buy have the money to spare and imo deserve to be ripped, those that can't... can't. This has nothing to do with new players.
---
I still see no reason to get upset.
---
Yeah serums were the biggest pain before I started making them myself. I got so pissed off with fast travelling wasting money for there to be no serums in etc I ended up buying adrenal reaction from the bunker for 4k I was so done with it. 
---
Definitely needs it's own section, as I don't believe it's the same game without mutations, I accidentally sued a rad-x earlier for the first time in forever, and after bird bones/marsupial/strange in numbers/SS jetpack it felt like I was massively handicapped in comparison.
---
You can glitch you budget...
---
Lol 2010. I just don't take selfies anymore. That was quite the phase.
---
Does not seem to work with tic blood anymore period
---
Unless you want to be one of those people with alts who store or sell everything you just eventually realize you can't use all those extra legendaries, save the nearly weightless ones for tomorrow's scrip and drop the rest at a train station.
---
The same happened to me, logged in a few minutes after the reset, had 4/7 done already, one of them the complete 5 one, which is just crazy. Tried doing them again to see if it's a display glitch, nothing. Did the fifth one to see if I get score for completing 5, nothing. Only got score for the one I've done. Just like that. 1250 score down the toilet.
---
I understand exactly how you ended up with the boundaries and it is really interesting to see actually.  
---
A condensed version of a map made to fit into a square game map area isn't going to match the real life equivalent, and even if it was scaled up so it could match, it would have a ton of boring empty area.  Not really sure why anyone would want that just so the locations outline looks like the real world outline.
---
Something like this should deffo be tied to gold if it has to be made available post season.
---
You have some great captures there! I especially liked the monorail one! Please keep taking more and sharing! 
---
I can only aspire to take shots like these. I take horrible pictures irl and even more so in the game.
---
Building team gives intelligence, which in turn gives bonus xp. More int you have, more xp you gain from all activities. 1 int = 2% xp. I always only join building teams as it will boost my int to 44. Mad xp.
---
Love it when people share images like this. Honestly Vignette filter + slightly lowered brightness can really capture that "gritty, bleak wasteland" kind of feel.
---
The get better is coming. I promise. Hold fast homie, see you in Appalachia.
---
Intelligence boosts exp earned. So by getting +1-4 intelligence you actually earn more exp from all sources. 
---
Its mainly beneficial for kills on generic enemies.
---
I guess I'm blind then, still bored if the game
---
It’s more about the aesthetic than actually being “secret”. I have a “hidden” room behind a Nuka machine where I keep my Mistress of Mysteries regalia and a bunch of mounted guns.
---
I'm never around when the reset happens, just in case something like this happens. One of the completed ones was to level up. Haven't done that since yesterday...
---
Any error code? if not turn your PS4 off leave it for 5 seconds turn it and do the same with your WIFI Router.
---
For some reason if my Internet has the slightest hiccup and I get disconnected fallout will refuse to put me into a lobby until I reset both my PS4 and WIFI
---
So incredibly sorry to hear about your trials. I'm so glad you were able to find an escape. I've found very similar solace in Bethesda games. These things will pass. Just remember the escape this provided you and use it to keep your chin up. Much love &lt;3
---
So thats good for bloodied builds but not for much else
---
They also updated the combat rewards as long as they keep refreshing the world challenges I'm fine
---
Sure but in all fairness if you cant tell the difference between the nuka cola door and the nuka cola machine theres something wrong
---
Thank you that might be exactly it. My router every now and then kicks every device for like 10 seconds then accepts them all back.
---
The intelligence boost can average out to somewhere between 8-10% more exp. It all depends on where your baseline is. And of course it stacks very well with +X% exp boosts like canned meat stew and well rested.
---
So you want them to trade upwards of 100 percent bonus for at most a 8 percent bonus
---
&gt;!Pitt OP!&lt;
---
"Its mainly beneficial for kills on generic enemies." No such restrictions, as bonus xp is bonus xp. What ever you do in the game. Crafting, building, killing, events, etc etc.
---
Every time I try to stack them they replace each other
---
The chime still works on PS4.
---
I think nothing would look different in Florida.  No one would even notice mutated animals or ghouls
---
[An old chart, but still accurate](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451695772023652362/705807591220969482/WyBb9st.png). Bulk lead and aluminum to save weight. Bulk other things to sell to the robots or if you want to sell for less than 1c/piece to other players in your vending machine. Anything else is a waste of plastic.
---
What’s ya PSN ID mate i’ll drop ya a friend request, mines BeanToast .
---
I’ll see if I wake up early tomorrow i’ll try to wake up abit earlier so we can get that done mate, would hate missing a daily 👍
---
Huh. I'm on pc, haven't heard the chime in forever. Maybe we're bugged then. Lol
---
Your wrong. The complaints are justified. Try converting 10000 rounds of .38. It's ok once you're on top of your ammo stash and your only converting a 100 or so at a time, but wouldn't you agree that being able to dump all the ammo in at once and get all the points? Doesn't matter if your converting 100 or 1000 ammo, being able to dump all the .38 ammo in the machine at once is always gonna be better than doing it 20 at a time.
---
That's what everyone annoyed about, it's easy to make it better, but they won't.
---
It works solo, as long as you're in a group.
---
OP plotted a map based on real world geography.  The fact that it doesn't match a real world map is just  the developers avoiding adding in 100s of miles of nothingness between locations.
---
Got a 3 star fully modded flamer used especially for little griefing shit bags. Was in the rusty pick yesterday and a player was in there and started randomly attacking me whilst i was trading, so i turned round and melted him in seconds, he came back for more and melted him again.
---
The bright green glare of the pip boy light is kinda annoying, i have a combat helmet with a light on it but no mod option
---
It's a bonus on everything while the 100% only effects the reward you get at the end. And if you arent doing events anyways it doesn't matter. 
---
8% more exp for kills can end up being a lot more than the 100% from the end of an event.
---
If i'm not praising Mothman in my cultist cloths, you can find me in my Insurgent outfit with the white wolf fedora and surgical mask.
---
Yes but if you're grinding exp, you're probably just farming high level mobs.
---
Just about every mmo in existence?  They all have daily quests that grants a currency or reward that has a daily cap.  World of warcraft, guild wars, ect.
---
You actually get the bonus for everthing while in an event
---
I find it kind of a shame, cant get myself to drop legendaries. At this moment I just stop playing and wait until the next day to scrip / sell everything. But I realize that’s pretty dump as well... 
---
I may want to try marketplaces here to get my heavy guns sold faster (like explosive minigun)
---
This game is 99.9% solo player. Even the SBQ doesn’t require fireteams just a bunch of blue berries doing parallel play. No group strategy even needed.  It’s nice to see some multiplayer portions of this game . It’s lonely in the wasteland sometimes .
---
I haven't been playing NW on any characters all day, logged out of adventure before the reset, logged into adventure after, I still got 4/7 without even taking a step. I think it's more than just the NW connection.
---
It's good for anyone.
---
4 int is 8% more xp from all activities. Being bloodied has nothing to do with it.
---
I’m not upset over it I’m disappointed with the action taken against this type of behavior. I also think they somewhat deserve it but at the same time not every fallout 76 player is on reddit/forums to get the best trades or information (aka the newer players) and they just go straight to purchasing it on eBay or game flip simply because they don’t know any better. but hey I definitely see ur point that they probably deserved it in the first place for cheating
---
If a legendary scorchbeast flies over Morgantown airport when you start the collision course event ... take shots at the SB.  If you hit it, it will not agro against you, but sometimes you will get a level 1 or 6 legendary scorched, typically during wave 4.
---
Not consistent, but happens more often than not.
---
Bath salts and malt liquor
---
and use strange in numbers
---
you don't have to pick them up
---
No but 44int is far different from just 4int
---
😂😂
---
You can, get the fallout quick configuratior, it has a setting that does it, as its just a fallout76custom.ini tweak. Here's a link to it. 
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546)
---
Thanks for the honest opinion.
---
I've decided to download and try the game an hour or so, and see how it looks like.
---
I don't know what will happens, but at worst I just have to delete it again and forget it for another year or more.
---
If you die in your unyielding armor, click respawn, go to the social tab when you're presented with the map to leave that world and then join a server your unyielding bonus stacks. However you lose it if you go down or enter power armor.
---
Agreed
---
Eh, I don't need the scrap box. If you run out of anything, it's very easy in this game to get more. Go to the cat lady's house to get plastic and go through Pleasant Valley ski resort and scrap all the weapons you find/loot for steel. I never run out of adhesive because it is always tagged for me and I always pick it up. You can craft it too.
---
If you regularly check your stash and tag the junk items that are running low, you will almost never run out. I keep 30 of most items, 50 for some like rubber/oil, 100 for adhesive/screws/springs/gears/plastic/acid/ultracite and up to 1000 for lead and steel. Always bulk your lead and aluminum.
---
sometimes it can take time to register. if you did it with seconds on the clock it didn't register in time
---
Noone forces you tho, with current food buffs 100 score exp challenge  is a good way to farm
---
Lol, you may be the only person who *wants* Wheeling on a map 🤣
---
I heard something about it someone buys all your stuff before your camp loads in for them. 
---
So I'm putting something in each category for 25k.
---
No i just play the game. I don't farm anymore than i need to for dailies etc. Everything is affected.
---
Always wanted to see something like this, thank you
---
Yea did this today with a full building group ( best in my opinion cuz you get 2% exp for each  intelligent point and up to 4x = 8% extra exp for everything that earns you exp) plus everyone popped a lunch box for extra 100 %.  I went from 119 to 132 in a few hrs
---
Same here but for me its when im in a private server.  They show fine on community servers
---
Funfact irl no one knows how many nukes russia has lost so sleep well tonight
---
Ofcourse it is, but what has that got to do with this? :D it's the same 8% increase even if i had 80 int :D
---
Fucking YES! You do NOT use the same engine in games separated by THREE CONSOLE GENERATIONS. It has been 12 years since Fallout 3 was released. There is a reason 3, New Vegas, Skyrim , 4, and 76 all look and work essentially the same, and shit like train helmets exist. It was already a relatively weak engine, and they've been stretching it thin for far too long. Did you know the ending screens for 3 and New Vegas were images placed in front of the first person camera with an NPC hiding behind it because they didn't have another way to produce dialogue without it?     
---
For comparison, Unreal, which is built to work at the basest level so different types of games can work using it, is on 4 iterations in 22 years, with it's newest version coming out next year. Bethesda makes its own engine exclusively for its own games that doesn't work half as well, and repaints it once for the new generation.
---
I am from the south-southwest edge of this map and now live in the northeast corner.  Bizarre.
---
Really? That wasn't the case before.
---
1.21 '...jigawatts...!'
---
It's fvckin JIGAWATTS !!!
---
😄
---
They should have it as an award but not have "secret" in the name. Just call it fancy fireplace and let people figure out it has a secret door. Then not everyone and there momma knows it's a secret door lmao!
---
What level are you? And are you out to scam anyone? Or just want to help?
---
Actual there is a soft cap to intelligence based exp gain
---
So alt + enter didn’t work and I reinstalled it last night when the issue started happening. Everything is plugged in and working and other games aren’t causing issue just 76
---
You can get them from some venderbots at the train stations and the responder vender bot
---
Cosmicmole, I'll drop you one in the morning too :) Prob try and jump on from 9 onwards just depends on how fast I can leave the missus house and get back to mine lol. Should be on for a bit then though
---
Is Empath similar? being in a group gives me 33% DMG resistance?
---
I haven’t had issues. I get all my challenges done the day before and then I don’t log in again until after the reset happens.
---
No there isn't.
---
I bet op downvoted all of these lmao
---
I could see doing that if I had the caps on this character. My main has to shut off his vendor frequently. This character has trouble keeping above 1500.
---
I don't think that's true as I should be getting much higher exp for kills if that was true than I do. I get roughly the same. 
---
But this is besides the point, read my original post, if you arent going to show up to events then it doesn't matter because you aren't getting the +100% exp boost anyways.
---
When you think about it flordia is effectively the usas australia
---
It'll just be a cool way to decorate a wall of a room.
---
Depends how your special points are set up too.  You planning a rifle build or a stealth melee build?   If have low perception and agility might be worth doing it again.  
---
It takes awhile to grind.  I created a new character to go from stealth to melee.  But I still find myself using stealth a lot of the time irregardless.  Having escape artist + the Chinese stealth armor makes for a quick and easy stealth build on the fly
---
Actually, yes I did all the side quests. I have a sniper build. I've had it done in a month. And I don't play is actively as I used to. Maybe an hour or two a day
---
Which serums?  I’m PS4, try to keep 4-5 different ones in stock, and list them under 300 caps each.
---
Marsupial, healing factor, adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, and speed demon.
---
It’s filled with a bunch of dudes (elephant butt hairs)
---
If you’re trying to level only play during 2x XP weekends, it’s such a slog otherwise
---
I was able to chunk it out this way, 1-65 during the 3x XP weekend in March 65-83 during the 2x XP weekend in April and 83-100 during the 2x XP weekend in June
---
The above were something like 10hrs a day during the Xp week to grind out the needed XP, it sucks!
---
I was getting about 400 per supermutant kill at the one trainyard distant thunder
---
"or just buy atoms to make up for bethesda's mandatory bugs. what  are you? poor?" - 95% of this sub
---
Yeah it was kinda myth spread shortly after release, but then it was debunked several times [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tzw41/with\_all\_the\_talk\_of\_bulk\_your\_stuff\_to\_save/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tzw41/with_all_the_talk_of_bulk_your_stuff_to_save/) . Only lead and aluminium reduce weight by 50%.
---
No, you'll just take more.
---
Getting +20% XP on all other enemies during SBQ then +200% for the event (6000XP) has been very handy!
---
I’m not anymore.
---
I am currently level 59 and I know that ppl are trying to scam but I am genuinely trying to help new players and don't want anything back for the packages just trying to give a helping hand
---
Same problem here with the Queen, never counts as a kill to complete the challenge. Also need to complete Mistaken Identity but I don't even remember the last time it poped up, if ever.
---
I'll bulk everything, for the xp.
---
That's why I figured they placed it so low on the totem pole
---
Did you figure this out yourself or did this post help you?
---
That doesn't apply in a group alone.
---
Look for me then, GT: CannonHand76
---
Will be me or one of my kids who are lower level.  Currently Lvl75
---
Field surgeon , first aid 3, born survivor rank 3, team medic rank 3 work fantastic together.
---
Dont forget blocker,dodgy, rejuvinated, action boy and grim reapers sprint. 
---
Medics rifle with lower vats cost modded with auto receover, aligned long barrel, reflex sight, swift mag amd aligned/forceful stock to make vats cost 1-2 ap a shot. If you run vats/medics crit savy+ grim repears sprint help a ton.
---
For sure sounds good 👍 Sent you a request anyway i’ll try be on for around 9 myself will be able to get it done for both of us 👍
---
I can't remember the points right now :/ will check them tomorrow and repost to you. But i was planning on going rifle build
---
Your reset happened about 10 minutes ago. Most people seem to agree that logging on too close to the challenge reset time is what bugs it out
---
im at lvl 25 and it sucks! i hate myself for not playing on 3x xp
---
Looks dope and has an Helm lamp wich is equal to the bright light of a PA
---
You may need to redo your main stash. Once my fo1st sub ran out I dumped everything from my stash into my inventory and actually looked at what I needed to stash. Found over 150 weight just from crap.
---
I was counting the compound too Haha almost no dmg diff.
---
Explains why my i keep losing 60 carry weight
---
Mistaken identity is once per character thing for some reason the sbq u need to kill by yourself apparently
---
The stealth suit personally only use in Nuke zones, but its still suitable in any build!
---
Can you post a screenshot please ?
---
I only keep 2star and 3star weaps and junk/sell/give away the rest. Thats just  3 3 star weap and 2 2 star weaps a day to max scrip, ez pz. Some of the better armor drops ill keep and sell but ss is just so dang stronk, no need for any other armor just gotta pray to rngeezus for the good rolls. apparently i have some karma to make up : /
---
lmao imagine digging though my post history to comment on a month old post.
---
Class freak doesn't do anything for herbivore or carnivore. Herbivore will double the effects of any veggie related buff.
---
Thanks ill check
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Not playing currently but I'm sure there is a video about it on YouTube
---
I agree wholeheartedly. FO76 is so close to being a fantastic game. It just needs the quality-of-life improvements and end-game content the community has suggested. Granted, these are not little things, but Bethesda has already done the hard part and made the game as it is now. With all the money they get from FO1st and the Atom Shop, they should be able to finish the job. Where is text chat, a global trading post and perk card loadouts? Why aren't events like a Colossal Problem added every few months? I like the new grouping system, but we have a long way to go.
---
I play PS4 and can never get voice chat to work in game 😂. Don’t worry
---
I will have a look never thought of that lol 
---
Cheers 👍
---
Only happens if someone else in your group has empath to apply towards you
---
I just did a heart of the swamp, I got the same exp from a lv 62 stranger feral ghoul as I get from a typically level 62 from white springs. 
---
Unless the strangerghouls give exactly half of the exp of a level 62 non-strangler ghoul, I don't think the event exp boost applies to event kills.
---
&gt; It's a bug, if you play nuclear winter and log out and dont log into the survival before the challenges reset they auto complete but you don't get the points and it's greyed out.
---
did this last night, my challenges are fine
---
no
---
Activating fullscreen gives a massive fps increase, but you should not ALT+TAB during loading screens as it can break your screen resolution and mouse controls, which is only fixed by restarting the game. 
---
Also make sure to limit the FPS to something below 200 (can be reached in small indoor areas), because this causes movement issues.
---
Here are some more ways to increase FPS: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byE4qyx8kwA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byE4qyx8kwA&amp;t=845s)
---
Not the case, it's just bugged period. Have killed the queen solo on my private server numerous times and it won't trigger.
---
Okay and once again the child should know better and that also comes down to parenting. Where is the issue?
---
Can you sell them in your machine?
---
I’ll run this event with you and if I get the plans you can have em.
---
Check the market sub. The plans are a low drop IIRC.
---
I’m in the same boat friend.
---
I heard it works that way never worked for me either but it might be worth the try
---
Fixer plan? I can sell you one for 5k caps, found a few for that from a vendor, I'm not on right now but I will be soon
---
No man, but go on LFG, you’ll have a lot of luck there :)
---
Yeah it sucks aha
---
So its purely cosmetic?
---
Fallout 1967: Chernobyl
---
That would be awesome if you have a spare set !
---
Ah ffs I always forget the elevator, I've always walked through the whole place to the top. Thanks!
---
You are a true gentleman! ❤️
---
Ya some people hate that I sell clothing from plans since there at like 20 pieces and it might be armor but I do sell them all at 100 caps or less. Don't see the point in hoping to scam someone by them not knowing.
---
I know a lot of players want those items. Sell a lot of Halloween and treasure hunters outfits
---
Weird I was getting about 162 I think
---
Yeah no problem I've been holding onto them but I know the frustration gets old lmao, I'll let you know when I get on :)
---
Mistaken identity happen in Camden park I did it once and you had to complete 3 task there , no big reward just the Camden  blue outfit,  but still about atom quest there's some new one with atoms rewards, that I did complete before and have appear again.
---
You're right.  I'll admit they are an exception to the rest, but only because leveling suddenly matters due to the Season.  People will start abandoning them as they finish up.
---
They should be based around things people actually do and give bonuses that are more relevant.
---
- challenges (bonus score)
---
- leveling (bonus xp from enemies or int, sure)
---
- looting (bonus resources/plans in containers)
---
- workshops (bonus resources/defense rewards)
---
- legendaries (better chance of 3 stars from a 3 star, etc)
---
- pvp (rewards for pvp combat)
---
Among those I still need speed demon and healing factor. 
---
Know the next time-ish you plan to be on?
---
I thought it was Boss but, my buddy told me it was Maxell. So I looked up the commercials and yup he was right.
---
Man I really like the PA helmet light but I just bought the V94 scout mask...
---
*Adam Sandler walks up to the mic*
---
Oh, somebody kill me please
---
Somebody kill me please
---
I'm on my knees, pretty pretty please
---
Kill me
---
I want to die
---
Put a bullet in my hea-a-a-a-ad
---
First time I checked this actually, what's the point of being on here if you're just gonna be negative and make brash assumptions? You what they say about those ;)
---
Western outfit and chaps on my gunslinger character  and travelling leather coat with assault mask  on the other
---
If your on pc you can change it
---
Since I'm meeting Zacamojo anyway I can sell you a fixer plan for 5k caps as well if you'd like
---
I'll be on fairly soon
---
I think an equally bigger issue is the fact that this sub is split by circlejerk haters and circlejerk fanboys. No one wants to listen to the others, and both of them dismiss each other's points. Then us normal causal fans get shafted by Bethesda, the fanboys, and the haters.
---
Pointless then
---
I'm mainly referring to low level characters, I'm level 24 on an automatic weapons build and I'm really struggling to even keep .38 rounds
---
Might be worth as my foods I use reg are: Corn Soup, Carrot soup, Mutfruit juice, Tato juice, and sweet tato stew. Doubling the buffs of all those sounds nice, the AP regen on corn soup is especally nuts, its not +3% its a flat +3 per tick, +6 per tick with herbivore. I was asking about the sweet tato stew, as it didn't double melon juice buff which is hp regen.
---
Yes. It should be base game.
---
If you'e higher level and you've got a gun you are gonna use (mostly) just for the SBQ fight, you make it primed and the ammo crafting multipies exponentially when you're crafting ultracite ammo (at the cost of flux) along with ammosmith and super duper. 
---
I craft ammo for my  Ultracite Gatling Laser perhaps once a week, and usually I've got about 40k rounds on me.
---
Level 2 Ammosmith and Level 3 Super Duper and you will have all the 5mm you can roll around in.
---
Yes hello I would like an Ohio expansion pack plz.
---
Yes, yes we are.
---
i craft about 2000 50s a day for dailies
---
Heavy Guns puke bullets. It's what they do by design. SBQ is like 3000'ish rounds for my AAE .50 Cal.  
---
I wouldn't pay for a single bullet, but yeah, I craft'em whenever I'm back at camp. Roughly 2000 rounds on average, just to keep me topped up.
---
Unmarked grave?
---
Also, if you can connect it to a wall and apply a wallpaper to the wall, the cabinet will get removed.
---
That's my experience.
---
Yes it’s a known thing. After you play a game of NW the world boundaries disappear
---
Thank you very much!
---
Appreciate the feed back
---
25. I grind too just in case the Gain 10.000 XP challenge goes away next Tuesday.
---
yeah. ignore me. I've banged on so much about strange in numbers in a party today i managed to confuse myself. On the plus side it gives me more than +2 to stats. i get 3 on all and 4 on int.
---
How did you determine where the state lines are on the east?
---
Does it start an event like Scorched Earth?
---
It’s worth it because everyone knows how expensive it is. 
---
-idiot who owns one.
---
Yeah. I’m pretty casual as well, but I finally broke down and got it. Now though my Stash is full of crappy legendaries that I can’t get rid of fast enough.
---
I just want a straight up fist fight, naked obviously. 🤪
---
Yeah. Its definitely nerve wracking - but still have 1st advantages. If you really wanted to you could exchange through that account and have 1st still on a smurf
---
I went into my first match of the day, jumped off a cliff and someone revived me, I did it again and they followed still. Then they went up the cliff and jumped too, oddly painless for me lol
---
Beckley is Beckley, but geographically it's about where real-world Huntington would be
---
I'm fine with the debuff, I thin it adds a layer of realism. But s bug does explain why I'm going through so much purified water lately, I just assumed I was doing something to cause it without knowing what it was.
---
Wait this is supposed to be all of west Virginia?
---
Thanks a lot! I’m glad you like. I’ll definitely post more!
---
This is smart. I should mod my big guns, I definitely do not give them enough love.
---
This might be my fav pic yet. Love that pose!
---
Ok. I had never experienced this and have only been playing NW for the SCORE
---
As a lefty who is well accustomed to brass burns on my right arm, FO is kinda a fantasy for me where the guns eject correctly 😆
---
I totally agree that clothing and armor should be separated.
---
But it isn't player's fault they are on the same tab. It also isn't player's fault that their inexperience might be reflected in their prices or selection. 
---
I know how irritating the quest can be; I spent months searching (player vendors and player entrepreneurs) for HL Vangard limbs.
---
Please don't nuke 'em, though, OP (unless they're in a decent spawn area). It *might* not be their fault.
---
The other side to that coin is everything is so expensive and good you have to PM to make a deal.
---
I have a vampire mr handy buzz blade and honestly, if I ever lost it I'd probably just quit the game. I have no idea how to play without it. Most enemies can't hurt me as fast as I can heal so all I have to do is to walk up to things and slowly kill them.
---
Yeah the clothes add variety to the game and so it's a good thing, even if not my cup of tea.  I don't get mad at players if I see clothes for sale at reasonable prices cause there's no way for you to inform customers what you have until they come out - that's Bethesda's fault for lumping clothes and armor into one category
---
But I do feel like destroying bases when they have outrageous prices.  I dunno why, not like anyone is buying.  Just irks me .. a lot.
---
quite frankly the color red is pointless because we have the color blue.
---
I recommend going to /Market76. I post "W: serum name H: caps" and normally get someone willing to sell under 500 caps within an hour or 2
---
Rng is rng. I got left uny hand with first roll, and right hand took me 28 crafts.
---
Is this a thing?
---
Do you put the stock in tour left or right to shot
---
Nah, all we need is MORE STUFF TO FRIGGIN DO ENDGAME. The daily stuff is fine, i get it. But there is just NOTHING to do when ur up there in levels. We do our dailes, get our bullion, max our scrip, max our caps and thats it....Open up the vaults, add more large acale events, tone down weapon damage across the board (balance for sbq and large hp pool enemies...) i mean, lots of really clever dudes here have thrown out ideas, id just like MOARRRR
---
I AFKed while sleeping and then while at work. About 15 hours of AFKing with an AHK script got me all the rewards ez
---
When I get kicked I get an authentication error, the only way I can fix it is by restarting my ps4. From what I've read it has to do with your internet stability, but reset seems to be the only way I have fixed it.
---
yeah tell me about it... wasted 20 legendary modules on chest pieces and only got 2 of them 3\* &gt;\_&gt; the best of them is what im using now.. a fkn troubleshooters XD
---
Friend me gt is Evllve
---
Honestly once you get the daily grind down for mats it's not even that bad. Hornwright 03 in excavator for iron and lead ore, then lucky hole mine with excavator for mass lead, then tanagra town/abandoned trainyard for acid, and you can throw in super mutant farming at west tek for more steel/gunpowder if you like. 
---
It's not for everyone but largely I don't worry about farming much anymore with using a laser gatling for bigger stuff. Just the odd hour farming flux alongside the SBQ flux drops.
---
Nah. More like 750
---
Same here. I log on about 6pm and finish all of them. Except today I still have 2 to do when I log back on.
---
Like people selling ultracite arms for 1000 caps each. If those actually sold they'd be buying mine too sell. Most of my plans are 20 caps lol
---
Main reason I sell them is literally just so a new player can get some things
---
It's possible in Fallout76Custom.ini  
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/images/2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/images/2)   
---
If you are using Quickboy, replace Pipboy with QuickBoy.
---
Exactly what I did here as well. Can only agree. 
---
And thanks man!
---
The problem I have with PA that always seems to get me killed is the hard landing animation after landing. It seems to render me motionless and rather helpless for a few seconds and it gives a chance for melee builds to close distance or non-melee builds a chance to unload most of a magazine into me. I haven’t considered keeping stealboys on hand. I usually just sell them. They seem too heavy to carry around. Maybe I’ll start holding on to a few from here out
---
What platform will you be on? If Xbox it will be on the gamepass soon if you have it.
---
PS4 unfortunately but thanks!
---
Yes it is
---
Except when you nuke White Springs!
---
I wish they’d fix how the junk goes into the stash
---
Did you leave the game after playing NW prior to the challenges reload? Just curious to see if the correlation is there. Some saying that could be a possible reason.
---
Hey I'm on ps4 and I can craft any of the serums. I'll do the same deal as the other guy, 300 each.
---
40 RA, garbage
---
1st LL:  Cham, AP, sent
---
Just do a few at a time, I personally do 5 a shot to avoid long term depression!
---
It’s just easier that way
---
extremely quick tbh. Like shockingly quick.
---
Maybe 30 modules max. 3 pieces of unyielding 3\* and 2 bolstering 3\*
---
gonna try and get the other 2 UNY tbh
---
There should be an xp boost for fallout 1st. Most paid battlepasses have an xp boost. Fallouts pass is free, but those other paid passes don’t have a subscription service.
---
Agree I need my damn 94 flag pose! I missed it 😭
---
Oh damn knew I forgot something important haha. PS4 my dude
---
what platform would you be on?
---
S4 my dude
---
I try to bang out all the weekly challenges and that day's dailies in one go than just bang out the rest in one go per day.
---
Stock on my left shoulder.
---
definitely...
---
It’s been a 3 weeks since I start rolling on right leg, still don’t have it. I don’t have depression I just want a minute with a person that thought pure rng is a good idea
---
Unless your in PA then it costs an extra 1500
---
Probably being dumb, but I can’t equip them as my regular throwing grenade.
---
I run emergency protocols on all my PA. I wasn’t aware that’s there was a jet pack for the arms that could be used in conjunction with protocols. It’s a shame it went legacy I imagine players who have one will want something legacy in return for it.
---
We the new update it’s so easy to find teams now
---
I use a quad cryolator, then switch to my magic guass shotty once shes frozen
---
Nope I’m Irish ☘️ but a nyc game would be cool but still kind of similar to Boston maybe an Alaska game with some Anchorage storylines like 3s dlc
---
Idk man all of them were seemingly downvoted so it looks hecka suspect, but if you’re that bent outta shape about it then that makes this great
---
aw man, i'm on pc. hope you're able to find a good friend or two, i totally understand the anxiety part of this post. best of luck, man.
---
Wait, that was a thing? Jesus....
---
Nice one
---
This games title should be changed from Fallout76 to “You should”.
---
Jersey is pretty much already an apocalypse in itself

Back in my day sonny, everyone had 400lbs and black powder rifles. It was like the civil war
---
I'm on Ps4, and I got a few friends that I play with, we shoot the shit and shoot or melee enemies, always room for more!
---
Why do i need to think about the one south park episode
---
They hit it on the head with that one
---
Fallout 1st
---
It's just like a gas mask
---
On Pc its G for emotes and 2 dances are fallout 1st robo and mothman and the rest atom shop
---
Nukagirl
---
I doubt them being added to the drop list was intentional, at least not the way they have been (regardless of if you have bought the plans). They're bullion items, and those are all non-transferable.
---
Progressed from season lvl 19 to lvl 24 today, never thought levelling process will hook me up so badly :D
---
Tbh before seasons I barely made a level each day bc I thought it was a lil bit too much hassle (I was at around level 425 on June 30th). Now I'm rebuilding my char to be an ultimate xp-farming machine (65+ int full unyielding stealth heavy flamer herbivore build) and I must admit, hearing all these progress bar bloops every so often is so damn satisfying!
---
Thanks man
---
It could suit a witch doctor character too, or maybe an elder/chieftain. I know you specified no central leadership, but it could be symbolic of a proud warrior or something of the sort.
---
198 iirc with 15 int, no other buffs.
---
Damn lol hope you can find one :)
---
Sounds good man, give me an add if you're serious PSN is SinisterEllis
---
It's simple 
---
Step 1: crouch
---
Step 2: uncrouch
---
Step 3: repeat untill happy
---
A little? That thing is bugged six ways from Sunday. It's like something they finished out the day before the patch dropped and didn't have time to test.
---
i do but i also have class freak maxed out but christ it still drains like a mf
---
And we are back to idiots going against the TOS .)
---
Any game like this has an unsanctioned market, no one has yet managed to dry them out and no one ever will. But they regulate themselves usually.
---
As for ebay and game flip... lol, "buyer protection"... 
---
I am not saying it's w/o a risk, but you start to sound as if you are arguing based on rumors and not on facts.
---
the smoke machine could add some ambience during rituals. Loving it!
---
What level are you at now? Is it set in stone that the requirement does not become higher than 25 score per level at higher levels?
---
I dropped those at the overseers camp, and white springs for a reas lol.
---
Scrap box and tent should be available for all players. In their place, 1st members should get an xp boost on season pass, and persistent workshops for private worlds.
---
They made a huge attempt to fix the bug in patch 20. Why create half thought out conspiracy theories of "Bethesda wants us to play more" when it's as simple as it's a bug in a complicated old mess of an engine they can't easily squish. My money is on accident bug and not conspiracy theories.
---
Better than what bethseda can do
---
Definitely one of gamings best communities and this game is just so peaceful a great place to escape to in these trying times. Words cannot explain how sorry i am for your loss im going to pray for you brother
---
One piece left and I just got the plan for it yesterday. Only one perfect roll so no jet pack mod for me yet though I do I have the plan. I think it’s been like a month.. I just came back and restarted so it has been that long..
---
You're right, it's on Bethesda for putting clothes and armor in one category.  I know this but when I'm annoyed to begin with and then I see the player is asking for 1000s of caps for something common..sorry but it really grinds my gears for some reason.
---
And honestly the nuke threat is mostly venting.  It's more trouble for me to launch a nuke then for them to relog.  But I *might* have once pulled the local deathclaw to the camp, jumped on the roof and then made myself a tasty sandwich while the beast ran wild. 
---
Not my proudest moment but I don't feel bad.
---
PM me when you can get on. I'll be needing it in about the same period of time. On here or GT DaRapuano
---
Yea I did the math on sbq event with full event team and full biuld team and with the biuld team between mobs the queen herself and event completion i ended up geting like 2k more exp on biuld team per run
---
i have class freak maxed out and i dont jump occasionally like a damn fortnite player, i usually fast walk so i can look around the areas for junk and such
---
Fallout in Poland: pretty much metro last light.
---
Close enough. :D
---
Basics... Platform, Timezone, and preferred playing time should be in that post.
---
This needs a meme.  Did the same thing recently
---
It would also be nice if they had a legendary/non legendary marker.
---
I have a themed mothman conversion centre camp, which culminates in a vendor I just have mothman stuff in (for 1c - its not for profit just for a bit of fun).
---
I have to keep the stock levels really low, so it doesnt excite someone seeing 30 weapons to find they're all cultist blades (I now keep only 1 blade)
---
I said that I am not going to respec, and that I am going to wait. We will never achieve real peace with everyone being so ugly to one another. I actually am chill, just wanting to make sure it doesn't get swept under the rug for too long. Most are complaining about score , that's not really an issue, just folks wanting to use their nocturnal pitchforks. You have a good day fellow human.
---
I think a customizable jukebox would be a really cool item. You could even make a quest out of it, where you find holotapes around the world that have new songs you can add to it. Would be a great opportunity for Bethesda to get new music in the game.
---
It's a glitch that's been around since NW launched.
---
Ive gor both legs and the left arm for unyielding. They are just sitting in my stash because I'm looking for +1STR pieces.
---
Sneak is broken also right now, and it's already in use also.
---
Think it's more a remove debuff for not eating and drinking and making a bigger buff for those who do want to do it.
---
It incentives you to do it but doesn't punish people who don't want to bother with it
---
Ope, ty. I'll remove the post.
---
I just got this thing how does it work?
---
Hey I'm all set :) had to find which character it was on lol, my gt is Lord Zane66 so just join and send a team invite whenever you're ready
---
Holy shit YES pls. 
---
I never raided once because of this.
---
Im level 16 but west tek is already becoming a drag
---
What platform are you on? I would gladly buy from you if you had a spare for XB1, just cant get on until later tonight
---
Sneak works fine for me. Right now, they fixed that a couple of patches ago for me.
---
My god can you imagine how that would go down on this sub? Lol
---
That is true dude
---
Or better yet a chat system.  Trying to communicate through emotes is impossible for almost everything.
---
Swap gear between accounts and characters is possible.  It just requires dual boxing to swap gears between accounts and Fallout 1st to swap gear between characters.  Extremely annoying compared to other MMOs.
---
Iowa: corn fields. Lots and lots of corn.
---
I have a fireplace from last x mas. Can’t wait to have a second with a secret. I don’t have the modern fireplace I don’t like it.
---
I am on Xbox and yep I do :) just let me know when you're on, I'll be around just might take me a few to actually get on 76
---
tuxedo, white hat and fashionable glasses.
---
Can’t criticize it though cause people like to get exploited
---
Not true, [according to Angry Turtle](https://youtu.be/Up33CokPoDQ?t=413) it needs a team mate to work, but you can then benefit from your own Empath.
---
You get a plan every time you take a workshop. Also from random containers
---
Regardless, it's one I already use.
---
I've always hoped that we could get a FO in Texas. Houston, Dallas, Austin, all good spots. Hell there's a nuclear reactor here in College Station at A&amp;M University. Then there's the more rural areas with smaller towns, for a more similar New Vegas style and aesthetic
---
Some people do sell then at their vendors, but your best bet, if you have the caps is checking out Whitesprings. Plenty of shops there that sell camp plans, but a lot of them are pretty expensive. Otherwise, you will get plans for taking over workshops, completing events, and finding them at diffetent locations.
---
Also keep checking out player camps. Often people sell camp stuff for reasonable prices
---
Very nice! I downloaded all of them!
---
Yeah. Because Beth isn't playing fair, I've given up on the game board. I got the ammo converter...such as it is.
---
Imma just keep walking West Virginia shootin' up shit and trying to catch the Mothman. 😀
---
I honestly expect the ammo converter (in what ever form it takes after they update it) to show up at the train stations like the legendary scrip machines.
---
Ok so my build let's me do a few things. 
---
First of all my main weapons are unarmed (deathclaw gauntlet or the latest wastelanders gauntlet) which i use for 99% of content.
---
Secondly. Ive got a bloodied ultracite gatling laser (bloodied isnt important) which I use for nukezones while in Power armor or tough enemies such as SBQ.
---
And lastly ive got a reduced vats cost rifle (uses .45 ammo) along with the Tormentor perk so I can shoot scorchbeast out of the sky so I can melee them to death.
---
Now we have the stealth suit I can used unarmed weapons in a nukezonw so im thinking of changing my build a bit.
---
does this reduced resistance help berserker's?
---
my vendor
---
Wait so you do the quest, turn it in, server hop then you can turn it in again? Just asking so I make sure to not do it.
---
Your amazing thank you!
---
I've been reading through all the replies (a few more than I expected so for the sake of my sanity I haven't replied to many) but I do agree with this one, even if it's not quite the point I'm making. 
---
I'm astounded by the amount of people who will defend the shittiest things, but equally those who won't give any credit when it's due. You're right, the community is super split it's sad. I always remember that the people giving the game the hardest time and throwing the most shit usually are the ones who play . love it the most. They're just frustrated.
---
The Buffalo/WNY region would have a shitload of water areas-- Lake Erie is the Western Border, Lake Ontario is the Northern border. You could go up and include Southern Ontario, kind of like Far Harbor being attached to FO4. You could go towards the Finger Lakes, too.
---
Replace coal mines with defunct gypsum mines. Add more defunct steel mills. And grain mills. And breweries.
---
More rolling hills, fewer mountains. Swampland... Er... Uh... "Wetlands" are plentiful where I live. Lots of farmland and suburban hellscapes. A ridiculous number of retention ponds disguised as natural bodies of water.
---
If the Rads don't get you, the Radstags will. Or the rednecks. Or the ice and snow.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I was actually really surprised you cant do that while i first played the game after Steam release. I also said " i hope Its not atomic shop feature "
---
I’m very glad you like them!
---
I’m honored you even downloaded them. 
---
Just went an read my comment, I did forget to mention I'm taking a break from playing until it's fixed.
---
This game still isn't PTW though.
---
I have the plans to build them but I haven't yet. If I can't sell them, not sure that I will. I wonder if I can scrap them...hmmmmm.
---
Is that for both airborne and water or just airborne?
---
thanks hahah
---
Off the top bloodied junkies  are good sellers instigating is good for strong 1 hit weapons  furious is good on high capacity guns and reduced weight is gold on heavy weapons
---
Again, you're paying for a living game with new content. You pay a subscription if you can or you make it work. Everyone gets the content. If you don't have that you pay for the content. Really not a hard concept.
---
How do you afk NW tho? Doesn't it pull you out to the main menu after each match?
---
Hang on to everything that's anti-armor, junkies and bloodied. Also on some of the 76 market pages, you can post and get a price check.
---
You need a refresher in the lyrics.
---
There’s quite a few plans for sale In the shops at white springs.
---
It's most likely going to be added to the game through the Atomic Shop, Gold Bullion, or some other unseen currency. Otherwise people would bitch about how you have stuff that's unobtainable to them.
---
Where are the rumors I acknowledged? People get scammed on eBay and gameflip all the time that’s why these sellers have ratings. It’s based on positive trades or negative trades. “Buyer protection” means nothing lol you see how they exploit the system already as it is why wouldn’t they exploit gameflip and eBay while they’re at it to cash out? If they’re tryna cash out trust me their gonna find a way to cash out regardless.
---
If you’re on PC you can use an AHK script to move you around and also leave upon dying then find a new game. I’m fairly certain there’s a thing on console that allows you to use macros, I forgot what it’s called tho
---
Florida: meth labs.
---
My suggestion would be north-west of watoga. There are 2 spots at a cliff, near relay tower EL-B1-02. It's a rather well known spot so be prepared to server hop a lot.  
---
But you have a large pond on these 2 spots, have a nice view when a nuke goes down and are near the settlers/Watoga (which I personally like).
---
If you got Fallout 1st as well be sure to place your tent north of the map near the raiders. This minimizes the caps you would spend on fast travel.
---
 [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
Of course! Added! When you get it and you ever want to play, let me know
---
I'm not sure if switching characters or gamemode had to do with it, but it may be related.
---
I grew up in Alaska and think it would be awesome to do a game on Kodiak Island. Lots of WW2 stuff is still there, and Operation Anchorage would be cool to have in the game.
---
Got a full set +1STR and another with AP refresh it took over 2k module's I wasn't going for AP refresh but it's pretty sweet
---
The lighting on the first one is amazing!
---
I noticed quality change when uploaded to imgur. How’s the quality after downloading? I’ll be more than happy to send them in a “cleaner” form if you want.
---
Yes. It is. It only increases 25 per rank
---
Hey :) I’ve just added you just loading up now
---
It’s something to buy after you get the other stuff you want more.
---
On the contrary, it’s called the legendary race /s
---
Alright awesome :)
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I’m very pleased with that one myself as well
---
Yes, it's quite annoying
---
I tried posting a list of things they could fix, and people mostly shit on it, even when I said to cut out the bits they dont like, and still spread it around, that way we could at least get SOME things fixed. The Fallout community at large cares about fixing 76 as much as Bethesda does.
---
I want the Nukashine Jukebox from Bivs basement.
---
Does herbivore effect xp gain? I've heard that int doesn't increase xp gain either.
---
That would be great! Will check it tomorrow.
---
Im looking for one more piece of +1STR + 50% reduced fall damage and its eaten a fair few modules. 
---
So far I've found one but still need another so I don't die from fall damage when players leave the world when im at their camp.
---
It’s been working for me. I just got fine playing and it worked
---
I doesn't help when Bethesda's set up the board game specifically like a race you can't win.
---
Food/Drink should be in separate categories
---
Don't listen to back seat parents. Ppl don't know what they're talking about. When I was a kid I had friends who weren't allowed to play smash bros because it was too violent. You're literally playing because an adult who actually knows you bought it for you to play. 
---
And honestly since F76 isn't catered to kids, I imagine you'll run into fewer pedos. I don't know what internet world is like for kids these days but for me on runescape it was a daily problem. 
---
Stay safe and have fun!
---
I keep some in my vending machine on Xbox.
---
NCR! That's all I have to say.
---
It was a glitch they patched with wastelanders :( if I'd been smart I would have made a bunch. As it is I've got 2 lol one on loan to a friend
---
thanks, you too!
---
 "log out or the game will break" 
---
Is Fo76’s motto
---
Arum in the whitespring has a bunch of camp plans.
---
Give this man some uovotes
---
It was updated in patch 18 or 19.  Before you had to perform an additional search to try to get Butcher’s Bounty to proc. 
---
Now, as long as the perk is equipped just getting close to the kill is enough to get it to prov.
---
You think they can really make that happen without screwing something up..... not trying to pick on them but they don't have the best track record at fixing or improving things without breaking them first.
---
But yes. I would like some kind of shared xp system.
---
Aa a fellow Tennessean, I love your ideas!
---
I would like to see Alaska in the game one day. The cold/snow would be interesting to see.
---
I'm on PC. I'll have to use that next time rewards come out. NW just isn't for me
---
Oh damn. Didn’t know. Thanks for sharing
---
Got the script uploaded somewhere?
---
My thinking exactly. Why buy the cow.
---
it's an american holiday
---
I've been a PS user since the PS1.  
---
My kind of games tend to be on PS as well as exclusives.  
---
I'm not super serious either but in all the time it's been out I still haven't finished the main questline and only jumped in a SBQ battle once. I know I hit it but couldn't loot her body but I did get rewards for that event.
---
Hopefully the modules go on sale on the 9th and you manage to finish your set, good luck man praying for rnjesus to be in your favor.
---
the less pvp in the game, the better.
---
xbox one
---
Theres also working toilets and showers that I wish we could have as well. The sink from the pass completed my bathroom but my broken bath and toilet ruin the look.
---
Okay thank you. I'll domybestto not do this. I don't want to unfairly max my settler reputation.
---
They have said already that some score items would have a future mechanic by which they could be earned. I would assume that the ammo converter would be on that list.
---
Yes atoms and fallout 1st are bound the rest isnt
---
If your on PS4 I can help you....
---
It's a post apocalyptic wasteland with other players and you want it to be peaceful????
---
Wait. The legendary modules are included in the sale? I better keep my scrip.
---
If only Bethesda gave a shit about us and their game.
---
Lucky you. My veteran ranger helmet doesn’t get that option.
---
no, i'm on xbox one :-(
---
The community loves you too, my friend.
---
I use the mountain scout outfit with medical glasses and a surgical mask. I really like the look of it. Though I'm in power armor 99% of the time so I dont get to use it a lot.
---
Yeah sorry, on PS4 here as well.
---
Why not play NW?
---
Back at ya kid.  Class act throwing some love at the devs.  They get a lotta crap and deserve some credit.  The game has come a long was since launch.  The player community is very cool and multi-generational.
---
Best of luck mate
---
Like I said in another thread: make the tent  and scrap box available to all players and replace them with xpboost for season pass, and persistent workshops for private worlds.
---
I read this whole thing 3 times and still got no idea what "ruined" PvP. 
---
Only thing I could piece together was Public Groups. 
---
Please if you wanna rant about a issue, leave a clear explanation about what the issue instead of just ranting.
---
Ok. You should probably play something else then? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I run a full troubleshooters for nuke runs and ISS so I get that. Time to re-evaluate my everyday pieces I guess
---
I expect additional free shit is not constructive criticism.
---
I'd also very much like too see the source where we were promised x number of free atoms indefinitely. I would like that exact quote, with the exact amount and where it says indefinitely.
---
Haven't heard anything and they just released a new summer specific road map and it didn't mention anything.
---
I think Bethesda isn't taking full advantage of holidays in this game.
---
Fansnacht is cool, no doubt. The Halloween Event is cool too but I want more.
---
Like make Whitespring a true hub and every holiday decorate it apparently. Have a fireworks show for 4th of July from between 7pm and 2am.
---
Have a New Years Eve celebration from 10pm til 4am. Do a Christmas event there all week Christmas week and also cover the map in snow like GTA Online. There's so much they can do but just haven't.
---
It’ll be atom shop shit probably. 500 atoms to change your hud. People would but it.
---
I honesty don't think it will be as bad as people think, we aren't through the 1st week and I am already almost rank 18.  I play a decent amount, but not excessively.
---
I appreciate the post's awareness for others, but I did know myself in so far as taking berry mentats before radiation rumble, with my unyielding set, mothman event XP, canned meat XP, and sbq brain food :) I think most people need to be aware of the usefulness of INT so I'll always upvote this post!
---
Philadelphia where north philly already looks like a fallout game and the other parts will have alot of historical landmarks. Which would be cool for non philly natives to see. Can get yourself a perfectly preservwd cheesesteak out of a vending machine lol
---
Yeah it was fun. The only slight issue is mobs can explode into pieces, which roll around and can make looting a game of catch the rolling head.
---
That is an excessive number of exclamation marks.
---
The Chinese spies would walk into the state, look around for a bit and the say, “Someone beat us to it.”
---
Group pvp is no longer a thing usually when one group of pvpers hits another then they can start a big fight, but now one person hits one and only those 2 are agro it takes like a hour to get everyone agro to each other for a 4v4 and even then by that time everyone left or accidentally bugs white it's so broken
---
So? Guess what, the game is set in America.
---
The fact that people have to come up with work arounds to finish a daily quest for 250 SCORE points proves that this is a horrible idea for a Nuclear Winter quest. Heck reviving in general is a horrible idea for quests. I have finally seen it in Adventure Mode thanks to people teaming instead of just standing over your body waiting to steal your junk, but even so people still don't die that often.
---
Missed it in 4 too tbh but atleast there were mods...
---
You've come up with a whole stereotype about me based on one comment about Karen here forgetting that this isn't her Facebook page. I absolutely don't care what people think of this game; love it, hate it, whatever, you're entitled to your opinion. You just keep on projecting, though; you're *really* good at it.     
---
Now, come at me with a sob story about growing up poor in Detroit; I could use a good laugh, and that would be more interesting than your pathetic "you're a nerd!" insults.
---
this is NOT a gear based game it's a MMO like ESO its supposed to be a gear grind and a build grind not a quick hop in and pvp experience, if we wanted a battle royal we wouldn't be playing fo76, we wanted out gear based mmo where most of the time the player with the best strat gear and build wins
---
I like to wander the wasteland nude it just sharpens my senses
---
I’m level 120+ and don’t have the fo1st subscription. I stopped carrying ammo for weapons I don’t use, mainly missiles, mini nukes, and 40mm grenades and that got rid of 100 units of carry weight in my inventory. I still carry frag grenades, but only about 20 at the most and sell all other grenade types. I stopped carrying .38, .44, cannonballs, .50 caliber balls (black powder ammo). I’ve slowly been weaning myself off of carry weight reduction perk cards and stopped picking up everything I see. It’s been hard but once you stop picking up everything it gets easier to not hoard stuff. 
---
The real endgame is specializing your build and using only a few main legendary weapons and armor. Once I get a better weapon or armor legendaries, I send the weapons or armor I’m not using to the scripper. I’m not good at pricing stuff so I stopped putting stuff in my vendor, but I’ve never been too lucky with the RNG legendaries so anything I tried selling wasn’t really worth buying when I learned what makes a good legendary.
---
Where is West Virginia?
---
If it worked that way I’d just run around the mission area collecting XP without so much as firing a single bullet. 
---
Doesn’t seem like a great idea.
---
I agree! I love holiday shit!
---
I see them all the time. 
---
What are you looking for?  Watoga has 5 spawns for T-seriess
---
I bet you could bound the vaults in this pretty good too
---
Is this a serious question? In 18 months when have they done anything cool? Even if they had planned a 4th of July event you know damn well it wouldve gotten delayed to July11th.
---
According to some of lore New York is basically a crater.
---
im hoping/saving too but i wouldnt hold your breath
---
About that. Kinda bugs me that it’s collect wood X amount of times, rather than collect X amount of wood.
---
Cause the later rewards players with woodchucker making extra value for the perk. 
---
But a small bug me.
---
:(
---
I’ve noticed that people rarely take the suits in the Airport Workshop (Forgot the name) especially the one in the back of a level 2 locked truck.
---
Bear in mind that they’re of lower level but it’s a free fusion core and easy armour :)
---
Yeah a rant to Beth because you can't gang up on unsuspecting people (or having your friends hide while you be an instigating shit head) shows your exactly what needs to go. Fuck griefers. Bye.
---
If love to see a UK based fallout game.. Lol.
---
That's the plan
---
oh god.. the forums...
---
Pointless post. 
---
This sub is full of over dramatic, whiny, entitled children. They won't listen
---
I paid for a month of the thing and before it ended I got enough junk to last till winter. (Winter is the next time I'll bui F1st cuz they will release the BoS DLC and I will be playing a lot
---
Lol nobody cares about 1v4ing that's boring all we care about is 4v4 team fights with other pvpers
---
Not really lol, considering they’ve done it in previous games in the same engine. They just choose not to enable it for whatever reason. Lag maybe? But, it’s def easy af to implement
---
YEAH
---
Sure thing man :)
---
I buy .38 rounds or trade 5mm for them.
---
Counterpoint, I do buy .38 from time to time.
---
You can always do the quests to earn the plans for full ultracite, x-01 and excavator set
---
No. I haven’t played nw in two days and have played in adventure mode since.
---
How about a "Family Friendly" toggle for Bloody Mess in the settings?
---
Instead of Meat Explosions, it's Confetti.
---
I like to save them up and then throw them straight in the air. They make half decent fireworks. 
---
Actually that’s about all I use the grenades for, plasma is my favorite by far.
---
Neat! This was one I was actually looking forward to unlocking
---
I don't know if it does, you cn see it on the helmet but I dont remember if it was moddable or not
---
It’s definitely a rough feeling. But I’m glad you’re starting to feel better :)
---
Atoms are bound to the launcher they are earned on, and fallout 1st is bound to the launcher it's activated on. Items purchased with atoms, or earned through fallout 1st will be available for both. You don't lose any atoms, so you can switch back and forth and spend them as you see fit.
---
No idea why they are doing that. The bow still has broken sights and animations yet it has many skins
---
It would be even better if you could list all other calibers that you don’t need so sellers will take note and remove them so that you won’t be disappointed again.
---
well if you wanna play that game. Is it july 4th in the game?
---
i cannot remember any online game i've played doing july 4th celebrations. Usually some kind of winter, Halloween, and spring celebrations. 
---
You got some skins. Be happy with that.
---
Trying to finish my T-45 set by finding a left arm, and my T-51 set by finding a helmet. I've had the worst luck over the last few days though.. Running around all of the left side of the map to every spot I know that spawns T-series armor. and can't get either of those pieces.
---
Only one person but if that one person leaves the private server everyone who does not own fost will be disconnected
---
As much as that sounds like a bad idea, makes helping a friend/teammate level without worrying about letting them tags enimes first in an event would be nice. I one shot most things and have to only hit things they hit - I'd be for it
---
Fo1st*
---
Why is west virginia?
---
There are five power armor spawn locations in Watoga. Four can be accessed without any fight assuming you’ve done the Mayor For A Day quest.
---
* One is in the center of Watoga by the downed vertibot. 
---
* One is on the roof adjacent the civic center, also by a downed vertibot. Climb the stairs to reach the roof of the civic center, then cross over to the adjacent building.
---
* One is in the bus terminal behind a locked door (level 3 hacker or level 3 picklock). 
---
* One is on the roof of Watoga Emergency Services building which requires killing a few baddies to reach it. You could skip them if you are fast/sneaky. One of the enemies could be a legendary.
---
* The last is on the roof of the high school.
---
Note that not all locations will spawn or if they do it is not guaranteed to be T-60. If its not the type you want then don't take it.  Server-hop and run the route again after checking the locations.
---
Bro. Do you want some cheese with that whine?
---
Thank you sir or madam.
---
Only the owner needs to have the sub but if the owner disconnects the others get kicked
---
Looks cool and has a built in headlamp (a flashlight). I wouldn't prioritise it over other stuff though, like SS armor or the gun plans you want.
---
No but they have a maximum holding capacity. They just stay at that until you empty them.
---
I would buy 38 if I didn’t have a boat load of it. 44 is trash unless they let us dual wield pistols.
---
Ooo it has a light?  I know someone who.is buying that plan soon.
---
Fallout 76 takes place in West Virginia...
---
Nice thats the next reward i unlock
---
Which is over 10 weeks from now.  If someone hasn't been on in over 10 weeks really care as much about that item.  Also shouldn't people who have been playing more often or longer get something for that.  Example would be Warframe only founder players have Excalibur Prime and no else can get it.  This is saying hey I earn this.
---
It's all good, lol. I've been stockpiling Fusion Cores as I've searched for the final piece for both of my T-45 and T-51 sets.
---
Sucks when you have 3000+ hours and I’m still playing.
---
Yeah, no, it isn’t. Hopefully Bethesda will open the game up to modding *sometime* and somebody can fix it for them. Because I know it’s a small enough issue that they’ll never touch it.
---
600 hours and I never knew that.
---
I never play in third person, so I'd never see it. But it can't hurt.
---
Somebody bought all 1k of my .44 the other day. People do buy it
---
People rarely talk it seems like, and even then it’s often too low or garbled anyways. I keep the volume low, don’t talk or listen to people, and do teams just fine!
---
Does ESO have luck based mechanics such as random legendary drops?
---
I dont believe there are but there are the magical weapon effects
---
It's all good. I guessed you were venting and didn't think you'd go to all that trouble.
---
Myself, I'm waiting for a Beth dev to camp on a public server so I can nuke 'em for the Ammo Converter.
---
Yes I really like it
---
Ah, okay! Good luck, dude.
---
Yes, when activating the light you use the helmet instead of the pipboy. It's bright, warm white light
---
After reading your ticket I have come to the conclusion that there is no way you are older than 12. If you want your voice to be heard you should actually provide feedback instead of threatening to have your mom cancel your FO 1st subscription.
---
Id keep it white tbh. Thats the color i used in my fallout games.
---
Works for me too.
---
Wait if most of the Settlers came from various parts of Pennsylvania then why is Foundation on the bottom part of the map
---
sounds made up
---
And do those peoples items come back if we all play again on that same persons private server?
---
My gatling laser doesnt have the 25% fire rate effect, just the 33%vats one, which is not very helpful for heavy weapons.
---
It was first couple posts on ur profile....ur trying rly dude. But you already tried to flame someone for grinding a game you grinded 1 million times harder. Gtfo kid
---
Level 35 is fine.  Try to learn locations as you go so you have spawn in points if you die.  Or even drop your camp or survival tent.  Death is inconvenient, nothing more.
---
Not a whine just a suggestiom if a lot of the new people dont know that type of ammo hardly sells theyll list it not knowing any better I stay at max caps most of the time so the main thing for me to spend them on is ammo
---
Would definitely be on board with this!
---
I really like insurgent with a miner helmet, the blue ridge Caravan and Firebreather. They look good and speak 76 to me.
---
I also really like the overseer vault suit, leather and jacket
---
I finally got a Bear Arm Puncturing Mod from Project Paradise!
---
Try walking somewhere else before trying again
---
Why as a player who earned an item for playing during the event not have something special.  It is the same with the nw Halloween items or other exclusive things on games.  If you make it where anyone can get it later it feels less special and earned
---
I do the same and agree Plasma is the best.
---
Ok cool I was like god damn I don’t wanna get shitted on
---
They might have done it to help you out and give you caps i do that sometimes when im at max caps
---
When you say items what are you talking about?
---
Don't forget the guy that puts 30 combat knives in his trap base vendor to get foot traffic. Losers!
---
25000 xp. You dont have to deal with nw and you get xp.
---
That’s awesome. I really want this one.
---
Ah, so those aren’t up to RNG then? I just got the game earlier this week so I’m not familiar with most of the quests rewards.
---
I got plans for the t45 and t50 by doing those treasure maps that drop off crowned mobs. I actually had plans for a t45 arm last night. I dumped them all in the blue suitcase at watoga train station this morning.
---
Its not like servers they are Worlds like the open ones but for 8 players and closed sometimes areas are looted enemies killed etc the items in the inventory are safe but everything build in workshops are gone since you will join a new world not the same again
---
Lol I can tell someone was bullied at a workshop one too many times
---
Um.... a lot of people actually like .38. 
---
I also have been using .44 recently on my gunslinger.
---
I can make you T-51b armor if you would like :)
---
Its just so annoying you shouldn’t have to do that
---
FYI: If you're not doing NW daily challenges, you will earn 215500 score points which are 4775 short of required 220275, or 48 times 10k experience.
---
If we include 3 days of double daily score, we get additional 5250 score points, which are enough to get over required score points for level 100 if we ignore score points from experience. Though the margin for missing any day is very small still
---
for free ??
---
Often
---
I went into a NW match, asked if anyone wanted to get the challenge, everyone said yes. We all loaded in, looted and took turns clinging ourselves off the control tower at the airport until we all got it. 
---
I’m kind of shocked that that many people were all willing to actually use their microphones at the same time, but it worked easily enough.
---
I'm not crying you're crying 😭
---
I used to have a set of Vanguard and now use a mixed set and I find it way more effective. Vanguard is popular because people like to see the big Damage and Energy Rating numbers, Damage Reduction is better.
---
Ok. Just saying your issue is avoidable.
---
I just throw them in downtime during events, people usually join in and throw their grenades too
---
I'm with you on that 100%, I was just stating what BGS was most likely to do. Plus, you can get the NW stuff right now from Halloween, and Christmas.
---
 "non-pay-to-win" **LOL**
---
don't pick up anything
---
also i have no idea why you cancelled.
---
If by a lot you mran like 1% of the player base then you're right
---
An animation of him downing bath salts before he turns legendary! Or should it be him spending his winning lotto on Hooters and cocaine?
---
strange, I have the excavator too but I take almost zero radiations in nuked zones, even without rad x
---
Hookers lol
---
Thanks for the detailed list! I'll try out that quest and run through those locations later tonight.
---
It's clearly a bug, kind of silly to ask for a convenience fix to a bug instead of a fix for it. Hell, they're still not even affected by any weight reduction effects
---
Try not using a crap mutation like healing factor
---
I have a sign that says fed76 pricing so
---
Makes events fun and highly enjoyable! People are actually doing events!!!
---
Yea i know i just feel like this should really be fixed. You get so used to the bugs your just like eh. But in reality they are painful lol. Trust me i know i have 826 hours into this game. Which is a lot and isn’t 😂
---
Be honest, you keep the commander in their dressed in M.O.M. garb to RP your twisted fantasies.
---
your post was some bethesda bootlicking bullshit. you got flamed because you deserved it.
---
your salt sustains me.
---
Ultima Online, hmmm I confess I haven't played for quite a few years, but I don't recall any "quests" that would be mandatory grind
---
Great work!
---
I regret that I have only one upvote to give.
---
Rad Sponge is basically a troll perk. If you share that, you're an ass.
---
Building gives Int which increases XP
---
It's not healing factor.  I cannot stimpack at all once the radiation goes away.  I'm talking during the fight itself.
---
Drop sir v9, delta forward base almost any firebase, 9 different spawns in watoga, two possible spawns at camp venture
---
With so many ways to make things slightly easier on players in this game, it would be great for Bethesda to make some of them a reality. I'll probably still keep bulking stuff though, it does make it easier to pull a lot of things out at one time and sell them off to clear out space, but damn that stings a bit to learn that it's only 2 components that have any actual weight reduction benefit.
---
Oh hell yes bud! I’m 25 also, live out in Oregon, and am in serious need of some chill peeps to play with. My PSN is Hundredhands4u, definitely add me! 🤘🏼
---
Worse than ever for me.
---
No, the full x-01 set comes from the enclave quests, ultracite comes from Brotherhood of steel quests, and the Excavator comes from a terminal in Garrahan Mining Co. although do keep in mind these require to be at least level 25
---
Ah ok. Damn. Sorry this is happening. Hope it's rectified soon.
---
All full sets
---
At most 8 percent which is 92 less than hunting and events
---
Israel, it's already a fallout universe here minus the energy guns
---
It’s fine for high health builds. That and a shared ghoulish and you’ll never need a rad away in a nuke zone again. Bad for bloodied builds for sure
---
Yeah it bothers me. It doesnt make any sense.
---
PA has a built in 90% rad resistance. Then whatever is left, gets lowered by RR afterwards. Even with excavator, you'll be at &lt;1 rad/s. This is impossible to achieve in a regular armor (even SS). Only the Chinese Stealth Suit is better (99% resistance). And of course hazmat suit, but it comes with no armor or legendary effects.
---
Shut up
---
This. And get the workshop back that you painstakingly just finished building up before the server decided to crap out.
---
Then like every other blodied build invest in unyielding sentinal and use nerd rage plus seredipty
---
Haha also alligator pets, Nuka World Florida and mutated sharks.
---
Other things to not put in your vendor:
---
Legacies for 1k or less.
---
Bear Arm and Fixer plans for 1k or less.
---
.50, 5.56 and 5mm for 0 caps.
---
No one wants to buy that shit either.
---
Would be good if we could get a .44 receiver for the lever action.
---
Are you on PS4? I need the challenge too and I'm online now - Chez206 😊
---
Ye, thought i read that somewhere. Thanks
---
Once I get those things, sure.  I'm not even at good bullion farming yet and I'm running what I have access to.  Just started more recently.
---
Most people never talk (or listen) anyway, so just do your thing. No reason you should have to miss out on team buffs.
---
Keep up to 50 of cloth, wood, etc in your stash. Stuff that you may end up using but is pretty common all around. Bulk and sell the rest if you find yourself with more than that
---
75-100 of more important things like screws, springs, adhesive, ballistic fiber
---
0-25 of stuff like asbestos that you won't really be using
---
If you have a ton of spare steel/lead/gunpowder/stable flux, just farm the remaining components and use it all up making ammo
---
Just resist the temptation to pick up things you don't need, it may be hard but eventually you'll get used to it
---
If you still have issues, take ALL of a certain kind of item out of your stash and carry it on you, and invest in either armor or a perk to reduce the weight of that specific kind of item
---
I want to set mine to that orangeish yellow color again. I rocked it for so long in 4 that it feels almost wrong to use anything else
---
Just wait for the next big dupe which I hate to say you'll be able to pick a set up for lik 30k
---
The protection from PA is a bit different from regular armor. I can't remember off the top of my head but I think PA has a flat damage reduction of 30% give or take. It might apply to rad resistance as well since its considered a form of damage. So you have that 400 to 500 rad resist plus 30 percent of the rads you take are completely negated. Atleast that's my understanding of how PA works
---
I still don't understand the apparent distaste for that event. It's one of the best, especially with a big group.
---
I’ve been saving up flare ammo. Gonna pop them in the air at my camp at night sometime later.
---
Yea i know right. Like before it was every now and then. Now it’s so common.
---
You can I changed mine to pink but can't remember how to change it back
---
Even it did, the fixer doesnt have a slot to place it but the chinese stealth suit has a slot but no skin lol
---
But it gives bonus XP for everything, if you are not doing events it is superior.
---
You should be able to decide if you want to use a shared perk. Strange in numbers is annoying to me aswell.
---
10% probably know what that site is and I'm not sure it's very accurate. But it's a start. I would rather it be stuffed full of expensive good guns.
---
I’m a Bug or Pumpkin grenade tosser.
---
Herbivore with cranberry relish and brain bombs are a good combo if you can’t keep the canned meat stew in stock.
---
Why is that?
---
This makes me think of when I took a picture of the sunrise at the cabin where Mr Thomas and Winston died. I at first didn't see them behind me but the sunrise is just -chefs kiss-. This is a great screenshot and it is also -chefs kiss-
---
I have a twisted muscle serum that I got for an alt character that I stopped playing. No one has bought it so you can have it if you want it/need it.
---
Quite often. I've even come across a bugged suit that had both t-51 and t-45 pieces stacked on top of each other. It persisted after many logins, I took the chassis and every time I deploy it it still has two pieces. I'm afraid to actually go into it though in case that undoes the bug
---
Yeah that’s the problem.  You’d have people show up and do nothing.   It in a game where the cart majority of enemies get 1-shot, there’s got to be a solution.  At least have people who are on a team share the kills.
---
??? Ur a legit kook dude. I was not complimenting Bethesda in any way. I was talking about people expecting a ten week 100 lvl thing being placed in their hand. What is wrong with your brain that you shit in people for doing something that you’ve done more of than them and then reading into what I said and assuming more shit. I didn’t compliment them. Bethesda is shambles. I don’t get why your salty. I was just pointing out that you’re a hypocrite for what you said. You’re reaching so hard you’re putting words in my mouth now. Go back to doing what you were doing before you commented on my post.
---
Absolutely! :) Do you only need it for level 30? I can make it for up to level 50 if you would like.
---
Jump height for marsupial is too much.
---
Even maxed out there is still negative effects. If you have multiple that cause thirst they will stack.
---
Great retort. 10/10 would read again.
---
I love how they get every single pvp thread locked
---
Awww🥰🥰🥰
---
I live in Massachusetts, so Fallout 4 😁
---
Get a good Gatling plasma or laser and you will find more ammo than you can spend.
---
Big thanks to u/jellonoodle for logging in and holing me up. I appreciate it.
---
Sorry bud with the missus at her house but if you get on for 9 am gmt I'll be on for at least 2 - 4 hours and we can sort you out too
---
There’s a different sub for that.
---
But and this is a big oneone of the biggest ways to get score is the 10000 thing which literally takes no time if your hopping events
---
Open your pipboy. First tab.
---
They should revert the change, and pacifist should prevent you from ever getting damaged by another player under any circumstance.
---
bethesda promised that with fallout 1st subscription people would get persistent workshops, meaning that if you leave the server or logged out you’d be able to head back to the same world and same workshop with all the things you’ve built prior leaving.
---
but bethesda didnt keep their promise.
---
I only subscribed for a month. 
---
Only keep the junk you use on a regular basis, like stuff to make ammo and repairs. The game takes from your stashbox before going into your scrapbox.
---
Drop or bulk&amp;sell the rest as you probably hoarded glass and leather for a lifetime in your scrapbox.
---
For the tent, i don't miss it much. At SBQ fights there are always a few around.
---
Yes West Virginia is ONLY Appalachia
---
I'm still using my old t60 helmet with the bright headlamp for this reason
---
Well, I mean you played the content. So, yeah, that's what it is. It's about the content of a majority of open world RPGs (~60-100 hrs).
---
I've stayed with game past that because I really like camp building and playing with friends who are just picking it up, but that play loop definitely isn't for everyone.
---
Honestly, Kentucky would kinda be like WV, bombs didn’t hit the state too much, except there are areas like Louisville, Fort Knox, Northern KY, Fort Campbell, etc that would be hit, but overall, it remains it’s natural beauty
---
I mean, downtown chicago is already worse than than some places in fallout games, so idk what they would do. Also more shootings here on a daily basis than whitesprings and west tek combined, so they'd probably put too much strain on the servers trying to recreate that. I think tactics did a decent job by showing what a chicago fallout game would be like by being completely broken and borderline unplayable
---
I agree
---
Look at the context of the discussion.
---
Don't worry, we're not too far off from that!
---
I hear you mr sarcasm you can keep your 38 and 44 ammo in there my bad
---
When someone builds up a workshop and then leaves server, it keeps all the things they built in that workshop. So someone else can come along and claim it and it still maintains the decorations. So in this case, someone must have built up the workshop and left the server before you came along.
---
The message itself "yo beth (Bethesda), where my persistant workshops at?" is basically asking Bethesda - why have you not implemented workshops that continue on even after you log out and back on. The person who wrote that is hoping that they would implement a system so that you can claim a workshop, build it up, log off, then log on again at some point in the future and it would still be there.
---
TBH buying the GB plan should just let you craft them. They would be droppable, tradeable, and lootable.
---
I keep Raider Punk in his underwear and a tinfoil hat to allow everyone to RP their twisted conspiracy theorist fantasies.
---
I certainly dont want to tell you how to play the game but..auto builds are not really viable at low levels for the reason you just mentioned and because you dont yet have access to the gun lvls that actually pack a punch in auto. one thing you might consider is to invest in melee perks and use melee weapons for clearing dungeons to conserve ammo while you farm.
---
I don't think that West Virginia is that small?
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Wisconsin : Great lakes and lots of brahmins
---
That's okay, I won't be on at that time. Good luck with your challenge!
---
Yea, I have no idea why a basic feature like text box was not included in the base game.
---
mountain mama
---
Going for vanguard.  Got 4 pieces so far.  60 modules or so.  They aren't perfect roles but good enough for me.
---
Nope, never participated in pvp in this game because its simply not made for it. Of course you wouldn't understand that because you think the pvp community is "large" to begin with. So "large" they removed the pvp servers...
---
It says leave my team if your not gonna do events, I ask how does he know they arnt doing event and why not just remove them instead of sounding like a noninclusive dick wagon
---
I'm not even selling that but it's literally none of your business what other people put in their vending machines. 
---
Fast travelling to a vendor camp is always a gamble. Shit inventory, trap camp, owner logs off during the fast travel period or logs off while you browse the machines, etc. pp.
---
Using either mutation only negates the HP regen from eating the other food, it doesn’t negate the effect you get from it. Ex: Carnivore won’t get HP benefit from eating cranberry relish, but does get the XP bonus effect. Vice versa.
---
Yeah, had my adrenaline spiking once I had all the codes and found the briefcase, worried I would be found and killed before I could launch, but I was lucky. Afterwards my hands were shaking for 10 minutes, coming down from that adrenaline high was awesome.
---
Can you just tell me what it does it does not tell you what it does... even in the stats tab. Just says something about confetti and party time in caps and the duration
---
The Skunk Ape would have to be there.
---
I know. You also don't lose bond. Still doesn't change anything I've said.
---
Unless you're with a team that's together that benefits from the changes as they happen, it's a very selfish thing to do and sucks for the person just wanting to grind out XP. Especially if you forget to change back to Build.
---
Ahh I see thx!
---
I saw killing and ourselves next to each other and my heart dropped also sorry about all that going on
---
I 100 % agree it's not going to be as hard as everyone is saying, today was in a full biuld team (8% more exp when ever exp is earned) and everyone popped a lunch box ( another 100% exp) I went from 119 to 132 in no time and completed repeatable exp challenge at least 15 times now imagine this on a double exp weekend I see real grinders being done before people can even start buying levels
---
I was only able to start it last night, then lost my internet connection. lol I was able to log in for a few hours this afternoon and completed the dailies, so I’m now progressing toward level 3. I don’t see myself making it to level 100 and am completely OK with that. I just want to get the ammo converter and have it on hand for when they redesign it.
---
Not everyone uses what you do. Remember that. I personally have alternative weapons I like to use a and a .44 and Pipe Rifle are included. A Q/E Pipe rifle is good fun.
---
Can’t you just kick them from the team?
---
your lack of self awareness if really funny.
---
sorry i hurt your feelings. 
---
and this post complains about the RNG of magazines, there is no grind lol, but i guess thats over your head.
---
[Ticket Submission Page](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Try radshield.
---
Oh my fucking god, this!! I’ve been saying this to my best friend i game with since this game came out. So many customizing options they could easily put I. The game and they won’t. Watch it come out soon and you’ll have to buy colors in the atomic shop.
---
For anyone that this happened to. 
---
I don't understand why I get negative votes for asking a legitimate question. The question is, is that it? Not trying to be snarky, mean, rude, whatever. I like the game and  love the series. But the game obviously needs more
---
Go hard filling up the stash box while you can. Buy mats from players in bulk.
---
Coast on scrapbox until Beth deserves your money again
---
It's like +25% xp for an hour and a random lunchbox buff.
---
thanks to the ultracite I don't need to farm, lazy to the core here
---
I love that it is now ALWAYS worth it to join a team. I don't really need caps, but I love that you get some caps whenever a teammate finishes a quest (any quest!). I haven't had my mic on when teamed, but I have still been having great luck with these ad hoc teams following the objectives for events and sharing the wealth by allowing everyone to tag enemies. In particular, I love the events teaming: I killed the SBQ with a team (none of us launched the nuke) 3 times last night. The extra xp for completing the event and that turning into added SCORE is really encouraging people to get together to finish events. Love it
---
Just got the T-45 left arm if you are on PS4.
---
I use. 38 ammo, and my B3325 pipe rifle works pretty well. Are you selling interesting stuff in your vendors, like BE lasers or J25 weapons? I hope so, otherwise, remove your vendor and jump inside a fisure. Do us a favor 🙃
---
Cram everything you can into your scrapbox before your sub ends. It keeps its inventory, it just won't let you put anything new in.
---
Other than that I'm kind of in the same boat currently since I wasn't able to re-up my sub but other than having to deal with competition for lead and ballistic scrap I've been dealing fine.
---
Only if you are the leader but it's still just good advice to benefit everyone.
---
YES! MOAR UPVOTES!
---
I apologize could you direct me over there
---
So they understand the severity and amount of players affected.
---
If players stop posting about it, they'll assume it's not that big of an issue and get reduced in priority.
---
Sorry if this hurts your OCD.
---
Clearly you’ve never modded a combat rifle
---
I think the Brotherhood of Steel game took place in Texas but I never played it. I’m near Dallas so I put a lot of thought into Fallout in Texas.
---
I think it would be cool to form like a Pony Express to travel to new areas since Texas is so big. My hometown of Aubrey is the self proclaimed Horse Country USA and the neighboring town Pilot Point is where Bonnie and Clyde died with the next town over being the birthplace of Gene Autry. A lot of history packed into such a small area. Heck, Denton has the Goat Man’s bridge which would make an awesome Cryptid.
---
I think it would be cool to see the fractured Reunion tower in Dallas (the big ball for non Texans) with a huge chunk on the ground. 
---
The state fair with a religion built around Big Tex. The Ft. Worth stockyards could be turned into a slaver auction. Texas Rangers set up in the Alamo.
---
So many possibilities and landmarks.
---
Ah thank you :)
---
And broke some more perks just for good measure.
---
The bonus XP will stack up to 4 times or +100% XP, you can get as many of the random buffs that are available tho.
---
Can't they got rid of that ability
---
It would look the same because Wyoming already looks like a wasteland
---
It doesn't bother me now because I get SCORE for playing the way that I always have. It doesn't feel like a grind (yet). At the same time, I have a bad feeling that it's going to feel extremely grindy at the end of the season when I'm trying to get those last few rewards before the end of the season.
---
The stash box isn’t from the atomic shop
---
As of patch 20 teammates can't build in your camps now
---
Do we know if in this timeline the 4th is an actual thing?  It's a differnt universe so mabye the Brits got so mad at the spilled tea they just took their ball and went the fuck home.
---
I was way over encumbered and didn’t know why. Turned out I had twenty floater grenades. Those suckers are heavy. I ended up throwing them at cars to see what it looked like. 
---
I legit bought the road flares to craft. It’s kinda cool but doesn’t last very long.
---
That’s only in public teams if it’s private you can
---
Use the FO76 map site to find the closest bench to you when you need to scrap. 
---
Keep around 100 of each scrap type you constantly need in your stash and bulk/sell the rest. 
---
Scrip your weapons and armor in order of HEAVIEST to lightest. 
---
Sell your bulked junk in order of HEAVIEST to lightest. 
---
Only keep the weapons and armor that are specifically for your build and vend/scrip the rest. 
---
Utilize quality of life cards/backpacks  for items like chems/food/ammo and keep them on your character instead of in your stash. 
---
Get a full set of unyielding so you can carry 400+.
---
I haven’t noticed it that bad but there was this dummy at uranium fever earlier today using an explosive flamer. He was live streaming and kept talking to his “audience” who it later turned out was 7 whole people. He killed all 3 legendaries before anyone could get a shot in. We all have him thumbs down. 
---
It’s annoying but it’s not a persistent problem. But when you do have a jerk out there doing that it is certainly annoying.
---
From my understanding the freeze effect from arrows will take effect in one hit. But with as low of a rate of fire it has. It’ll will freeze for a second, then thaw off and then fly off before you can even get your second shot off. The good ole freeze gun is probably your best bet for SBQ cc. Imo try finding a quad ffr one. I’m sure a legacy one wouldn’t be awful to tryout either.
---
Nope tried my buddy like to hid welcome mats in my camp wouldn't let him even acces the build menu
---
I don't understand the people who do this, it's not hard take a couple damage cards off so you're not stealing all the kills
---
Apex allows the weeklies to roll over. So even if you miss loads of dailies it's really easy to do catch up. 
---
Their first Season Pass was a proper grind fest. But they learnt from their mistakes and the other seasons aren't as grindy
---
Damn what?! That would have been so nice!
---
You make a good point on there being a risk in fast traveling to a camp my post was merely a suggestion to people who just put that type of ammo in their vendors bc they have a bunch of it and in most cases it will probably sit there forever taking up space in their stash weight and vendors I am well awere and agree that anybody can put anything they want in their vendors thats what makes this game so gerat
---
I was just able too after patch 20 in my friends camp in the mire you sure you weren’t in a public team
---
Did you read the patch notes? Private teams are supposed to still be able to build. If they can’t, then that’s a bug. They didn’t “get rid of that ability”, at least not intentionally.
---
Never had that happen.
---
No we wernt
---
Yeah, does this individual believe they are so well known for some reason that we all should know their motives based upon their username alone?
---
There's a double SCORE week, it's well published.
---
Let's hope it stays in next week's challenges! ;)
---
I promise to you I was I was there for an hour building his house
---
Who know these days Beth will do what they want
---
-chefs kiss- back. Thank you kind stranger
---
I'm claiming mendella effect
---
Define heavily incentivise.  
---
As in skins etc.?
---
But what if you got a flight helmet on but not the pack ones
---
I’ve completed every single challenge.... the challenges themselves are not bugged
---
One sec I’m just searching what that is
---
Wouldn't work in public or course, but private? Would be a godsend. Especially with as much as this shitty game fucking crashes.
---
What are the 24 challenges? I can only think of like 3?
---
PC sadly. :(
---
Thanks for the offer though!
---
various buffs - look under effects
---
maybe it’s that one with the voice syringer. “someone to talk to”. I’m not sure
---
If you don’t believe me I’d welcome you to come give it a try
---
Go into your pip boy and look at your statuses.
---
Good point, but Let’s all remember this is the first pass in fallout, the next one will probably be much much better with constructive criticism
---
Yes, delete your toons and uninstall the game
---
Just pick what you need. As a rule of thumb i always have 50 of each junk in my inventory and just drop the rest. Prevents me from getting overencumbered.  
---
If i know i'm going to be doing lots of crafting (as when i first got the Guass Minigun and Plasma Caster plans) i hit some farm locations and maybe some workshops for only what i need.  
---
Do not hoard. This is the major lesson.
---
Hey. I can build it for you. My nickname is Assass1n1191
---
You can.
---
They said it was something they hope to do in the future... it wasn’t a promise. And they never said when they would do it. They still could do it. Calling it a broken promise is a little misleading...
---
Sure sounds great I’ll send you a quest right now :]
---
Im glad you have a nice weapon that uses that kind of ammo and therefore you enjoy finding that in vendors and I do keep my vendors pretty stacked with15+ 3* legendaries as well as 20+ 3* armor pieces as well as rare apparel like western outfits longshoreman outfit imposter suits and rare plans like cuckoo clocks primed receivers for most weapons and all mutation serums Iike i said earlier I make caps faster than I can spend them thats why I get a little frustrated butvyeah I understand that everyone is free to put what they want on their vendorit was merely a suggestion
---
Lol thanks XD
---
It is. After doing it one time to get credit for "Voices" on that that challenge I can gladly say I will not be doing that daily again.
---
Always check the trade bot at Harper’s Ferry. It’s where I sell any Legendary items I have no space for and can’t scrip.
---
My bad, any other night I probably could make it to help you but saturday is always a ps4 lite kinda day for me.I will send you a psn request tonoerow anyway in sure theres gonna be more rubbish ones like this to help with
---
I think having ESO+ for years desensitized me to the monetization aspect. When I finally bit the bullet on ESO+, I realized how much I valued mtx currency it gives every month. I basically subscribed for ESO's version of the scrapbox, but I also bought lots of cosmetics. When 1st came to this game, I realized that I wanted the scrapbox, and I wanted the atoms that come with the sub. Even if I don't spend them every month, they just keep adding up.
---
To note: If I pay for the sub for a month, I'm going to try to play every day (even if it's just for a short amount of time) for that month, same as I did on ESO. The sub probably wouldn't be worth it to me otherwise.
---
Love these... Makes me want to delete all my pics and make my own.
---
Well, I have a new background. Thank you.
---
I simply answered your question about XP and building teams, you are arguing with the wrong person.
---
Goes both ways. Have been to events where players do all they can to not step in, and watch d other players get over whelmed and F the event because they can’t hold their own or do their job. Not always so cut and dry.
---
first, every sub is overdramatic.
---
second, its okay to be passionate about something you like, even if its a stupid game.
---
And lastly, yes, we are entitled. We paid money for this. We are entitled to a working game that doesnt try to fuck us every chance they get. The opposite of that entitlement would be acceptance of that, in which case i wish you a good fucking. I'll see myself out.
---
That was irony, obviously. It is ridiculously easy to implement such i thing (and i know because i'm a programmer). Just as it is ridiculously easy to implement many other QoL improvements we talk about so much in thus subreddit.  
---
But they can't seem to grasp even the most basic tasks like a good UI.  
---
Ammo converter? omg...  
---
Vendor prices? Just gives us a spinbox for each digit FFS  
---
And BTW: no, it wouldn't lag. It could very well be a client-side setting for you to adjust so it would have literally zero impact in performance.
---
The secret is to allow your apartment to descend into chaos and squalor so that you have the time to keep for Appalachian life organized
---
I’m honored. No, thank YOU
---
You misunderstood what they meant. What it is is, if you have a bunch of water purifiers, only one at a time produces a water. Then the next, so on and so forth. Basically, having a bunch of purifiers is like having a separate storage for just water.
---
It's off for consoles but it tell you if something script or not at the very least
---
High level players and veterans finally have something worth while to grind. 
---
The actual issue shared loot and xp. Public events should be altered to allow everyone to get xp from every kill and loot from every enemy. Level lock the events so that low levels can't come in and mooch free xp and loot.
---
There’s nothing to win lol
---
Unique rewards yeah.
---
True.
---
You really should read the rules of the forum.
---
Play on PC, where you can change it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Thank you! 
---
It’s really a beautiful game imo. 
---
I love the camera function
---
Don’t give them lame update ideas!
---
Running that right now with the gas mask. Looks great and also practical for my low level character..
---
My main gun is 2* bloodied lever gun and I absolutely love it. I have a backup bloodied sniper rifle but Levy is my babe
---
As a cola nut myself I would like a cult for Nuka cola in the factory
---
how on earth is it breaking so quick? i have a gauss shotty with level 2 gunsmith and it lasts for ages
---
also. Lever action is godly
---
You don't need the killing blow. You just need to tag it for it to count. Same as before.
---
Where is the second to last one from? It has a really bleak and gritty feel to it.
---
Just play NW. What? You suck at fps and you can't win unless you got better weapons than others? Aww that's too sad
---
Let’s be honest, there are a lot of things we should be able to do from previous games.
---
And one of the perks of becoming a high-level member of the cult could be unlimited nuka cola
---
Yeah, but do you have to have it equipped when you make the kill?
---
100% it's probably my least used feature... But when I look back at some of the shots I've taken.......it makes you realise how beautiful the game is even if the actual graphics in general aren't amazing.
---
That's a really impressive thing to do IMO.
---
Oops.
---
I picked an event no one else was doing and a bunch of people show up halfway thru, I didn't really wanna sit there and wait for them to chase the mobs around. So I nixed them. 
---
Sorry if I took the fun from others but I was really trying to get an event done. 
---
Probably us just stepping on each other's toes since we're not used to being driven towards playing with each other.
---
Maybe he has a horrible build and need to land like 7 shots to kill a mutant
---
All that work i did for you and you are on the wrong system! 😀
---
It’s cool. I don’t mind trying to help. 
---
I just got that helmet you are looking for, too.  
---
Oh well...it’s now scrap stuff.
---
To expand on this and clarify : your camp has a fixed rate to produce water and more machines only increase storage capacity.
---
Unless you only visit your camp once per session and storage is a priority, many units are a waste of camp budget.
---
There's fireworks on the seasons board.
---
It’s from right behind my camp, just north of Charleston station if you follow the tracks.
---
I still cannot complete Discover Ash Heap (Beckley) and Cranberry Bog (Abandoned Bog Town). Even tried a new character. Private server. Etc.
---
instigating for sniping.. furious for when shit gets real
---
I like Instigating hunting/sniper rifles for the sniping.. furious levers or handmades for closer in work
---
It's what happens when you trust but **dont** verify
---
Playtest Manager: Did you guys playtest it?
---
Playtesters: Sure did!
---
Playtest Manager: Awesome, let's ship it!
---
Dude literally every mmo has storage as a paid feature lol
---
2 shot accuracy is ass.. I like furious on levers...
---
Your alt world scares me
---
Every single underarmor has this size difference that can bulk or shrink your armor. Try road leathers if you want to look bulky
---
Hey besides adrenaline not working , does inspirational work with public teams ? Or just with a actual team you make with your friends ? I can seem to see a difference,  and does lone wonderer work in public teams (dumb question I know but you can expect anything a the moment )
---
I just sold some to a vendor last night. Not sure what the issue is here
---
🤔Sounds like a PC thing. If it is I'm now jealous of PC users.
---
youre repairing to 200% and using some level of gunsmith and it breaks fast?
---
Fallout 3 did anchorage.
---
... or combine the two into the Brotherhood of Mothman. Ad Mothtorium!
---
This is really well done. Maybe you could do some with your camps (or camps you visited) in the same aesthetic style it could be fun to see too.
---
The ladies would never go without play toys....
---
That's just not going to happen.
---
And I haven’t even thought of that until now. 
---
I will definitely try that
---
No, what they said (and this is a direct quote) was: "Private Worlds WILL continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. Budgets and Workshop persistence."
---
Nothing about "hope". True they didn't give a time frame, but it's been 9 MONTHS with zero "evolution". It's bullshit and I'd like to shake hands with the sonofabitch that's going around building these at workshops to spread awareness, but that would be physically awkward.
---
O wow
---
Black lives matter bro
---
i can on ps4 so i Conrad just my fov, how can you play with so little surround to see?
---
Well this could still be done would just take longer cuz everyone would have to become hostile with everyone on the opposite team
---
Hell yeah gimme dat pumpkin colored hud
---
I carry an instigating.50 cal just for events where I can just spray and pray due to the insanely small time to tag legendaries but haven't came across the rifle yet
---
It was at 100% when I got it. I am a sneak rifleman - [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f245ee&amp;d=s01pd2pk2pl2pp2pa0p80p90e90e40c72ic4l71lu2lt2la2l01lb0a72ar2an2ao0au2s70&amp;m=31c8f295&amp;ad=081a7](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f245ee&amp;d=s01pd2pk2pl2pp2pa0p80p90e90e40c72ic4l71lu2lt2la2l01lb0a72ar2an2ao0au2s70&amp;m=31c8f295&amp;ad=081a7)
---
It lasted a little over 2/3 of a westtek run. Seems 2 shoot means double durability loss :O
---
Given how easy it is to complete daily challenges, I can't ever see that happening.
---
Levers are ok but this one not so much.
---
Thinking about it, yeah, you're right.
---
1 headshot did it when close, 2 from a distance.
---
One of the rewards in The Legendary Run is fireworks, but the 4th will be over by the time we get them.
---
The are examples of ways they could evolve. I guess I’m missing the part where they said you would get those features within 9 months and therefore lied?
---
These are all really nice!
---
Hint you keep the scrapbox and it is filled with your junk you just can not add more to it.
---
They are all easy to kill...
---
Oh well just got it anyways cheers for the conversation
---
Thank you! Glad you like them
---
I agree to max daily limit. It feels like a mobile freemium game with the daily caps
---
Cause Bethesda do not want you to play this game 16 hours a day. They want you to get a job, buy atoms
---
Have you thought of taking some with power armor or other things placed around?
---
And the water is irradiated and gave me dysentery. Might as well stick to bathing and drinking from the river.
---
And will this be your answer a year from now? 6 years from now? Where do you draw the line? They dropped 1st, advertised that these are things that would be coming, and there has been no update since then. There has been NO EVOLVING.
---
 Chinese armor will allow you point blank mayhem with a shotgun and your victims won’t know you are there even when you are killing them and their friends from 3 feet away. West Tek becomes a laughable blood bath doing this. Lots of options beyond obvious muted range.
---
Don’t be so uncivilized 🙄
---
I've only launched 1 myself (I don't play NW too much, though I do enjoy it), and I was that excited. Until I realized that everyone could see me on the map, that is. I wound up with 2 kills, but died less than a minute later. It was worth it to see that cloud though!
---
Actually had a great shot of me in my x01 looking at my first nuke ever launched. But it got lost when I upgraded from PS4 to PS4 pro sadly.... 
---
but I will definitely try to do some more variety!
---
Never mind I tested inspirational and it works with public teams, sadly adrenaline is RIP
---
It would be way better if the sink gave purified water. Even if you couldn’t collect, only drink
---

The Brotherhood officer suit is all black and its and under armor so can be shielded too👍
---
For sure! Your photo skills are top notch I look forward to seeing more!
---
It is indeed ass. I dont wanna repair my gun 4 times a day....
---
We are here to clean-up the wasteland and do t neeed more of your crap.  😃
---
All they had to do (and i hope they consider in a future patch) is to add a meaningful repeatable way for everyone to be able to catch up if they missed some days due to innability to play or something.
---
The game punish you if you don't do every single daily/weekly right now and that is not a good design.
---
Its to stretch out the grind, without it you could get so much done during lets say one weekend. They rather see People stretch out theyr playtime so The game survive for longer. And of course they want us to check out the store every Day as well. Its a cheap and infuriating way to keeping the game going. This is what i take out of it at least
---
Pretty sure it is, unfortunately don't think you can do this with consoles.
---
Why does this come up every single day. You can already do this in a roundabout way. And I’m 1000% positive bethesda community managers have seen this request and have kicked the ol peanut around on if it’s something they want to implement or not. If they do soon, they don’t need post #3644 to remind them about it. If they don’t do it, that’s fine because you can literally already do this.
---
Am I the only one here who thinks this? Every other mmo has a monthly subscription.
---
Did they say they would evolve within the 1st year? One evolution is season 2 May include additional season benefits for fo1st. 
---
I don’t know where to draw the line but think it’s a little premature to say they broke a promise. There was nothing in the communication to say those types of changes were anywhere in the near future.
---
It would probably be better than what bethesda has done
---
That one autocomple when they uploaded a patch so all my bugged quest got completed and was awarded atoms , but was hoping to get a fix on these but no luck
---
Can you get a fixer? If you can the fixer plan you might get a legendary one to drop. Or a nice handmade is good to.
---
Because it is awesome, completed my bathroom.  Much better than the worthless ammo converter.
---
 with teammates it works yes, gonna test and see about lone wanderer when your alone in a team. Who knows
---
I didn't say they broke a promise, the other guy did. I was just correcting your statement that these were things they HOPED to add. They are things they said WILL be added and almost a year later, we haven't heard a peep.
---
But only tiny part of MD, doesn't explore MD history nor lore much
---
I've been trying to get the challenge for a few hours now... Have one revive. I'd be happy to jump in and help you both, so we could all knock it out at once! I'll shoot you a message on Live after my next match.
---
Takes it from the stash first
---
Magic:the gathering: arena.
---
And its contentious issue there as well. And why I stopped playing. It started feeling like work.
---
I'm trying not to stress over this game the same way.
---
Bethesda: We have a hotfix coming out Tuesday.
---
Tuesday hotfix: Now no one gets experience points but every hit automatically dupes something in your inventory.
---
Is there no pleasing you people ? You bitch and moan when it’s free. You bitch and moan when you pay for it. If you don’t like it. Don’t use it. It’s that simple. Everytime I look at this sub it’s always people complaining about how BETH is messing the game up. If you hate it so much don’t play it
---
You definitely can on a public team. I built a rad shower for someone just last night. Had to quit the public team first, but then we joined a private team and I was able to build no problem
---
Man I hear this all the time, what a shame. Peaceout76
---
Cuz it looks neat.
---
A pass with 100 rewards that is meant to please the entire fanbase...as crazy as it may be, some of the items there will not please you
---
And brighter Pip Boy light damn it. I can't see shit.
---
I think the 5/5 challenge should give atoms on top of the score
---
same.
---
If your talking about the FO1ST box then yes any workbench takes from there to build
---
Ad Mothtorium, Brother!
---
I dunno, it's just how I play. The only time I go into third person view is in NW to position myself into bushes.
---
The other person who you jumped into defend did
---
Rad Hogs... Yeah this would be a cool name for pigs in Fallout
---
Yes this needs to be doneth.
---
All do 👍
---
To do a 4v4 you would have to exchange 32 shots at the start of every round. 
---
You would have to do this everytime someone died because seeking revenge only activates pvp for the 1 person that killed you.
---
Murdering animals isnt fun. Watch a video where pigs get slaughtered, they cry from pain, shake and die from suffering. Bacon. So fun.
---
Oh sorry I thought you knew about it
---
I miss it it's always fun to see your weapon on your back
---
That's his issue. Again, I was just correcting your statement about them HOPING to add features that they said they WILL add.
---
Which ones worked? Any suggestions would be helpful
---
Thanks for the advice though if i use undearmour  all the garbage I wear would be seen, I want an outfit 😁
---
They should let us choose between like 5 things
---
I really like this idea 👍
---
There's limits to stop those who play 16 hours a day from dominating. if there was no scrip limit they could spend all day turning in legendaries and trying to get the god rolls from mumbles and then they'd get richer and richer. And cap limits to stop them having way more caps than everyone. And then your average player wouldn't be able to afford any kind of godly weapon as they'd just be trading among themselves. 
---
many games have limits on earning currencies. This is not a new thing.
---
so you've taken the 1400 caps from the vendor? buy something. 
---
Or simply stop picking stuff up to sell. Scrap the weapons and junk you cannot sell. put the junk in your vendor for cheaper than normal and it wont be in your stash long.
---
Right. I wrote that backwards.
---
A couple of the kill certain creatures and crafting repair ones. Some don't complete tho so youd need to send a ticket vut apparently they will reward atoms for all that should complete
---
Maybe Hope was the wrong word. My point is it was no promise and was listing future features “such as” which is open to interpretation. Future features could resemble the things they listed.
---
True for suppressed weapons.  Don't shart shooting a double-barreled shotgun in westtek, every green mob in the place will come straight for you.
---
From what I’ve seen. You only receive SCORE from daily and weekly.
---
Sorry, yes. But the later sounds like fun too.
---
I mean people cry from pain shake and the like too in the real world but I'm still going to shoot them in fallout
---
damn is even possible to reach rank 100 then lol?
---
It works on guns close to 200 rof. I have a vats hit chance gatling laser and it melts the queen way more than it should.
---
Died from dissin' Terry
---
Psycho. I only smell flowers and count rocks.
---
You don't know what they are exactly until you use them
---
Had a mod in 4 for this. It was completely unnecessary since i always played first person, but i wanted it. Now that there are real people around i would love to have the option to show my actual loadout on my character. I want my binoculars hanging around my neck and my fire axe strapped to the backback. If a single modder could put this together bethesada is out of excuses for not offering it.
---
I learned this yesterday from a Level 9. I only hope that it was a secondary character played by someone very familiar with the game...otherwise I’m right there with you lol
---
It was a promise though. When a company sells you on a subscription service and says that certain features WILL be coming, that's a promise. I have already granted you that they did not promise WHEN they'd be coming, but it is disrespectful to those of us shelling out money to them that they have given no word on the status of these features. Again, I'm talking about Workshop and CAMP features, not mods.
---
Yes i want my gauss pistol on my hip
---
I would love a system like that 😊
---
But isn't the brotherhood already established centuries y
---
Later and has no sign of worshipping mothman
---
Civil war suit?
---
How am I being a "non inclusive dick". I know they weren't running events because they were in West Tek, Whitesprings, and the national radio array typically. 
---
I was running events, Both the public, such as radiation rumble, Arkos pharma, uranium fever, and ones like distant thunder, AWOL Armaments, riding shogun and any other high level event. Never once did any of the three people in the group show up to any of the events.
---
I was offering advice for people who want to take advantage of the 15% exp buff [which I always share] and perk sharing, to reap further benefits and not clot up other teams. 
---
Or is it a good system for the leader to have to micromanage ever person, or if someone joins an event team with the expectation of people doing events. 
---
I was in a server with 3 maxed out event teams and no one was running events. I know because I was running events solo.
---
I’ve been having terrible problems the last 24 hours. 
---
Twice I’ve had the black screen with just the HUD UI (while not wearing power armor) forcing me to close and restart the program. And I just had a hard blue screen crash while shopping at Whitespring.
---
That’s now how subscriptions work. You pay for the services currently offered in the period of your subscription. If people don’t think 1st is worth it with current features, don’t subscribe until it does. It’s that simple. You aren’t shelling out for features beyond what they said was included when you subscribed.
---
They probably just wanna argue with anyone. Nothing is controversial about the statement if you aren't running events you could benefit more by doing a non-event team.
---
There was extra content. It was free and hidden in the game for dedicated players to discover and enjoy.
---
Carts didn’t have DLC, but we’re not talking about DLC. We’re about fake currency. With DLC, you pay one price and get everything in a nice big package. It’s easy. Fake currency requires constant engagement and attention. People who don’t have the kind of money to constantly throw at it generally don’t have the kind of free time to dedicate to “earning” it with such forced scarcity. Discontent with that extends well beyond “entitled tweens who want free shit”.  
---
It always matters what the past was like with regards to change. Remember when FO76 purchases were supposed to be “cosmetic only”? I guess since times change we should just roll with it, right?
---
Todd will retcon that.
---
I feel like it’s possible but only without missing ANY daily or weekly quests :/
---
Good to know!!! Thx
---
Okay dude. Whatever you say.
---
Ah, I getcha.
---
Ive modded plenty of them but dont like them they break easily I prefer handmades and fixers and since I own a bloodied handmade I dont really mess with combat rifles at all anymore but to your point I know all about mods and changing ammo types in guns with different receivers still dont see hardly anybody who really knows what they're doing using that ammo type unless theyre a pistol build which is probablh a verh low percentage of the player base
---
My first matched I jumped off a cliff by the mines, after making sure to give thumbs up and help emotes before i jumped and killed myself right in front of them. They all just stood there and watched me die next to them.. So I decided to play normally for awhile. Zero natural revives because most of the time my teammates run off and get themselves killed in a place where if I try and rez them I'll get myself killed or they'll just get downed first anyways. Or they spawn on the other side of the map because they never click a place, which happens far too often lately because people end up dying from the storm shrinking instead of from other players. I should have just grinded xp instead, I probably could have made up the 250 points and then some. Lesson learned.
---
Then i have to try my best i guess thanks for your answer
---
I'm almost lvl 20 without really trying yet.  I do farm xp a bit, but I only play a few hours a day, I'm not one of those guys farming xp by the millions.
---
The first week isn't over yet, so unless it slows a lot more I should be fine.  
---
Also I dont play nuclear winter at all, so I miss guaranteed one daily a day.
---
It is going to be tight though.  If you miss a day or two, or get screwed out of score by glitches, or refuse to farm xp at all, you'll probably come up short or at least start coming down to the wire as the season closes.  
---
Though I'm personally only after rewards up to about level 80 ish.  After that it's up in the air.
---
If you where running these events how did you know where they where are you omnipitent now to
---
Or just hit the enemy once... go kill trash and come back to loot the legendary.
---
Billions of Scorchbeast get killed everyday and nobody bat an eye
---
... pun intended x)
---
That really sucks actually. Doing some dailies for atoms was what made me login on a general basis as I'm done with all main quest and most side quest.
---
Nuclear holocaust isn't fun either.  But this is a *game*.
---
I have missed the First 2 days and im lvl 14 know i just want the gatling gun skin looks badass imo
---
not exactly P2W but that the Atomicshop would stay 'cosmetic'-only, yeah.
---
You can, but you also lose their bonded bonus. But it's mainly so if you join a server with 2 or 3 event teams you know you'll have help with events. 
---
If you see 3 or 4 building teams you might realize people are just farming mobs on this server.
---
Lol, I wish I could have some of that luck though! I found T-45 twice last night and both times it was the right leg, right arm and torso.
---
Feels like the game is going out of its way to troll me, haha.
---
i'd put 1\* legendaries in for 30000 caps if they did that because it's silly
---
Yes. And the color of your light. Im calling it now.  They're waiting for people to get used to the shitty green and then they'll try to charge atom points for it.
---
Have a regular one no plans someone gave it to me
---
Yeah same tho I’m not sure I’ll be able to keep up. My weekly quests haven’t been terrible (not sure if they’re the same for everyone) so it wasn’t too hard to knock it out in 3 days but knowing Bethesda, they’ll prob get grindier and grindier as time goes by. Good luck! I’d really like to hit the end of the board!
---
Yeah that and the pa paints, and gillie paints are really all I'm after.  Everything else is just icing on the cake. So about lvl 80 I think.  I'm not looking at the thing right now tho.
---
Exactly lol, that works too, clearly 6 people have trouble changing cards, I'm sure they'll figure it out one day
---
I think it's going to be useless , because the moment you make the public team people will join and perk gets disable , I think
---
I was planning on doing the same, using the T-51b as the helmet but I didn't. I dealt with it. Heh, if we can all tell Bethesda that this is what we want, please, let me know. I will tell them.
---
Would rather have that than this current shitty tag mechanic.
---
[End game boss for next major update, the Rad Hog](https://i.imgur.com/PzabJoB.jpg)
---
Get an alt
---
Yeah the pa paints are also cool just want the gatling skin as i love the gun but hate the look if it lol
---
Fachnaut robot gives free food and drink, instant completion of various daily challenges also makes food and drink meters trivial, weapon repair kits, allowing instant repair in the middle of fights, doesn't matter that the Queen ones are better, they're still selling them! Cosmetics that allow you to hide better in Nuclear Winter where the default look is bright blue "hey shoot at me" jumpsuit! Fallout 1st, allows people to respawn wherever they want as well as being able to scrap/store junk anywhere on the map as well as infinitely!
---
Various advantages there over free players!
---
Playing the wrong game my guy
---
Congrats on winning the game I guess?!? I was running a bunch of events yesterday. I was so overloaded with rewards, but after spending a half hour shedding what weight I could, I had to turn the game off and wait for train stations to replenish their caps and the legendary machines to reset for the next day just to finish selling it all. Everything about this game begs me to play, and yet the economy continues to tell me to stop and do something better with my time. So weird.
---
Not entirely true. A weekly is repeatable. You only need get XP in order to get more SCORE.
---
Get fucked. You were wrong.
---
I do Forbidden Knowledge “runs” by going through Whitesprings Bunker, VTU, and AMS HQ Watoga. I’ll go through the desks and file cabinets, and write down where the Technical Data are. Pick up one at a time, turn in, go back and get the next one. Tedious, but this is the only way to prevent build up of duplicate junk ones and get the BoS rewards.
---
Yeah me too wish you best off luck aswell
---
Oh, I wasn't being negative. It's a valid question. 76 doesn't make its depth real apparent on the surface, but it's definitely a game that rewards exploration. There's something to discover on literally every mountaintop and every valley in between, but usually not a lot to indicate it. Once I leveled enough to not get curb stomped by a lvl 5 mongrel, I started cross country exploring, and that's the sort of play I like. 
---
But as far as traditional, mainline content? Yeah, it could use more. I mean, BGS is trying to fix that, first with Wastelanders, now with seasons and another Brotherhood themed quest line in the fall, but it's taken some time, for sure.
---
sucks to be you.. gotta admit at tmes like these Im pretty glad I dont hoard mountains of useless crap...
---
I'm a pa junkie heavy tank, so pa skins are needed for aesthetics and the gatling gun is my bread and butter.  The gillie suits just look dope and my mule might look nicer in it.
---
Exploration more endurance. I've made it to level 260 with my endurance at -2 due to addictions. Think I'll be alright roaming the map. You know what I want to do? Join 4 random people in a team to build things. Said no one ever.
---
Do encryptid when possible for plan :)
---
I prefer Nuka grenades, personally.
---
also 2 of my alts are 50 and they have decent Legendaries and stuff in their vendors 
---
sometimes i just go afk in my camp while i do other things and stuff sells. Level means nothing.
---
Nah.
---
You can check your map between waves, they are highlighted on it. It takes like no time guy.
---
Or a game that teaches you to manage your resources effectively knowing what the limits are
---
God, yes. I was such a big fan of this. I hope they put it in 76.
---
Yeah i also like the gillie stuff Espiacally the hunting rifle skin want to build a stealth sniper once i unlocked the whole set
---
The whole PTS is doing it for free...but still nobody at Bethesda takes them really serious
---
Ya
---
2 shot explosive guns break 4 times faster then normal guns. 
---
2 shot or explosive would break 2x faster. 
---
Tse guns are horrible now since the update. Junkie and bloodied are the only good guns.
---
TLDR: Use public teams to take advantage of the repeatable XP challenge. Stack your Lunchboxes and XP buffs. In 6 hours over a weekend you can get reliably get 10 or more (more for the early ranks) SCORE Ranks from 2 days of daily challenges, the weekly challenges, and running events/dailies.
---
I missed the first day of challenges and got to rank 11 in 10 hours Wednesday from the Weekly and Daily challenges, except for leveling up 3 times (got 2/3 level ups). I did the repeatable XP challenge 6-7 times (untracked it after it took 5 minutes to catch up after cooking). This was solo for half of it and in a public Event team for the other half, using just Cranberry Relish with 10 Intelligencs, and without using Bloodied/Unyielding, Carnivore/Herbivore, or Lunchboxes.
---
Thursday (yesterday) in 3 hours I went up two more ranks to 13 and ended 100 SCORE short of 14 from finishing the Level Up weekly, the dailies, and the repeatable XP challenge. Four of us got together and made a public Building team (+4 Int), stacked 4 Lunchboxes for a +100% XP boost ***(You can stack 4 Lunchbox buffs)***, and ran events and farmed enemies. That was 2000 daily SCORE and 1200 SCORE from the repeatable. Tagging enemies at Line in the Sand with an automatic Tesla got me 200 SCORE alone.
---
I could agree with that. Something like near teammate kills you get 30% of the exp or something. OHHH maybe that can be a perk card or legendary perk card!!!
---
&gt; the challenges that require you to have the killing blow on a legendary mob
---
Which challenges are that?
---
I want to holster the 30 to 40 guns I have on me all the time lol.
---
Yea, where do we keep our guns? It’s weird I pull out mini gun of nowhere lol
---
Well good luck with your future build.  At least it doesnt need rep so it should be a pretty quick set up if you can get the legendaries for it.
---
You have to check the silo status first. You were given a silo holotape by modus. If you lost it, you can buy another
---
But I like my one star exterminator combat leg armor piece
---
Thanks you too
---
I'm confused, if you know your stash is almost or full and u are at daily script, why bother picking a legendary up if its not something your going to use but script?
---
They aren't talking about people who just dont play; but little timmy who has never played before, and buys the game sometime during season 2 or later
---
sell them. people buy legendaries for scrip. stick them in your vendor. I usually pay up 700-800 caps for 3\* weapons in vendors.
---
because it invalidates the possibility of any future angry threads on reddit..
---
This hasn't been a thing since Fallout 3.
---
You know what I really miss? Isometric turn-based combat. They really should bring that back... smh
---
Idk but the idea of leaving legendaries on the ground just seems absurd in game logic
---
Enjoy your downvotes. No fight. Only hoard.
---
Every day. EVERY. DAMN. DAY
---
the one in your vendor for 4500 caps?
---
Big mad
---
You mean a disco ball my brotha
---
og game was like a day or so.. wastelanders.. a year
---
Is this a thing? I really hate gouging prices so my legendaries go for cheep (i think) intended for low levels to be able to get their hands on a nice weapon. More times than not a high level buys all my stuff and runs right to the exchange. Kind of tees me off I say.
---
Prior to Wastelanders we basically over slept and missed the initial alarm, so within a day late.  
---
Wastelanders now implies it's been a year (as the Pipboys have all updated by a year) and you're some nutter who lived in the Vault all that time so now there's no food left and **you seriously need to leave!**
---
But if it has no use but script then why pick it up? If you see a nocturnal mingun do you pick it up because "game logic"
---
Yeah I do thanks for correcting me :]
---
Your words are warming. Thanks again
---
I’ll be on at some point tonight, just not sure what time - target is midnight EST.
---
PSN is aj ninetyeight or in game aj-98
---
Camp is on a power transmission tower just S of monongah power plant, at the T to go to Bolton Greens.
---
If the serums you need are not in the machine, no sweat - I have the mats to make more.  Last I logged out, I was in WS, so access to a chem bench is also not a problem.
---
Yeah, no.. it’s 6,000, right next to my stalker walking cane for a cool 8K
---
I see now, thank you for opening my eyes
---
That's sharp.
---
Or even just sell them or drop them for others to pickup.
---
Now it's just an annoyance to deal with.
---
As others have said if you have time load up on scrap, that way you still have some time to adjust back into well ya. Honestly putting the scrapbox ( a game changer when it comes to storage) is a very well stupid idea. Now yes I understand it a major favor or when it comes to FO1st but still, making it free would give BGS a lot of goodwill. Not to mention making the game a a lot more enjoyable
---
Enclave is also pretty bulky.
---
Mic drop
---
I haven't found any legendaries I wanted yet at a vendor bot, but I have found lots of You've been insult notes and propaganda flyers to add to my collection though.
---
After patch 20, i found a chassis with both t-45 *and* t-51 pieces in it. It just works 🤷‍♂️
---
And I’ll sell you my Fasnacht Sun Mask for max caps
---
I can beat most of you pve sissies to death with a mule, it’s not about dominating, it’s about being able to fight against different builds in real time. NW is fun but it’s not as enjoyable as fighting other pvpers, pvp in adventure has far more variables and there’s not 20 minutes of loading screens every time you die. Some of us like to grind for better gear, fight better builds, and actually put in work to be decent. NW doesn’t allow any of that, it’s just fortnite in the wasteland.
---
And the meta was to use a dragon, half-rifle half-shotgun!
---
Are you saying that it's "only" a display bug?
---
They always are.
---
Yes and no. Some of them display but dknt complete some display and complete. I noticed they stayed the same for a long time until i marked them
---
\*New Vegas

[some youtuber already got inside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Thats not black... thanks for the response though 👍
---
1st doesn't allow you to scrap wherever you are, those are scrap kits you're talking about and sold separately. Also to be fair 1st is sold separetely of the Atomicstore, they have their hands in both, premium shop and premium subscription. I'm a critic of the store since the very first announcement of non-cosmetic stuff but if we critice we need to be fair and stay to what's actually there and there's enough to criticize
---
I've got slightly taller walls in my CAMP bedroom, and hope this wallpaper and the later unlockable glowing planets wallpaper blend nicely, so I can have the stars one lower, and the planets one higher up.
---
Disagree. By trying to prevent this problem, the current "tagging" system just punishes those who actually -want- to work together, rather than doing anything to -encourage- or reward teamwork. Plus, there's a super easy solution to your problem, already usable in-game: if someone is just leeching, rather than contributing anything, and if it bothers you, you can kick them from the Team.
---
I understand the essence but in actuality it would backfire. I think new players are at a disadvantage with much of the xp grind as their focus is mainly to survive. High level players have the best tools and resources to max their potential. But that's sort of the point. But I'd like there to be a way I could carry some low levels on my coat tails. Give them a bump.
---
Unrelated but is anyone else having their team disband after every game of nuclear winter? It's really annoying
---
If you are outdoors, fallout 1st let's you scrap anywhere, just plop down a tent!
---
If it was low-level that could be a fun, but temporary, thing for a relatively new player. Otherwise it’s scrip.
---
Just had same thing 30 min ago...
---
Before fast traveling, i talked to her to finish daily ally quest...
---
Fast traveling to wayward, and so did the ally..
---
Running back to camp I geuss...
---
After 30 min and multiple fast travel she still did not return at my camp
---
If you are melee, those are pretty good - something like 140 dmg, IIRC.
---
Less than 1#, plus heath regen - not a bad deal.
---
Lmao you really got me, that was good
---
Look at the responses here. A lot of people use .38. Just because you or I don’t, doesn’t mean other people don’t.
---
You mean to tell me we were waging war on the Virginians this while time?
---
I wish they had guild quests and memberships like Elder Scrolls. There are so many ways this could be implemented and it would be neat to explore. Your idea for Mothman sounds great.
---
&gt; If you were to do all the challenges on the season you would finish it two weeks early. 
---
You should be careful about spreading misinformation yourself. The math has been done already, barring the recurrable XP, it's impossible to complete the season on challenges alone, so the 2 weeks early thing is misleading.
---
It's only possible because of the recurring XP score and whether that's gets you to completing 2 weeks early or not at all depends entirely on the person playing.
---
More like it’s exposing how bad legendaries are if there’s some that absolutely has use to pick up. They could fix that simply by not having a scrip limit
---
I was using a level 35 TSE handmade on my alt for levelling at westek and with 1 in gunsmith i could do a run through that and then go do an event or two without repairing
---
It doesn’t bother me, just pointing out the side-effects. Choose your poison! I remember people going out of their mind when people were camping and not helping out at Fasnacht. This would be every day, every hour, camping.
---
I'll have to look into that. I usually use my anti armor prime lmg for sbq, it does crazy damage to her. I use the vamps gatling laser with my bloodied build to keep me alive in hairy fights, and the prime ammo is so cheap to make I have loads of it.
---
Sounds like you didnt need them, then why the complain
---
I can’t believe that’s a thing. This game is fucking embarrassing.
---
Did you watch the video? The maths are pretty clear. Alot of people are working it out wrong - working it out from rank 0 instead of 1 and doing exactly 10 weeks when likely it's more.
---
Oh sorry, I thought it was.
---
There's the hat and the helmet. Been like that since launch
---
What do you do with that much water? Sell it?
---
Yup. That's by design. They want to make you feel uncomfortable enough that it'll pressure you to pay for that discomfort to be removed or relieved.
---
It's quite sinister if you think about it.
---
female or Male? witch costume for sure if female or tattered dress. Male, greaser jacket and jeans or union uniform
---
You overslept a year! Check your pip boy. Reclamation day was a year ago!
---
I finally did radiation rumble last night. Feels good man.
---
I just want to see their levels. I don't care to buy from anyone below lvl 100
---
Why am I allowed in the silo if I’ve already launched it? I couldn’t go into Charlie but it let me in Alpha.
---
Well without that my gun can last a week without gunsmith before I repair it. Guns that can be modified into auto type variants have really high base compared to guns like the lever action.
---
Haha well congrats! Head on over to r/daddit if you haven’t already.
---
I've done the math myself counting from Rank 2 as you should. You're short 53 rounds of recurring XP.
---
It will do that from time to time......
---
I have a feeling no one wants to start it and get stuck with no one turning up to it. One of my team mates started it and i joined in as soon as I could (was in the middle of wrapping up another event) but there was only 2 of us and it was a mess.
---
TBH I dont even know how to start it. I'd work it out but I find that whole area a maze having only done it a few times
---
Had the exact same this about the same time yesterday and I feel your pain.
---
Hopefully not.
---
So you never watched the video? At least watch it to compare how you're both adding it up, I'm curious who's right and who's wrong.
---
I have both! Thanks 😊  union looks cool I'll wear it. Witch costume is nice too
---
F off man I've pvped for like almost an year till they removed survival and I can guarantee every single pvpers got them cookiecutter builds and weapons. Only variables you get are from these unaware non pvpers that be wielding something like pipe revolvers and they rarely fight back. Even if they do, it ain't a challenge at all
---
They will most likely be up for the PTS reopening.
---
No body is even buying them anymore... I just removed and dumped 55 masks that I had gathered from the event. I kept one each of all of them and trashed the rest.....
---
I see the responses and Iagree that everyone is free to sell whatever they want in their vendors however as a decent lvl player (280) and someone who's been llaying a lot the past few nonths bc of the pandemic I know that the percentage of peolle that use that ammo is really small hopefully theyll fix the ammo converter so itll add value to all ammo and we can really get the ammo we all need by scrapping what we dont use
---
I do like them! Bethesda should do community loading screens. It'd be cool to see them ingame. 
---
I'm still dipping my toes in FO76, do you recall where 5/9 (the one with Mars and our moon) was taken?
---
The 5 daily challenges are the one on the daily score list.  I think there came 7 listed if you count the NW and the complete 5 challenges.
---
That threw me off too.
---
I have been betrayed and lied to
---
If you are level 14 you are right on track
---
Adds up but its glitchy you might need to level up in nw to get it.
---
Level 50 is better than having level 10+ players who have a bunch of like low level knuckles in their machines for 30k each.
---
Is was just 2500 for the final rank which unlocked the Ghilie.  There were other ranks you had to unlock first.  Like the Loveseat.
---
Think it was like 14500 xp total for the Ghilie.
---
O weak dude
---
Couldn't agree more - many other games work that way, and before playing the beta, I'd just assumed it'd be the same here, too. And the "tagging" system makes sense for when it's random players just happening to cross paths, but for events, and especially for Teams, still needing to "tag" things to get XP is wildly counter-intuitive. It's incredibly frustrating, too; either you're forced to use underpowered gear or playstyles you don't like, just so you're not constantly screwing over your friends, or it becomes a race and competition, "who can get to the enemies first?" And I don't want to be forced to compete with my friends when we're trying to play co-op...!
---
I don't see a "Daily score list" or any of these challenges listed.
---
I got the Bear Arm plan first time I did it where all 3 survived last week. I dont really play melee though lol. Was hoping for the stimpak diffuser plan
---
It’s a play on words. It’s actually a time sink.
---
Thumbs up or wave emoji when joining the team. I kick anyone who doesn't at least emoji spam.
---
Pretty sure this bug is different than the previous one, even if the result is the same. 
---
The fixed the old nuclear winter auto complete I believe.
---
I've been on teams a bunch recently for the event XP and never used a mic. If people have had issues with it, they never kicked me. 
---
Also I find a lot of times when in in a public team everyone is doing there own thing anyway.
---
It’s a very clean sink....it goes great with my kitchen-less camp.....
---
Map, upper left corner
---
Yup, every other sub has people asking build advice etc.  This one is about missing features and bugs.  Because the game is missing features and has more bugs than a hundreds average games combined.
---
Yes and no. I like the idea of raid public teams and I can't wait for 96 to open but the down side is you would get alot of people who hadn't done the raid before, aren't prepared for it or just want to be carried. The raids were vicious if you hadn't done any research or didn't have the right gear or just weren't prepared for it.
---
I did. The dude made an assumption regarding the day the season pass will end, based in "mid month" update and wording of "around 10 weeks".
---
I didn't think it warranted mentioning since I went of what is actually known which is 10 weeks. If Bethesda sticks to that (and they need to at a minimum), you definitely fall short with challenges alone.
---
This whole thread is a lesson in critical thinking and not following things blindly.
---
Thank you! And yes that would be awesome!
---
The picture is taken right above Wren at The Crater, raider camp. Do ask again if you can’t find it
---
The daily score list is the one that replace the Atoms dailies.
---
I feel like this what they kinda wanted it's a apocalyptic wasteland people should be gouging each others eyes for a source of protein!
---
You should have a sense of rush when you come across a player, are they going to chop you into little pieces and force feed you to the settlers or give you some purified water and let you be? 
---
You tried to launch a nuke of course there's going to be people trying to get in on the action why do all the work yourself when you could have a someone do 80% of the work and you get the profit! 
---
All jokes aside. I've actually always wondered why a nuke silo isn't locked to a team or one person it's something that seems like it's intended but this fallout 76 we're talking about so I don't know
---
You should also be able to drop keys. 
---
Just picked up my first duplicate today on my main, a level 315. 
---
Big F
---
There is nothing in my upper left corner, just says Menu.
---
Oh wow this explains so much
---
Because when I join a server that has 9+ people all saying they wanna do events. Its frustrating when no one shows up to any events.
---
Thats awesome.  I hope you go back and play some of the older games in the series.  Start with 3 if you're looking for a similar experience but you can go real old school and try some of the real early entries into the series.
---
Unfortunately from a business perspective it rakes in so much money that there is no reason to remove it
---
Yeah, this is an old bug that was around before the S.C.O.R.E. was released, so it'd make sense for it to be fixed before doing an overhaul to the challenges system right? Apparently not.
---
I did however notice one way to trigger this automatic completion of challenges which is to play Nuclear Winter **before** first joining a regular Adventure world without initializing any of your daily/weekly challenges (which is done by logging into a regular Adventure World). I did this once because I just wanted to play some NW for a change, and all of a sudden all of the challenges popped up on my screen as being completed, but did get a single Atom for having them be completed.
---
I logged back into Adventure, and they were all "completed" so I couldn't earn any Atoms either.
---
So make sure you log into Adventure first before NW to prevent any challenges from auto-completing and stealing your rewards.
---
I'm also unaware of any other causes for auto-completion, but this is one that I've experienced a couple of times before.
---
You mean you don’t enjoy magically pulling a weapon out of your butt??
---
I miss holstered weapons too 🙁
---
Thanks for the info. I tried using cryo bows(lvl 1 &amp; 50) against ghouls and I could barely even notice anything. I think I may end up just sticking with a few cryolators and getting all my crystal from lucky hole just like my lead
---
Not build, bulk. And I just noticed my typo. Fuck.
---
They are useful when you haven’t been playing for 300 hours and acquired better. Without cap limits, scrip limits, gold purchasing limits, scrip scrapping limits, everybody has the same full god mode build and one shots everything in the game and boy wouldn’t that be a whole lot of fun to keep logging in for. It’s perfect in its imperfections.
---
Then don’t collect it.
---
Level doesn’t really mean much, beyond the variety of what’s being sold may be larger.
---
Low level could be a mule camp, at which point, might be good stuff (or just like any other camp, not).
---
I’m 209 with 3 machines - but there is only one legendary.  The remaining 89 items are armor and weapon plans, bulk acid, serums, bobbleheads, magazines,  and mods.  Occasionally, I throw in some outfits or underarmor.
---
Point is, very little is level specific, so the pool of potential buyers is much larger.
---
So you can do other things like explore and just have fun....
---
At least that’s how I feel. From a design perspective I would want people to experience the whole world, not just grind legendaries non stop because we have them the ability to exchange them.
---
Don't forget gold and score limit as well.
---
Well based on your statements you seem to be able to solo them so that should be fine then rightbit mean if theyvarnt on your team even you dont get the bonus
---
Latest patch notes make it sound like it might be better? I'm about to login with the wife and play, so I'll take it out of my stash and see.
---
Patch Notes for Stanley:
---
* **Animations:** The Stanley Skin for Grognak’s Axe now uses the correct two-handed swing animation when attacking in third-person view. 
---
* **Art:** The preview image for the Stanley Skin for Grognak’s Axe no longer extends beyond the screen when inspecting the item in menus. 
---
* **Grognak’s Axe:** When modified with the Stanley Skin, Grognak’s Axe now correctly appears in Weapon Workbenches.
---
Worded badly indeed. It actually says you "will get SCORE from public events and leveling up"
---
Ghillie suit was the 8th in a series of items. It was only 2,500, but you needed 14,750 for all of the set
---
Cheers :)
---
Supposedly a team of modders from the F4NV project are ironing out the final details for a Fallout 4 mod that'll accomplish this.
---
After that takes off, I'm sure Bethesda will shamelessly copy them.
---
I’d be glad to help but unfortunately i’m on pc
---
I would still like to see the levels when looking at a camp though, I’m not saying this will fix anything, it’s just a QoL improvement and honestly gives people a better idea of what could be sold at the camp.
---
No problem.  
---
I'd kind of enjoy it if they did these updates every year and things go progressively more dilapidated until it's just like one broken down Mr. Handy jabbing you during character creation just repeating "Get out!"  
---
But I imagine that would make a poor experience for new players.
---
Yikes no idea what any of that means, sorry.
---
I can solo almost any event in the game, including radiation rumble and Arkos pharma. But those events go much smoother with multiple people and the top tier rewards are actually impossible to achieve with one person.
---
Yup it’s been acknowledged and escalated by community managers. It does sound simple but probably more complicated than we would know. 
---
Anyway it is possible. Build two doorways back to back. Add wallpaper and then replace them with a solid wall. It’s a little labor intensive and uses double your wall budget but it works and looks very nice.
---
Also .44 and Western Revolver
---
If on PC you can do a ini edit and change them both. It's stupid simple and just weird that it's not supported vanilla.
---
My bad, upper right
---
Have you tried messaging them for help instead of making posts based on knee jerk reactions
---
Nicely done sir!
---
I went there the first time like level 39 when it had been nuked and it's been the worst moment so far. My health constantly dropping and hordes of ghouls nearly twice my level when I just wanted a dumb sword for the mistress of mysteries questline D:
---
Yeah I agree, my parents were too strict when I was growing up and it really messed me up. I got in trouble at school once and my mom assumed it was because I was into “violent shows” like Pokemon and Sailor Moon so she stopped letting me watch them lol.
---
I think as long as your kid is mature enough to understand that things they may see in media like movies and games aren’t real and aren’t things they should imitate in real life, then most things should be fine by that age. Not sure I’d let like an 8 year old play Fallout (for one thing I don’t think they would understand a lot of the nuances of the games) but 12 should be fine.
---
Anyway OP, I’m glad you’re enjoying the game and please continue to have fun!
---
At what point has it actually been known to be 10 weeks? It clearly says "around 10 weeks" not "definitely 10 weeks on the dot". You've assumed in your maths yourself. This guy clearly has more reasoning than you do.
---
I understand you point.
---
I hate it when games create a flaw in their system (in this example, stash limit) so they can sell you the solution.
---
It's even worse than loot boxes, seriously, pretty low on their end, and it really shows a company doesn't care about it's customers.
---
Jesus christ man. I don't see how this post has rubbed you the wrong way so badly. You're literally just looking for anything to complain about. 
---
But yeah I did message people and got no response.
---
I’m at about the same spot. I’ve missed one NW challenge.
---
The same cards, this is Bethesda!
---
No no, we have plenty of hooters in florida
---
Is it possible to get banned for this?  I just switched from console and am unfamiliar with what the 'anticheat' software looks for. (I'm an idiot I always assumed it looked for changes to the directory and included files)
---
I would love to do this by the way because I'm not the biggest fan of the green (always used red/orange in my fallout games)
---
Looks to be working correctly now, and I can confirm that I can remove the Stanley mod in the workbench. So excited to have this weapon back as I got it early in the game and mine has the Executioner perk!!!
---
I see that, I just don't know what a daily challenge is. Nothing says daily challenge.
---
Lools lole thats them walking up to the new wedigo collossus event
---
When I go to the armor bench, the clean mining hat does not show up to be modified?
---
I watched that video, now I know why my anti armor lmg seemed to just melt enemies, I've got 50% limb damage on it. 
---
I guess I did notice health bars on scorbeasts drop rapidly after a second or two with my gatling laser, too.
---
Challenges are under the challenge menu... they are all of the challenges you’ve been completing for score...
---
Well thank you kind sir!
---
It is worded badly because every day there has been a challenge to complete public events. They meant it in the way that you will be doing events which will complete challenges, not that the events themselves will earn score.
---
I'd understand that if there wasn't a whole gaming ecosystem full of passes. Games take stuff from each other all the time and one look at any other pass system shows they use each other to make them better. 
---
This challenge system is about as anti consumer as it gets in terms of catching up. Even some of the first pass systems allowed weekly challenges to stick around until the end so late comers could catch up.
---
You mean like every single other person on this sub whines when we have a good thing but it makes them uncomfortable and has to go try complaining about a real problem like why won't the queen land properly anymore or with the alpha from the wolf event dosent drop legendaries
---
I would of gotten it today. If my weekly challenges didn't bug. Lost 1000 score :'(
---
I’ll help but u gotta help me revive u as well
---
New Vegas? Sorry my bad then.
---
Given that is the case, that's even worse. There has never been a Bethesda Fallout game with this feature at all.
---
I wasn't referring to you, it was just a general statement. I find games these days simply way too casual. I love the history of this game and I like this game a lot. But after playing a few hours a day for a month it seems they've covered just about everything. this isn't a Jeb I'm just trying to make sure I didn't miss anything because after a month if it all boils down to dailies then they really need more put into the game
---
Yes anything done in a crafting menu pulls from the box
---
You can’t ignore the fact that the company creates the issue so that they can then sell you a subscription monthly. Paid content should be extra content, not basic quality of life content.
---
My Gatling gun which does 500 or so dmg a shot uses 5mm. The ammo machine from the raiders basically make me have infinite ammo for that gun. 
---
For the SBQ I use prime gatling plasma which the ultricite plasma cores are so easy to make and gives tons of ammo per craft. Each bullet from that gun deals 100 dmg per hit on her face. My plasma Gatling legendaries are bloodied FFR.
---
You are ahead of schedule. You should be around 15 to be on track IIRC
---
lol i'm at 15 and happy, stop crying.
---
I'm betting you're ahead of the average. I've got most of the dailies and all the week, and quite a few of the repeatable, and I'm only at about 15.
---
also yes
---
16 rank but I got hit with that bug from earlier so I lost out on a few points.
---
Been hitting up encryptid &amp; scorched earth for xp
---
A full uny set with a few god rolls took me 9 days.
---
Bruh i want to have a good time not just spend all of my time grinding doing plain ass quests
---
I think it's more then 14,750 I got the glowing  skeleton yesterday after 9 hours.
---
 im still grinding for the fur jacket I've been doing it 5 hours so I belive its 28k XP for all items
---
Oh they won’t make that mistake again
---
Don't do it then, it is completely optional.
---
In the upcoming hot fix we have to completely disable everyone’s inventory so we can work on a game breaking bug where some people are enjoying playing the game
---
What I'm saying is that 10 weeks is a definite minimum. That's all we know for certain.
---
The guy in the video makes assumptions based on wording in the post that hasn't been clarified. He chose the date that he did. It may not be that at all. It could be exactly 10 weeks. It could be even a week later that he stated.
---
The point being his info is based off bigger assumptions than current accepted math (yes, that math too is based off assumptions, namely that score growth per level remains consistent at +25/level, and challenge amounts and scores awarded remain consistent too).
---
The currently accepted math uses fewer assumptions. To blindly go off the video's guys assumptions as fact is just moronic. 
---
Look, don't get me wrong, it could work out just like the guy in the video says. However, I go back to the original point of my comment i.e.
---
That statement you made is at best misleading and at worst, outright false.
---
I wish I could believe you.
---
Yeah I’m 14 or 15 and it seems like it’s going alright so far.
---
I think they showed a few in the summer video that came out.  One was like adding explosive damage to your punches or when you killed someone.
---
I’m on... ... 4.
---
