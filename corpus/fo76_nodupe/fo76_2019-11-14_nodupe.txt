Can't win...
---
---
---
Correct lol
---
Scenario 1 you were at a workshop with Pacifist on and lost the PvP. Always turn off Pacifist of you're doing workshops. Or even near them they are a PvP area.
---

---
Scenario 2. Seeing as your on PC some shady cheat engine shit like on NW. But I'm uncertain how prevalant this is outside of that mode.
---
But most likely scenario 1. Where were you?
---
Also, Pacifist isn't broken nor is PvP in fact a level 30 killing a much higher level proves it's working as intended. If you won every fight just because you're high level that'd be pretty lame.
---
You missed something here.  They weren't banned for data mining or using third party apps
---
  They actively used exists in the game, after they knew about them.  That IS in the TOS, under cheating.  But, yeah, this is still messed up.
---
Curse Todd Howard and his non existent top lip smh
---
It is the thought that counts.
---
If i can ever help you.
---
Maybe i will be able to help others out like i have been helped.I think now i have read the plan i can make them again.
---
I have a trick I use, that works on XBox, but im not sure about PC or PS4.
---
XBox will idle you out if it thinks you arnt doing anything, so will fallout. 
---
To trick both the hardware and the software, I go to my cooking station, and pretend like im going to cook.
---
Then I go AFK.
---
I do not disconnect. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have used this trick many a time to run to the gas station for snacky treats and smokey treats.
---
Needs to apply a -2 agility need for 10 minutes, while you shake the pins &amp; needles out of your legs.
---
Just tried about 2 days ago, could have put it right next to the armor(?) Workbench on the side w/o radiation.
---
Where?!
---
How do you open the vault it doesn‚Äôt let me open it unless I get three people which I don‚Äôt even have that many lol
---
Ive gone grocery shopping using this trick. 
---
Mostly its only to run to the gas station.  But it does work.
---
Oh like just sit idle in the menu all your characters doing stuff?
---
Sorry totally missed the detail, yes it is only for the armor mod
---
There‚Äôs a 10mm msg? I keep finding lame pipe pistols and pipe revolvers smh. I‚Äôm new. Level 10
---
Hahaha up vote
---
I don‚Äôt know about securitrons being in Appalachia but...
---
I open the crafting station, then sit the controller down, then go to the store.
---
I stay logged in at my camp.  The controller shuts off, but the game doesnt.
---
&gt; Total coincidence. No reason to think that was you.
---
I don'[t know why we are arguing. I agreed with you.
---
At this point any content and QoL change is very much welcomed. I think they were putting all there eggs in one basket hoping to get wastelanders out for us before the end of the year and they came up short, not really surprised tbh. I hope they announce something of whats to come tomorrow in there weekly post.
---
Its different bwhaaaaaa.
---
Would love to display the Power armors like Fallout 4.
---
I had a room full of them.I collected them all
---
Sorry, I meant protectrons, lol.
---
All good.
---
Dang you beat me I payed $6 on eBay for mine lmao I thought I had the steal. üòÇüíÄ
---
&gt; In the video he even admits that the guy who was banned performed an exploit (which was bannable). But he was performing the exploit with good intentions, supposedly 
---
Yeah, supposedly,
---
Except he never reported the exploit to Bethesda.  He claims he didn't need to because someone else had.
---
I‚Äôve tried using a terminal only to be stuck halfway on the zooming in animation and had to quit the game to get out of it
---
Ah ok. That's good to know at least.
---
Maybe just consider what i said generally. Put that first and advise ppl.
---
How about big cat skins?
---
Ya
---
Actually, I was referring to the "900 hours guy", and to be precise, the headlines said "banned for having too much ammo" (which the banned person claimed was all made legitimately by crafting), maybe I should have worded it better. But I never said the guy was not duping, the point was that his side of the story was treated as gospel at first, which is on the topic of this thread. I do not know what is so hard to understand about that.
---
There is
---
Least the dude did it for us on PS4
---
&gt; He has been using the cheat engine to monitor the memory stream
---
Who do you mean by "he" here?
---
If you're talking about u/undefined7196 (aka map76 guy) he was *modifying* the game memory, for many hours, by his own admission.
---
Is it the same one from fallout 4?
---
And if the "exploit" is writing tools to modify many memory locations in the game?
---
No idea, just google the name to find out.
---
Righting one wrong with another is an awful practice.
---
Bethesda's greed and loss of consumer good will does not warrant false information or incorrect journalism.
---
&gt; What made you think ~~the~~ *any* game would ever be anything but shareholders wanting more profit?
---
I emote first and if they don't stop I whore out my tse laser and mow everything before they get a chance.
---
Oooo a Quad Explosive Less Vats Cost Gauss Shotgun sounds awesome
---
they should also hint to locations of cap stashes as casual chit-chat...
---
My first camp was the small pond just east of the lumber yard.  The one with the dock and "floating" inner tube.  I made it and the e d of the dock, at the same level and placed a small porch next to it.
---
The location I currently have, is slightly bugged, for now.  I had a mishap of dying and respawning "in" one of my foundations.  But, somehow, some of my inventory items , that can't be dropped, fell on the ground, making their area, "unable to place due to interfering terrain".  I've worked around this ad of now.  The location is in the more, between The Maw and the Tree House Village.  Just south of the tree house village is a cliff.  On top of the cliff is a lead deposit.  In order to have both the lead extractor AND the waterfront property, you have to place the C.A.M.P. Devi e halfway down the cliff, in a very narrow ledge/alcove.  I have a "lean-to", protecting the extractor, and my vendi g machine is just off the edge with a staircase going down to my bungalow, workstations and bar.
---
Ive also heard about people being banned for data mining and third party apps (im not sure how true it is, but i wouldnt be surprised if it was)
---
Honestly yeah,I would be fine paying $5-$10 for the skin again. I'm not swimming in money myself but as long as it was available again in a new game, with updated graphics, UI, etc. I'll pay for several more skins again.
---
So is that one of the issues? Players aren't satisfied with the new fallout so therefore selling old skins is just the tip of the iceberg?
---
And I get it,Pay2Win mechanics mean any form of advantage but I just think the fridge complaints are just being blown out of proportion as it's not a legendary 5 star Handmade that does over 10,000 damage and never breaks. I also get the argument if we let them get away with this then it'll snowball into that
---
He didn't "use a glitch" -- he hacked on game memory for many hours.
---
Go to vault 94 (north east part of the map) enter the cave access terminal and choose the option to open vault door it should just open if not then it‚Äôs somehow bugged try restarting your game, if still doesn‚Äôt work send me a screen shot i will try to ask if anyone encounter similar problem
---
This. It's not that complicated. Grab a gun and get to work.
---
Basically, first person to find a gun wins. Each round is 7 minutes of queueing, 10 seconds of spawn selection, 30 seconds of constant gunfire.
---
Does it have a red mask and is made of leather?
---
I was doing that earlier and was bombarded with messages that my build is wrong and it will not work from people that didn‚Äôt even bother to watch other part üòê it‚Äôs why i decided to show how things works first and then go in to details. Looks like there is no perfect solution...
---
Yeah and maybe a side quest. Not all the same though sometimes side quest get to repetitive.
---
Yes, I think thats the one. A lot of stuff got ported over from fo4, some not even meant to be in game at all. (Like marine armor helmet) Other stuff just went in to the atomic shop
---
The only thing im worried about is the supressor. I play 3rd person, so the sights arent an issue for me on any gun
---
They work with the community managers &amp; the security fault was emergency patched do to what his "cheating" uncovered. The problem wasn't the ban, it was that it took BGS 2 weeks to respond to the ban.
---
If the only way you can replicate it is with tools, then they deserve the ban. Professionals wont fuck with Cheat engine, they have Charles Proxy which is way better for manipulating online games. But if the cheat engine was used to easily recreate the scenario  which can happen without it's use, then thats a grey area. Tbh i don't know too much about the specifics of this case
---
I'm pretty sure they copied almost all the assets from fallout 4 then just shoved what they didn't want in the dev room. They probably ran short on time so reused alot of assets.
---
Been buying junk a lot lately because of the scrapbox, but I try to find flux the most. I'll buy stable flux any type at up to 200 caps apiece, but the sweet spot is 100-150. I saw two camps today with dozens of each flux at 250, but I had to pass it up because that's just too much it was soul crushing
---
Thanks y‚Äôall for the info. The blueprint tip worked perfectly. Still stinks that it‚Äôs not easier, but I guess we can‚Äôt expect everything to be perfect! üòÇ
---
I am 37 sir
---
Too bad explosive gauss won‚Äôt happen again üò´
---
I'm a junkie junker. I sell bulk scrap 15-25 caps each. Non persihable foods and specialty drinks like hard lemonade and white russians... 1-3 caps on the foods, 10-17 caps for my mixed drinks. 
---
Maginizes seem to be really popular right now. Clothing can be lucrative but I'm a junker I don't know much bout clothes.
---
IMO, you are better off building on an acid node, and using a collectron instead of a junk extractor.
---
this. I've received both the jumpsuit at VT hat from it
---
This has always been an issue with the game since before it launched. Any negative aspect, real or not, spread like wildfire and people latched on to it. One time someone on this sub reddit just said the game had no online security. Didn't prove it. Didn't show any evidence. Just said the game was unsecured and everyone just believed him. Gaming news sites ran articles on it. Then someone showed that there is online security and showed proof of it. Nobody cared. For months people still said the game was unsecured. 
---
People want to hate this game. Thats it. They want to hate it and they wanted it to fail. So every little issue becomes a big deal.
---
They wont, they will get a 1-2 week ban at most. Every Ban I hear of get an email saying they can come back after an X amount of time or around the next patch time if/when they fix or defend against the exploit.
---
This same thing happened to me. In fort defiance, a mole rat was walking around. I have a stealth rifle build as well, with 22 perception, so vats is no issue. I‚Äôm 5 feet away, vats 95% of course, and miss. 4 times. Tried leaving the building and came back, same thing. Tried melee and nothing either.
---
I feel bad for the lady that's been collecting fuzzy plushies. I remember her posting how she was so happy for it to all be for nothing now that they were adding display cases.
---
Meanwhile I haven't been able to display a single item that I would actually want to
---
I usually only empty mine out at the end of a session.  
---
It doesnt seem to have a limit to what it can hold.
---
First I would like to say I didn‚Äôt realize the scrap box thing was fixed. It happened to one of my friends just the other day while we were playing is why I mentioned it. But if it‚Äôs been fixed for everyone else and my friend losing all their stuff was just a fluke then great. More power to Bethesda. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be deceptive and lie in my post. So if it‚Äôs genuinely fixed I take back what I said about this. As far as my ‚Äúagenda‚Äù it really was a joke until I saw how downvoted it got. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm defensive, I‚Äôm just surprised. I thought it was common knowledge that fallout 1st is a big middle finger to you and everyone else who bought the game(like me, who checks in on the game and plays now and then waiting for it to be a decent product). 
---
That would be embarrassing indeed. But that‚Äôs not me. Sorry man. I was a GIANT Bethesda player for the longest time. With this game being a giant fallout 4 asset flip, all the insane bugs(some even from fallout 4), lack of content, the nylon bag, the insane monetization, and other things, then the nail in the coffin, fallout 1st, at what point can I voice an opinion that Bethesda is becoming electronic arts? I post all this hoping Bethesda will see it and WAKE UP. If you like the game great! I‚Äôm happy for you I really really am. But you can not deny all this game has done since before it even came out is slap its fans across the face.
---
That‚Äôs the opposite of checks and balances... or lack of
---
Yeah, we're sending .50 cal rounds, hiding behind a door should not save them, fuck it hiding behind a wall shouldn't save them!
---
Acid.

On pc, you can't be seen data mining, as all of the relevant files are on your hard drive and they can't regulate, just looking.  Looking at the files is an end user right. Unless they are data mining the servers.  As far as the third party apps.  They technically can't do anything about that, unless you are using them while connected to their services.  This issue has been brought up with several games.  Ubisoft had an autobot ,no not that one, that could detect if cheat engine was running while also running The Division, which led to bans.  In this particular case, one user was using cheat engine to make screenshots and wasn't trying to hack the game.  I think they let him back for that one.  With apps like that, you just have to make sure they aren't running while the game is.  A lot of these stories, liked previously stated, can't be proven, as they are "he said she said" . Whom is how truthful they are?
---
Kilgore, ask the Tralfamadorians, they'll use their 4 dimensional view of the world to actually read the posts by the "map76 guy" where he describes how he found the "exploit" by, and I quote, "shotgunning" the game's memory.
---
Cheap legendary for scrip. Depends how many caps I have, 300 -700 for 3 star weapons.
---
Outfits I dont have - prices vary
---
556 typically 1 cap per
---
Radaway 
---
Lead
---
A lot of times I dont care about price much cause I need to keep the caps flowing.
---
Problem with project paradise, you need to keep all animals alive to have a chance for proper rewards üòê
---
Plans sell.  If you price right.
---
Ammo sells, if you price right.
---
Weapons and armor sell sometimes, if you have good stuff (noone is going to buy your 3\* berzerkers rolling pin)
---
When I go shopping I look for armors, unyeilding, leather or forest scout.   Thats it.
---
I‚Äôll dm you in a bit just getting groceries haha
---
Indie games. Some of them really do just love games and want to make some. All the big dog companies though are no doubt corrupt. There are many videos about this on you tube. Whale hunting is the new thing to do in the industry. Look it up.
---
Use it but can't add more to the box
---
I‚Äôm buying scrip legendary for up to 20 caps/scrip
---
Submit a ticket and request a refund of your Atoms. "Shockingly high CAMP budget cost" worked as an excuse for me.  
---
And you'll probably get to keep the item.
---
I wish
---
It goes to me, but then I'll put it back Into your scrap box so you can use it.
---
You paid for fallout 76, twice
---
Yeah, Todd gets it... sorry man
---
j/k - you can still access and remove scrap from the box, just cannot add anything new to it
---
Project paradise is just an example. This would be best for the lower tier event specific rewards.
---
TO MAKE MONEY DUDE. Them lying about details of the game? More people buy it. Money. 
---
Promising canvas bags then sending cheaper shit? Money. Insane scummy DLC practices? Money. 
---
The motivation on those is clear. Scummy, but clear. I'm not a Bethesda fan boy and gave them shit for everything else every step of the way. I'm however not so blinded by rage that I think they would intentionally harm themselves to make less money. 
---
Bethesda is greedy. 
---
This loses them money. 
---
This upsets people who spend money. 
---
There is no way they would intentionally cut off profits and piss off other customers without it being legitimate. 
---
Everything else? Yes, on board completely. 
---
This specific instance? I believe them because they have nothing to gain and a lot to lose. It doesn't make sense and I think people are so mad at Bethesda they aren't thinking logically. 
---
Every action has a motivation.
---
Every scummy lie or trick they pulled had the same motivation. 
---
This one doesn't.
---
I make ammo en masse so I am always experiementing with new guns and their mods. I look for Legendary Weapons which because I am 50+ I fully expect to be higher than 3000 caps. I prefer to buy Plans and Mods, but I don't know what they all do and end up buying things I don't really like, but why not? They may become viable later. I sell only ammo and everything for 1 cap. This is because I love making ammo.
---
I think I recognize some of those names. Also playing on PS4. Communicating really makes a difference, especially when it comes to sortin out loot
---
I should add that there are some great instructional videos on YouTube. Jug does really neat stuff.
---
I would do that, but I don't want to be banned for contributing to the game community ;)
---
Vault-tec confiscates it.
---
Your telling me that Ubisoft has hired prime to monitor the division? (Kidding, of course). And yea, i know, you cant just find a data miner, but you can find them out. Also, weather or not its a right to view the files, we've already seen that Bethesda tends to throw that out the window (as seen with Australia)
---
Yup. Theorized something similar only because I always end up facing the same people every time I log in to play NW.
---
I don't care about profits so I sell all ammo at 1 cap and everything else is 10 caps or less.
---
You mean what was promised at e3 last year when they first showed us fallout 76
---
Is Flux the stuff you can drink? I always drink it. How do I acquire it and what is it for if not drinking? I could look it up, but I love interactive conversations with people in the community.
---
Yes. All factions are also inside the whitespring. You've been gone awhile huh?
---
I agree 100%! It would be super nice to see it truly go on as a progressive, dynamic storyline - truly having Wastelanders and Dwellers working together, or fighting, to build a better future.
---
I‚Äôll look into that as well. Thanks
---
It doesn't say that they will work on Fallout 76. Probably because after Wastelanders it will be KIA.
---
welcome back
---
there is only one pool of daily caps for all vendors now and they all share it..
---
No. Maybe it was just a fluke in the inventory, sometimes ifnitndoes that, just sell an item worth 1 cap and it will reset the value.
---
Audibly laughed
---
Vendors used to only carry 200 per faction, which is why the list you have was created.  There are 7 factions
---
About 6 months ago they combined all the cap pools from all 7 factions to one group pool.  So now you can sell 1400 worth to any vendor.   They now all share the same pool.  
---
You wont need that list anymore, you can just go to any vendor and get your daily limit
---
I didn't know NPC's were going to be implemented. Awesome.
---
Bethesda hire this man!!
---
But it does say work on fallout and elder scrolls. So fallout 76 fits in the fallout games.
---
Is the guy who sells you coffee in the morning corrupt?  He's only doing it for money.
---
&gt; There are many videos about this on you tube
---
Youtube is owned by alphabet, possibly the most corrupt company on the planet.
---
Yeah, it was definitely a hit and miss for people. I hope they make fixes later. I'm in the same boat, haven't been able to display any items I want.
---
Good news then!  Nothing in there about 76, so they won't necessarily have anything to do with it.
---
Unless you think a bunch of people from Wisconsin all feel like moving to Texas.
---
Technically  a carbine. Pistol caliber carbines can shoot 10mm respectfully and act as a pistol.
---
Thanks Doc!
---
Ehh shotguns are only decent in NW though, no loss...
---
Nothing special for nazi guns friend
---
&gt;Found the exploit that was already in use elsewhere
---
Thats what you're omitting. This guy was tracking down an exploit that already existed.  Is it possible to perform the exploit without 3rd party software? We don't have that information because he will not give specifics. **I** need that information before **I** call someone a liar.
---
It says *Bethesda* works on Fallout and TES. And that this new company will work on undisclosed projects.
---
That's inert flux, it's what happens if you don't hurry up and stabilize the flux while you farm it. Flux is what you get for harvesting the mutated plants in nuked zones. You have to stabilize it by gathering materials from irradiated enemies also found in nuke zones. There's five different types, each used for specific recipes or plans. They're a pain to farm, so it's easier to to buy directly. I also like to talk about the game with the community haha
---
there are 2 kinds.  When you pick flowers in nuke zones you get an unstable variety that degrades into Inert Flux that you can drink.  Its basically water.
---
If you have 10 unstable, 1 high radiation fluid, 1 hardened mass and 1 glowing mass you can combine it all to get a Stable variety.
---
The Stable flux is a high end crafting material used for power armor mods, decon chambers, serums and other high end crafting items.
---
Inert flux is what you drink. Stable flux is used for crafting you get it for killing the queen or by crafting it from flowers you pick in nuke zones. It has a few different colors so itll be stable "insert color" here flux
---
I was selling Mininukes and Missles for 5 caps each and no one ever bought them. I had so many that they took up 100's of pounds so I eventually just dropped them since I can't sell ammo to an NPC vendor :/
---
And as one more point, your last part is dismissive of my entire point. I went off about how this particular one is different and doesn't have the motivation of profit because *they lose money*
---
You say they are trying to act like they are for the community/player base and this is damage control. Lying blatantly is not damage control *especially* after they were silent for everything else. 
---
Go deeper with that thought. Why do they want to satisfy a community? For profit. 
---
This goes against profit 100%
---
It's not logical and to honestly think they'd do that is emotion over logic. 
---
I never defended their lies for profit. I defended them on this particular instance because they're not lying in my opinion.
---
Its not "more" to do. Its a seperate mode. No idea why people want it.
---
Thr lmg is the most based gun in da game , ur handmade could never
---
I guess you could if you wanted to, isn‚Äôt that what ‚Äúpistol braces‚Äù are for üòâ
---
Good ideas but how can they make Bethesda wealthier? People don't like FO76 1st but those memberships made some serious coin for Bethesda. Look Todd and Pete have bills to pay and I don't expect them to rough it driving last years M3.
---
Player vending machines. The ability to rename items. Legendary scip &amp; vendor. Display cases &amp; magazine racks.
---
I had a similar issue  yesterday at the Queen.  
---
I hit a radroach 4 times for 1900 per shot, and it didnt die. 
---
Damage numbers popped up for both the main hit and the explosive, but the thing didnt register damage.
---
It may have been the same bug, or it may have been standard Queenie lag
---
If you are not american you dont care about thanks giving and therefore the next holiday is christmas
---
So you could buy a month, farm scrap like crazy, and you still have access to it til it's gone?
---
Does it stay in the scrap box or does it (and it's weight) go into the regular stash box?
---
Might buy a month if it stays in your scrap box after you cancel even if you can't add
---
Probably mesh related?
---
I‚Äôm only level 9 but can I plzzzz join in new to the franchise and I keep getting reckt by the enemy AI. This is exactly what I need, a group of higher ranked players to show me the fallout ropes and help me get on my feet with guns, weapons, and just all aspectsof the game. 
---
Gt MurdaBoyManny
---
I guess you could shoot a PCC like a pistol if you wanted to, isn‚Äôt that what ‚Äúpistol braces‚Äù are for üòâ
---
Muzzle break is a given; it's standard on every lmg. Just don't take it off if you don't know the mod. And I absolutely agree; lmgs could use more mods. That or increase the amount of crafted .308. Either one is fine, but both be glorious.
---
I lined the street in Sanctuary Hills with them, like 30 of them.
---
Can people without OP builds like Bloodied do it solo?
---
You know what?!  I havent seen a normal blunderbuss in a long ass time.  Are they even around anymore?
---
And worse yet, they have the front sight mesh shown on this ATX skin:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/623057565567418369/unknown.png
---
How long would it take them to fix the nif? Not long at all.
---
I definetly feel like they did something with Lmg
---
Prime it bro, best decision I've made in the game, the lmg is an end game weapon so having to go into the nukr zones to craft the ammo gives u stuff to do and the ammo now is crafted in batches of 170 instead of the 30 before
---
Is this information available somewhere? Id like to do some digging for other items.
---
"Imagine if the game was good instead of bad"
---
Yes, the only part you need to do dmg is boss fight and best weapons for that are actually tse not bloodied
---
I‚Äôve never noticed that before. Really makes you wonder just what the hell the weapon designers are smoking over there.
---
Yeah, it's even on the frickin' ATX skin: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/623057565567418369/unknown.png
---
Yeah you can still get them. Not sure if there‚Äôs a static spawn but I sometimes pick them up from enemies with a crown. Got one on my wall. The dream is to have my favourite wheel filled with them and swap to another one after each shot haha
---
was supposed to be out already but got pushed back to q1 of next year.
---
This bug has existed since Beta. It has never been fixed. Thats a year of 1 gun breaking your play session. Guys please give up on the game. If it dies, bethesda might move to the next one and not fuck it up so badly.
---
How about i just pay 13 dollars a month, then i can stash my junk, and any players i kill's junk,unlimitedly.
---
Hopefully something else I can pay for.  /S
---
Thatd be cool!  I got one back in November, but havent seen one since.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs a random encounter.
---
Its prolly in the water. Cause they are all affected.
---
True story: a professor from a southern university was walking around the Harvard campus, looking for the library in which he was supposed to give a seminar. He stopped a student and asked "Do you know where the library's at?" and the student said "Here at Harvard, we don't end our sentences with prepositions." The professor then said "Excuse me, do you know where the library's at, asshole?"
---
It's all in the games files. You can find it using xedit. Message me on discord at Eckserah#0001 if you would like to join my discord where people are available to help you figure this stuff out
---
Supposedly stays in the scrapbox
---
They need that and a buff. They should make them the shotgun sized version, and fire actual shotgun sized spread.
---
The real question is why the hell are you reading a book by Rachel Maddow? She‚Äôs an any-dirty-laundry-i-can-get newscaster lol
---
You need to go in and team up with each person, then coordinate everyone going back to home screen and then having the lead join NW. it‚Äôs pretty clunky.
---
Hey, I'd be happy with any penetration at all!
---
Damn you beat me to it
---
Your nonsense, weak insults don't change the fact that you're pathetically entitled and ridiculous to expect a refund on already spent digital currency.
---
Wouldn't it be her publisher?
---
I would hazard a guess that no one who actually writes a book does it grammatically correct or perfect spelling. That kinda shit is sorted out by the publisher before release.
---
C'mon, this is Bethesda!
---
Ooga booga.  Bethesda gave me a game for ten dollars.
---
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.  -Papa Yao Guai

Well its Rachel Maddow, so.....
---
Plans, any and all plans i don‚Äôt have, wont pay silly prices,
---
There are more fuck ups like these, like take the Pump-Action 
---
Shotgun, it is supposed to have an actual picatinny rail to mount optics on it: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/606518673817206785/unknown.png
---
Then is the .44 Revolver with its missing Bull Barrel:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/605404768009060363/Missing.png
---
And then there is the 10mm Pistol with its missing comfort and sharpshooter's grips from Fo4.
---
When your birthday and what is your address?
---
What a surprise.
---
I really hope they do add crossplay functionality. 
---
They wont though, because they would have to develop in-game messaging, and that would require effort...
---
While you're at it, how about having the game overload the cheater's motherboard and fry their nuts?
---
Portal to NW would be cool. Makes it more immersive if you place it on vault 51 on the map
---
That's awesome!
---
Yes, lemonade stand is random. I once ran into grahm and the responder bot at the same location, that was cool.
---
To post a pic you need to have it hosted somewhere (Imgur is the most popular) then paste the URL to the picture. You can get fancy with html but at minimum, just post the URL
---
Unfortunately I'm a console player. Maybe its a good idea to collect and centralise all drop lists somewhere so other people can easily find which events to grind.
---
Isn't it more likely that very few people are playing NW?
---
Just another pointless spam post, that is all.
---
Oh okay
---
Or there's Bellular who in his quest for clicks doesn't shy away from using anything that reddit writes about with a juicy clickbait title. And then of course follows it with his speculations and predictions...
---
And don't get me started on Baby Kicker (Heels vs baby face)...
---
Only worth a damn if they actually produced good damage. Something like 5000 dps instead of some cheap 800 or less
---
I didn't really mean that they were going to move only work on 76. But it seems that's nothing is about 76 itself.
---
That's great.
---
More like.. they both hit at the same time, and they're both *resisted* ***individually***.
---
So meaning that... let's say, for your example numbers (200/180), you swing at at something.
---
That something has 145 DR and 170 ER. That's calculated as  
---
Phys: *200 - 145 = 55 Physical Damage*  
---
Engy: *180 - 170 = 10 Energy Damage*
---
**OVERALL TOTAL DAMAGE DONE:** *65*
---
Would you say that it just works?
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
Thanks regardless. I'm not new to the game and am leveling a bloodied melee now so I'll keep this in mind regardless
---
Haha yes, but I like to have that story as headcanon. The people I‚Äôve met playing NW are like the next wave of dwellers we heard of from the holotapes found in V51. Friends turning into enemies and people forming rivalries and what not all because ZAX has pitted us against each other. 
---
there‚Äôs a bunch of fresh names all the time but there‚Äôs a bunch of players that‚Äôs been playing consistently since the flatwoods map.
---
Barely.
---
I assume that's the initial setup?
---
After every match I'd just quit match then it'd be "Waiting..." at the main menu and dump me back into a lobby with the other 3
---
Yea, the leader had to keep going back in. I just mean party up should be a 1-button click at the end of a match if you want to stick with the team.
---
This has been in the game since launch, reported numerous times. Bethesda doesn't fix it and won't even acknowledge it.
---
Ah. Thank you.
---
Give me 4 players and a lot of concrete and I'll show you to to box a player's camp with walls lol
---
You know all the morons accusing people still playing Bethesda games of suffering from "sunk cost fallacy"? I guess that those people (the haters) are actually experiencing it for real. They've become so in love with the hate for Bethesda that they cannot leave the hate train. They have spend so much time hating and bashing Bethesda (sometimes for legitimate reasons) that they'll now use ANY ammunition to fire against Bethesda... It's really pathetic. No wonder gamers are seen as toxic and entitled when we can't even verify our sources and stay objective...
---
Is this some reference I don't get?
---
Amen
---
lol
---
Would be nice if they give us a planter box (IN GAME) so we can organize our plants and don't have them all on a slant all over the place.
---
It‚Äôs cool of you to let this sub know how much you enjoy jerking off to the smell of your own farts. I‚Äôm glad you have a hobby &lt;3
---
No, that means we caught them lying and stopped giving them money.
---
what level are you and can you access the bunker,?
---
And bethesda won't even acknowledge it or respond in any way about it.
---
I don't see people saying this
---
I'm interested, 373 but so solo so would like to get some other players to do the raids with.
---
No. I'll buy you a grammar book, because right now your sentences don't make any sense.
---
ü§´ three letter alphabet boys are everywhere, don't mind me though Im just buying oil filters online üòè
---
‚ò† tfw you only read the first half of the post and follow it word for word.
---
I wasn't sure if the big clip was the shotgun or not. No idea
---
Can you reword the title to make sense?
---
Sorry the insanity of this entire thing and the number of trolls out there have me being very literal
---
But I don't have friends...
---
Thanks, the number of troll'ish posts have me seeing kind of black and white this week, completely went over my head, lol
---
Why the fuck were you reading Rachel Maddow's book?
---
dodgy doesn't work with cavalier or sentinel
---
.. either you get the cavalier effect or the dodgy only. they negate one or the other
---
This is the one thing I‚Äôve wanted more than any other since the beginning.
---
Unfortunately it has all the makings of an intentionally frustrating situation that is perfect for monetization. 
---
Simply put, they will not do this for free
---
I tried to condense it too much. Using previous Bethesda lies as proof the YouTuber ban is also a lie doesn't work.
---
You haven't actually watched the video. Cause if you did, you would know that Juicehead didn't just run with the story at treat the original person's account as gospel. He looked into it and talked to people who actually knew what was going on.
---
Come on dude, please don't be one of those people that don't put much thought into a story and just run with what the OP has said.
---
When i still played I reported it over a dozen times. They don't care if it doesn't give the money.
---
Sweet, I'll be happy to teach, I'm currently studying for a test so after my test, I might be available.
---
Awesome, I'll be sure to read it and soak every letter in.
---
Awesome, I'll might be on tomorrow
---
That's what I thought also but I don't have a skin the shotgun unlocked. I was hoping that it worked for both but to my disappointment it did not. The shotgun however does have a drum mag I believe so maybe another screw up.....
---
Blows my mind that Bethesda has not even responded to this..
---
It totally affirms the notion for me that they do not care at all for their loyal player base and that the only that they care about is negative press..
---
If more youtubers were reporting on it then they would respond.
---
Bungie was able to do it on the fly with Destiny 2, then again Bethesda is known for dragging their feet on anything that doesn't show clear and immediate profit.
---
Could be that's next years reward as they seem to only use things for limited events half the time when they have been in the game files for about a year.
---
Pretty much nailed it.
---
Hard to say, depending on how the company is structured, they could stay in WI and work on any number of things.  Not a whole lot of development work *needs* to be local to one location.
---
Most companies do segregate large portions of the employees geographically, but it's not a hard requirement from a workflow perspective, especially these days.  In my last job, our team worked all across the country (US), with about half in various parts of California, but the lead was in Washington state, and a lot of the hard coding was done in Russia.
---
We can dream though right üòÇüòÇ
---
nothing there drops Max level so who cares. The two awesome explained guns I got from there were unsellable and we're more valuable as script.
---
My Quad Explosive Fletched Harpoon Gun is basically a Blunderbuss and I nicknamed it rightly so.
---
yeah, I only do it for plans or jumpsuits. screw killing the miners.. you won't get anything of value unless you want low level crap
---
You can't form a sentence by randomly inserting words.
---
I‚Äôve seen a vengeful moth man and a sheepsquatch near a fisure
---
Hopefully this means more content and balance patches. This game is pretty bare-bones for updates compared to literally every other online RPG I currently play.
---
oh i am so happy
---
If you already have everything in game, why wouldn‚Äôt it satisfy you to help out others by setting lower prices? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre saving up caps because you need them for a specific item.
---
The railway overpenetrates. The explosive variants don't though.
---
I was just thinking this exact thing.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a solid pvp weapon. I would keep it if you don‚Äôt have one or a qffr Tesla
---
I have an explosive ultracite laser rifle. Bloody with reduced vats cost. They exist and it bangs
---
Gotcha. So the current choices for airborne disease resistance without the perception reduction are now a pair of women's underwear worn over the face or a fishbowl? That's awesome
---
You higher levels with your cheap ammo and cheap merch are the real mvp‚Äôs for us lower levels
---
You're not the asshole. They just are too afraid of people endangering their safe space.
---
She has a PhD from Oxford, is a terrific storyteller, and unlike her show, her book got factchecked by penguin
---
What part of the YouTuber ban do people think is a lie?
---
50k really?
---
How appropriate!
---
If you were gullible enough to buy this game in the first place, there's no helping you at this point. This has been coming for years, ever since the horse armor and ripping off Obsidian on New Vegas.
---
Says one who says "kid" unironically ahahah 
---
you are just a pathetic tool, enjoy getting worked to death by whatever next corporation you like to suck the dick
---
Uh yeah, I would say so. It‚Äôs a rare pvp gun
---
I down voted your posts. That is all.
---
Ok I know several people who do that same thing. Nothing new. What does that have to do with the title of the post though? That is actually a very real and irritating problem. Especially when you have to then pay to travel back to watoga.
---
I have over 100 repair kits- they are rewards from queen fights. I have no issue about them (I love them) as anyone can earn them by doing queen fights. I‚Äôve never spent a dollar on repair kits.
---
Another classic example of power-hungry, partial mods.
---
Definitely a good find

---
  
---
I'm guessing these are the only notable changes we'll see for camps for a bit, but it's possible that the expanded building area could result in less distance between camps. At least that's my hope.
---
Easy enough to add a rule..not sure what the fuck their problem is
---
[removed]
---
That's insane. I understand why everyone keeps requesting it. I'm glad I didn't scrap it then. I don't really pvp but I knew it would be useful in protecting myself lol
---
This is good to know. I have been trying to get loot from the queen lots of times but no good. I had bad weapons, thought i was missung my shots all this time, lol. However today was the first day I got loot, somehow, my shots got through I guess and got great loot. No legendaries but some plans for jet packs and a gatling laser. As we were finishing up the quest another nuke landed and i helped kill the second one and got more loot! Felt awesome üòÅ
---
I am trying to get the plans for the rad shower, looks like i may have a chance now. Yippee!!
---
I got one but it‚Äôs not quad
---
Destiny isn't cross play though. It's cross save. Those are very different things.
---
Haha yup! Pvp is pretty bad atm. Hopefully they make it better in a patch soon
---
You're right, I mixed them up. Thanks for the correction.
---
I commented on your naughty word post ..it's what's in the game...I'm not sure it's a bannable offence IMO.
---
I should have posted the camp I came across today....it was way worse. I almost didn't buy anything cause it was just gross...and I'm not easily offended and tend to have a slight bevis and butthead sense of humor.
---
No. If ballistic is 200 and energy is 180, and the enemy has no resistance to either, it'll be hit for 380 damage.
---
Adding resistance to ballistic or energy will lower that portion of the damage by the relevant amount. So having a bunch of energy armor but zero ballistic armor means the energy portion might be entirely blocked but you'll still do *at least* 200 damage from the ballistic component.
---
So, for example, if your shishkebab does 200 ballistic damage and 180 energy damage, and you hit an enemy that has 50 ballistic armor and 50 energy armor, you'll end up doing a total of 280 (150ballistic+130energy) damage.
---
It's no problem. I just remember I was confused when they did it because I thought it was cross-play and I was so excited to play with a couple of my close friends... Then I was super let down...
---
They must be changing the rng drops because I got the same quad gamma and a quad faster reload Tesla just this past week.
---
This is the same sub in which a mod wrote a lengthy post about how there can‚Äôt be any negativity about fallout 1st when that came out.  This is the same sub on which you can find posts about the supposed ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù of this sub.
---
Easily. You can get a pretty good price check or sell it on the fo76 trading sub. Here's the- [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/)
---
throw it in the pile with the rest of the suggestions.
---
That is not absolutely true, any legendary will sell if priced cheap enough for scrip 10-20 per scrip it will sell.
---
That's crazy. I wonder If it was the recent hot fix?
---
I started a new character this week as well and the only thing I've experienced from the bugs you listed is #3 with the government aid drops after completing that event at the Morgantown airport.  But that bug happens on my main character too and I don't consider it to be game breaking.  Everything else has been fine for me.  I'm playing on PS4 btw.
---
I dunno but I was surprised. Now I can't ever find anyone to pvp with to try them out. Pvp is so dead and hardly anyone takes a workshop anymore. Ive been claiming workshops but no one comes to take them.
---
I was thinking about messaging someone just to try it out lol
---
All these bugs are reported on this sub many times. It's not like I made them up.
---
If your on Xbox we can battle together to see. I've been playing with my friend but that's kinda boring after awhile.
---
Well said
---
Yea I'm on xbox. I'm a vanguard build and get annihilated in pvp lol I built a tank for pve. I ensiferum I is my gamertag. I'm on R6 Siege right now though
---
This certainly floats my boat :)
---
I just did
---
I think Bethesda is telling the truth
---
No. No you didn't.
---
True, it is just easily forgotten.
---
Modern Warfare doing it with being able to add people is fantastic. My brother owns a PS4, I own an Xbox one. And the fact we can add each other in the game and play together is brilliant. I understand it‚Äôs developer choice right? I hope more games follow suite. Fo76 would benefit massively.
---
I won't be on til tomorrow. I'll add ya. I'm a vanguard build too on my Pvp guy. I don't pvp with my bloody. He's just a pve farmer.
---
DM me, I just got back into 76 a few weeks ago and hit lv21 today. Need something more interesting to do than farm plastic all day for shotgun shells.
---
Ok it will have to be possibly this weekend
---
I sell plans and recipes that are a bit more difficult to get (not metal bed, ivory grip for pistol, or chemistry workbench, lol)
---
I sell crappy legendaries for script if I'm too lazy to scrip them.
---
I sell ammo for 1c each...not all but mistt. I will have sales when I need to clean out my stash where you could get mistakes for 1c, though not many people use mistake launchers it seems
---
I sell harder to get outfits for cheap. But most of them don't sell well.
---
I look for good unyeilding armor, plans I don't have, and good prices on outfits and guns I don't have.
---
OK, I'm asking what part of the situation other people think is a lie. I'm a bit out of the loop because I haven't seen anyone suggesting anything about it is untrue.
---
This gun could have been so much fun.
---
But .....
---
I know, that's true and I'm aware.  I didn't mean to come off as if you made them up.  I just happened to start a new character as well and wanted to add my experience so far on PS4.  It's my 2nd character so I haven't been through the early stages of this game in a long time now but so far I haven't encountered much issues on my end.
---
Playing on PS4, new character too. Nukashine blackout put me in a loop, had to close game and reopen.
---
Hopefully not a micro transaction though like possible rewards or plans.
---
If I claim, its in private server. Mainly bc I don't want to pvp lol
---
Same happened to me on r/animememes I posted a meme I had for 3 years in my phone and they removed it and suspended me saying it was a repost from 5 months ago. I just got on here 2 weeks ago how am I supposed to know it was posted 5 months ago? They messaged me saying I should review the rules and warned me of further violations. Last 3 memes I posted were counted as reposts from years ago or I didn‚Äôt give the right tag and were all removed
---
There's always the pvp radio station Hunter/hunted
---
I claim because I wanna pvp but no one ever comes.
---
That's kind of the whole point though.
---
 I think the panties shot kinda crossed the line it could be considered lewd.
---
Instaban is pretty harsh though.
---
I can solo launch in around 25 minutes or less, did my first today. What is it that you're stuck on?
---
Ok, thank you for explaining.
---
Nukes were explored for all sorts of things.  They toyed with the idea of nukes being used to quick dig canals or excavate large holes, before they really understood fallout/radioactive contamination.
---
mini-golf, and more carnival minigames would be neat
---
I‚Äôm banned for posting YouTube links to Camp videos haha. I complained and was unbanned, then someone I know post THEIR YouTube link but thanked/tagged me for an idea in the comments, banned again haha
---
Found the Elizabeth Warren supporter
---
the link doesn't work?
---
As long as it doesn't make bethesda crack down on use of mods on PC, fine.
---
I only use mods of stuff that should be in the game already (text chat, perk loadouts, item sorting) but till they implement that stuff in the game cross play isn't worth losing those mods.
---
Console/console crossplay sounds better.
---
No
---
Hearing An-Capitalism reminds me of Ayn Rand for some reason
---
I‚Äôll buy your 3-star Berzerker‚Äôs Rolling pin... at the right price. Then I‚Äôll scrip it and visit Murmmphgf (or whatever her name is) during a sale.
---
Two decades man :(
---
Oh lord this is actually happening to me. I just need 8 more scrip and I had two 3 star mutants one dropped nothing and one a 3 star weapon.
---
I just want the whitespring ones that sweep everything.
---
I just put it in again, did it work for you this time? üòä
---
I don't know how feasible it is, but I'm all for anything that deepens the world and expands the economy.
---
Wow, really? I have seen some of your videos and they are awesome.  I was trying to remember who exactly created those crazy catapult or trap-house videos just today or yesterday, as I had seen them months ago. Unreal you got banned for posting something so creative
---
very nice
---
You have to get 30000 caps and ask around for an expolsive energy weapon usually people dont put there legacy weapons for sale on their vending machines I already bought two just ask around and then there will be nothing left to do on the game but take over people's workshops with your new weapon and gather their junk because survival mode is gone.
---
The mask? Idk what system your on but on xbox they were mass duped a while back. I saw a guy over a thousand of them.
---
Thank you! üòä

I spent a lot of time looking for the right lockers that my first Miner Key went to as well. That's them in the background, yeah? /s
---
My IGN is Ludvillain. Just send me a FR. :)

post on r/fo76filthycasuals they would dig it
---
Ooh ok! I'll do that!!! Thanks üòä
---
JFC, Bethesda already answered this, the question has been asked and answered a billion times on this sub, what is wrong with you people?
---
Sounds like the same exact cheat I saw people reporting in NW.
---
 Report them and move on.
---
Lol, sure guy. I don't envy your job of lying for your company.
---
Can we get this stickied so it can become the next "sense of pride and accomplishment"?
---
op said gatling
---
Since An-Capitalism seems to be something you made up, you probably are right.
---
Actually... sorting players into lobbies based on number of cheating reports isn't a bad idea.

We just need a reflex sight!! I got a ve me and be lvc 10mm smgs. I love smgs but their ap cost compare to the variants (combat rifles and handmades are my other lvc guns) they use way to much ap. I still use the ap cost stuff on em (piercing forceful/stablized stock/stablized/aligned long barrel) and ap is still alot, the reflex would give it the extra less ap cost to make it viable
---
All I ended up getting is 2 of the short versions... oh well close enough I guess

Not even a full server, it's 8 total slots.

Give. Give give give give.

Stop whining lol this wave has already moved on. It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to require payment for private servers, most other MMOs operate on this same principle.
---
I recently noticed this myself. I also have 1st. I find that I'm collecting more "unique" items. Clothes, weapons, etc that before I would have tossed because my stash was full of things I needed such as junk or legendaries. I don't know how the mechanics of the game work. But I could imagine it takes more to load in 30 different clothes and weapon combos than 1k of steel?
---
Lmao it worked thanks
---
&gt;Peaceful protest never got anyone anything.
---
Execept African Americans equal rights in the 60s
---
I have 30 melee weapons 20 ranged weapons, 30 armor, and a mix of serums, stable flux, popular chems, and Ionized Meat. All the weapons and armor are predominantly 2-3***. All are max level legendary. 
---
The most common thing I sell? 
---
Ionized Meat. 
---
FML.
---
But them from player vendor or Market 76 on Reddit.

Lol costs 240 a year if you do month to month in canada or 130 if you buy the year outright.

Isn't it the door to the Vault for Wastelanders
---
i can get you the rest for free lol
---
I see panties everywhere. Driving down the street, in the mail, on TV, on the sides of buildings. And I've seen this bug too many times to count. Lewd? Cmon. In a game where heads on spikes are a common occurrence, underwear is considered lewd. Nice one.
---
There you go.
---
Yes I believe it is when you open the door it is labeled Vault 79
---
from the zenimax terms of service section 8: "You agree not to access, receive, play or use any Service to: Promote, upload, transmit, encourage or take part in any activity involving hacking, cracking, phishing, taking advantage of exploits or cheats and/or distribution of counterfeit software and/or Virtual Currency or virtual items.

I know no one reads them but yknow,
---
Is it the last thing youve farmed? Are you aware of the pick up X ammount of items before you can pick up the same item again?
---
Now the real question is, can i get down there? Lol
---
I'd like it. Todds honest truth, building (as buggy as it is) is probably my favorite thing to do in the game. üëç
---
Either Brie or Gruyere are the best cheeses to pair with your whine.
---
Thanks! I was pretty surprised haha :)
---
Well that settles it then. If they can't appreciate the time and effort you put into making creative (amazing) content for other people to enjoy, then I want nothing to do with them ever again (not that I did anyways)

Not yet, the elevator didn't work for me
---
Pc needs to be quarantined right now with all the hackers in nuclear winter. Other than that I‚Äôm all for it!!

Ahhh okay, I didn‚Äôt know there was more than 1 song, oh well it‚Äôs a shame they didn‚Äôt make it to the full game.
---
Me neither. I saw the keypad and immediately went to try 111111 as thats the next logical code at this point, but no luck. It doesnt let me. Lol.
---
I would love building camps for others if that's ever possible.  I think Bethesda would just put caveats on how atom shop content is used.
---
Nah, it's a shared service from XB1, only one 1 live account, shared games. I didn't pay for fallout 76, got it for free lol
---
For consoles you can share games between 2 consoles and only pay once which is pretty cool.
---
I think I just time traveled two weeks into the past.
---
I had this issue with my camp, ended up having to build a floating camp 2 levels above the river to place rails. Funnt thing is, it left me place a fence on the foundation, but not a rail.
---
It‚Äôs really to bad because the sub in general is really great but it‚Äôs not worth the headache :)
---
Well you'd be the one of two people to tell me what they dislike about this post. The upvote/downvotes in the comments tho don't seem reflect the upvote/downvote of the post itself.
---
I'm starting to feel like the delay of wastelanders might be the death blow for this game. I've enjoyed it and pushed past the bad because I still had a good time. As difficult as they made it sometimes. Made some friends....etc
---
 But lately I'm lucky to get past 15 minutes of playtime. I sincerely hope they have some sort of new content filler between now and next year.
---
I see it as win-win-win. Buyer gets a cool new home they might not have the time to build otherwise, seller has extra motivation to build and a nice little reward, and Bethesda should see increased in-game activity, a new player-driven economy, renewed player interest in exploring for camps, and probably increased atom shop camp decor sales. :D
---
Fuck the mirelurk raid, its cancer just like next weeks too. Not even exclusive photo frames could get me to run those.
---
180~
---
And you do need to server swap still
---
I recall much excitement a year ago, getting on for the first time &amp; just mucking about. So many people at Flatwoods. So many times it locked my controls due to server not responding hah

Don't quite feel the same nowadays : /

You can feel unsafe in adventure mode ? You get free atoms, that alone makes it worth paying for a private world if you buying atoms anyway, so you getting a whole bunch of value already .. I don't necessary disagree, private worlds by itself wouldn't be worth it, but you getting currency and other benefits .. speak with your wallet, I won't pay for it as it is not worth it to me, but I can see why someone who already buys atoms would.
---
You know what lewd means?
---
Wouldn't we all!
---
Yup, it was old news to us the minute the first person told us that. Thank you for your input though.
---
Imagine the servers trying to deal with terrain deformation
---
Happens a lot on ps4 as well when higher up and looking down. I've built a lot of very tall structures and this happens every time I scout off the edges for enemies. Usually happens at 5 stories or more.
---
It‚Äôs a shit post made for the lmaos
---
Interested in teaming up. My psn is MyLittleShadow
---
What's in the nuka plant that's worth server hopping for?
---
* laughs in chainsaw *
---
people were making camps for others. like hiring a decorator.  that was months ago though
---
You're so lucky dude, I've done that event multiple times in one night &amp; have gotten 0 legendaries.
---
Definitely interested, but unsure how much I'll see the rest of the crew as I'm here in Australia and dont get online as often as I'd like (real life ya know..)
---
I'm not a total noob, and have a Character at lvl 81, done some cool stuff but would love to hang with a crew and do dungeon crawls / launch nukes from time to time.. maybe BBQ the SBQ lol.
---
Known cheat on PC. I see this all the time. Report and move on. Bethesda won't do anything about it, but at least you did your part.
---
I'm sure if we complain enough they will put it in the atomic shop for 800 atoms each.
---
And that, folks, is what you call a 'backhanded compliment'.
---
Jessica Jones... See... The thing is... Fallout 76 is broken as hell. But thanks for playing.
---
Vibe check is a dream weapon, think I have its twin but it might be 50 damage resist while aiming
---
This game makes no sense
---
The original Prey and Rune were epic. 
---
Plus, mmogfails said they are getting new people and that it's a good thing. 
---
He was right s out enough things, that I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
---
The amount of boarded-up buildings bothered me in fo4 as well, always loved the mods that opened them up.  It would be cool if Wastelanders utilized a lot of these unused spaces.
---
I am a heavy gunner so I never get to buy ammo. Something in one sbq fight I‚Äôll go through 5k rounds so ammo would be rediculess for me
---
There is no deathblow likely for a game like this. If it does die sooner than we'd like, it will be the result of gradual decay and many unsolved problems, not one screw-up. 
---
People will shift to other games as is natural in a MP online context, Wastelanders will bring people back (for good or bad), and modding / private server upgrades are also likely to be a big draw for old and new players.
---
Free the homeless! Wait.
---
No problem
---
Welcome to about a month ago :)
---
That's coming for a sub cost of $1.99/month.
---
I got mine from thirst things first.
---
Could always do that since the feature was introduced.
---
The Gauss is not an energy weapon I have seen various arguments as to wether explosive ones are still available but as far as I can tell they do drop.
---
Oh cool, I had no idea.
---
This sounds fun! Let me just grind a few levels first...
---
Agree to disagree my friend. Haha I have seen 0 concrete evidence first hand or second hand of a radium or gauss dropping as explosive since the change. Data miners have supposedly proven it doesn‚Äôt happen anymore but then again I‚Äôve also heard data miners proved the opposite side of the arguement üòÇ
---
Leader of the pack is the best way to get that, but you might get 3 weapons just to troll you.
---
Well I'll be damned. After mucking about with ipresentinterval you are 100% correct. My bad. It's hard being a bumble fuck.
---
250 levels and \~1000 hours I have never seen a Lemonade stand.
---
They really should at least give cross progression ie use my xbox character on PC.
---
Unstoppable monster can easily go for 15k on a trade subreddit, it can no longer be acquired and is a good starting weapon when transitioning to a bloody unarmed build. The other two if they're not 3* aren't worth much, mostly just scrip price
---
See, I was right. No idea why he kept arguing after I agreed with him.
---
My bad man, your definitely right, it's an unnecessary step now.
---
Part of me says yes, because they are kind of cool in   
---
a fun novelty way, then I remember this will just make it harder to get the actual weapons that I want and I say no thank you.
---
20days~ since the addition of the patch, but we‚Äôre getting deep into semantics here, lol
---
I‚Äôve had a crap day, sorry for taking out my frustrations on your post
---
Have a lovely weekend
---
Bethesda is not your client. They didn‚Äôt hire you to do this work. You did it yourself. Your tools are 3rd party to them.
---
Regardless, you‚Äôre just getting into semantics. The spirit of it is that they don‚Äôt want you using tools they didn‚Äôt create or approve to exploit the game, whether you‚Äôve got good intentions or not.
---
I guess I knew the bone hammer wasn‚Äôt worth much but I‚Äôm still hoping someone needs a broadsider for their build. Unfortunately I‚Äôm specked into heavy guns and even with all related perks I still do more damage with my explosive gat
---
Ok Boomer would be the perfect name for a good Fat Man, tbh
---
Personally, I love my FSS RW Super Sledge (named the Guilty Verdict) and my TSE RW Minigun (named the Siegebreaker)
---
I eventually raided my stash for stuff I half wanted to keep. Logged in with a different character to get them done and got 8 drops in West Tec ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Broadsiders are broken, only work as an AoE I hear. Might try it yourself. Supposedly enemies don't take direct damage from the projectiles
---
So update, figured out how to replicate the error 4:8:2000 login failed. Account not authorized. I get this if my console goes to sleep mode while in the main menu.
---
Ohh ok, thats interesting, because thats an account ban error code!
---
*sigh*
---
I got it.
---
I hate myself, but I got it.
---
I hope so. I have zero friends left that play. But would love to see it strive.
---
As of right now that wouldn't work. PC is too hacker prone because it has no anti-cheat
---
I hope Wastelanders does. There is a great amount of unmarked locations we can't build at so I take that as a good sign.
---
Damn straight we do!
---
What's with your headline declaring that "some of the workers will join the fallout 76 team"?  There is nothing in that article that even says anything about Fallout 76.  Did you just make this up?  This is a completely false statement and should be retracted for there is no validly at all with that headline.
---
Your message would be taken more seriously if you left out the gratuitous number of ‚Äúya‚Äôll‚Äù.
---
Read this as ‚Äúoooooo‚Äù like you were curious until I saw OP‚Äôs response
---
I hope this post made you feel better about whatever you were upset about
---
Sure it's worth a join we have people on at all sorts of hours I'll send you a dm with the link
---
I'm sure a few exceptions are fine dm me for the link when you are ready
---
yep it worked. Nice build!
---
No problem we can help out.  Just dm me and I'll get you over to our discord
---
&gt;I personally think the issue is that players of Bethesda games have gotten so used to having to fix their games to make them playable 
---
Unless you consider every game before Fallout 4's mod support was officially launched allowing mods on console.
---
Thank you!! üòä
---
I'm sure there will be a few who would love to help a new character like you,. Dm me for the discord link
---
I saw a similar post yesterday. Sounds like a new bug.
---
Oh really? I must've missed that post.
---
Yeah I mean now that I think about it, I helped a few friends with their camps when we played more over the summer.  A lot of people just don't want to deal with the building screen.  Maybe they don't have experience with or they're traumatized by building a billion settlements for Mr. Garvey.
---
Well, really it isnt this particular location, its any main location. Im kinda new and im just tired of every good location i get to its already been ransacked by farmers.
---
Capitalism always prevails in the same fashion that decentralization always prevails.
---
Well first, some have told me they have never played and are criticizing it. That‚Äôs how I know. Because they say so. Would you take the advice of someone who has never been to a certain restaurant over someone who has? No you wouldn‚Äôt. 
---
And length of time is also important. Someone who made it to the overseers camp and said they hate it, has far less knowledge than someone who has made it to a queen event.
---
I'm sure your pretty sentimental about that 50 call but just about any other prefix would be an upgrade
---
If you play this game then that's a way of supporting it, and you're on this sub so I'm assuming you play. Not sure what you're trying to get at about being against supporting the game if that's the case. Also, basically calling anyone who bought first an idiot doesn't make you any better than those calling everyone without a subscription a peasant. It's time to stop with the childish name calling. While it isn't okay what Bethesda has been doing recently, it's also obvious they aren't going to change things or they would have by now. Either be an adult and accept that people can't always get their way and just enjoy the game, or stop playing.
---
Wasnt farming, tryong to ACTUALLY hit it for tge first time but ive still been trying on new servers, no luck. I went through at least 14 servers so im just gonna get fallout 1st. Have my own server.
---
Well, I started by myself and was getting in a rut till I met a few people and played regularly with them. It‚Äôs a lot more fun with other people. And if you make it to the overseers camp and say you don‚Äôt like it, you haven‚Äôt even played the game yet. You wouldn‚Äôt have even gone through one town yet.
---
Do you kill it before it can get them?  It doesn't always spawn with them, but it should gain them after a while.  Typically it's a lag thing, but if it happens on a private server, hard to say.
---
I saw multiple posts about this issue. One person was claiming that this occur when you delete legendary on private server, like reach the limit how many can spawn. How long you were playing on this private server before launching a nuke?
---
No definitely not haha It had plenty of time to gain its stars.
---
Not very long, maybe an hour max. Nobody claimed to kill any legendarys either.
---
Right, that's what I was saying. I've never done anything to get banned, but this happens whenever I go into sleep mode. Weird stuff
---
Serums are why caps are useless lol
---
I saw a streamer last night playing.. She was freaking out over it like it was end of days. Weird stuff, the game is the same as it always was. People crying and don't play are the weirdest of the bunch. My guess is they wanted another single player game they could pirate. Makes sense.
---
The punch bowl works as a makeshift sink.
---
I had a full pirate set, whitespring jumpsuit, and halloween fireman outfit show up in my inventory. I assume I got them when I blue screened out of the event in the end (it happened a lot). Maybe they were supposed to be there but wasn't and it was fixed. I have no idea really that is my assumption.
---
I would love to but you need to do like 8 different medals after that that I haven't even done yet
---
&gt;I do want to add, that the person who did report it was permabanned as well
---
I think that's a pretty significant fact that's not being noticed enough.
---
Hopefully Wastelanders will change that...it would be nice if we could build into more existing structures
---
the free stuff was supposed to encourage people to buy stuff. since what they were giving away wasnt effective sparking sales, they cut back on it
---
Bionicle
---
Can never find a Xbox server where a good amount of ppl do the event properly.  Ugh :/
---
I'm sorry I don't understand you, I don't speak peasant.
---
What do you mean? All damage will penetrate armor by a certain degree by default, and high damage will penetrate all the way to the 90%cap once the damage is over 6.66 times the value of the armor. That's the way it worked in fallout 4 and I've always been told fallout 76 uses the fallout 4 system.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
https://i.imgur.com/0hKtbHu_d.jpg
---
As you see from the example on the wiki, high damage VS low armor will ignore 90% of the armor, the full armor penetration cap.
---
Most of those posts were just hype posts to trigger a response similar to this I would guess.
---
As painful as it sounds I think I‚Äôm going to do this.
---
I'm curious. If this occurrence was able to be replicated with consistency, would this be a viable method to gaining levels in relative peace, or would playing normally and hoping for the best yield better results?
---
I like the junk fence idea a lot.
---
"Well, better not enter this place." about sums it up.
---
Ps4 Tag: Vulcanthropy
---
I had something similar happen to me. Thousands of rounds of ammo types which I don‚Äôt store or sell popped into my stash. Had to dump them as they took up a lot of room.
---
I remember right after NW came out the prevailing conspiracy theory was "You watch, they're going to just let the base game die now so they can focus all their attention on NW because it's a cash cow. It's going to be exactly what happened to Fortnite."
---
Exactly the reason I tried the private worlds. Was sick of spending precious time server hoping to find a location that hadn't already been looted or enemies already laying dead on the floor. That's not even grinding as there is nothing to grind! I've managed to build up my supplies again very quickly and can once again enjoy exploring and playing the game. Makes such a difference but it still doesn't sit easy with me that I have to pay extra to play the game the way it should be.
---
&gt; the stack is just 1 item in your inventory with a number attached allowing you to pull from it and "create" more.
---
Only for junk, though, as weapons have more values attributed to them. Also, you can go up to max 8 players on a private server.
---
All boarded up houses being hidden entrances to new dungeons...
---
PS. Aaaannd we're in Blackreach üëøüíÄüëª
---
Good addition. I wish we could use them as empty spaces till they were used but I have no idea what kind of work that entails.
---
On Xbox I sell them for 250c.  Same price I sell 3 star legendary scrip which is ironic as nuke cards are practically guaranteed legendaries yet they don‚Äôt sell but the scrip does.  
---
I suppose all the meta gun builds can down them in like a microsecond compared to us melee folk. 
---
Ah well I‚Äôm fine sitting on them for when I get an itch to drop a nuke on Queen or for giggles on ppl.
---
1) There is literally nothing in either of the links you sent me that has anything to do with weapons having a base armor pen. 
---
2) here is the actual actor value for armor penetration. specifically states on it 0-100%

I remember reading those comments, but overall, it's just been a sad time for Fallout fans.
---
Juicehead is pretty damn good. I have been playing online games for nearly 20 years. Everything from the top MMOs to sports to Call of Duty type shooters. He understands what a game should be from a consumer standard, if anything I think he has been more than fair to Bethesda. Banging on him for being indifferent or against what has been going on is basically taking a stab at his first amendment rights. He gives praise when it‚Äôs due and criticism when that is deserving. I don‚Äôt like anything in media that is strongly biased. He certainly doesn‚Äôt run constant negative videos.
---
In the mire once you can survive there
---
I sometimes feel like I'm already there...
---
Haven't had that one, sorry.
---
its abbreviation is AnCap, and fallout is anything but ancap. all major enterprises are working for the government and most are to some extend confiscated by the army. do you even know what ancap is?
---
I‚Äôve seen that happen with non-sentry boys but the big ones still always seem to gone me 6-700 xp, was farming today without issue.
---
It actually does because this is the comment that the developers decided to put in this record specifically to explain how much armor pen works. 
---
You are confusing how armor works with how armor pen works
---
lol damnit yes sentry bots üòÇ
---
Sorry, got off early tonight! I‚Äôve only ever run 1 silo so I just want to learn the process a little better.
---
I speculate that nothing happens except a fluff inside the vault on ‚Äúhow far we‚Äôve come‚Äù.
---
iirc when you spawn at Harper's ferry go straight ahead and down some stairs and there is a square building sat on it's own. Inside there is some display cases with the black powder rifle in and some ammo. Careful though as there will be a few enemies lurking around it.
---
I wish this were a thing
---
What about commando without stealth? Also how would you compare auto vs. non-auto rifles?
---
Let me try again.
---
1. Damage is calculated on a sliding scale where at the low end, low damage is heavily reduced by high armor, and high damage is reduced very little by low armor.
---
2. As damage dealt goes up, higher damage will ignore a higher and higher percentage of armor, which can be expressed as "damage has armor innate armor penetration"
---
This commenter explains it better than I can, but he says the same thing.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cx2wgp/patch_13_energy_weapon_buff_the_numbers/
---
Yea agreed, even if the houses are empty they should still be available for camp building. Heck even if it had no loot I'm ok with it.
---
The grind time is worth it in your opinion? I started to shy away from firearms because I was really only coming across .308 and not enough of that to use a firearm full-time.
---
Im a disappointing person sorry bout that.

12,800 atoms.

So many üêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêë here for Bethesda.
---
I wish blueprints saved the furniture and decorations so we could just buy and sell those.
---
50-100 if you want them to go fast, and provided they are full or in the 70+ charge area
---
Usually 50 to 100 caps if they're full cores
---
for nothing to happen
---
Yep still rolling along solo a lot.  Been finding myself helping characters xp farm for levels and recently started farming for rare outfits, never used to care for them.  
---
I got 3 characters I bounce around but my main favorite is my original melee character.  Love to go around with my prison shank knife cutting everything.  Though my character sucks against ranged but I still have some fun PvP with it.  
---
Just yesterday while chilling at my base vending with players some player started hitting me in melee with be slow blade and I shanked them after the turned their back to hit another customer.  They came back with a PvP meta handmade and started destroying my base but I still snuck around and shanked them in the ass a second time lol.
---
Moments like that are hilarious and that kinda stuff happens a lot to me so it keeps the game going for me.   
---
Playing with my daughter was really recent but absolutely beats having to play roblox with her lol.  
---
Although I‚Äôd love it fallout 76 could do events that you had to survive disasters aka last man standing like in roblox those are surprisingly fun and I think could translate well if done creatively. 
---
I do think the game needs more though, hopefully now with more cash coming in they start delivering that soon; hence why I support it.  They‚Äôve given me a lot of enjoyment over my gaming life so I‚Äôm on board to see where this failboat goes :)
---
We aren't professional game developers so have to use the tools we have...
---
There was supposed to be lore regarding that but I guess Bethesda decided not to let players know about it again. Basically there was a plague after the bombs dropped and it was boarded out when people inside died to prevent infecting others. Maybe the blight?ü§î
---
Vats
---
This literally happened to me TWICE while farming scorch beasts yesterday! 
---
My vampire mini gun made me invincible until Mother Earth showed me whose boss... lol
---
I don't think you made the glitches up but i think you did make up this post
---
Probably nothing too exciting, other than a positive spin on the year.  Ultimately this game has been a fun diversion that I never really wanted or expected before it was announced, but I have genuinely enjoyed the in-game community.  I'm not sure about this game's future, but I hope Zenimax/Bethesda has learned some lessons going forward.
---
Next time I'll post my 10 hour long gameplay video and you can watch all of it.
---
Probably vegan. Looks pretty green to me
---
I have to go on LFG through Xbox to find any of them, and even then it‚Äôs only a few here and there used to be I could join like any game and within 30 minutes there would be a nuke on Queen, and the whole lobby would mob out
---
I feel like PC is just still healthy, it definitely feels a little empty most of the time on xbox
---
I must just be getting lame servers then idk
---
Thanks for the reply, this looks good will try it out, thanks again
---
I attempted the vault raid once and honestly it was horrible. Beth should just hand the reigns over to obsidian at this point if this is where FO 76 is headed.
---
I had something like that today I dropped a nuke and only one other person showed up we were having a laugh over it though
---
Oh really? Do you remember where you saw this?
---
Yea I agree honestly, maybe it‚Äôs time to sell the rights to Fallout back to obsidian and the original creators.
---
I still mine for 1c per unit of charge and they run to sell fast enough.
---
The game uses aws so it puts you into a regional server with other players close to you.
---
Ah ok, googling just showed me capitalism. Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm not on that often otherwise I‚Äôd take you up on that
---
You on ps4 I could use some
---
Stealth is purely an option, but sneak attacks do an extra 2x damage which can really boost your damage output and save on ammo. If you were to start a Commando build I'd recommend not focusing on stealth perks until you've unlocked all the perks that boost you raw damage.
---
ive personally never had this happen
---
Oh man, if I could get one with a suppressor, bloodied etc I'd eat my own jizz. 
---
But I can't coz I deleted the game and sent hate mail to Bethesda.
---
You can be as causal as you want. You have to say hi once every 30 day‚Äôs to be considered active llol. 
---
Hell if you chat often they have prizes!
---
Eh I guess it can‚Äôt hurt
---
Duped yes?
---
What if I wanted to run with the Plague Doctor mask in Nuclear Winter? What outfit and hat would be the best match considering the stuff we got in the Atomic Shop?
---
1 cap per charge point and anywhere between 100 to 130 or so for a full charge core.
---
This is the correct answer, and don‚Äôt bother with units under 50% charge
---
Psn*
---
Yes, I am. My username is Kap10MooseKnuckle. I'll hop online real quick if you want to buy them now, or just let me know when.
---
It's quite simple. When a person or company is caught in a lie, they lose credibility. When they are caught in multiple lies, it tends to annihilate goodwill and trust really quickly. 
---
Bethesda has lied to us repeatedly, has shown their incompetence every step of the way through the launch to now, and has reneged on previous promises they made to the community and players of the game. At this point, I'm ready to take nearly anyone's word on them doing a bad thing simply because I trust them so little. 
---
If they didn't want this kind of reputation, they shouldn't have cultivated it over the last year or two.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for a big new info dump on wastelanders but I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll get it
---
I got some to unload carlost306 psn network
---
Sorry, should have clarified. The map showed the yellow circle highlighting Morgantown. I was in the blast zone. The screen shook and dust fell from the ceiling as a loud bang was heard, but I didn't take any damage. I thought maybe people were just having a laugh nuking the newbies doing the quests in Morgantown (there were a couple other low level players around), but after reading this thread, maybe there was no malintent after all? ü§î
---
In my experience they go fast at 95.  125 max  but they will still sell, just slower.

It's not limited to Tesla Rifles, it's just Bloodied Builds with the Tesla Rifle trigger it all the time (and Executioner's with the correct combo)

Low charge fusion cores are good for making ultracite cores.

It has an AP reciver

&gt; Juicehead is pretty damn good.
---
I agree. I have no problem with juice head. He's one of the better youtubers because he isn't prone to jumping on bandwagons. Which is why I was somewhat shocked by his latest video.    In the case of this banned player, he is one of at least eight youtubers who are pretty much saying the same thing.
---
This is an awesome idea!
---
We did 20 queens in puplic yesterday and one was non legendary
---
Is the exploit a natural bug? Is there a way for it to be replicated without the use of external software? Don't take the part about professionals the wrong way, what i mean is that you wouldn't have the chance to use the proper software unless you were part of Beth's in house or freelance dev or FQA teams.
---
I don't remember anyone ever showing any proof of that happening, but it's fixed now if it ever existed in the first place.  The color is determined by what mods are applied to it.
---
Yeah public lobbies are fine.
---
That‚Äôs a rare one for me.
---
More often than not everyone tries to let everyone tag them first.
---
Thank you üòä
---
I don't recall which particular camp highlight YT video it was, but there is actually a tiny market for paying players caps to build a camp for you.
---
Please see my edit. I posted links to other videos that pretty much echoed what you said. I was not singling you out.  I was using you as one example of many. Yours came to mind first because I watch your channel more than most.  
---
 They all seem to be reading the same post from the Map76 guy.  One guy claims he was banned and everyone immediately believes him and is  an uproar.   I just don't get it.
---
I sure .44 ammo on my pistol build.
---
Why?
---
Because I wanted to be Kellogg in this game damn it...but I can‚Äôt even have the goddamn bull barrel.
---
But yeah, the guns suck.
---
I‚Äôm still running around with my level 5 Somerset because it‚Äôs armour penetration makes it better than anything else I‚Äôve come across.  (Nearly level 40 now).
---
...at least it‚Äôs lot boring like my other character who is a bloody, stealth commando with a bloody vats enhanced handmade....sometimes it‚Äôs just more fun to run into the middle of a group of enemies with machine guns (so super mutants) and shoot them in the head one by one while serendipity props every half second
---
This thread discusses all the benefits of AA in various scenarios.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cx2wgp/patch_13_energy_weapon_buff_the_numbers/
---
Basically you will always benefit from AA on a gatling plasma because you won't be reaching the cap with a fast firing weapon like that unless you are hitting very low armor targets.
---
I think I saw my first one only 600 or 700 hours in.  When I started farming random encounters I started running into a lot more though.
---
Pretty sure one spawns fairly regularly in the Helvetica towns collectors exhibit. Its a wooden shack behind the church.
---
I would say so. More so If you do things solo as opposed to groups due to the damage vs survivability. I still die a lot, but I just switched a week ago or so. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve repaired any armor yet though despite this.
---
People actually pay those prices? Damn.
---
Thats exactly what id like to see
---
Would be great if the map changed. Not massively, but would be good to see the structures and deserted buildings having a face-lift. After all, it's been a year since leaving the vault, and we are rebuilding Appalachia. Maybe even a few intact roads appearing ... for the eventual vehicles dlc (fingers crossed).
---
Thats why im worried. They might focus too much on fallout1st members that they probably will forget normal players
---
Omg I remember  that it was like near iron forge
---
If you use VATS, I don‚Äôt think it counts as hip firing. It‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm wrong though.
---
I knew they were adding new gauss weapons in wastelanders. Didnt know there was going to be a minigun though... that's going to be a pricey gun to shoot. Lol. But im getting one none the less, it sounds epic.
---
3 caps stashes, a lot of nuka Cola and some scrap
---
This.  They go to full or greater depending on your INT.
---
Geez 1756
---
Yeah project paradise needs a trigger so we can organize teams.
---
There is concept art of the pistol, a gatling/minigun(multi-barrel) and I believe assault rifle styles.
---
500+! Here's to another 500!
---
for me it was thunderbluff but yup that's one.
---
Would not be surprised if they announced F2P (free to play) but my guess is another meat week like event and a Wastelander update.
---
The jarred scorch heads are pretty cool.
---
If that's the case, sucks there's no group that tries to run peaceful 20 minute games until the fire closes and kills everyone.

Any updates on your tickets?
---
I dunno, ‚Äú the world is my dumpster‚Äù is my new favorite phrase.
---
I've seen 5-10k.
---
I named the weapons after memes I just think it‚Äôs funny lmao
---
Cool, thankyou
---
865
---
Thanks that‚Äôs great to know. I‚Äôve seen some weird pump shotguns in vending machines that has explosive bullets effect but no major effect, I suspect those were the result of that bug.
---
Oof, I shoulda took the gamble. Both were sold when I went back both 2500 each
---
But murder is the most fun
---
Yeah pretty much I agree, can't say whether what they did was right or wrong but no response at all from customer service?? That's awful
---
The first "playthrough" was so much fun. I miss it.
---
:(  
---
Sorry to hear that.   
---
I'm really hoping they nail wastelanders which could lead to old players returning and new players joining ü§û
---
The gun plans can be bought at Grafton.
---
Right on. I was going to put a stock on with better hip fire and it‚Äôs the first time this dawned on me. Thanks
---
Ah, that explains it.  I thought it was intended.
---
At any rate, it's only worth what you're willing to pay for it.
---
2001 (A Space Odyssey?)
---
Posted about that 19 days ago, so it would have been after the patch. It's on the unofficial bug list now, so hopefully it will get fixed. 
---
It also effects seeing which magazine is in which magazine rack.
---
Needs more meat. And pinch of salt
---
I payed $7 for my copy at a second hand shop
---

---
I wish I still had this much hope or enthusiasm ü§î
---
My old friend I used to play with back then gave me one. He was for sure a duper since he had two.
---
What about crossbow?
---
Mmog fails, a notorious leaker for fallout 76 info has said they have 2 holiday events + a wastelanders pre-launch event planned  
---
Take it with a grain of salt though, I wouldn't mind another community challenge month, I digged getting free things
---
I was wondering the same. I guess I will rise my prizes then(I have been selling those with 10 caps).
---
mods that improve hip fire also improve vats %.  correct me if I'm wrong though
---
Scorched beasts can be legendarys now.
---
You can drop stuff till you're under weight then if you open the social menu without closing your pipboy and choose to fast travel to a friend your bag will be where you travel to
---
Used to sell full charged one around 30c, on pc, higher prices seemed to never sell at all.
---
I'll join in a few
---
Possible bug on that.
---
I've crafted them at 120%, then with Power User used them, and while they show at 999 in the ammo counter at start, when "depleted" they sit in your inventry at 20%.
---
Now I need to do more testing to confirm if you get those first 200 shots or not (Wasn't paying attention at the time).
---
But even those 20% Ultracite cores can be "washed" back in to normal cores by putting them in PA frames\*, and then used again to craft more Ultracite cores.
---
900
---
Do not have access to my console right now, but I am guessing that I spent at least 2/3 of my time puttering around in my C.A.M.P...
---
If you're willing to pay, why not just get 1st for a month 1650 atoms an outfit and 2 emotes that you can keep. ü§î
---
783
---
Fallout 1st+
---
Not for me.
---
All I needed to know, thanks.
---
Answer is yes both people got banned. There were 4 of us in total who ended up getting banned. I was unsuspended after I harrassed them for 13 days straight for updates to my situation. Ended up missing the entire Halloween event and the nw stuff as well
---
I'd by 2mm EC at 1 cap, but most of the time I see them at 5 or even 10 caps a piece.
---
Considering that I can make 27 for Lead and Steel (No Gunpowder needed) and that I farm so much Lead I sell it, anymore than 1cap and it's not worth it.
---
Maybe elite riot gear or advanced at least
---
Like snow? That would be a decent change up
---
And can we have an edit so we can change the skin without moving, storing, or having to relist everything? ü§î
---
Nah, they will be items in the Atom Shop exclusive to Fallout first members!
---
I've always wondered who boarded up these buildings, and I have so many ideas I'd love to see behind them.
---
There's no such thing as a legendary limit. Sometimes a script fails to run and this is what you get. Otherwise it's the servers ems/ews budget being totally depleted so you end up with almost no enemies when waves are supposed to show
---
Is it a Ultracite ammo or Prime gun?
---
and half of the rest at the loadscreens :D
---
Prime. Tbh it‚Äôs all my guns and ammos I made ammo for.
---
You getting you the crafting bench plans from (Responder) questing/ wondering the wild.
---
Only exception being Power Armour Bench, that is a specific quest down in the Ash Wastes
---

---
Looks good
---
You may consider changing out  Traveling Pharmacy.  For PVP you wouldn‚Äôt be carrying too much extra junk so you may not actually need it.
---
Suppressor.  Depends on who you are fighting (with the 110 limit - it may not matter much).  Also, depending on your build (weapon) you may consider Tenderizer-1
---
Scope. I use the iron sight once in a while, but sighting down an invisible iron sight crouched with chameleon is not optimal.   My cross bow is an Instigating VATS (+ critical, +30% hit chance) which is a monster (720 base damage in stealth) over 1k criticals. With a scope I can use my other Instigating vats (limb damage, + dam while aiming).
---
There's areas called workshops like Gorge Junkyard, if you clear out the enemies and pay to take the workshop, you will get plans to build things. You can also find plans laying around. And the robots venders sell them. You have to go to the notes tab and click all the plans and recipes or you can't use them.
---
Kinda looks like it's flipping a double-bird to me. :D
---
Missil launcher with target computer.. 6-8 shots with demo Expert.
---
The mask is duped.
---
I‚Äôll take them. What are your prices? I won‚Äôt be home for a good few hours though
---
[PC] I have every mod for Lever Action, I can mod your weapon if you are bring me matetials, bu charge, just materials I want to! :)
---
Before it was released they made it seem like nukes would have multiple effects on different areas.
---
This was another of the many lies
---
What do I do when do u need
---
1488
---
I got 2 left full charge
---
1413 hours
---
Also if you want to gain this mods by yourself, you need to scrap lever actions. Also some mods have plan for learn it, you can check station vendors for that.
---
Add me, IGN:emreyigit93, we will talk about it but I'm won't be online for a few hours.
---
It‚Äôll be new to Bethesda‚Äôs take on the Fallout universe, so likely very different.  There‚Äôs also supposed to be a gauss gatling and a different gauss rifle.
---
Guess someone should test it with a buddy. Engage friendly PvP have them stand always off. Then test the vats percentage. Mod weapon test again rinse repeat.
---
I have to ask, you are making the correct Ultracite ammo for it?
---
There was a gun (now fixed) that when Primed used a different ammo type (example, normally uses .45, Prime made it a .44)
---
I have traveling pharma for the ungodly amount of stims super stims and chems I carry, and I was considering doing suppressor at 2 to get tenderizer but I plan on using U.S Operations magazines for either +10% damage to players or the one for -10% damage from players depending on circumstance, thanks for the input though I was a food build until I discovered sandman on YT, I was at about level 80 at the time. Now at 145 I can proudly say my build is complete and I can finally start upgrading my modding/crafting cards(super duper, gunsmith, etc.)
---
Hear, hear. Good speech. 
---
Happy Birthday you sick bastard of a buggy mess! Can‚Äôt wait to start it later the day.
---
For improved VATS:
---
Automatic weapons, Aligned barrel, aligned stock, green dot sights (and the other non magnifying sights)
---
So many ppl don't know this tidbit.
---
Action Boy/Girl is a solid perk, and one that I would expect to max level on a lot of characters
---
I also saw that üòÇ
---
Sadly I 100% expect this exact thing. Maybe some crap stats that we don‚Äôt care about. They should have a page inside the fallout portion of their website displaying up to date stats they posted before that update like every day or something. Way too much work for them but it‚Äôs better than releasing blog posts that give us stats we honestly could care less about with pretty large issues in the game currently.
---
2541
---
I think it‚Äôs only 2. I‚Äôll have to check when I get a chance.
---
Well you need ultracite ammo for a prime weapons, and regular ammo for non prime weapons. Theres no crisscrossing
---
Admmantium skeleton doesn't work in pa and put starched gene's
---
Do you know more about ems/ews budget for the servers? How exactly it works, is it different for private and adventure servers? What kind of actions are depleting this budget?
---
It‚Äôs a good build
---
I'm wondering the same thing. Hopefully they won't put npcs in Morgantown.
---
Almost 1k I‚Äôm on a break after they took away the NW rewards a day early &amp; refused to even say a word but last time I checked I was at 967 I think? Cool to see the hours some of you guys have put in.
---
That leak said it was dead in the water.  Obviously we can think its fake but the horrific netcode for this game is a bigger indicator for me.
---
Remember, BGS Austin has never made an online game before and after 12 months we for 15 updates.  
---
Crossplay seems so far from a reality let alone a dream
---
Yeah I'm pissed.  Had about 2500 xp to go.  Logged on to find it gone.
---
About 900! Played about the first 120 solo, and the rest with my bf. We met playing 76.
---
Ah ok, cool. I remember seeing the Gauss pistol and some other (plasma maybe?) weapon on a twitter post or something. Very excited to see some new weapons :)
---
2234
---
It's an image of a combat shotgun with the same skin. The skin was taken from a pack on the Creation club for Fallout 4, and they didn't have the time or the professional inclination to take a more accurate photo
---
Only issue with this, Workshops are PvP areas.
---
i have loads of plans. they are all yours. mankind1979
---
messege me and remind me what you want and i‚Äôll meet you when i can!!!!
---
[If that's actually the amount of hours you've spent and you're not just fucking around](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words), I'd suggest logging in and playing for another few hours.
---
550ish. Just another 7100 till I get those 20 Atoms!
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Nothing at all. :(
---
yeppers! not now will be later on.. i‚Äôm on at some point daily
---
Awesome thanks bro I am level 8ish I believe and managed to grab power armour from a spawn near the 76 bunker
---
and peppered.
---
There's a shop inside the Whitesprings that sells them, or at least plans to craft your own. I think it's simply called Black Powder.
---
It seems like there's too many personal problems going on behind closed doors for Bethesda to celebrate an aniversary
---
2419
---
That‚Äôs no problem I tried looking up your gamer tag couldn‚Äôt find you, my gamertag is; Ulzra
---
Hmu when you get on bro
---
When they were first announced I hoped for something like those ammo vending machines at the train stations. I wish they would make a reskin to that, but I don't think they ever will.
---
I picked up a bear, and decided to put him in a display case. I dropped him scrapped and stored junk, then picked him back up. Did this multiple times. Then I finally got back to the camp, built a display case. Built some atom store stuffed animals on the bed. Went to put the bear in the case and he was gone. Because the stupid build system used him to make the stuffed animals. üò°
---
you on ps4? i got the fireman uniform
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm so disappointed. I was loyal to this game and Beth in general but this really woke me up. They don‚Äôt care unless it‚Äôs about money.
---
You‚Äôre thinking of an Editor. A publisher doesn‚Äôt edit books they publish them.
---
You ruined the surprise. üòÇ
---
Makes sense you like the brotherhood then.
---
Valentine's content has been in the game files since last year. I think they forgot to enable it
---
I appreciate it but I was going for resale. I have one for me already.
---
lel
---
you haven't lost that much friendo
---
There's also a whole lot less going on in a Nuclear Winter map, 50 players be damned. Zero interactive clutter or things to harvest, only like a dozen AI creatures, far fewer containers and none of them instanced, and all the players/interactive objects are confined to a fraction of the entire map. 
---
I really want the Firestorm effect for adventure mode nukes, and for them to expand on shaders like that in general, but no way it's that simple.
---
267 and tbh I regret the last half of it, coulda stopped after 100ish hours
---
Considering it's weight I doubt that they had hundred**s** of flux lost.
---
Yes I know the scrapbox has no weight limit, but the flux had to exist somewhere before they put it in.
---
this. i cant have my future cola bar if i cant use my signs without the insane budget impact :(
---
seems they take the "put your heart into it" quite literal
---
1026
---
...and many more to come!
---
you have to be sneaking just heads up, but he's the motorcycle grenade guy
---
that's just sad
---
What other perks don‚Äôt work in power armor? I know serendipity doesn‚Äôt work but how about dodgy and other agility cards?
---
I feel it's more like "Shit, the game is hemorrhaging players. We're gonna have to go-back on our word and do some kinda crappy stuff to keep the lights on and not let the game die".
---
......How you just gonna make me not have to kill myself to get around?
---
I'll try this out.
---
If it ever does come, it probably will be a micro transaction.
---
Ha yeah and cut the flowers if you have any. And if you've got the deathclaw topiary it would cut that too.
---
The nuclear winter storm should be what they use
---
100 caps for fully charged fusion core if you want them to go fast 
---
right now im selling them at 110 caps, just to see if it gets sold at all or if the extra 10 caps are too much (lol)
---
anything below 50% should be sold with 10-20 caps less than its current charge
---
Well, technically, Fallout 1st isn't *content...* if gamers consider it "content" then it's really no wonder the general standards for game quality has gotten so low in recent years.
---
Probably nothing to be honest.. and would it really surprise you?
---
I literally have *1* friend who plays.  I only play Fo76 when he's online.  I'm so overencumbered from only playing with him on his private server I literally need to do weird workarounds like this just to keep playing...
---
Hey it may sound "drastic" to you but it was frustrating as hell to me. After I reinstalled the game I haven't had any crashes at sign in at least.
---
That's really nice. 
---
I had my camp in that very spot last year from just around November to mid-January. My base was a floating platform, tho...
---
T...The idea is your friend goes there for you to travel to them for free on, but you're absolutely valid and correct.  I didn't know this was already a well known thing.  I just discovered it...
---
D
---
Sigh, I probably should but then people would complain I'm selfish and hurt everyone who cared about me.
---
I guess that's still okay, pretty sure no one genuinely actually cares about me.
---
Increased hip fire accuracy increases vats accuracy
---
Max it out
---
Sorry, I don't know as I've never run radicool w/o the other perks and gear.
---
Fertilizer and toilet paper...
---
Even unboarding the donut shop near Flatwoods would be nice. Give low levels a splash of high sugar/AP snacks and another pie machine.  
---
Just put some life into the map.
---
If they bring back 50% off Purveyor, I'd be a happy CAMPer.
---
2400
---
Gatling Gun in brass would be nice.
---
Why would i pay 15 eur (not certain about other currencies) when i could pay 10 and only get the emotes. I dont need the useless stuff 1st gives you
---
Thank you!!! I'm moving my camp all the time lol!
---
1 year later and the game still sucks gorilla nuts.
---
I stopped playing about 2 months back...just plain tired of the BS from Bethesda.
---
My CAMP is more of a home/rest stop than a store. I have a vendor, but I treat it more like a soda machine or a phone booth you'd find on the side of a building, rather than a full on shop. It's there if you want to use it, but it's not the focus of my CAMP.
---
If I didn't want someone buying from it, I'd either just not list anything for sale or remove it outright. But that's just me.
---
What matters is that yongslant shat out another video.
---
Does the ‚Äúwelcome mat‚Äù solution work with this? Place down a welcome mat where it says you can‚Äôt build and you can place things on top of them.
---
This has an optimisation purpose. If most interiors were opened and decorated, I would be forced to play the game at 2 fps
---
&gt;You can load in before the doors on occasion, and see the ‚Äòboarded‚Äô effect before the interactive doors pop-in
---
Same with Berkeley Springs Station.
---
Ill try that
---
Are you a retard in technology? Do you comprehend that transferring server entitlements between accounts in order to "recycle" them makes completely no sense and is not the way its done?
---
Are you truly just a piece of shit who's going to live such a ignorant life?
---
Have fun then.
---
Hopefully they won't crap themselves like they did on the anniversary of the bombs dropping about a month ago.
---
As a PC player, I also don't want to see console players ruining out helpful community either - griefing is basically exclusive to console.
---
Makes sense.
---
I‚Äôll be really happy if the new version of the gauss rifle doesn‚Äôt require the player to hold down the trigger, then release when firing.  It‚Äôs so awkward and way harder to shoot laterally moving targets that way, at least for me.  It‚Äôs also a pain to cancel a shot.
---
If the charge started once aiming was engaged and built up on its own with subsequent shots that would be such an improvement.  No need to swap weapons or holster to cancel fire.
---
It‚Äôs seriously the only reason I don‚Äôt use a gauss for a sniper rifle.  I could teach myself to deal with a hold and release mechanic, but having to put the gun away when a shot fails to materialize is a dealbreaker on a sniping tool.
---

---
Bethesda do it again and again and someone never learn...
---
&gt; time flies when you play a game so humourlessly bad, it‚Äôs actually enjoyable! Who would of thought that. 
---
Fallout 76 is the Plan 9 From Outer Space of online games? Never thought of 76 that way until now.
---
Max it out and look for a piece of armour that offers food weight reduction.
---
Fallout1st subscribers get exclusive bonuses and the rest of us get a "thanks for sticking with us as we explore the Wasteland together" or something
---
does a full ultracite core become a full normal fusion core when inserted into pa?
---
I usually price everything at half of ‚Äúsuggested retail‚Äù, with ammo and chems for cheaper. Seems to work well.
---
Unless we're on even ground, I usually go for the head first to knock out their eye laser. Their pathfinding is a bit shoddy, so it takes them awhile to close the distance if you're on higher ground. 
---
I personally use Blocker and Dodgy, so I can shrug off their melee attacks much better than the laser.
---
I've never put a full Ultracite core in PA, but the 20% Ultracite cores were coming back at 20% standard cores
---
238, which is close to my guess of 250.
---
Anyone can buy a PhD at oxford to be honest. As long as your daddy is rich and powerful enough.

---
I don't know about your idea necessarily but I could see something similar, like a pop-up AirBnB.
---
They tell you were to place your camp and you provide them with all the basic amenities for a fee. 
---
Like all the benefits of a survival tent but with more options and no need for Fallout 1st. 
---
Speeds up their xp/legendaries/scrip/caps per hour and does away with any encumbrance fast travel issues.
---
Honestly the commons will help me a bunch to get started anything I can‚Äôt use I will give to my buddy he‚Äôs starting out aswell so I‚Äôm sure it would help him aswell, I am really enjoying the game though it‚Äôs super chill
---
Why are you here then?
---
Getting in and out of the PA, will give different results then storing then redeploying  ;)
---
Cross save would be awesome as well
---
Happy Days.
---
Would love some of the Fallout 4 experience trickle in to in 76.
---
I built a fully automated Farm.All the work done on it by Robots i built.
---
I think the boarded up houses add a more abandoned look so they should stay boarded up but we should be able to gain access somehow
---
I logged in 1312 hours.
---
No worries, welcome to the wastelands!
---
 What time zone are you in?
---
I know they're a business, but I honestly feel they owe us more than just a thank you. The game community has been the best vitual community I've been a part of, but everything else surrounding the game and its release has been a total mess, right from the start and I feel it's only been getting worse with every fiasco we have. I just hope they manage to turn this game around and head in the right direction...
---
Attention
---
Around 120 because there is no content for solo players that doesn't like to grind.
---
Agreed! Though, for the time being, use the cooking station clipping camp glitch? You can access most like this.
---

---
I dropped about 300-400 in when I got my scrap box...

Luckily I got it after the issues were ‚Äòresolved‚Äô

980.
---
One year down, and meant more kills to go. Feels good man. This is really something special
---
You are right, and do not deserve your downvotes at all. People want to be negative and have a warped point of view about this but the reality is that Bethesda didn't ask them to hack the game. Regardless of intent, they have people for that. 
---
I've been using the bank robber analogy on here and YouTube. If you broke into a bank, using bank robber tools, and got caught, how far do you think you can get if you told the cops "I wasn't stealing, I was just testing out the security system out of my own benevolence."? 
---
Even if he had "good intentions" he still used a hack to hack the game. And got caught doing it. Why is this even a discussion?? If they asked people to hack them to find security issues, which does happen, then that's one thing. But, knowingly and willingly doing it on your own volition without any permission or protections is another thing entirely. And, it really shows the collective intelligence and maturity of the community that they can't at least see that point of view.
---
But no, Bethesda Bad, right guys? I'm sure DongYeah and Juicehead will make videos tomorrow about this Reddit post, as that is all their content seems to be anymore.

Uk pm me your gamertag

Definitely did happen.
---
Perfect, me too üëç

\&gt; Considering it's weight I doubt that they had hundred**s** of flux lost.

Do you realise what Fallout 1st is?

I got the protective from the harper‚Äôs ferry vendor, spawned after purchasing and learning the previous ones.

The shield raider underarmor plan I got as a reward drop from ‚Äòone violent night‚Äô a few weeks ago.

VATS is considered its own thing and has its own secretive nonsense, hidden stats.
---
There seems to be some bug that causes mobs to be immortal. You can hit them with any amount of damage and they'll heal right before your eyes. They also do not react to anything, and won't move from their location. I had a 3\* glowing mongrel today :(, spent too much ammunition on it...
---
Mole rats or something most likely. Those players may have led them to your camp. Anyway, that happening is pretty rare. Sorry that happened.
---
I noticed same issue but, I see same issue with with the vendor bots and that's been going on for a good while now.
---
New Icon
---
read your post tho
---
If you're PC, I'd be happy to pimp your gear with fully decked out mods, yo'.
---
Ultracite is.. one of those ones you just don't really think about accruing the plans for. It sounds scary - but with how often people drop nukes (On PC at least), it goes by reasonably quickly, and I'm pretty certain that I'm only missing one or two mods at this point.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No

143, with about half of that time spent managing inventory lol. I've had fun, but honestly can't comprehend how people have thousand hours plus, especially in under a year!

or a stupid excuse to keep it easy
---
The teams I've worked with are typically able to take down a SBQ within roughly 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on how quickly we get her to land.
---
Strategy is to draw her in
---
Stay off of D9
---
All ranged weapons  get a shot on and then focus on clearing the ground for the melee characters to do mass damage.
---
Continue to clear the area  after the kill until the ground clearance is completed.
---
Store your rewards flux and loot the SBQ

REPEAT...

I'd love to have Vending machines in the Style of a Soda Vending machine or even one of those Gumball machines. I'd have all my Ammo in the Gumball and my Nuka Cola and other snacks in the Soda Vendor....Ohh the possibilities...
---
So you are claiming that almost half of your Stash weight was flux.....
---
One of the people on your team probably got into pvp with another player to make you hostile to the other player who destroyed your camp. From what you said my guess is the two high level players teamed up with you to destroy your camp.
---
The pvp system sucks. I usually only team up with good friends cause other people usually get me killed, because I'm in passive and can't fight back.
---
We should not be forced into pvp because people on our teams a dicks. üòû

This is confirmed to be coming early next year.

I saw a player with long hair wearing a Firebreather uniform, an Old Fisherman's hat, and a plague doctor's mask. It was a pretty good look on them
---
600
---
On one character, yes
---
My mules had my other crap

Benefits of a fianc√© that plays. Had access to easy transfers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

fuck bethesda. fuck todd howard. fuck pete hines. fuck fallout. fall elder scrolls. fuck starfield. get it bethesda? you are pure scum.
---
Check the vendors in whitespring resort or the vendors in watoga.
---
2000+ hours.
---
What system are you on I'm selling a fixer plan at 15k on xbox
---
very low here. day one player.  i think i got like 150hrs or something.  still love the game dearly, just not much into gaming anymore.  its the only game ive played in the year (other than the occasional brawlhalla which is a free beat em up that u should def check out if u are cool enough).
---
Pretty sure you can still get them from the vendors (check both) at Grafton.
---
You need to PSN account to play 76 and  any other online PS4 game.
---
helvita, one off the back buildings, it looks like an old musium. there you will find as well the civil are suit and hat and some other goodies around there.
---
Beantown baby.
---
Sorry you tell you that but **there will never ever be drivable vehicles in a Fallout game** as long as they continue to use their shitty engine.
---
Horses are the most they can do speed wise but everything above that is too much for the engine. If they use this same engine for their new title Starfall or whatever it's called there probably will also be no vehicles at all.
---
1862 - the closest would be Borderlands 2, Skyrim, Fallout 3-NV-4 all combined (hundreds of hours each).
---
I look for bloodied weapons I dont have and bloodied explosive weapons i dont have
---
I sell legendaries at 100 per star unless i know it's worth more i sell it at what its worth or a little less
---
I sell nukashine 150 caps each  stimpacks 10 each diluted stimpacks 5 each super stims 30 each 
---
5.56 ammo 1 cap each 45 cal 1 cap each full fusion cores 30 each 
---
Plans 20 each or I drop em by my vendors in a bloody guts bag 
---
Exept for fixer plans those I sell for 15k
---
I give away legendaries at random by dropping em at peoples camps or at their feet
---
That's not what I'm saying at all, and I think you know that. Just that if you have no interest in a game, what's the point in coming to a sub dedicated to said game? Just to make sure people know you aren't playing anymore? Who cares?
---
Misc
---
thanks!!!
---
Its the same shit in Adventure mode on Xbox as well.  Played for about 2 hours last night and again...nothing was rendering correctly. 75% of Whitesprings, Watoga was invisible... no workbenches, no vendors, no guard shacks, no robots or legendary enemies.   Also the "dead zones" were back and now when you are sprinting you will hit an invisible wall about once every 5-10 seconds which takes at least 15% of your health.  A few times when I switched servers I would spawn into a world which only had bloatflies and ticks...then it was only exploding liberators.  This got worse with the last partial "hotfix". It had been steadily getting worse since Mischief Night, then just shat the bed completely the past few days.  Seems like this may be the new normal...unless you get the sub i'm sure.
---
Oh Christ it's been a year.
---
Well you're right. Im not playing anymore so I visit this sub once in a month or so to check on things. But just let the people that are really disappointed express it. I know its not in a "polite manner" but it gets downvoted anyway. Its not like Bethesda doesnt deserve some hate you have to admit. Its only natural for people to lash out eve if theyre not playing anymore. Most of the sub is positive anyway.
---
my bf and i bought them from the super mutant that wanders around, Grahm!
---
But I think when you're looking at the machine itself it's under aids. On the map it's misc.
---
Could totally be wrong. I haven't sold or bought them in a while.
---
Now you can find serums for low prices 300-400 caps. More than 500 is too expensive.
---
i thought the serums were under aid?
---
I wouldn't pay more than 450 caps.
---
It just works!
---
Just commenting to check this out later so I can try it solo over the weekend. Thanks
---
Easy to find. Watoga station.
---
thanks for the tip!! someone actually was trying to make me buy them for 1000-1500 bc they told me they‚Äôre worth 2000
---
Those boards are harder to compromise than the vaults. It must be Enclave technology...
---
oh ok gotcha! i got confused bc i know they‚Äôre under aid so i thought they‚Äôd be under meds when looking at vendors
---
someone was saying they‚Äôre under aid when looking at the actual vendors at the camp. i was asking what they appear under when you look at the green vendors on the map and can see the layout of what everyone has to offer from each category
---
How do you know?
---
Well the prices people are posting seem for be 50-100. I had 30 I got rid of at 75 each, they sold within a few hours
---
They are talking about the map thing. There's no aid. There's food, drink, stimpacks, misc, etc...
---
thanks for the tip, def will look for them ranging under that
---
Action boy is a must have. In 99% of all builds.
---
They said in an inside the vault thing, or something like it.
---
This used to happen at my camp in the mire often, I play on XB1. That was a few months ago but I noticed this again yesterday as well.
---
K, I'm gonna have to take a look.
---
Thanks mate! That's good to hear that is finally coming.
---
PA and PVP is a no sense.
---
The vendor bot at Harpers Ferry has both sturdy and heavy combat armor plans.
---
The BOS mod plans can be bought relatively cheaply from the vendor bots in Grafton.
---
You will never beat me to my nuka plant. I will always loot first
---
They are in aid
---
No he didn't, nowhere in that list does it say reading memory is against the TOS.
---
A very convenient "bug" around the free atoms...if it would affect the Atompurchases it would've been fixed the second somebody reported it
---
on his website, he stated that his friend reported something, but he did not report the footage he got
---
One 1st month free for all players. üéÇ
---
You can find them at around 300 a lot sometimes cheaper. That player was going by the default sale price which is way too high
---
I feel like any info that comes from those should be taken with a grain of salt
---
In the machine yes but when you view a machine on the map they're under misc.
---
Really I didn't know that thanks :3
---
Right which is exactly how they had been doing it since launch, aten_ra would report them because of his contacts at the Dallas office from when they flew him down.
---
NP, and they need more catagories when viewing a vendor on the map. It's been trial and error to figure this stuff out.
---
yeah they introduced this many months ago to 'counter' camps that were build underwater
---
it's stupid and buggy
---
Sorry just a question here whilst I do get its unfortunate and I believe his ban has been lifted from what I've heard (which may not be 100% accurate). Even tho his intentions were genuine isn't admitting you datamine a game by definition breaching the terms of agreement. I get it was to make a tool for other players which is admirable it still doesn't change the fact they have breached the terms they signed to use the product?.
---
yeah, for what we know those could also be 'money 1st subscription' only
---
If you target high DR use instead heavy combat armor.
---
I too would like to know this
---
Where is your camp? Players will kite ebemies to camps to destroy them. Especially at WS they'll agro the robots and use them.
---
How to get fo1st? Maybe?
---
 Was this text to speach?
---
I dont think there are bos posters. The advertisement posters should give you a good chunk of them tho
---
r/ihadastroke
---
oh, alright, I dunno then
---
Prices depend on what you think they are worth
---
I'm sorry man.
---
I‚Äôve checked everywhere suggested, sadly nothing. Thanks for the effort tho guys!
---
"lv30" doesn't really strike "endless search"...
---
... but I hope you find the plans anyway.

The features we‚Äôre looking to add in 2020.
---
PTS
---
Perk Loadouts
---
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
---
Legendary Player
---
Social Menu Fixes
---
Additional Public Events Improvements
---
&gt; You haven't actually watched the video.
---
Which "the video"? There were many on the topic, by Yong Yea, Jim Sterling, and others. Why cherry pick JuiceHead when I did not even mention his channel in the context of the "900 hours" story? And that is only one random example of past outrage over something that was later proven to be untrue or only partly true. I feel like you completely miss the point and just argue for the sake of arguing.
---
I‚Äôm hoping it will be added with Wastelanders.  They mentioned some weapon adjustments, so it would really be nice.
---
There is one its at the end when you scroll through.
---
I take everything with a grain of salt üòÇ
---
Yeah, that is why there is such an uproar. These weren't just zome random players, these were dataminers that had been working with the actual devs and been flown down to Bethesda office to talk to them and help the devs.
---
What they had been doing was the same stuff they had been doing since launch that Bethesda felt was worth rewarding them with a free trip to their office, yet now they ban them for doing the exact same thing.
---
Also, keep in mind the exploit they got fixed was literally how entire accounts were being stolen due to the log in credentials being sent in plain text over the internet. So it wasn't some "oh just a new way to dupe in game" it was a major security breach they found and fixed.
---
I have seen them as low as 250c, I have paid 400c and sell to vendor bots for up to 495c. If you looking to get for yourself don't pay more than 300c.
---
It's called "perk loadouts" and was announced to be coming in 2020.
---
Quote: "**Perk Loadouts** \- Perk Loadouts are also currently planned for early 2020. Like the PTS, this is still very much a work in progress and while we‚Äôre excited to get this system out to you it‚Äôs still a ways off before we can start sharing more details. Look to a future Inside the Vault when we get closer to their release."

---
Agreeing with other people doesn't mean you're jumping on a bandwagon... maybe it's because the other 8 youtubers are right?
---
seems like we have things in common 
---
I would strongly disagree with that statement. But to back it up I would have to dissect how we‚Äôre interpreting what ‚Äòpeaceful‚Äô protest is and how the change in times by default create a different context for what happened back then. I would also have to go into how any online ‚Äòprotest‚Äô of Bethesda in context to the civil rights movement is completely peaceful but then again people these days consider online name calling as ‚Äòviolence‚Äô. It‚Äôs not that I think you‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôs just that once you unpack that discussion it becomes impossible to get a definitive ‚Äòright‚Äô answer as the context for ‚Äòpeaceful‚Äô seems to change every decade , especially once those marginalised communities get more freedoms. Personally I would regard calling Bethesda ‚Äòfucking money hungry scumbags with no souls‚Äô whilst killing fallout 1st players on the spot online to be completely peaceful, but alas we live in times where words seem to hurt just as much as sticks and stones. I‚Äôm sure other people have expressed what I‚Äôm trying to say a lot more elegantly. I‚Äôm just a fallout 76 player, so by default I‚Äôm working with less brain capacity than the average video game player.
---
But you still come to bitch on reddit thank you so much
---
I can't imagine anyone spends a drastic amount of their gameplay time looking for harder to find perishable plants to craft chems. The vast majority of the player base just simple don't craft those chems. I know a spot in the game to has a lot of firecracker berries, and I know a spot in the game that has a lot of brain fungus, there isn't a spot in the game chocked full of Starlight Creepers. I can usually find about 10 plants max in 45 mins of me running around like a moron in the areas I've found through google that grow them regularly. This is not a fun aspect of the game whatsoever and I would get much more pleasure from having a few of these plants in my camp to simple craft these chems at my leisure.
---
From what I've read the exploit was the game was sending and storing your login credentials as clear text which allowed people to steal other players accounts. Bethesdas account security is abysmal, like now it also came out if you screenshot your logged in Bethesda website and it includes the web address in the screenshot others can use that address to access your account as well.
---
Hell yes
---
If he had accepted that invite from those two players is it possible somehow one of the players left the group, and made himself hostile to the party- to be able to destroy his camp?
---
I know this used to be a thing back in the day, but is it still possible this way?
---
The haters will continue to hate
---
recently my random legendaries are selling well 
---
price list:
---
1* equipment for 760-1000 caps  
---
2* for 1500-2000 caps 
---
3* for 2-3K caps 
---
bobbleheads for 100 caps 
---
magazines for 50 caps
---
Konami.. yes Konami of all people actually did this for MGS5. In FOB mode (a sort of PVP tower defense mode), cheaters were eventually quarantined to a match making server and forced to only play with other cheaters.
---
Konami in 2017 did more for gamers than Bethesda in 2019
---
Has axe.
---
Cannot break into boarded up buildings.
---
So 8 hrs later no response why?. Because we call BULLSHIT just go away stop coming to reddit you fucking troll
---
Oh god hearing 2b2t makes me expect to shortly after hear "is the oldest anarchy server in the history of minecraft" from a fitmc video.
---
If you've been doing quests, this is actually normal, and unrelated to the guy yelling at you. 
---
After completing Rose's questline you're rewarded with a power armor chassis that is weightless and directly tradable until you deploy it, after which it becomes a typical chassis with a Raider set on it, and will weigh 10 pounds after being recalled. 
---
The same happens after finishing the BoS questline, except the set is Ultracite rather than Raider.
---
Shielded won‚Äôt drop unless you already know protective so go buy it
---
Imagine if we get a surprise Wastelanders release?
---
I mean......it wont happen but it doesnt hurt to dream.
---
I'm not sure, but I think that is what happened. ü§î
---
Mr. Howard. Give us a completed and functional game above all else.
---
Lol vehicles DLC?
---
About 1500. Had my fun with it and may return at some point, but for now there‚Äôs Death Stranding and the outer worlds to get through first
---
How does any of that help when Bethesda was just caught saving and sending your login credentials as clear text over the connection? Or the fact you can use someone else's link to the Bethesda account website and it literally will give you access to their account with zero authentication, just a "oh you ised this link so you're now signed in as so and so.
---
Do u use concentrated fire?
---
Fallout 76: 1720. Borderlands 3: 2. The Outer Worlds: 0.
---
Really? You got ripped off. I bought 2 for 12k each  at vendors back when they came out. Duped weapons obviously
---
It's probably in advertisement posters, check the 2 venders in Watoga.
---
Probably we'll get a useless/filler Inside The Vault congratulating themselves on how far they've come since launch. Even though it'd be a load of horseshit since the game has barely, BARELY improved since launch.
---
They'll thank us for our continued support through the past year (even though they didn't deserve the support).
---
MAYBE some limited time Atomic Shop items to celebrate the anniversary (give us more money to support our broken game).
---
I can't believe this game happened the way that it did in the first place, but that it has only marginally gotten better over A YEAR, seals the deal for me. Bethesda is capitalizing on fans paying for microtransactions and 1st subscriptions and because people ARE paying, they see no reason to fix the game. Hey let's add microtransaction after microtransaction and add a subscription service, BEFORE WE FIX THE GAME. Yea, it's all about money. And you all are giving them the go ahead to continue these shitty business practices by buying the shit they're offering. Don't complain about how things haven't improved over the past year if you were one of the people buying their shit.
---
They should take the next few months of no content and focus what resources they have on getting the game out of BETA. It almost seems like a finished game ready for a public release!
---
Might I refer you to r/angryredditors
---
The silver shroud one is probably in Unstoppable posters, I would check the 2 Watoga venders for it too.
---
Blue fuzzy helmet? You don't mean the blue Mr Fuzzy mascot head/mask do you?
---
Ok so possibly in a set of advertisement posters I shall seek ty.
---
West Virginians would like more flat area to build on as well.....
---
About 700
---
I can‚Äôt get through into the lift but my teammate could but the button in the lift didn‚Äôt work
---
If you mean the Mr Fuzzy mascot head, you can get tgat by collecting Mr Fuzzy tokens at Camden Park via the Daily quests.
---
The helmets with lights are in the Camden Park rewards machine, colors are random. The yellow one without the light is in a porta potty at the flooded quarry north of Watoga.
---
20 fuzzy tokens with get you a mr Fuzzy hard hat of a random colour from the Camden park rewards.. i believe this is what your after? You can get red yellow &amp; blue as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
I'll have to check when I get home, but it's not going to be a crazy amount of hours. The game is too much of a broken, incomplete mess for me to play daily. And unfortunately after a year of updates, it hasn't gotten much better. But oh boy, the microtransactions sure have been able to go strong this past year...
---
That 5% can be a monster. If I miss the first shot at any percent I just get out of vats and re-engage. Works better than trying 10x in one vats
---
Yeah besides whitesprings and queen nukes are pretty boring, even high concentrations of flux in spots don't have many enemies besides those two, maybe could bump up the spawn rates like crazy in some nuke areas
---
I can't wait for this to come out. I have every item weight reduction perk maxed but it's too damn tedious to switch I never use them, running around all encumbered. 
---
Be nice if I could have armor presets too but I guess I can rename them. In the meantime it'll be nice just with the perk loadouts.
---
I might be wrong but it seems like there are 3 plans for postes. Advertisement posters, Unstoppable posters, and Communism posters. ü§î
---
How about I refer you to eat a sack of dicks
---
Flashbacks to BL3 oh no
---
There's more important improvements and fixes and whatnot that the game needs first. Crossplay would be awesome, once the game is complete and functional.
---
&gt; I don't think I actually got any details wrong per-say,
---
*per se*.
---
And a bit of rat poison for good measure
---
Are you welsh? üëÄ
---
800
---
Lol that's cool :D
---
I wouldn't spend money on it (not gonna spend money to support the developers of a broken game) but it is still a neat idea.
---
Everybody will be reset to level 1
---
I think the reward should be 5000 Atoms üòÇ
---
No, the lower fuzzy token cost mr fuzzy mining helmets that come in random colors.
---
827
---
Fix the game first, then add this. But yes, I agree.
---
It depends. I believe that there's still a long term bug where if you trigger vats and then fire immediately after, none of the shots register.
---
Try doing the same again with VATS but give it 1/2 second beat before firing and see if that changes anything.
---
Fix the game first, then I'm all for it.
---
30, I had the game for two weeks
---
"Beta"
---
of full crap from bethesda
---
T and Y are next to each other on the keyboard, so that'd likely be it.
---
Yea ok I can try but i was thinking the same thing.
---
Or maybe 760. That‚Äôs a ton of hours and what is it like 10? Craziness
---
Keep checking the vendors. I've seen them at all the vendors beside WS and Flatwoods vendors. Most frequent are the two vendors at Grafton and the two at Watoga.
---
The 10mm SMG with its missing front sight is the embodiment of Fallout 76.
---
Bethesda released a broken, incomplete, beta of a game for $60. After a year of updates, it's barely gotten any better. They also released a subscription service that contains highly requested community features, one of said features that Bethesda straight up lied that they couldn't do because it would strain the servers too much (unlimited storage).
---
That's why people don't trust them. They have done absolutely nothing to earn our trust. It doesn't surprise me at all that people are against them. Even in cases where we don't have all of the information, from either side. It's no surprise that people are defaulting to taking the side against Bethesda. They honestly deserve it.
---
The raid
---
Flying into the airport in Charleston is one of the scariest things. You see miles and miles of rolling hills and think ‚Äúwhere are they going to land a plane in this?‚Äù Then you land and see they literally took the top of one hill bulldozed it over into the valley next to it to make a flat spot.
---
Yes, your chance to hit raises with each miss, getting me to 95% constantly an I miss more than I hit.
---
Lol I have quite the opposite experience. If I snap and shoot my vats I can hit shiit around corners and behind cover because itl auto load 95% and then calculate the real hit chance.
---
All gilded everything.
---
I'll have to try that. This game continues to frustrate me. I've spend the last couple months being spotted in stealth on literally a constant basis before someone said unequip and reequipt your perk cards and now shit doesn't spot me in broad daylight. I just don't understand this game.
---
Happy anniversary. Holy crap. I looked so forward to this game last year. I was hyped to hole summer and fall. I never would have believed i would play this "live service" less than a year. I played Fallout 3 about 5 years long and Fallout 4 now since 4 years. It's such a disgrace, this greedy, broken dumpsterfire...
---
The vendor in watoga station definitely has them. If you don't see them on your first try server hop a couple times.
---
V94 mirelurks and bugs hit with poison dealing a lot of damage.
---
Harpers Ferry and watoga station vendors.
---
about 150. I had fun exploring the big world but i quit after the fridge.
---
About 450.
---
Imagine just chillin in survival mode, and you suddenly see a laser on your head.
---
Remember the old Gatling gun front sight bug that made it unusable? I wouldn't be surprised if the 10mm smg has the same issue.
---
The game is full of this sort of crap sadly. If you've been there from the start you pick up on little details like this.
---
Hope that's the issue and it's not something else.
---
No, you can‚Äôt. That was the first thing I tried when they added display cases and was really disappointed by this
---
This
---
Yeahp. They look better.
---
Bethesda just trying to encourage us to play more.
---
It's not false information or incorrect journalism though. Those guys aren't lying about Bethesda, they're telling the truth. Bethesda did it to themselves, they deserve the hate and loss of good will. They're just reporting what Bethesda has done and is doing.
---
I absolutely agree.
---
That's what grenade launchers are for.
---
Yes the best to be caught by VATS opponent and take your deadly crit one shot.
---
I don't think there is a way to buy FO1st without subscribing to it. 
---
Worse off is that the subscription doesn't show up in account management to cancel it (just like the console instructs)
---
I guess I'll find out in a couple of weeks if that means auto renew is active or not.
---
It's not funny, I agree with you, but as I said you pkayed 45 minutes more just looking for this. Of course I want it in the camp, maybe with a gardener dlc with new quests for unlock the projects. Anyway for now, if you need help to find ingredients, I can help you because time ago I studied all locations of some ingredients and where you can find easy and fast. (I wasted lot of time, days)
---
Hitchance is added to the hitchance of your gun. If your sniper rifle has a hitchance of 90% on the head, your own hitchance is added to this. If yours is 95% at this time your overall hitchance would be a multiplication of both probabilities. 90% \* 95% =  0.855 = 85,5% Hitchance
---
You got a good drop so they *must* have changed something?
---
That's not how it works, it's just perception bias. Your sample size is far too small to say anything changed.
---
No it was on mobile ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hey, PA PvPer in here. I see you're on PC, I can spar with you, if you'd like.   
---
As to your build, it's pretty nice, not that far off mine, except: 
---
1. VATS drains cores extremely fast, but seeing as there are not that many points to put in Perception for PA users, Concetrated Fire is ok-ish.
---
2. No need for Adamantium; switch to Lifegiver or nuka/chem prolonging perks, if you'e bloodied.
---
3. Action Boy is redundant with Lone Wanderer; you'll better of with Dodgy.
---
So I guess you're using bloodied build w/ emergency protocol torso and stealthboys, eh? How doest that work for you in real pvp combat? Genuinely interested; I always try to stay 100% HP, as PAs are quite the tincans, but do have EP/SB torsos on fave wheel...
---
Maybe he speaks Tamil.
---
Federal Law versus a video game's Terms of Service are two very different things.
---
A sea of glowing ones.
---
A literal parade at the 2:00 mark that had me in stitches.
---
There's a hard counter against it; stealthboy torso. Not that 99% of PA players use it, though, so you got that right.
---
I was not prepared.
---
We were also leveling the little guy.
---
I was thinking about doing that on PC too :)
---
I dont' have it on PS4 or i will surely join :)
---
Any non base game thing takes longer to load in!
---
Always carry a sawn off in case of emergencies üòÅ
---
And to be fair, Bethesda deserves the hate anyway.
---
I have done similar things in the past with plans.
---
Did you notice the legendaries kept coming?
---
Atoms for everyone that's stuck with the game, and ignored all the textbook whiners.  
---
One atom for every day logged in since launch maybe?
---
The PVP dmg cap hinders you to even use your full power and just makes you a worthless glass confetti canon. PVP works best with a high rate of fire weapon and some armor that negates PVP dmg.
---
90% of the game they're still good....its that pesky 10% that fly that'll have you watching your rifle toting brothers with tears in your eyes
---
If you're on Xbox I'll always be willing to do this shit again.
---
This, saw him 4x yesterday! Beats my personal record by 3.  He had those plans on him everytime. Good luck finding him though.
---
To be fair, I think the haters created the fanboys. Since the haters are kinda louder to the point that it's hard to read something really informative about the game on social media.
---
there's a "museum" type building in helvetia that often has a blak powder weapon in a display case.  cant say with certainty if its a rifle, pistol, or random.
---
In PVP your weapon damage is capped at 110 per shot and your damage resistance is capped at 300.  With these limits and being low on health from your Bloodied build, it leaves you very little room.  Higher DPS (damage per second) weapons are ideal in PVP.  Ones with 25% faster fire rate are a bonus.
---
Stopped playing after getting kingdom come on gamepass and outer worlds
---
You can use the outhouse, it's not so dirty, the only problem is that a molerat (i call her/him "Molly"), live inside it :D
---
Annoying, but at least the stuffed bears plentiful/easy to find.
---
Likewise - the VATS/Shoot 1-2 works like a charm for me.
---
The junkie build with vanguard/chameleon/sentinel armor and either faster fire rate or vats crit is probably the gold standard right now.
---
Of course, you can just brute force anyone with a b/e gatling plasma or even an auto/splitter legacy laser rifle.
---
2.3k hours for me. And if they dont add anything new to do, that will be all of it.
---
yes, I've seen that error message.
---
Got it over the weekend while I was rebuilding camp.  In build mode, tried to select an object to move, got the in use message.  Random item, and more than once.
---
Exit/reenter the build menu corrected it.
---
Maybe the vault will give us a good game that isn't trash to play, to this very day.
---
What is SH armour?
---
Ummm..... more monetizations?
---
Not since they put a cap on damage, now you‚Äôll get killed by anyone with a high rate of fire weapon
---
Bugs still in game since day 1 where you can use vats and miss most of your shots even if its high percentage, last I checked only fix to disengage vats then reengage and that would sometimes fix it.
---
at MOST we‚Äôll get a free player icon in the Atomic Shop (which are totally useless)
---
Swarms can be fun. Especially when you are on the edge of being overrun.
---
PS4.  Saw soemthing similar, but the odd color patches were white.  Thought maybe they were toying with residual snow effects for "winter"
---
then they color spots would randomly be purple or yellow, so that idea went out the window.
---
Issue has not recurred in a while....couple of patches, anyway.
---
I don't agree with you - I'll keep PB as they are...
---
They board up so many buildings because if they didn't, the size of the game would be larger than the storage on most devices. Plus it'd be 100x more laggy, and take a lot longer to load in.
---
strangler heart power armor, its the v94 raid power armor set, adds acid damage to your attacks.  this guy did a pvp video on it.  i use a harpoon gun like he did and it just wrecks people

I still use an IE shotgun with enforcer on my strength build because it's fun. I could be wrong here but I'm pretty sure that the explosions count separately from the pellets towards enforcer because my explosive shotguns seem to cripple more often that non explosive.  My non explosive Vampire's shotgun also provides plenty of healing as well. Yes, shotguns are still fun just not as crazy OP as they used to be(so I've heard, I never had one in the heyday of TSE before the big nerf).
---
Like I said, I could be wrong. If you read the other comments/replies it sounds like I might be.
---
623
---
SO, you have to stand it up in a display case?  Come on BGS, get with it.
---
It's absurd to think that you would build a ramshackle shack from scratch, and not occupy one of the hundreds of abandoned structures already existing in the game. Imagine being able to occupy a little rowhouse in one of the game's towns and having actual neighbors! That would qualify as "rebuilding Appalachia", so I'm sure it'll never happen.
---
Discord. Im out
---
Elaborate
---
Hint, they haven't.
---
Last time I saw the lemonade stand, he was in a  v9/fissure prime nuke zone....
---
Aren't there always sole deposit in each possible location? Except workshop area, of course. I couldn't find anything paired with my vital lead.
---
Underrated comment üëç
---
Oh you mean like 2 deposits so having a silver deposit and a junk deposit. Or node as some people refer it as
---
Or maybe improve stuffs that don't stick, making them stickable?
---
... and planteers for food, like on FO4
---
As much as I agree with the idea of not taking rumours as truth, I have a question: how are you surprised? How? After a whole year of Bethesda doing the exact opposite of what the people who still play this game ask of them, how are you still surprised that people don't side with Bethesda? If everything they did so far has been to the detriment of their community, is it really so surprising that people are willing to immediately believe that they have done something bad yet again? This shit is just par for the course now, of course people will be less and less likely to side with Bethesda on yet another controversy.
---
About the banning thing: yes, the players who have used the exploit have broken the rules. They could have gone about it in a different way. But maybe, just maybe, if these exploits didn't exist, there would be no need to test and report them. After all, these players are not professional QA testers, they are not being paid by anyone, and yet they still literally do Bethesda's job for them of their own free will.
---
This situation just seems funny to me: people who used an exploit to report it and have been valuable members of the community get the banhammer from Bethesda and get shat on by Bethesda's supporters, while actual clear cheaters (who are not using cheats for some kind of "greater good") are still running around free in certain gamemodes with no repercussions, ruining the experience for everyone else. And nothing is being done. Why is the focus on a handful of people who used an exploit (yes, that is bad, I'm not defending anyone here) to report it, and not on the actual blatant cheaters who are disastrous for the game and are actively ruining other people's experience?
---
Yeah, deposits. I couldn't think of the word, so, I called them harvestable items. My bad.
---
I don't mean to sound rude here but the problem isn't that I don't know how to use VATs. 95% should be 95% whether I'm up a monsters butt or across the room. That's just how a percentage works.
---
I've seen Mr Squeeze near FS Prime many times during the Scorched Earth Event, and the Prize Bot several times as well, also if you kill them in the Blast zone you can loot them for stabilizing materials.
---
Vampires swing speed golf club &amp; walking cane. I sell legendaries plans armor and sometimes interesting outfits. Mostly mid priced
---
2600
---
Absolutely, a silver or chrome would be great too
---
65% hit chance should still mean I usually hit. Statistically missing 10 in a row should be a possibility but a rare occasion. When it reads 95% there no reason I should miss 10 shots. 1, 2, ok. 3? Fine. 10? no.
---
No worries bub
---
I'm not sure that's necessarily true. The interior of most houses is identical, with a couple variations (blocked off attic, blocked off basement). Even if they were to use the same assets and just increase the number of places they used them, it would be an improvement (to take nothing away from what you said about instances spaces. It's clever how they do that)
---
How did you do that without constant "part of this structure will be inaccessible" messages that make you want to throw your controller at your tv?
---
Possible the 38 was a mule carrying some high end weapons, or just a standard player with a good build whom the RNG gods blessed with a very good weapon, or the 38 vats headshot you with a high damage weapon... the list goes on....
---
I could use 10 starlight creepers in a finite location then, please. As I said, I would have still played for those 45 minutes, I would have just been doing something more fun. I don't think the "lets pad the game with useless shit" tactic works and furthermore I'm not paying Bethesda by the hour so that shouldn't matter.
---
Hey I‚Äôm glad to answer these questions! I do this all day at work.
---
Regarding clear text: AFIAK this only affects PC users launching directly from the exe, which if you‚Äôre doing this it‚Äôs only ‚Äúclear text‚Äù on your own PC.
---
My last test the login server showed that it only accepted JSON via HTTPS to pass credentials, and they‚Äôre using salted JWT tokens if I recall correctly.
---
Regarding Session hijacking: I haven‚Äôt tested this myself yet because Beth doesn‚Äôt offer a Bug Bouny Program for my skills, but suspected that it was passing a session in risky manner, but again our threat model requires you have access to the persons account while someone is using it or a person dumps a link from their Beth client to a chat, as traffic passed to the Bethesda.net web servers are HTTPS.
---
As both of these require access to your PC to achieve compromise your points are moot and if someone is already in your PC, you‚Äôve got larger problems.
---
On my side of the argument, Having a long strong unique password would prevent both Password Reuse (*which is probably how this person had their account ‚Äúhacked‚Äù which is their own dumb fault tbh, and their other accounts are probably still compromised.*) and make the Password highly resistant to brute force cracking as longer passwords have exponentially higher entropy requiring a much longer time to crack them.
---
Password guessing would be out of the picture too, as Beth has a lockout timer on account logins... for legal purposes I have not tested this ;).
---
2FA is great and all, but it‚Äôs not an immunity shield, you can still be vulnerable to SIM jacking to steal your sms tokens, have your hard token stolen or your phone stolen for your soft tokens.
---
There‚Äôs always a way in, but starting with your own personal password hygiene helps you layer on more defences.
---
Makes sense. Probably just a game error
---
Yeah that guy was clueless.
---
Man, when they crowd like that use a phantom device, its hilarious! A true Larry, Moe, and Curly (the three stooges) moment. It's the only reason I carry them lol
---
haha blow through all your regular ammo? I've never actually done a silo run before, is it doable solo?
---
20 hours in BETA, 5ish after "launch". Each time I logged in, the performance on XBX is hot garbage. Over the last year I have lost all faith in BGS. Uninstalled after Fallout first announcement.
---
Thanks for taking a look though
---
Yea that would totally suck. I only buy skins when they‚Äôre out for a while. Can‚Äôt imagine how terrible it feels to have a hard earned weapon‚Äôs major effect removed by a buggy skin.
---
I melt when they drop that garbage on me. I'm full unyeilding urban scout, with team buffs nothing can touch me except that lol I'm def looking for poison res. I have found one so far, I can already tell the difference.
---
Well I had this character for survival and recently went back to him from my heavy gunner to find out that this character is hilariously weak in comparison. For the record, it is a min max character too. 15 perception, 14 luck, 12 agility, and as many dmg increasing perks that I can fit with no weight reduction perks, and being spotted in stealth CONSTANTLY vs on my heavy gunner who will hear a super mutant say "must have  gone home" from the next room when I'm in power armor just made no sense. Heavy gunners don't use stealth and VATs so I either don't remember these bugs, or they're new enough that I didn't have to deal with them before.
---
While I cant speak to kinetic dynamo keeping up w dodgy, If you run bloodied, emergency protcols is the way to go for toso imo.
---
If you're bloodied and want to run PA than you want emergency protocols for your torso
---
You may want to re-check the thread, as I‚Äôve posted an examination.
---
I hope it helps you learn something today! (Also you should change all of your passwords because your probably pwned and you don‚Äôt know it)
---
Any helps in Vault 94. Everything seems to give you poison and hits really hard!
---
I'm a melee build as well, but I carry a few automatic weapons to deal with things that fly.  
---
You can take down cargo bots with a combat rifle. ( Just takes a lot of shots.)  
---
Hitting the engines slows them down, and eventually makes them hover.
---
Troubleshooters and AA are both quite effective against cargobots and vertibirds.
---
yes it is :)
---
Good to know thanks.
---
About 80, I've played for the first couple of weeks, done all quests/locations, farmed for a bit and got bored. Maybe I'll check it out after NPC DLC is released.
---
Oh my, it looks very cozy! Good to see something different from my clunky fortress.
---
How missed that one, thanks!
---
Yeah, for most people.
---
I can't because I get lost and I will end up back at the elevator 15 times before I realize I've been running in circles.
---
So I'll usually team up with someone a little less directionally challenged on my tank character. I'll take care of the baddies and they serve as GPS. üòÇüòÇ
---
I missed about the emergency protocols, thanks
---
If you are bloodied you want emergency protocols.
---
Dragons arent in the legendary pool anymore.  Not sure why not.
---
I know by now, thanks. I will delete this post
---
which PA are you using? If you are on PC I may have people that can craft it
---
I don't need encouragement but if Bethesda wanna give me some additional financial encouragement then bring it on
---
I think it's a bug as this happens to me too.  If I toggle vats off and on, or shoot from the hip I'll start hitting.
---
But that's pure randomness. It only means your shots were inside this 5% 10 times in a row.
---
where did you get the American flag blueprint? 
---
it is probably one of the few blueprints that I am still missing
---
PS4 here, and after 10 private launches, I can say the legendary spawns are very low....maybe 2-3 3\*s
---
and they drop 1 star junk.  ill keep trying the RNG, but given the number of combos for guns/amour, you'd think BGS would increase the spawn rate for legendary.  Its not like it'll swamp the game with Bffrfr lever riles or uny/sent/ap pieces..etc.
---
meh I still wish this game didn't exist and resources were allocated to other projects :(
---
Sure, I wouldn't mind :D Have an upvote.
---
The reason behind this is that the value shown isn't correct. If you wait a sec it will update and often is much lower.
---
Quad Explosive Blunderbuss would be great to have.
---
this
---
Seems I‚Äôm on the low end of the board, 669(though I didn‚Äôt play anything for like 2 months)
---
Yeah mate, to be honest with you all that was done almost immediately. But your know-it-all attitude to the whole situation is just downright unhelpful. Ultimately I think it was a bug due to a connection interruption. You completely missed the point of my original post as 2FA which is better than absolutely nothing like we currently have, was promised but not given a deadline. I would feel better knowing that Bethesda took security a bit more seriously.
---
["\[Plan 9 from Outer Space\] has since been retrospectively described as "The epitome of so-bad-it's-good cinema" and has gained a cult following"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Outer_Space).
---
I've had a good time, this is my kind of game. I hope it's still around years to come.
---
Earning the pimpboy in nv was super fun and I was always sure to immediately do that. And one of my favorite fallout 4 mods was actually just a pipboy skin (the cool glowy quantum one, not creation club). 110% agree, it would be super cool to have some skins to earn, or new models to get. I imagine theyll stick to atomic shop for those. But even if they do, I hope there will be some cool ones on the way!
---
 Around 350.  I played from beta until about thanksgiving,  then stopped until E3 2019.
---
 if you did belly of the beast you get an Ultracite PA and the frame can show as 0 (not sure why)... If you completed Rose quest you also get Raider PA and it can also show this (often the 0 weight one is just an artifact of visual bug) if you did those 2 quests they might be the culprit, as far as I know, you cannot have somebody place something in your inventory without you actively picking it up...
---
We DON'T believe you anymore
---
Period
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúarm the homeless‚Äù
---
I don't know why you are being downvoted. People can disagree but that's a valid and understandable position you have. I also would be happier with Bethesda putting more work into a really gread single player game instead of providing a mediocre online game.
---
464, came back after a long hiatus but now I just love this game too much and play it every day.
---
I got shielded by completing the Top of the World radio quest from Rose
---
ei that is me :D
---
I played the game shortly after release, and I‚Äôve played it recently. It has gotten magnitudes better. I think the main issue is most people just bought a game and are playing it, they didn‚Äôt sign up for a revolution in micro- transaction morality... and its fine for others to be upset, my problem which is clear from the post is when others come and try and tell us how to think or feel. If you don‚Äôt want to play anymore fine, but to go around calling fallout players outrageous things like abused GF‚Äôs and mentally handicapped etc just because we are enjoying a game we bought and paid for, thats really my only issue. Live and let live.
---
Rocky but I'm still here
---
I'd like for them to take it a bit further than that, and give us the ability to create Ghoul &amp; SuperMutant characters, and I'm not so hung up on Lore that I would care what they did about the Pipboy or Vats.
---
* Supermutant Character Attributes:
---
   * Blue Skin, to easily distinguish them from Dum-Dumbs
---
   * Strength &amp; Endurance Caps increased to 20
---
   * Intelligence Capped @ 5, Charisma &amp; Luck capped at 10
---
   * Natural Rad Resistance equivalent to wearing PA
---
   * Accuracy with Ranged weapons nerfed, and Damage with Melee weapons Buffed.
---
* Ghoul Character Attributes:
---
   * Strength &amp; Charisma capped at 10
---
   * Endurance &amp; Luck caps increased to 20
---
   * Naturally immune to Radiation &amp; Disease
---
   * Inherent Cannibal perk (could be an exclusive food source)
---
   * All Unarmed/Melee attacks also inflict Rad damage.
---
So to sum up what you said you hate the game, you want everyone to know you hate the game, and you still play it for hours a day. Cool story bro
---
A few weeks ago, someone was spending more than a hour in a silo so I went to see if they need help. It was a lvl 100+ player but it was apparent they never nuked before (for example, trying to swipe multiple nuke cards and getting the rejected over and over, shooting the console in anger and never switching to the keypad). 
---
When they apparently looked up a gameplay and did the proper procedure, I told them over mic to please do not nuke Prime dead center. They nuked the same fissure site you mentioned, dead center.
---
It's 20 Atoms, not really better, doesn't reflect the level of commitment, definitely below minimum wage.
---
I only wish they would focus more on fixing the game than creating new shop items and lackluster events. I just hope wastelanders delivers.
---
My main is a Sneak/Crit/VATS build with 5 20% weapon weight reduction armors. I carry \~60 guns, 10-15 of them are shotguns that I use with Zero Shotgun Perks. Shotguns are very good until you start trying to kill any PVE content that has flat DR outside of humanoids.
---
Every weapon is hilariously underwhelming outside of VATS.
---
why no nuke?
---
Shouldn't make assumptions.
---
Im a lv 300. I encounter a missle sentry bot (it shoots a missile shotgun) for the 1st time yesterday. I had rank 3 fireproof on, and it still destroyed me. I was quite puzzled for a good minute.
---
Wait. There was ups? :0 I mean, watching bethesda fail is always funny, but not sure it's a good thing
---
I'm having fun. Played a lot over the last year. Many good times. Fun explorations and adventures. Hoping for more up ahead.
---
One of my favorite moments was waking up next to a cart that was 100% based off the Skyrim opening after my first Nuka Shine. Just thought that was the greatest little nod.
---
I'm glad they postponed Doom Eternal at least, seems like every amazing beth IP is taking a hit at the moment with Rage 2 and W:YB being subpar while fo76 and ES:B are downright ... controversial, to say the least.
---
I'm not joking when I say I'm glad they are done with Dishonored for now, best new IP of this last decade. Seems like something or someone has to change over at bethesda.
---
Horrors? Getting out of my power armor. Each time was a suspenseful nightmare for so very long.
---
I just did this event not issues on my end.  Bad luck then or the event time hasnt reset.
---
would be awesome, but given the delay of this drop, i'd say it has serious problems, and will take a while.
---
I too wish it would drop b/c i really enjoy the game, but it NEEDS new content.
---
I've personally had a fairly positive experience with the game. I enjoyed the quests for the most part (Not the DMV mission but it was hilariously accurate) The PA glitch nearly broke me but they fixed it &amp; I jumped right back in. I love "most" of the building aspects. A lot of fun finding cool locations &amp; seeing what you can create. The seasonal events have been fun. Love player vending. Most of all I've really come to enjoy the community as a whole.
---
There is an old craft-scrap loop glitch that results in free steel (100 /min) but it is so boring to perform I doubt anybody is doing that. As for the prices, I have seen prices go up as many junk vendors want to make quick buck over 1st members buying up steel.
---
They've certainly learned a thing or two about what the people left playing this game will pay for in the atom shop.
---
I've seen a few people saw most frustrating, tormented year of their lives. Must be nice, of all the things in life, a video game is the most tormenting thing you've experienced?! For me it was 2007 , my ex wife was pregnant and we found out the baby was at risk. Months went into planning her delivery , so many sleepless nights. After delivery we still had months of being in the hospital, ongoing operations. That was my bad year. This year I played a game I liked that happened to be received as sub par.
---
This game is already extremely easy the way it is and people still get mad if their aimbot doesn‚Äôt work. I wish this game didn‚Äôt have VATs at all.
---
Great idea.
---
Fantastic, sorry some can hate all they want, but I've been going strong since the beta and have loved every moment.
---
long as in time or long as being stretch Armstrong. I remember that happening to my friend, the then threw on the clown mask with the long nose and an asylum jacket, then started to run at enemies with a super sledge
---
Obsidian is announcing a new game today, so there's that. Timing can't be coincidence.
---
It‚Äôs been pretty rough. Since leaving the vault I tend to have these blackouts every few hours. Sometimes I see things floating in thin air. I can‚Äôt help but think Appalachia is haunted. Creatures around the landscape seem to act strangely too, sometimes not acknowledging my existence at all. Sometimes I think I died in that vault, sometimes I wish things went back to the way they were. Hoping isn‚Äôt worth it though, no one said the end of the world would be easy, but I didn‚Äôt think it would get persistently more difficult. I‚Äôve stopped going to Whitesprings, seems like there‚Äôs a gas leak around there or something, always feel like I‚Äôm drunk when walking around there. Now I sit in isolation most days cursing the god that gave me this life, praying it doesn‚Äôt make things worse. If it does I‚Äôm killing myself, I just hope when I get to those pearly gates I‚Äôm not greeted by a $10 entry fee.
---
yeah, i heard that too, but you get to be some legendary thing...details so vague, i really dont know what to bet on.
---
I name mine in groups so they sort together
---
Most of the players that use this sub have been playing for almost a year now, and obviously like the game despite its flaws. If you no longer play the game, and truly feel as you claim, then why do you continue to haunt this sub with your negativity?
---
Greatest moment was probably coming up close to Watoga for the first time, thinking to myself that this place would be great for a camp, completely ignoring the warnings I got over the radio about the place. And then two Assaultrons decided to attack me from one flank each, and simultaneously a band of Super Mutants snuck up on me from behind. It was a long battle that cost me much ammo, many stimpacks and added many a bonus droid to the battle while maneuvering around, but I did win in the end, after a long and costly battle. Still think back fondly of those days when ammo was scarce, stimpacks were rare and my life was in constant danger.
---
Launching a nuke during the first week, I ran out of stimpacks a bit over half way through and it was a bit of a struggle to complete without dying
---
So do I, but I still have to equip 5 parts and if I want to put them in the stash or take them our, I have to move 5 parts.
---
This quest has not progressed from talk to zach since 3 days ago.
---
skins wont cut it for me...new weapons (4/5 star) would along with new creatures
---
a few hundred more and you might get the elder paint, good luck
---
Is there any other effect on it? The nice thing about railway rifle is ammo basically becomes free at a point, especially with two-shot.
---
It can't be. All of their armor would be made from it. It must be zetan! With flatwoods having a zetan named after it. And those boards are flat wood. Plus we haven't seen aliens yet but they're coming so it must be used to create alien safe houses.
---
Hey that‚Äôs cool and all but you‚Äôre not exactly speaking from a place of experience where I am and have demonstrated that, and tbh my intent is to help and you‚Äôre obviously projecting your ignorance and hostility onto me :)
---
My account hasn‚Äôt been hacked but you‚Äôre welcome to try!
---
Got some PA paint that I sold pretty quickly.
---
Didn‚Äôt read the post :) it‚Äôs ok though! Good luck
---
There are a handful of cosmetics (Bomber Jacket etc) and all the BoS T60 'ranked' paints.
---
The odds however are low, very low.
---
Said that is free ammo and stuff just for clicking a rectangle on the wall.
---
Nope, just Two Shot! I'll add that to the post
---
I hate to say it but you are right SavoirFaire.  Meaningless stats and a heartfelt thank you is all I expect.  Not sure why they don't build some hype with Wastelanders or at least give us a heads up on whats coming in the next patch.  Hopefully I have to eat crow.
---
Mine's been like that for a month or more...
---
Dross toss is always on my quest log - but sometimes I will get Lucky Mucker or Chow Line as well...
---
sucks because I am missing out on a daily when Dross Toss turn comes around...
---
1 star won‚Äôt be worth a lot but if you perk it out it can be pretty effective and again, the ammo thing is a huge plus!
---
U won't be able to sell it if u got nothing better u can use it
---
I never use VATS.  I have a natural ability to almost always get headshots.  Comes from years of CS and BF play.
---
Around 1600 or so and still going strong
---
maybe our beloved incompetents will throw us a bone by sharing some Wastelanders details?
---
Absolutely has to be getting to the bottom of Lucky Hole Mine.
---
I know it's the big Lovecraft easter egg of the game, but I really wish they did more with it.
---
Also the great hunts for the Nuka Cola paint schemes was fun, too.
---
&gt; What exactly does the 95% chance mean? It cannot possibly mean that there's a 95% chance I'll hit the target.
---
Yes, in fact it could.
---
It's possible that there is a bug, but it's also possible that if you have a 95% chance of success you can fail 10 times in a row.
---
    #! /usr/bin/perl
---
    # How often do we get 10 failures if we have a 95% chance of success?
---
    my $failed = 0;
---
    my $throws = 0;
---
    my $shortest = 1_000_000_000;
---
    srand 123;	# Oh noes, there is a seed!
---
    for (;;) {
---
    	++$throws;
---
    	if (rand 100 &lt; 5) {
---
    		if (++$failed &gt;= 10) {
---
    			$shortest = $throws if $throws &lt; $shortest;
---
    			print "10 fails in a row after $throws, shortest $shortest\n";
---
    			$failed = $throws = 0;
---
    		}
---
    	}
---
    }
---
I get:
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 280, shortest 280
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 178, shortest 178
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 191, shortest 178
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 167, shortest 167
---
&gt; ...
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 206, shortest 29
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 326, shortest 29
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 189, shortest 29
---
&gt; 10 fails in a row after 247, shortest 29
---
Mate you're still making assumptions.
---
Hope so!
---
why would you be against additional, optional content? just because he said the N and V words?
---
Best: When I found a cat
---
Worst: When I accidently killed a cat in vats
---
I have to wonder if they‚Äôre just missing at this point. I see people talk about getting them as a drop in Mire or Savage Divide events, but I have not seen them drop in a *year* of play.
---
Likewise, people say you can find protective at Harper‚Äôs Ferry, but again - I have been *never* seen it there in a year. (Nor Watoga.)
---
So either people are misremembering where they found these plans, or they stopped dropping a long time ago. And it drives me nuts because I‚Äôm pretty sure I have Shielded for every *other* under armor but this one, and this is the one I actually wear.
---
Ive had problems with some of those before they seemed to reset but putting in a ticket with besthesda always is a good idea.
---
So no fixes yet? Cause I‚Äôd like to play again
---
I perfectly agree with you
---
Well here's the thing, I think they've already confirmed that there's going to be a shop in Morgantown and I keep noticing that they keep changing things in Morgantown like opening up certain buildings and this seems to indicate to me that they plan on adding NPCs there. Idk how it will work.
---
im on 1st as well and have been looking for chill people to have fun.  no mic. would be good to have other 1st players so the instance stays up even if I leave.

Did it last night and got zero fuzzy tokens
---
Bunch of dual spots but people are on them. It becomes a load into game challenge and annoyance. It can screw you over in a disconnect situation as well. It‚Äôs pretty much not worth taking over. The worst is that copper and steel one near start for obvious reasons. In the start your house pretty much got destroyed every log in.  Even now it still can take five server hops. I only do it on my alt because it was my first home and it‚Äôs close to the junkyard workshop.
---
The silver shroud poster is part of the Unstoppables poster pack;  if I remember correctly, I bought my plans for them from Graham.
---
"That is one big pile of shit" Scorched beast's poop piles with loot in them.
---
I am the opposite. I LITERALLY can't shoot a deathclaw in front of me with a shotgun unless I use VATS. I am terrible at shooters lol.
---
Distance is a factor as well. You can have a high hit percentage and still miss at a distance.
---
...you are in the wrong franchise, sweet cheeks. It's Fallout. That's part of it...
---
Those are fair points, but I feel like the shader is mostly handled by the client, I'm not 100% sure how the shaders work but I imagine it can't be that much harder than saying there's a rad storm inside the nuke radius.
---
Of course, I don't onow, it could very well be hard.
---
Coolio? Is that you..
---
I have because you haven‚Äôt demonstrated any intelligence so you leave me nothing but assumptions that you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
And btw it‚Äôs pretty obvious you don‚Äôt, because otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt need to rely on 2FA to keep your accounts secure ü§£
---
Because I see no reason to make that content, even if it'll be completely optional. Why waste time and resources to make something like this, when there are so many other issues that require developers attention?
---
Same issues in NW.
---
This is new, isn't it?  I notice this start to happen in the last month or so.  It's happening SO OFTEN lately, I've now started shooting from the hip on the assumption I'm more accurate than VATS.
---
I‚Äôm already expecting tons of bugs and d/c‚Äôs with it. If they dropped it early the angry mob would be swimming in so much sauce they‚Äôd have to relabel this thread waterworld.
---
hope it was worth  the ¬£12.
---
At vendors with basic bitch 3 charisma trading perk they sell for 420 caps, so good business. :D
---
You can see this ingame in challenges, there is one which require 7600 hours spent in Appalachia and you can see your playtime there.
---
Decent idea, could be worth a try.
---
are you using Hip Fire upgrades or.....?
---
I really want that to come out for that system but bad news is it was already confirmed to be delayed till 2020 Q1 but crossing my fingers I'm wrong as this would give a huge incentive to keep playing.
---
Did you accept the team invites?  If so, here's probably what happened.  Once at least one of the players was on your team, he initiated PvP with the other one.  This makes the other player hostile against the entire team and opens up your camp for damage from him.  He could have called in an orbital strike or something and leveled your camp fairly quickly that way.
---
Sounds like your tools were used to capture information to review and not doing anything to the game?

**Favorite Moments:**
---
The first time I fought the SBQ. I was level 40 or so and had pretty poor weapons and power armor.  3/4th's of the server showed up and we fought and won in the last 30 seconds.  It was awesome!
---
The day that the player vending opened up was awesome as well.  All the camps were open for business and the community really came together since we could find each other so much easier.
---
Earning the first survival weapon "Crushing Blow" the first week the Survival servers opened.  You had to kill 25 starred legendary enemies to earn it.  With open pvp all the usual spots were death zones.  Looking over my shoulder and trying to find legendaries was a lot of fun.  The gun isn't amazing but I will likely keep it forever just for the memories.
---
My first explosive gun was an awesome experience.  I had created a stealth rifleman with minor perks in melee.  I was about level 45 and was running Uranium Fever for legendaries.  I killed the 3\* supervisor and he dropped a Junkies/Explosive/Faster Movement Speed Lever Action Rifle! At that time you couldn't see all the perks until you inspected the item.  I did so and  I was stunned! I think I yelled out over the mic. Haha! I had seen lots of people with TSE's and realized how awesome they were (pre-nerf). The gun was only a level 35 but it absolutely crushed everything.  Still have the gun and use it once in awhile. It hangs on my wall right now in a place of honor.  That things has killed thousands of enemies in Appalachia. 
---
I recently completed all but the Chemist (pesky plasma grenade) and Collector (pesky magazines) opossum badges. They were a lot of work but I will be pretty proud once I get them all. The Ever Upwards is a great set of quests in my opinion. Lots to do and pretty great rewards.  I hope they give us more ranks to work towards in the future.
---
**Honorable mentions:**
---
\-Fashnacht
---
\-Mischief Night
---
\-Launching my first nuke
---
\-Getting smoked by the Imposter Sheepsquatch the first time definitely opened my eyes. Lol! Finding the real Sheepsquatch after all the build up was pretty fun too.
---
Also silenced shotguns are great with vats crit sneak builds.
---
That isn't how percentages work though. 95% is 95%.
---
I've only had this issue when using a gauss, ruined me on the weapon.
---
Yeah I'm struggling to sell a TSE railway rifle.
---
have you looked at this sub lately my man? how far and between posts regarding the actual content are? they are not even fixing day 1 bugs such as quest markers, DR250, shotties, they forgot to add an item to the seasonal event loot pool (empty rack), they keep postponing features and content they promised etc nothing we say here means anything, they will follow their own lackluster and paywalled agenda. 
---
These types of discussions are the only thing going for this game atm with all this content draught that will last for at least a quarter of a year.
---
This is true, but at a distance it's harder to hit. It has been for a few fallout games. I'm just saying.
---
no its one year after
---
If you mean natural bug in the sense it can only be done with the base game software, depends on the specific bug being tested, some yes and some no....   
---
As for proper software, we don't have access to "Creation Kit" yet either, which is the official software,  as XEdit doesn't yet have the stamp of approval for '76, but that is not going to stop us from trying to find bugs, errors and generally make improvements and tools for the community.  
---
I respect this is a nuanced issue, but as I understand it, most the "hackers" aren't using CheatEngine to exploit.
---
Sorry I use a MAJOR aspect of the game. Not actually though. VATs is your best damage output due to crits and chain hits on a head. Have some self control and don't use VATs if you don't like it.
---
Could make it so you can assign armor to underarmor
---
Meh. Junk is overrated, without endless scrap stash its extraction is pretty useless. I would want to have lead combined with something else.
---
3 rifle cards, that armor penetration card, bloody mess all maxed out
---
Timeline will be moved up when Wastelanders DLC arrive. Right now it is groundhog day on the 23rd every day.
---
Cool thanks I found them at stratton station.
---
I just saw one in someone's vendor for about 500 caps and thought about buying it. I haven't seen one forever either.
---
If you travel around you are going to fight against enemies. Kill them and take their weapons. Then scrap them and then you got some materials you can use for the weapons you want.
---
You can also just take everything you find.
---
Sorry, I meant for scrip, not to other players. Updated post.
---
I haven't found a legendary version in awhile either.  You sure this is a thing?
---
That's why I gave my opinion in discussion - I don't agree we need this kind of content. You don't have to agree with me and support OP, but that is my opinion in the discussion - for me it's waste of time and resources...
---
Well they probably need new tough creatures first. Current good weapons are more than enough to handle everything.
---
What would you suggest?
---
I been doing that but some materials they rarely give me probably RNG hating on me.
---
Are there not some already in the Atom shop or are you talking about something else?
---
Curious if this is a serious question given the number of bugs this game has?
---
Wearing a prototype hazmat suit and sniping the glowing ghouls from a distance might be better.
---
That subscription private blast zone farming looks amazingly fun.
---
Honestly the best place for scrap is player vending machines.  You can make a post on the other sub and people will hit you up with some good deals. Otherwise just check the map for people selling a lot of junk.
---
THANKS for all the help guys, I found it in my 5th relog at Watoga station! 1100 each but wooop!
---
there was a paint scheme for the ranger armor which was about the only thing I noticed
---
I understand you man, but for whats its worth, I think we are past the point of time and resources and since they can't fix 15 fps interiors and objects that take solid 3 seconds to load when you are literally 10 metres away from them for ps4, they might add a pipboy or two
---
My favorite moment oddly was when I got Marsupial mutation for the first time. It was awful trying to jump over obstacles in the beginning or high enough to reach ledges. 
---
Marsupial 4 life.
---
I hope I won't eat my words but I'm loving it, albeit not every second because of bugs and crashes but switching around with weapon builds, launching nukes to get the server together really kept me hooked this long, here hoping a better year for 76.
---
You didnt pray to RNGesus would be my guess.
---
True...mostly mean more variety. The extra stars wouldn't have to mean more dps.  Something like 5min poison resist on vats crit kill. Or invisibility after 3 headshot kills...etc.
---
He is being downvoted because a few hardcore shills don‚Äôt realise how important it is to have opposing views. Any opposing view to Bethesda is good Bethesda is great is challenged with downvotes, in a feeble attempt to silence their voice or at least make them think before posting again...Your opinion is only welcome if it follows theirs. I gave him an upvote to promote free speech.
---
This is my favourite game but the mtx are a bit predatory and should be overhauled.
---
That's how I feel about my Q assaultron head, at least 30 second reload times but hitting an enemy why 20 overcharged fusion cells at once feels so satisfying.
---
You don't know some locations i could check? Cause some weapons i wanna make to get mods for is a 10mm pistol  and SMG. Another one is for the Handmade AR.
---
When I was low level I went to the sawmill in the top left of the map. There are screws and gears and junk all over the place. LOTS of Super Mutants (steel, ammo, gunpowder, caps).
---
I even had my camp nearby because I was over encumbered every trip. Especially if you put your camp on a junk resource you can get all the gears and screws you need. Have fun!
---
Still don't agree with you - for me new pip-boy variants are irrelevant, I use default skin, I'd rather see BoS theme bundle or Enclave themed bundle if you insist on cosmetic changes. I just don't think pip-boy modification adds anything valuable to the game...
---
On the other hand maybe those kind of things should give us the feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
They probably could add that, just make you pay a subscription fee for the ability to do it lol
---
Have you tried just mashing the talk button while he's talking?  I've noticed with Zach,  the Scout Master at Kiddie Corner Cabins, and the Campfire Tales bot, that they often don't seem to advance unless you interrupt them at just the right time, toward the end of their speech.
---
You also could have used the binomial distribution to compute without numerical simulation.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt run a bloodied build. That‚Äôs a quad Tesla. 
---
I think it‚Äôs just anything that does a lot of damage pretty quickly.
---
I'd like to see this function with card sets as well.   Quickly be able to switch back and forth with prebuilt card sets.  Like max weight set, building/crafting set) battle set etc
---
You're completely incorrect about the link. Anyone can access your account with the link:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kiDRaruRrRc
---
Solid ideas here. I thought it would be cool to find a skin that goes on power armor that looks exactly like a super mutant and a outfit skin that looks just like a ghoul. This is even better.
---
Whats the name of the sawmill? I wanna check it later. Thank you for the info btw.
---
I think it's good, with the automatic piston it'll have pretty high damage perked up. My only gripe with Railway Rifles are the recoil. After shooting one spike, it pretty much shoots straight up in the air for each consecutive shot. I have a vampire explosive one that I enjoy quite a bit.
---
Use it. Have fun with it. When you find something better you can give it to a noob for them to have fun with. 5 scrip is literally nothing once you get to a certain point in the game.
---
If I sit in the pocket of nailing that 5% chance to miss 95% of the time I should play the lottery. Unfortunately I don't think it's RNG, there's something buggy with VATs somewhere. Some combo of cards, weapons, something.
---
Gilman Lumber Mill.
---
lol this is a lie
---
nice thread tho 10/10
---
Yea it's harder to hit and it displays that by making your % hit chance go down.
---
Doesn't matter in VATs
---
Not in anyway I‚Äôm happy to report. I have picture over on market of them in my inventory and Bethesda‚Äôs response. Happy hunting!
---
That‚Äôs what this community is for!
---
Same.  I really only use it against low level enemies that only need a shot or two who swarm (ghouls, scorched or insects are the most common).  Tap VATS, tap fire, tap VATS, tap fire...
---
95% is the percentage of hitting an enemy is equivalent to rolling a D20 in D&amp;D. that 5% is rolling a nat 1 which would mean that you missed. 
---
So you basically just rolled 10 nat 1s. you should probably get a new d20 then /s
---
I‚Äôd also love to see some fun ones. How about an effect that make ghouls dance or jump or fall asleep. Insta-kill is boring, make them party with us üíÉüèªüï∫üèª
---
Me too but I have VATs perks that have become suddenly useless and necessary at the same time. It'll take me 10 rounds to hit the monster, but now I've got enough if my crit bar to automatically hit something because crits never miss. Really a weird play style these days. Not to mention escape artist never. never. never. works.... **never**
---
Yes, why not. Anything that can be equipped beside each other should be able to group as a set.
---
Could be, I was aiming more to have a bit of fun. In FO4 I still have times where vats will lock on at 90-95% and I will miss more than half of the shots (even does this on the shotgun).
---
It does for me sometimes too. It seems like it varies for some reason though. Like, with a lever action rifle, it‚Äôs like magic sometimes. But, when I‚Äôm using my pistol character, I tend to get OP‚Äôs results (that is, just a full wasted clip at 95%).  That might just be observation bias, but there is absolutely something completely fucked about VATS.
---
He says during a major security breach that opened people to have their accounts stolen even with strong passwords that aren't bruteforceable. Lol
---
Wow, you're clearly just looking for places to come in and flex your superior knowledge - y'know, since you didn't even read the full post.  
---
&amp;nbsp;   
---
For a lot of people who aren't as versed in account security, being able to activate something like Two-Factor is a little peace of mind and as you completely ignored the content of my post I was hoping to draw attention to the lack of this feature. Additionally, nearly everything you have posted in the thread was only tangential to the original. Sure I could've used the tools I have at hand to show everyone that I can "see" how Bethesda delivers a payload, but I didn't since it was irrelevant to the topic.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
And while you may think that your *absolutely* groundbreaking password hygiene solves the problem, some of us like to go steps further for example: while I have big fat unique passwords for all of my online services I still use 2FA where possible because I like to have that peace of mind.  
---
But sure, I don't know what I'm talking about. I better just bow down to your arrogance.
---
450 hours. launched my first nuke about 2 hours ago.
---
I have spent around 200 hours in this game and how did I not know this was a thing? Sorry for the confusion.
---
He's arrogant.
---
Reminds me of an experience I had on Red Dead. I found a dog in Rhodes and my buddies hear "Ohhh a dog!" a distant gunshot "Doggy no!". I had accidentally hit right trigger rather than left trigger.
---
Ahhh I'm always using my lever...never tried a pistol
---
For the AWOL Armaments quests I'm able to squat on the big trailer and snipe all the Gutsy's when they spawn - OHKs with the VATS/Shoot
---
Bethesda Support also said the marine helmet wasn't dev room, and then Valseek clarified that it was. All of these are indeed dev room items, Vault 96 hasn't even opened yet.
---
You're surprised it doesn't work?
---
Foo kin‚Äô satellites
---
I think they really need to bust out a new roadmap.
---
I have spent around 200 hours in fallout 4 and somehow I didn‚Äôt know he existed? Sorry for the confusion.
---
I wish you could actually blueprint your camp fully and then be able to sell that blueprint to people. and said blueprint would only need to have 1 ground connecting point so you can put the camp anywhere that you move it to.
---
1k caps per?
---
Grrab it!
---
Sweet!
---
I‚Äôve done it, it‚Äôs underwhelming. From inside of those boarded up homes most pre-built walls (usually all) disappear so it looks like you‚Äôre standing on an empty platform. Much more fun building downwards or into a mountain where you can get creative.
---
Haunting like a ghost until all occupants are gone. Good analogy.
---
Bethesda screwed over so many of us and I look forward to them going under. I had 4 accounts for 76. I loved what this game could've been. But it's extremely clear it was and still is a cash grab. 
---
Good luck friend. I'm gonna go play classic wow. At least that game is good even if the company isn't.
---
my man the game is broke, I do not in any way or shape condemn you if you are a duper, but if you haven't manufactured that response and haven't put all that three items to queen's body in your nifty 14.99-dollars-per-month server, that means you must've been duping or a duper gifted you those items. I used to frequent that sub too, and this one as you can see, and have never seen either one of those items ever since that devroom story arc we had
---
Oh I agree they‚Äôre likely not released. I‚Äôm sure it was a bug that led them to me, but if Bethesda says I‚Äôm in the clear, I‚Äôm gonna be rocking some atom cats paint selling replica axes and jumpsuits.
---
Again thank you. I will be sure to check it out.
---
It's a massive grind. I've probably turned in well over 100, and I just got the t60 elder paint (the "final" reward for the drops). I suggest looking up all the rewards and seeing if its something ya wanna do. If so, the military wing of the whitesprings bunker (with all the desks) is an awesome place to get tons of technical data.
---
I still get many of them. Burned through 1k 50. Cal rounds on my legendary hunting rifle while trying to clear through the mobs. Not really any good legendaries, but good scrip fodder.
---
So what they say it‚Äôs okay and then they‚Äôll turn around and ban him for having exploited gear?
---
You can jump into the air with marsupial and get 3 separate quickvats before you touch the ground. It's great
---
And he doesn't even know what he is talking about, if he'd go read eckserahs explanation of the massive security breach they reported he'd realize he is full of crap.
---
He doesn't even realize how major the flaw was and He is trying to claim "oh they were just weak passwords".
---
I like the stealth Shotgun approach (even though it makes absolutely no sense).  Most (if not all) the Shotguns can be fitted with Suppressors.  It cripples their range, yes, but as long as you are otherwise sneaky, you'll be able to get right up in an enemy's face and one-shot them, almost like a melee character.
---
In fact, in some cases, I've taken to having my melee character use Shotguns simply because they seem more reliable these days than melee swings, which often fail to count.
---
For that purpose, though, I'd recommend *not* using an explosive Shotgun.  Those tend to aggravate the game's damage rubber-banding problem.
---
.45 ammo 1cap
---
Desease cures..buy them all at around 20-40 caps each
---
rare weapons/armour no limit depending on item
---
scrap that im out of...usually will pay any reasonable price 
---
Fusion cores less than 50 caps each
---
Did you post on the trade sub last night? I thought I saw a post about that.
---
\-Did you read the plans yet?
---
\-I want to see the Atom cats paint!
---
\-Was the SBQ fight on a private server?  Wondering if these are FO1st only rewards.
---
Look I didn't leave a comment just to be argued with.
---
Lol, that‚Äôs hilarious. But also a little infuriating considering the game gets an update and then continues to break more parts.
---
Wow, can't believe it's already been a year. My 1st years has been off and on. I get a character through the main quest, finish getting all the perk cards for the build, gear, then I lose interest since I'm not into just grinding events/farming/ammo mats, legendaries. Then, a couple months later, I'll get the urge to try out a new build, so I'll start a new character and go through the game again. I really like the progression towards a build, with the main story as a guide post.  Just "finished" my fourth character. I'm really hoping Wastelanders is good, I'll definitely be checking it out.
---
Dude don't give up the secret! I love being able to hit things through walls and around corners with 95% VATS and my 2.5x sneak damage!!! I do get that bug sometimes though where its 95% yet can't hit it. I just cancel VATS and re-activate.
---
I should have but It was last night.
---
Ah, gotcha
---
well, it's bethesda. Since Skyrim they are being real a**holes and making even more bugs
---
Unfortunately, he's probably not going to get it through his skull.
---
How about today? They have no choice now but to say at least something relatively new. Maybe they‚Äôll show perk loadouts.
---
But my way, if done right and not fucked up like my first attempt is more fun.
---
With a working program:
---
&gt; 1 misses after 82 attempts  
---
&gt; 2 misses after 651 attempts  
---
&gt; 3 misses after 5654 attempts  
---
&gt; 4 misses after 236017 attempts  
---
&gt; 5 misses after 5157588 attempts  
---
&gt; 6 misses after 35812275 attempts  
---
&gt; 7 misses after 430842518 attempts  
---
(then it stops working due to overflow).
---
I realize there‚Äôs no definitive way to prove I‚Äôve never duped, but I obtained these 100% off of a queens corpse immediately following a fight as she bounced on the ground (as I usually just speed click her loot into my inventory) on a public server. If they were put there I‚Äôm not aware. I assumed that the weird botched update made a bug. Either way, and again I know it‚Äôs just my word, but they‚Äôre legit for me.
---
did you have 21k in your pocket at the time??
---
It's all-but-essential for the raid, but frankly, everyone should have one piece with it because poison damage is no joke.  With one piece, you have a reasonable chance of saving yourself with a Stimpack, because the poison won't deplete your HP faster than the Stimpack can regenerate it.
---
Because I'm at work and when I'm bored I follow this sub. I have my reasons.
---
I would die for vehicles but even modders can't get to work well on Fallout 4, quite a few out their but they have many problems with the terrain.
---
My money goes to: NW Halloween Event Stats and First year Recap.
---
I have trouble believing that I miss a 95% chance 95% of the time every time I play when this game is historically buggy.
---
Considering you can only get 3 per day, it's likely most people don't bother unless they want the rewards themselves.
---
Mutated horses then :p.
---
Unless it has been patched out, CAMPs can take damage while you are still loading into the world.  They likely smashed things up while you were loading in.  It doesn't take long.  :(
---
I used to do it all the time but lately when I try to nuke either the server crashes or my game freezes so I give up. I have like 40 nuke keycards
---
Likely true, but still makes no sense.
---
I mean even if they are duped, hope you enjoy them man! They are pretty unique!
---
First of all, Bethesda Support doesn't know most of the things they're talking about, they'll say that 3 videos of a hacker shooting into the air isn't enough for a ban. You can ask any dataminer, these do not drop from the queen, only from the dev room. If you got them from the queen, someone probably put them in there because they have been mass duped on PC and are being spread everywhere.
---
What are the hardest materials to find for your?  Likely screws and aluminum.  You can set your search function on the crafting table to find items with the specific junk in them.  Honestly you are better off just checking vending machines for what you want.
---
I did post there, hello from there as well!
---
-I haven‚Äôt read them but I damn sure am now!
---
-gonna post that pic as soon as I can!
---
-public world, no ‚Äúfunny business‚Äù as far as I know.
---
I always speed click all the queens loot and I did it as she bounced off the ground, so if a duper got them in there it was impressive.
---
Yeah sadly lol, all good tho I'm usually floating around max cus shit in my vendors is overpriced.
---
TSE is not a bad roll. it's what I'd consider a starter weapon, personally. moreso on a minigun which doesn't really care about accuracy.
---
on PC you'll seldom find people selling it for caps and the asking price is usually max. TSEs in general are trade only still. they go for cheaper on consoles, though.
---
Yeah reclamation day... they‚Äôll use it to bull shit ITV... üò≠
---
Sorry you think you can just comment random nonsense and not be called out. I'm not trying to be a dick, but the percentage chances based on your distance. It doesn't just simple display 95% for no reason, and leave you to gage your own hit chance based off your distance...
---
One of my favorite moments was around level 50 when I witnessed a scorched super mutant hound fighting two super mutants.
---
My least favorite moment is when legendary corpes vanish, or turn to ash and yoy cannot loot them.  I just know they have the items Ive been trying to get...
---
Dang would kill for a weapon store box, food supply box, and a chem container box.
---
You get double the chance of getting your spikes back.
---
With Two Shot Explosive you get 4x the chance of getting your spikes back. If they aoe damage hits dead enemies, it has a chance of adding a spike to their body too. You'll walk out of some fights with more spikes than you came with.
---
Pioneer Scouts badge quests. You will have to do 1/2 of the tadpole tests and collect the badges by completing certain objectives first (can't remember what exactly), then you will have enough credits to buy the plans from a machine vendor at the Pioneer Scout Camp in the Toxic Valley. The machine vendor looks like one of those alternate vendors outside train stations that sell ammo, meds etc.
---
I live in Alabama, lots of hills around Birmingham. I visited MN once... and there's no hills. if you're in a 20 story building you can see for miles. the city blocks are ACTUALLY square. I didn't see any 4 story houses that you can only see 2 from the front. I was so confused. I grew up in the hills man. next you'll say that your city drainage actually works, or that you've never been stuck in your driveway because there's no way to get up the crazy incline while it's wet or icy. what do you people in flat areas do? it just seems awfully boring lol
---
I agree.
---
Some 95% misses can be explained by XCOM logic.
---
But I do think there is some kind of problem where a missed shot becomes sticky and leads the subsequent shots to miss as well.  When this happens, I often exit and re-enter VATS and try it again.
---
They are extremely hard to come by. When they do sell they are around 100 caps each. Not many folks part with them though
---
I'd say you got about right
---
Dude I‚Äôve been playing so long (since beta) and have rare stuff. For the first time though I feel like lightning struck, it‚Äôs a crazy feeling.
---
I just want to know if the robots at whitespring fix the fences....
---
Woah why is it more expensive on PC? I can definatly say they're cheaper on ps4 because I didnt expect it to sell for that much for a reason. I'll see like a junker tse for 2kish sometimes.
---
Especially when all those three items are dupe only lol, lighting never strikes twice but apparently it stroke thrice this time
---
Happens to me with the gauss rifle in vats all the time. Says 95% but I'll miss if I hold the fire button to increase the damage first. Every time , nearly.
---
I always speed click on looting her too.  Remember when her inventory used to spin forever? Lol. Just a habit from back then.  
---
Kinda surprised the dataminers didn't discover these items.  But I think they are mad and I don't really blame them.  It's crazy you got all 3 in one drop.
---
oh i get it thanks
---
Likewise - persevering despite the most ridiculous issues. The potential is there, Bethesda just needs to keep delivering.
---
Hey I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, and I‚Äôve seen the loot tables and data mines too. I‚Äôm just sharing my experience of acquiring them legitimately for me, and getting a piece of that rare fallout excitement.
---
AH! I have forgotten about those quests. I am still trying to get enough badges to get the extra backpack carry weight.
---
Now was that so hard to admit?
---
I use/do the same with my LAR, and it's even better with Gun Fu.
---
Try going melee for a while. Get into VAT‚Äôs and just stand there while the ghoul beats you to a pulp.
---
I get it, but they‚Äôre legit to me. Sharing the excitement is all.
---
Considering how slow this gun is that really blows.
---
Agreed. I also want to have an option to repair whatever I have materials for.  It never fails I always need like 1 razor grain. Lol
---
I forget if rifleman or heavy weapons perk works for railway. Excitement. If you don‚Äôt like it, scrip it.
---
you take the good/you take the bad/you wrap them up/and what do you get?/Fallout 76
---
The dataminers discovered these items a very long item ago
---
Lol yeah I gues there is a 3rd explanation. Thanks for the input
---
Oh I fully expect this was either a bug or hell maybe a fast duper tossing them in, but my excitement is real. Also, god I‚Äôm glad those days are gone. I did so many queens in the early days where that arrow haunted my dreams...
---
really hoping Wastelanders is a sort of soft relaunch. We shall see.
---
I live in Salt Lake City so we have mountains, but the valley is pretty flat between the mountains.
---
My caps supply is the issue though. My venders which usually sells Ammo isn't selling very well. So i hope to be able to sell things low to high level eventually but i gotta work on unlocking mods before i can \^\_\^; still thank you for taking the time to assist me. I appreciate it.
---
Share video
---
It's funny to me. It's 2108 when Reuben Gill escapes vault 51 which is stuff years in the future. But his body is already found in the world. 
---
It's one year later when wastelanders comes out, per the voiceover but I've heard data miners find that zax references the coming wastelanders being new recruits to be overseer but again that's supposed to be in 2108 so.. Can Bethesda at least get their timelines straight even within the same game?
---
What do you mean about post boxes?
---
I honestly don't know. I can't speculate past that this is just how the market turned out during the first few months. caps are worthless on PC. you'll only find 1 and crappy 2 stars for sale, everything else is trade only. once in a blue moon someone will show up in the market asking caps for a good roll, and they're instantly inundated with offers starting at 60k.
---
I can't speak for PS4 but I think 17776 is high for consoles, yes.
---
I think it depends on the range. I noticed that when I am in melee range with certain weapons (like the railroad rifle) I'll miss every shot .
---
VATS bugs are most of the reason I quit playing this game. It's so infuriating.  FIX THE BROKEN STUFF IN YOUR STUPID GAME BEFORE ADDING NEW FEATURES. 
---
Whoever is in charge of high level decision making for this game does not deserve their paycheck.
---
Gps satellites
---
You don't understand sarcasm do you.
---
Like Mail Boxes, I saw an leak about it I think...
---
At least we know half your username checks out, clown.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt tel you if they are or are not enough to ban. They don‚Äôt comment on the status or outcomes of investigations. That is their policy.
---
Huh. I didn't know that. I'm sure I've played almost 200 hours by now though!
---
If you are PC could I get an Atomic cat paint service after you learn them?
---
Then someone broke the policy because I got about 2 emails with them saying this.
---
I've done it maybe 20 times. Outfits sometimes, twice a legendary piece of combat armor, and recently the shielded BoS underarmor plan, which was very cool. I don't do it very often, sometimes weeks apart.
---
I think I see what you mean.  You put a mailbox in your camp and people can put things in it for you.  Makes sense.
---
This is my first Fallout where I specc'd out of VATS specialization, specifically because of the massive inconsistency
---
Any ideas on what i can sell? I'm not sure what's selling on the worlds at the moment.
---
If it doesn‚Äôt get wiped out with today‚Äôs maintenance, sure!
---
Yeah! Perfect for Xmas
---
Drills...Lol.   Honestly I wish they would put a chance at a serum recipe back in her loot pool.  Make it a small percent so people can have a chance at getting them again.
---
After 400h, still lvl 170. I guess I explored a lot?
---
Hopping out of VATS and  retargeting usually works for me. It seems to only happen when something is moving fast and manages to flank me or gets too close too quick (dogs, mole rats, &amp; sprinting ghouls are the usual culprits). On rare occasions it will happen with something 10-15 feet off. I don't recall it ever happening with something at more than 30ft away.
---
I‚Äôm betting the buyer saw the price, read it fast and thought it said 1776. Bought it and is now wondering why all their caps disappeared.
---
IF they do an ITV. XD
---
95% chance to miss? tee hee?
---
Session hijacking isn‚Äôt a new thing y‚Äôknow? 
---
This can be done with any service that sends you a link, and normally requires that your email account is compromised or the person who owns the account doesn‚Äôt do something stupid, like drop sensitive link into a chat.
---
My other points are valid as well, incase you want to tackle those!
---
I completely agree! I got two serum recipes off her (neither of which I even use) but those made it exciting for sure. Drills... man, only slightly worse than a 1 star board...
---
.556 ammo always sells. If you have possum badges you can trade those for a high price. mutations sell pretty good and crafting marine tactical helmets can net you some easy money.
---
You‚Äôre projecting, I‚Äôm trying to help you and you‚Äôre vehemently resisting any opinions other than your own.
---
Agreed, I came across a camp in new gad getting wrecked by super mutants, thought I'd help out and fix it back up, only took five mins but a fix all option would be welcome.
---
386.
---
You kidding?  I've seen the devs play....they're not that good.  haha
---
Wow players don't like the idea of this game going free to play.
---
Try thinking about baseball.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand account security and you‚Äôre just regurgitating something that someone else said.
---
Stay away from the city in the middle as much as possible, that's what I do. That place is death for soloing.
---
Free atom shop item. Maybe a special daily challenge.
---
very low level befriending a deathclaw...  stimpak stimpak stimpak stimpak run around in circles, shoot with hunting rifle, get picked up and slammed, stimpak stimpak stimpak stimpak, hunting rifle shot, picked up and slammed, repeat
---
Brother died, upvotes to left
---
Try to message me?
---
I actually TSE pistols as sidearms for my melee character and they do the work. They worth some caps.
---
Furious is pretty great for machine guns, too.
---
It's normally a Agility thing right? I may be wrong.
---
I know the feeling,lost a very important person as well. Sometimes i even go to the place she had her CAMP and bring me memories.
---
Im sorry for your loss man, you can always make new good friends in this awesome and commited comunity like I did. Cheers.
---
I've been asking for spiral stairs for a long time now. Hope we get them some day. Your other suggestions would be awesome too.
---
Do you have any mutations?
---
I asked a question.
---
I know, right? But it still wasn't as good. Design and interface are better
---
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about your loss man, thoughts to you. RIP
---
Its Bethesda
---
Doubtful. Their auto response when you submit tells you that you won‚Äôt be informed of outcomes.
---
I gotta say, your "help" was unnecessary from the start and you just continue to make assumptions about my situation. From your post history its clear you're just back here to feed off the vitriol in the subreddit.
---
i usually ignore the team im placed with, and do my own thing...im not that experienced, but can usually get to top 10, and 10% of the time, ill get top 5...I've won a few times getting lucky.
---
The real answer is because the game was rigged from the start.
---
Do they mention how long? What a joke
---
to maintain
---
That really depends....do you plan on using it on the queen a lot?
---
I think you're enjoying the idea that all these ignorant people are just massaging the shit out of your inflated ego.
---
Throwback to Fallout 4 when you fight a sentry bot and manage to spot a split second of 1% on their fusion core in VATS so you hit the critical button and one shot them
---
Where can i find the plan for that tactical helmet? can't make mutations just yet but i'll keep that in mind for sure.
---
&gt;That's X-Com Baby!(sorry!)
---
If he said 99% hit chance and missed 10 times it could come close
---
Tuesday maintenance didnt go well. They werent able to patch some things they had wanted to. Surprise maintenance today for that now
---
I‚Äôm home sick today so I actually have time to play for once, üò©
---
Here's why- [Link](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/372824/fallout-76-maintenance-november-14-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I know, right? But it still wasn't as good. Fo76map has better design, interface, and features.
---
I would agree but it was the only 5 digit item so it stuck out like a soar thumb.
---
Yes but I also use it on Daily use to do if it becomes useless for everything else I‚Äôll opt to not
---
you have uny/sent/ap pieces?
---
They didnt finish the fix on tuesday.  They had another problem come up.  At least this time they found it.  They announced this shut down at the same time.
---
As it is I can get it to 340 without things like Chems or adrenaline
---
Thank you kind stranger.
---
That's cause you hit that 5% ten times
---
Thank you for the reply. This does shed light on the problem a bit more. I am still curious though, aside from your suspension for harassment, did all of the banned users participated in the exploit recreation including the reporter. I really want to clear out the confusion, if it's a ban wave that they did or it's really really annoyed admins.
---
5minute headsup nice
---
Don't prime it since it's everyday plus it's instigating and explosive so it's not very good to a SBq
---
I lost so many uncollected resources from my workshop... Oh well :(  The server went down before the countdown timer was up, and they announced the shutdown like 5-10mins before it happened lol
---
They deserve the curb, and maybe a stomp for good measure. They're shitting on all the folks who've done good work in this game (and there is actually a lot of good under all the unaddressed bugs).
---
and it uses the camp owners resources so you can just keep repairing while the rabid mongrels go crazy destroying everything,
---
I swear I‚Äôm not evil.
---
I lost so many uncollected resources from my workshops... Oh well :(  The server went down before the countdown timer was up, and they announced the shutdown like 5-10mins before it happened lol
---
Doubtful? I can show you the proof.
---
No apparently they didn‚Äôt finish the fixes from Tuesdays maintenance so are trying to do them now. Wish we had a bit more notice
---
What heavy legendaries should I be looking for for queen fights?
---
Reporting beneath a journalistic guise that Bethesda is banning random, loyal F76 players who report bugs to them, without disclosing the incredible important fact that said players used the most infamous cheating game tool, is misleading and bad journalism. 
---
That is exactly what several big youtubers have done, including Yong Yea (who milks it more than anyone else), Skill-Up and AngryJoe all does.
---
This has nothing to do with Bethesda pushing the blame away, but self-proclaimed journalists not doing their job properly.
---
It's been some months since I saw the post but there is a pretty big diminishing return on the AP refresh if you're running both Lone Wanderer and Action Boy.  So if you're running Action Boy alone, worth it, if you're also running Lone Wanderer, less worth it.
---
You act like it was going to be the same forever. The design and interface would have changed and gotten better going forward. You say better features but there's literally nothing fo76map offers that should be behind a pay wall at all. Everyone gets pissed at Bethesda but no one cares when someone else does it like that guy?
---
I hate that can even happen...if you want to, for some reason, handcuff us to a 30k limit.  at least let sales above and beyond 30k dump into a separate bank...
---
Got on to do that final 5 level push to 50 ... server maintenance yay hopefully it‚Äôs some items in the store for 76s anniversary or a surprise event maybe idk it better not be just a small hit fix that keeps it down for hours that can wait till they get a decent size update to put in with it.
---
I love how this quote was about the FO4 companion app, which hasn't worked in years, and probably never will again.
---
Yep, and my server went down BEFORE the countdown timer ended...
---
Ok. Please do.
---
Yea the spiral stairs &amp; ladders for sure would be a great addition. The fireman pole &amp; slide would just be fun to have and see how people incorporate them into their camps.
---
If I remember correctly, it's also the year anniversary of main release, and since they sh*t the bed on Tuesday with some boring wallpapers and turret skins, here's hoping they were saving it for today! I might also be giving them a bit too much credit
---
Under the assumption that I don‚Äôt understand sarcasm :)
---
You don‚Äôt understand humour do you?
---
No, nothimg
---
Those are just reskins, I mean like a completely different Pip-Boy, like being able to swap between the 3000 model from Fallout 3, or the 3000 Mk IV model from Fallout 4.
---
So I'm not the only person experiencing this? I've had this problem for months on end.  
---
Every single rifle I use will show 95% chance to hit and miss like 8 times, regardless of level discrepancy.
---
It's a good 1HK0 weapon against common infantry. I would prime it so it one-shots 68 super mutants to the head.
---
yes
---
Serious answer: because the game is always in a state of semi-brokenness. 
---
I say this as someone who has logged hundreds of hours in 76 since release. It has continually astounded me how the dysfunctional nature of this game is like whack-a-mole for bugs and irritating design flaws. I have loved this game, at various points and to varying degrees; havn't touched it in about a month.
---
95% is a high percentage, but not an infallible shot. You can still miss with 95%. Missing like the OP said a bunch of times is a different story.
---
That‚Äôs annoying, I was on for 10mins and I went to switch servers. Boom ‚Äúdown for maintenance, go play something else nerd‚Äù
---
No kidding. They made a post about it 30 minutes ago. Completely unacceptable.
---
Oh no you misunderstood. I wasn't suspended for harassment. I harrassed customer service with tickets and phone calls because I recieved no human responses about my tickets for 13 days. The community managers couldn't even get info on what was going on. All 4 people have been doing bug and exploit hunting and reporting for multiple months before this happened
---
Itd be nice if they waited to do a bigger update to group all of them together rather then take it down for 1 or 2 small fix‚Äôs that we can live with. Hopefully there‚Äôs something for fallouts anniversary
---
no, every armor that has this stat bugged now it has +25% diseases resistance. It's retroactive, so you can find it on every armor that has previously bugged RR.
---
Rofl, no 99% of links don't work that way. Go ahead and share a link to your battle.net account it won't work, same with runescape, origins, etc.
---
It is very obvious you've no clue what you're talking about. But by all meams keep bleating about things you don't know about, It is quite funny.
---
Yes
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH-r715x8cc&amp;feature=share
---
Our group made a video from submissions we got from different communities
---
Down for maintenance....perfect....
---
I have the same gun and chose to use the speedy receiver. Tried the prime one and it's too much hassle crafting ultracite ammo for everyday use
---
Sure, you're being funny.
---
weren't you the very same account that was calling undefined an a-hole who galvanized the community by taking down map76 then linked a worse version of it?
---
Hotfixes abound....always expect a few extra maintenance periods after a big one, since Bugthesda tends to break as much, if not more than they usually fix lol.
---
Yes.
---
Nope. It actually never was bugged. All armor with disease resistance were incorrectly labeled radiation resistance.
---
It's a game. You are as rich as the game allows you to be + your stash is 20 pounds emptier and someone is happy shooting the weapon.
---
A good day in the Wasteland.
---
Yeah, the chances that we all miss with a 95% hit chance this often are statistically improbable.
---
The real answer is: a bug.
---
Sry didn‚Äôt understand you... so if I have a +25 RR piece, it‚Äôs actually +25 EDR?
---
Your ignorance is pretty damn funny.
---
All those camp's I've seen trying to look like strip clubs would be really thrilled to have a fireman pole added. In all seriousness though, Id love spiral staircases.
---
no,not a single one
---
Then, based on this logic, PC players should not be allowed to use mods since those same mods are not available to console players.
---
I don't buy that. Not as often as it happens.
---
only when it was bugged (not listed on the stats). If that was listed on the stats it remained 25RR
---
I think the second vault is going to open after wastelanders, so that it can be populated with human NPCs.
---
Some people don't have a lot of time to play and knowing the servers are down will help them plan their time out better.
---
Any of those plans would be highly unlikely to be found in the queen's loot table, or anywhere in the game for that matter.  My guess is that someone at the event took a trip to the upside down.
---
Bethesda's support seems to communicate with the devs via a string and tin can.  If they communicated at all, this is what it probably looked like....
---
"Hey Juan, there's a gentleman that says he got plans for Atomic Cat paint, a Garnish Axe and a 69 jumpsuit.  Are those legitimate items?"
---
"GARNISH AXE"
---
"(sigh) Are they legit, Juan?"
---
"You are a moron, Sanjay."
---
"Fine, I'll just tell the person they can have them.  Fucking coders...."
---
Do you die after exploding?
---
Nope, it's the hotfix from Tuesday.
---
Like i explode with an big explosion like on the fatman
---
Do you die when you explode?
---
Oh hey a fox!
---
Later:
---
*accidentally reflex VATS Targets and shoots said fox while picking off Mongrels in the area*
---
Usually u want something like a 50 cal lmg etc but the Gatling gun will do, effects u are looking for are bloodied Junkies anti armor furious with fire rate.
---
They didn't get the whole hotfix done from Tuesday. This is the rest of it.
---
Which quest? Some of them you need to do the whole thing in one go.
---
Maybe, but you clearly needed it because your account got owned (and probably still is). If you‚Äôre too pig headed to understand that, well, I can‚Äôt fix stupidüòå
---
That sucks.
---
it looks like that now:  [https://i.imgur.com/TD4z1hE.png](https://i.imgur.com/TD4z1hE.png)
---
Ok so if my RR piece lists RR in the stats, it‚Äôs actually RR, not bugged or EDR?
---
The only "luck" involved here, is the bad luck to have gotten sucked into a game that company refuses to fix. It's just a bug, folks.
---
lol...well there was a lot of that.
---
And even if these YouTubers are huge pieces of shit, it's irrelevant because there are actual terrible things that Bethesda has done and is doing. But by deflecting the conversation away from those things, and talking instead about some insignificant YouTubers, Bethesda gets what they want: less attention on themselves. Which let's them continue their terrible business practices.
---
Halfway through a silo fixing to nuke Welch for some flux. I feel your pain. Take my upvote.
---
now if its RR it's RR, if before it was bugged RR now it's EDR
---
That is fantastic and probably not that far from the truth :D
---
edgy
---
What materials specifically are you having trouble with? Steel, screws? Plastic?
---
I have a explosive exicsioners 50 cal but I don‚Äôt normally use it because it dose less damage and it chews through ammo
---
Not new, it's a long term bug for 76.
---
Says the dude who doesn't realize there was a huge security breach so password strength has nothing to do with accounts being stolen.
---
&gt;Mine did too-- about 3 minutes early.
---
Yeah, celebrating with a hotfix is a microcosm for the game itself.
---
once you get it, it wouldn't hurt to have a standard one also. the high capacity lowers rad and energy resistance. what system are you on? need help?
---
I did not have so much trouble with it in the past‚Äîit seems to have gotten worse, like the login crash issues.
---
‚ÄúShit the bed‚Äù. Got a chuckle from me. Haven‚Äôt heard that one since y grandpa died. Take the upvote.
---
The game is so broken it surprises me my character hasn't fast-travelled to Diamond City by accident yet.
---
Totally forgot about this one!  
---
Hope you don't mind, submitted and logged on the Weapons Wiki   
---
oh my
---
If you want a rrak spooky place to screw around in look for the church in the bog that has a legit haunted organ
---
I‚Äôm attempting to help you understand account security which you‚Äôre completely unwilling to accept any ideas other than your misguided preconceptions.
---
I have the same problem....sometimes i can shoot around corners with VATs....other times at 95% ill miss with all 25 rounds
---
Same for me. I destroy sentry bots in one shot every time like that,because i can snipe their fusion cores from everywhere.
---
First: the Fallout 1st thing irritatesme, but there is no reason to trash you for that.
---
Second: I agrre about the game and despite me gripe with the 1st, I still play the game a lot, not adventure, but still.
---
Third: Happy cake Day!
---
Short answer: it's a bug.
---
Longer answer: it's yet another of many bugs that Bethesda has, for reasons beyond me, all but refused to fix.
---
To be fair, I was just hitting player vendors, getting my scrip taken care of, etc. I'm sorry you had all that work wasted, but at least it happened before you launched the nuke!
---
PC and I mainly play in PA so the extra weight is more for just being able to walk around when I am out of my Excavator PA
---
Hey dipshit, I've already said several times that I fixed the issue and because I've been playing on it since, it definitely isn't "owned". If you're too pigheaded to understand that, well, I can't fix arrogance.
---
Just so we're clear, the account wasn't hacked at all. It was a false positive you moron.
---
This. It is a game. Let's have fun. I love to give items for free and it is nice to receive them too.
---
Poor summary, maybe try reading it again. I don't hate the game, I enjoy it from time to time (not hours a day). But I do hate Bethesda for releasing a beta for $60 and also charging for microtransactions and subscriptions on top of that $60, while also doing virtually nothing to fix the game.
---
All I want to do after I wake up is play a little 76 and drink my coffee before I go into work, but I can never seem to be able to do that between hotfixes and server disconnects :(
---
It sucks because I really do enjoy this game and only get to play for about 2 hours at a time if I'm lucky.
---
Trolling on Molly.  Fantastic.
---
For SBQ specifically, explosive and instigating aren't much use, so you'll want something with punch.  Hunters and Zealots are OK prefixes, but furious is probably better (unless you want to go bloodied or junkies).  For major, FFR is likely the best choice.  Minors are up to you, reload speed is OK, reduced weight or Str aren't bad.
---
Most heavies aren't great in VATS, so those are not great choices in my experience.
---
The only fun i had was getting new loot and chilling with friends
---
Oh, bless your heart. You need to do a little research before you come and talk to adults.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking
---
there was an old online only game called "Gunz" which had so many hackers that in order to play you basically had to be a hacker too. There were moments where people were using hacks that looked like they were ripped from a JOJO episode.
---
2 players walking towards each other with slashing and blocking turned way up so there were just air clashes.
---
Theres something semi-beautiful about 2 hackers facing off. I think they should add a third level of the olympics which encourages doping and augments.
---
Once again you're missing the fact password security has zero to do with this security breach. You're basically saying, " you should have had smoke detectors and fire extinguishers" after someone is the victim of arson.
---
The only person who is coming off stupid is yourself with your ignoring the fact password strength means nothing if the password is to an account from a company with massive security breaches.
---
Thanks! I appreciate you finding the humour in your situation.
---
There was one time I tripped out on some nuka shine and swear I heard Benny from new Vegas...
---
I bought first for the outfit.
---
[Adventure] I was wandering around my camp waiting for the daily scrip and caps to refresh.
---
No big deal.
---
Not to mention there are some fun challenges like ‚Äúkill 76 enemies with a flamer‚Äù or something like that. I had a LOT of fun killing things with my instigating crossbow for a challenge, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs an OP weapon.
---
Please, share your knowledge if you can demonstrate it? I already have.
---
It's mainly Screws and Springs.
---
Since you completely understand the situation, of course.
---
Fucking hell, you just don't get it do you.
---
You have attained bloody mess rank 4
---
I get this % issue with the "can do" perk in whitespring with my mule. How many 20% can i hit in a row before a 80% procs? Apparently a streak of them.
---
I've never been mass down voted for asking "why?" before lol.
---
Ive loved building up my tiny cabins and i loved the early community when everyone was new and curious, though I'm still loving it
---
Good for crippling, but they are still not working well. My shotgunner is now dual melee because, if I am going to need to be that near to finish them off, at least I will save the ammo.
---
No problem. It‚Äôs a fun area for lower levels. The muties will swarm you once they see you. A lot of sniping and running around hiding while you listen to them gripe about how WEAK you are. Have fun!
---
Cool?
---
This happening once would be possible. Happening all the time for everybody isn't. It's a bug, plain and simple.
---
Do you end up in a bunch of pieces?
---
I was at the last stage of this week‚Äôs raid.  I got two legendaries and lost probably 500 rounds. Not that big of a deal.
---
I'm not asking this to pick on you, I'm just curious. But how exactly do you think the game has gotten magnitudes better? What has been improved or fixed to you?
---
Already refuted that talking point my friend, if you‚Äôre able to hack my account please do so to show me evidence that his wouldn‚Äôt help to stop a ‚Äú‚Äùmassive security breach‚Äù‚Äù.

Same tag as in game, and for some incentive, I think I saved my CC details!

Good luck!

That would be the Third vault

&gt; edit: I played for more than 250 hours btw
---
It's so terrible you played 250 hours of it. Wow. It must be bad.
---
If you go back through his post history, he mentions that he doesn't play any more. I feel comfortable assuming he's just back here to be a thundercunt. I'm just gonna keep engaging him though.

It‚Äôs very doable. The fewer people on the team the fewer spawns. Make sure lockpick 3 and hacker 3 are selected to get through it. It is a bit of a maze so I studied YouTube videos of solo runs first to get a feel for the dungeon and steps necessary for completion. After a few runs you can do one solo is 20 minutes or less.
---
I haven‚Äôt had my account hacked and you have, seems pretty obvious who understands the situation here.
---
I do!
---
You take video games too seriously. Get off your high horse and get a job!
---
Amazing
---
And you're still stuck on that when you've already been proven wrong. Oh well, no more attention for you troll. Run along now.
---
Servers are down. Like it started üòÇ

Currently
---
Hey there, Not going to go into the fact that support has been wrong before since your getting a lot of that already.
---
I went and found the items you were referring too, and none of them are in a leveled list of any sort. So it was not a 'bug' that its there.
---
Starting with the Grognaks Plan:

There is 0 reference to a LVLI, however it was directly placed into the all scrap chest.

so 100% did not drop from the queen, and I know youve already been told this, but here is the data to back it up.
---
Sorry for the double comment, wanted to get both posts.
---
Of course not.  The fast day/night cycle is just to have a changing environment instead of literally having to wait 12 hours for a night cycle.  Imagine doing challenges with day/night requirements.
---
And the launcher, somebody should take care of the launcher.
---
But I have been in constant contact with dude behind Map76 over the past week or so. I am not just going off of what he said in his post, I just use that as an example due to it being whats publicly available.
---
I would take what MMOG fails says with a massive grain of salt after some of his recent claims around YouTubers and the Fallout 1st discount thing, seems pretty fishy to me
---
I mean, even auto aim can‚Äôt make up for no skills? XD
---
You get a note from the quest. If you drop it then it will repeat. Or could be bugged, I get pop a squatter every day at log in now, so who knows for sure.
---
Honestly, I recommend sacrificing one Rifleman pern card for one level of Longshot
---
Nobody cares about hacking your account, it's beside the fucking point. Just keep on with your bullshit about everyone being hostile and refusing to listen to your enlightenment.

Let us know if/when you are having a memorial service at the Vault 76 entrance.

PS4, I'm running a 1 strength build so my carry weight is pretty low. but I carry my excavator around for sure

Oh my, he's got a Wikipedia article! Everyone has to listen to him now!
---
5mm is super common.  I‚Äôd only prime a gun that either kills everything in one hit or ultracite ammo is easier to make in bulk than the conventional counterpart.  An LMG or bloody lever gun are good examples.
---
Yes?
---
Off to a rocky start, shortly after leaving the vault a year ago today I fell into a coma for 6 month's: I left the vault, wandered around for a couple hours and last thing I remember feeling was dissapointment. Then I woke up months later covered in dust when I heard other vault dwellers taking about how things are better in the wasteland. Sure the ~~(F076)~~ wasteland isn't as exciting as the ~~(F04)~~ vault I came from, but regardless of your ideas on the current state of the politics from those money hungry folks at ~~Bethesda~~ Whitesprings, it has improved from the smoldering wreckage of reclamation day, I think.
---
Welcome to /r/fo76. haha
---
Yes my account is very hacked right now, weird how I was still able to change critical details and am still able to access and useit.
---
I'm back up to -2 :D
---
Been an issue since Nuclear Winter was introduced, hope it gets fixed soon!
---
Too many. A lot of it, and I mean a lot was afk. I probably left my character in the Munitions Factory for a week. I have well over 100k 5.56 so I'd imagine so.
---
Just so disappointed in the endgame aspect or this game... honestly after beating the main story line which is also way too short. You have honestly nothing to do besides launch nuke in one of the max 3 spots that are actually worth nuking, fight the queen and do the raid. Its suppose to be a mmo and you can practically solo everything with ease. Every mob gets killed in a whitesprings nuke in like 5 mins.. they need to add higher level mobs in more areas.  I want a challenge n fight more mobs where a party is essential. Where you actually need a charisma build. I just dont get why it's so hard to add more raids or higher level mobs. Like 85% of the map a lvl 20 can just roll through which makes no sense imo. I have a blast still and make the best of it with friends but I pray wastelanders is a huge add on content wise. Also dont wanna get my Hope's up lol
---
Exactly!
---
.... So people, including the OP of this thread should jump onto the bandwagon and copy-paste the multitude of "FIX THIS PLEASE!", "WHERE'S THE NEW CONTENT!", "WASTELANDERS PLS!" posts that are made on this subreddit almost daily?
---
I've never said these Youtubers are "huge pieces of shit" I just find it to be a huge shame that they sell their journalistic integrity for some cheap clicks, similar to how Bethesda sold F73 at its release for some cheap bucks.
---
They're no different, both parties have willfully lied in order to earn some easy green. But sure, go ahead and demand that its more important that the OP talks about how shitty Bethesda is, because this subreddit isn't filled with enough of it already, clearly.
---
They do
---
Not in this game!
---
Top idea

Preach it brotha

I don't mind at all. It happened again Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.

Happy cake day
---
It is just a video game. No need to justify why you like it pal because nobody normal cares either way.
---
You're flinging around a whole lot of general stuff, and you keep talking about how you know so much about my account being hacked. I'd love for you to demonstrate proof that my account is hacked.
---
You're not wrong--it has gotten worse. It just wasn't good to start with.
---
I do wonder if some old code in there just isn't optimal for real time play. But the first step is admitting they have a problem
---
Did your friend owe you money? I had a friend in the early 1990's that owed me money and his sister told me he died. I found him on fb a few years ago.
---
Would be great, both for basements and bunkers!

My tools can monitor and alter the computer memory. Not the game itself technically, as they do not touch the game files, but they can alter the memory which the game is using, which is nothing more than a technicality.  But, it would still violate the TOS as there is broad language in there. 
---
&gt; You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax 
---
I mean, technically, any mouse, keyboard, monitor, forum, map, website, graphics card, ram stick, etc, that has not expressly been authorized by Zenimax, which there is not an authorized list anywhere, technically violates this as well. It is literally impossible to play this game without using something that violates the TOS. You cannot play it on any hardware without being in violation. That is why intent is so important. I have admitted elsewhere that what I did violated their TOS. And the ban is not my issue. The issue is that they refused to respond to my support tickets explaining why I was doing it. Intent is everything if you have a TOS that is impossible to not violate.
---
then why waste your time replying?
---
Got the game in like March or April. Been having a pretty good time overall and not too many issues with bugs. Took a break last month and plan on returning once Wastelanders drops. I found myself logging on and feeling bored more often than I was yanked into the game. Borderlands 3 releasing also made it pretty easy to take a break.
---
The best day ever was when Dr House lifted me out of Appalachia and I woke up in Halcyon. I heard it was right on time, too. People have been fooled into spending 12$ a month for the privilege to live in hell's penthouse.
---
Cool, maybe lead with ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs a false positive‚Äù before attempting to justify your position instead of flying off the handle at a random Internet stranger looking to give some solid advice?
---
Or generally, think outside of your narcissism?
---
There is no "best".  Combat, Scout, and Marine are the most well balanced.  Every other type shines in their own way while lacking in other ways.
---
Yessiroonie
---
I mostly agree, however, I have come across camps where the player was using broken wall pieces intentionally and repairing it would be a hassle for them.
---
Are you taking head shots? If so, stop. It's broke. Has been for a while. 
---
On my commando build I hit limbs or torso with an extremely high level of success including shooting through walls (it just works).
---
The game should been like NV in a spinoff using 4s engine and assets. Regardless there was so much potential that idk if the games rep will ever recover.
---
The one that has features you like. Weight reduction, chameleon, unyielding...that kind of thing.
---
While it would make sense to me to advance time this way, with everything being scaled down (day/night cycle, time it takes to erect buildings or travel across Appalachia, creature populations not being decimated, etc.), I see that it isn't practical game wise.
---
Vats has always worked well for me. A 95% chance will almost always hit. 60% chance will hit about 60% of the time and so on. Doesnt matter which gun I use.
---
It'd definitely be nice if instead of a 5min timer it was a 60min timer.
---
Lmao okay. You keep thinking that you won, but we all know the real result here.
---
I hope I live inside your head rent free for days!
---
I wair waiting for the xcom comment!
---
Incase the weapon has a large bullet like gauss rifle during vats the bullet will stop after coming near a wall even if vats was supposed to not miss
---
Highest defense?
---
Even if im not a big fan of 1st, I absolutely love Fallout 76, despite what the popular opinions say. I hate when people only use 1st to criticize on 76. I mean yeah it has issues, but using Fallout 1st as your point only means that you never touched the game.
---
Took me about 6 months of grinding it 3/4 times a day to get all of the T60 power armour paints. It was a heck of a grind but very pleased I did it. :-)
---
From what I've experienced, I think there can be sometimes be a little lag when you acquire a VATS target, so the percentage is either incorrect or the lock-on isn't properly situated. I feel like I see it more often on the first enemy in a new area and less on subsequent enemies unless it's a laggy area.
---
Another thing I've noticed, usually with concentrated fire, is that sometimes the body part you have targeted in VATS is actually blocked by something in the world, but the percentage hasn't updated. I've noticed that head and torso shots on Tick tend to miss a lot and I think it's because the target is so low to the ground that it's probably clipping into terrain and therefore can't be hit.
---
A year ago today I was still sleeping off a terrible hangover from an epic night of partying. We were all so excited to finally be leaving this blue and yellow corporate prison. Little did we know what terrors awaited us outside and just how much we would all miss the safety of the vault where things just....worked. After I finally dragged my hungover butt out of bed, I found that I was the last one still in the vault. At first glance outside, it didn't seem that much had changed. That is, until I had my first encounter with a tick the size of a house cat. I barely made it up on top of a burnt out car before it got me. Just thankful it couldn't climb and thankful I grabbed that machete off the corpse by the vault. I was able to hit it enough times that it ran off and I was able to get away.
---
Then there were these terrible...things....scorched as I would later learn they are called. Looked and acted somewhat human, but definitely something else now. By the time I got to Flatwoods in search of the overseer or any of my other vault mates, it was dark. That first night was absolutely terrifying. I had yet to see another human being outside the vault but thankfully the group that called themselves the Responders had left plenty of info and training behind that I was able to survive the longest night of my life. Why oh why did I ever want to leave the vault?
---
The next few weeks was a huge learning curve of how to survive in what was now an incredibly hostile environment. Mutated wildlife, scorched humans, these zombie things called ghouls, and these massive giant beings called super mutants that want nothing more than to eat me alive. This was not the West Virginia I grew up in. I might as well have been on another planet. After about almost a month I was finally getting my bearings and feeling pretty confident so I decided to journey down south past Charleston and see if I could find some resources in the mining camps. I made my way by following the railroad south. I was almost to Welch station when it happened. Out of nowhere I was attacked by 2 huge molerats that came up out of the ground beneath me. While fighting them off, 5 supermutants seemingly appeared out of thin air. Ok, I can handle myself, no problem.
---
Then I heard it. An unmistakable flapping sound. Like a giant bird. Or more like a pterodactyl. I had seen something like this flying over morgantown airport but it didn't give me any trouble and flew off to the east out of range. This time was different. It made this terrible noise that sent explosive shockwaves through my body, injuring me greatly and blinding me with these bright flashes of light. Why did I leave that power armor I found in my stash?!?. Mistakes were made. I ran as fast as I could to what I presumed was safety inside the train station. As the beast circled around the station, I was able to take out the rest of my ground-based foes through the train station door. I was finally able to land a couple shots on the flying terror as it flew past the windows. It was like my rifles were BB guns and did next to no damage. This was going to be a bad day. After nearly exhausting my supply of .308, my rifle decided it had enough and fell apart in my hands. The beast was too far away to hit with my trusty shotgun, my laser was almost comically bad, and the thing just laughed at my pistols. What was I going to do? Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, the beast started doing strafing runs over the station, coating it in this acidic haze. The putrid, gaseous vapor penetrated the station's interior and began to destroy my armor. Like a crop duster from hell, he beast continued to spray until I had no armor left and nothing but worthless weapons. There was nothing I could do. There was no escape. I crawled under the station desk, closed my eyes and prayed for it to be over.
---
I must've fallen asleep while waiting for the end that never came. When I awoke the next day, the beast was gone and an eerie silence greeted me. I got out of there as quick as I could before it decided to come back. I eventually made my way to Watoga, which was now completely overrun by hostile robots (yeah, the conspiracy theorists were right after all), and then on up to Harper's Ferry. Or what was left of it. I encountered a couple more of the flying beasts, or scorchbeasts as I would learn they were called. Sierra Bravos as they were known to this new group in Appalachia called the Brotherhood of Steel that seemed to be the new version of the military. Every time I encountered one, I made sure to run as low and as fast as I could before they saw me. The scorchbeasts, that is. Not the BoS. They were all dead, along with everyone else it would seem.
---
I finally met up with some other former vault dwellers in the area around The Whitespring resort, which was surprisingly untouched by the war and its aftermath. Apparently I wasn't alone in my experiences with the scorchbeasts. We all traded tips and tricks on how to deal with the winged terrors. I practiced my marksmanship quite extensively on the..uh...local population around the resort and got quite handy with a handmade rifle I picked up. I also got pretty darn good at crippling legs with my shotgun which came in very handing for getting those mutant bats to land by crippling their wings.
---
Over time we all learned how to launch some nuclear missiles that had been hidden in Appalachia, spawning all sorts of interesting flora and mutated fauna. Including a massive queen of all scorchbeasts. We had all resolved to destroy this thing once and for all, but that proved more difficult than we could imagine. Many failures and retreats were in store for us, but eventually we prevailed. And every time she returns to terrorize the cranberry bog, we dispatch her with increasing efficiency. 
---
Now, a year later, we've honed our skills and the scorch beasts are but a minor inconvenience. Some people even hunt the things for fun. Many of the former vault dwellers have built their homes around the state and have even established quite a sophisticated economy using bottle caps, ammo, rare weapons and armor, and these amazing serums that give us crazy mutations. Most of us work together and help each other, but there are some that were quite negatively affected by their time in the vault and have decided to take it out on the rest of us now that we are out. We try to pay them no mind and deal with these situations as best we can. They are still our brothers and sisters and we will always help them when and if they need it.
---
Now, we look forward to a time when people decided to finally come back and call this place home. We've heard rumors now for a while that there's a couple groups that are making their way towards Appalachia to settle here but we've not seen any signs of them yet. Something keeps holding them up it would seem. Well, no matter. Whenever they do arrive, I hope they appreciate what we've done to make this area safe again. Here's to another year of adventures! Stay salty out there.
---
I will, because you can do nothing but flail flaccidly at your keyboard.
---
Would be awesome but they'd have to black out the under-map landscape.
---
You find them in desks and filing cabinets. The enclave has that one mission control room full of desks that have 1-3 technical data
---
If that's what you call flying off the handle, I'd love to see what you think is worse. I think you should learn to read better.
---
It‚Äôs okay, just helping you understand some basics. :)
---
Yep, you can see the ingame date on the pipboy.
---
is this supposed to offend me?
---
My prediction is no ITV.
---
I‚Äôm similar, not a 1st subscriber but I find myself drawn to this game more so than even 4. It‚Äôs similar for me
---
To rdo, where in if I stop and think about it, it sounds like a pretty boring time. For some reason though, I find myself drawn to the simple gameplay loop. I think it has something to do with having a shared world with other real people. Like I WANT to level up and explore everything just cause other actual people are, I like to share the world, I might not ever encounter another player on my play time of the day, but I know they‚Äôre there, also progressing and for the most part, enjoying the game just like me. 
---
Super stoked for wastelanders and def don‚Äôt feel like I got ripped off with 76. It has its issues, but it brings me hours of fun, so it‚Äôs doing its job so far
---
One question: does your weapon have "two shot" legendary effect?
---
If yes, than change it for something else without TS! I believe that VATS hit chance calculated before accuracy modifiers of TS applied. When bullets are fired they'll spread farther than should without TS, thus missing the target if it is far away or small enough.
---
Too many idiots to wrangle who can‚Äôt provide proper information, like yourself :)
---
I have a bloody lmg I just don‚Äôt use it much because of the ammo should I invest more time into it?
---
Pay to idle, where you can set afk for an entire day for a couple bucks lol. I feel like they are looking to monetize everything at this point because this didn't generate as well as they had planned.
---
Vanguard's, poison resist, sentinels/cavaliers, lead lined, BOS heavy combat armor probably has the best defense
---
Solid retort, clear understanding and comprehension.
---
I'll agree with at least the spiral staircase.  
---
Funny, yesterday, I considered a post regarding adding them to buildable objects.
---
If dataminers are correct it should be beast themed. So imagine 94 but with deathclaws and bears.

Thanks dude
---
I once rolled 4 20s in a row and maybe like 3 1s in a row during a d20 gaming session.
---
But never ever 10 in a row.
---
No lol
---
Good info. Didn't know the odds of getting a spike back increased like that. I guess that explains even more why every once in a while someone will dump a bag with hundreds of spikes since they are self replicating like that.
---
Me too
---
Did you throw all 5 dross pieces or just enough to hit the targets?
---
The post is a waste of time. Just play or don't play the game no need to justify it
---
Are you on PS4? I had been collecting them to buy the outfit but found it for sale in someone's vending machine and bought it. My boyfriend also gave me a jumbo Mr. Fuzzy, so I don't really care about using my tokens for anything. I still do the daily the too just for fun, I'll give you my tokens for free if you're on PS4
---
Pick up X amount of items before you can pick up same item again? Does this mean on a whole server or a particular location? I don't think I've heard of this before, could you explain a bit, would be a huge help, thanks
---
Yeah no--this will throw a crit. You shouldn't be able to miss on a crit...yet here we are.
---
I'm hitting repeatedly
---
You‚Äôre incoherent at this point, if you talk like you keep your account secure, no wonder why you reacted so quickly to a false positive!
---
Im PS4
---
this! enjoy!
---
Upvote! I also suggested exactly this a few weeks ago.
---
Maybe this is true, but I'll get this game bug in and open field.
---
I sell grounded and carnivore for 250c in my vendor. To robot vendors I get 500c so I usually hit there and sell two of them and some random stuff to get my 1400c.
---
Microwhatnow?
---
The harpoon works the same way.
---
Will slay in his name today
---
I can't throw because you can't grab the dross
---
The one time I didn't get fuzzy tokens, I think was due to the fact that I didn't get a single dross through a tire. They all just made contact with the tire and I didn't receive any. Haven't had any issues if I get at least one through.
---
Pretty sure the hostility started with yourself, hold on let me check... yep it did! Bless your little heart. Once you grow out of puberty you may understand a bit better. üòå
---
That definitely answers the question of "how confusing can it be?!" Amirite Lol
---
is there a time limit? I won't have any problem with the mobs, just wondering if its one of those where you need a team to do certain parts or what. is hacker 3 essential? I'm terrible at hacking but can do locks easily. might check a few vids tonight cheers for the info
---
I got a Mutant The Dragon. 10%+ damage for being mutated so yes.
---
Thanks
---
I assume the flechette mod plus explosive means never-ending ammo supply then?
---
since ive got several of these, whats that mean?
---
You haven't seen what he's written on his map76.com webpage recently about the exploit he was testing. Of course he modified memory using CE, otherwise he wouldn't be able to test that exploit. In his own words:
---
"So I tried a lot of things, and finally figured out a way to trick the purveyor to take caps instead of scrip. I was sure that is what they were doing, but at this point, I had messed with the memory so much that I wasn't sure what all was causing it to work."
---
That's really odd man. Sorry that's happening. I know he has the longest dialogue before you're actually permitted to begin and you have to listen to everything, before you're able to pickup the dross.
---
I don't use a ts anything. It's AA as stated in the post.
---
How about a free month of FO 1st for the first year? Oh wait, that would mean the company wasn't greedy. And oh wait, game would still be buggy, unstable, and incomplete. NW is still "beta" survival mode is gone. Mmo aspect lessened with private sessions. No expansion for many months. 
---
I've put in 500 hours and have no interest in logging in to a game that was dying and they then killed or at least spit on
---
If you want to stir up shit go make a DOTA post on the league of legends subreddit or something.

No one on the FO76 subreddit is going to trash you for playing FO76.

I've never used it but I'd say so. I've seen dead enemies laying around the SBQ event with a bunch of harpoons on them.
---
Are you on console? Had this same problem with this and other events a few months ago. Power cycling my console fixed the issue for me.
---
Look mate, you clearly think the world is against you at this point. Sarcasm and hostility are not the same thing.
---
I miss hiking the mountains near Ogden (was stationed at Hill AB) and seeing the valley. It was spectacular.
---
Maybe more correctly: it SHOULDN'T matter. Aten_ra is the local bug master (or at least has been harvesting them to serveb up to a Bethesda who refuses to acknowledgen them). But maybe there's a related bug AR knows about? Someone else in the thread mentioned headshots...I need to test this out myself. 'Cause this is killing me with my TS lever.

Same happened to me (lvl 50 achievement one if i remeber right), fortunately i had wanted to make an alt and it worked.
---
That's how RNG and memories work. It is entirely possible to be those few people who miss shots those shots repeatedly and our brains are just designed to remember these bad memories better than the times when the shots do hit.
---
For instance, XCOMs infamous 99% point blank misses are a result of players remembering the 1% of the time they missed a critical shot and not remembering the remaining 99% of the shots that worked.
---
or just self contained cubes like foundations that you can go inside and also join together horizontally or maybe even vertically to add a little depth :D
---
Wait what are you doing in West Virginia???  Another settlement needs our help.
---
It's a pretty common question here. [Check this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=best+armor&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on) for previous discussions.
---
There was a bug where VATs was consistently broken a couple months ago. I hope it isn't back, but if so; popping back out/in to VATs cleared it up for me as a workaround. I haven't had any consistent issues lately. I have had this happen when experiencing latency due to my own connection, unstable server connection, etc. YMMV, and I hope you find a positive outcome.
---
Funny you said that. It ended abruptly after only 3 dross throws and gave me credit for the event. Yay for purified water only!
---
Because it wasn't about the companion app, it was about how the settlement building system was a concept that "just worked" in Fallout games.
---
You're reaching.
---
Attention whore, I don't want to downvote you because that's what you want
---
I on xbox and I wouldn't mind giving it a try sometime.
---
Never played a Fallout game before this one. My brother is a huge fan and was playing the beta and told me I would like it since it‚Äôs like a multiplayer survival style game and less of a solo player RPG handjob. He was right, we had a lot of fun and I ended up buying it with him and some of our friends. 
---
When things got stale, I was left on my own to play as the guys moved on to other games. I used the time alone to explore and when content was added with Wild Appalachia my friends all came back. Once again the game was a riot. It‚Äôs gotten pretty stale again. We so looked forward to Wastelanders and the weapon rebalance and the legendary level system thing. Instead we got a Nuclear Winter map. Which was cool for a bit I admit. And, yes we really had fun with Mischief Night. 
---
But, we‚Äôre bored. Right now I login and play with just one friend largely because he‚Äôs far enough away that we don‚Äôt hang out otherwise. We used to love the insanely complicated photo challenges because they were something to do. Now daily challenges take a few minutes to knock out, grind your dailies until you almost are at the next level and then hold off until the following day so you can get the level up challenge done quickly. Rinse and repeat.
---
I‚Äôve got 3k atoms sitting there cause I don‚Äôt want more paint jobs or silly outfits or wallpaper patterns. I‚Äôm legit working my way through harvesting 7,600 wood as something to feel like I‚Äôm progressing in the game. I love playing in this world, but it needs content like pandas need bamboo!
---
This is the worst bethesda game ever!! They have royaly fucked everything about their reputation! ( the only thing they had left of any value.)
---
What's japped
---
If distance were a factor, that would still be a bug, since VATS is for melee too...and it's broke for melee as well.
---
 shotgun to come? could be!
---
If that is all we are getting those stats better include the number of NW players killed while hiding naked in the bushes without picking up a single item.
---
It's a very strong gun.  Put a prime receiver on it and start saving fluorescent flux.  You'll be able to watch the queen's health drop rapidly when you're shooting at her.
---
clipboards scrap to wood and springs.   
---
IIRC typewriters have them also.
---
screws: some toys, and check every workbench you pass, there's often a box of screw or gears nearby.
---
Oh...Lol....yep, that when I started playing.  Thx, sry.
---
I was one! :)
---
Apparently I did. So I guess you were caught in the ban wave, shame I really do enjoy your contribution on reddit. And it's sad that the community managers couldn't help you with that.
---
There was a shotgun exploit? I was just reading that everyone complained about the shotguns lately.
---
Meathook and pipe revolver
---
Brand news‚Äôs well?
---
I have no idea, but it sounds racist and/or ignorant.
---
Yes, I healed enemies instead of hurting them or something, I don't use shotguns
---
Well they are already 20 years late for renovating the complex, so...
---
Close race going on. Who's gonna win?
---
Never trying to stir shut up...just putting out some positive energy here.  It's what I like to read about- ppl who enjoy the game
---
If you but a helmet from a player and scrap it you get the plan. If you are on xbox hit me up later.  Gt:shadyrebob
---
gotten 3 of the paints...those were my 1st 3 turn-ins, haven't gotten paint since.  
---
A few other BoS centric clothing items, couple of plans, (but don't recall the specific of either)
---
also gotten aid, fusion cores, ammo, and armor...
---
What‚Äôs the difference in prime and non prime weapons exactly?
---
I mean, yea. Bethesda is really shitty right now and people should keep pointing it out until they fix themselves and fix this game.
---
Don't get me wrong, offer constructive criticism instead of just saying Bethesda sucks. But also, constructive criticism only goes so fast because this game.is mostly broken on a technical level, which we can't really suggest ways to fix. Bethesda needs to do that themselves, fix the servers, make the game run smoothly, etc, etc.
---
I got unsuspended but I was the only one and I suspect it was all my constant harassing of the customer service for an answer that did it.
---
See the cake beside your name right now?  It's the anniversary of the day you signed up for Reddit.
---
You need to finish it in one go, it doesn't checkpoint.
---
When that stupid shit happens, I go back through the entire post and downvote every comment. It's pretty fun and means you likely got everyone back once or twice
---
Because each shot has a 95% chance. The random number generator may just hate you and you hit in the 5% miss window every time. It's not cumulative.
---
Always wanted to slide down a pole
---
And get stuck in your levelling up menu asking you to open unopened packs because of lag. Result: Getting killed by a ghoul because you are stuck in menu screens
---
Pipe guns and meathooks double dipping?
---
That was pretty adorable.
---
Just saw the edit to this; bro, I get it.
---
I work in InfoSec, this stuff is literally my job, hence my standpoint. Apologies if I seem harsh. 
---
No ill will intended, but this was legit a bit of fun.
---
Cheers.
---
A little bomb shelter in your house would be superb. Ahhh
---
Ah ok, I also experienced that some days
---
Happens occasionally with the LAR too - shoot scorched in head, should be lethal but instead it goes down to like 1-2% health then boosts back up to full.
---
It's not surprising because Tuesday's hotfix was incomplete, but I don't see a reason why the advance notice had to be so short.
---
You made me smile....its not that deep.  I was just giving some positive energy. Try it...it comes back to you man.
---
You have the same nightmares I do? Haven‚Äôt slept properly in months
---
\^
---
Interesting. For me, I‚Äôve found that I have to throw all 5 for any fuzzy tokens to be awarded. If I just hit the targets and wait as the timer to ticks down, I don‚Äôt get any tokens.
---
I'd have 6 insult bots all talking sh*t to each other in my pub camp, and one Biv the bartender wasted behind the bar. 
---
Biv- "Does it smell like alcohol in here, or is it just me?"
---
Insult bot 1- "I-considered-attacking-you-on-sight, but-I-don't-think-I-can-hurt-you-more-than life-already-has."
---
Insult bot 2- "Boom, roasted."
---
Insult bot 3- "Zing."
---
With that kind of a roll rate you might want to hit up the legendary vendor...
---
Will do! I'll give you that downvote you asked for then after all. I've had lots of enjoyment from This game, 500 hours in.
---
I can't even find a notice about servers being down. I thought my account was wrongfully banned or something.
---
Ah yeah I guess it is.
---
This is the only definition I found that seemed to apply.
---
Verb
---
jap¬†(third-person singular simple present¬†japs,¬†present participle¬†japping,¬†simple past and past participle¬†japped)

---
So happy Bethesda did a event to celebrate Reclamation Day.
---
Posting this on r/fo76 instead of FC...  bold strategy Cotton, let's see if it pays off.
---
As far as Fallout first...  I think the hate might be a little exaggerated on this sub.  I have so far only received one thumbs down from another player when I had the NCR Ranger suit on.
---
Glad to hear it! See, it comes back. :)
---
Not necessarily. I‚Äôve reported cheaters in game before and paraphrasing here they followed up in the past with ‚Äúwe‚Äôve concluded our investigation and have made the necessary actions. Thank you for your report.‚Äù
---
My last two reports didn‚Äôt get a response, however, so I feel a policy change may have occurred or CS tooling is going through some changes.
---
Just redownloading for the 5th time see if it's any better this time round
---
There was a glitch that allowed massive damage output. It's a pc only thing
---
You‚Äôre right about it‚Äôs potential, I‚Äôm not optimistic that the game will see any of it.
---
Yikes.
---
In other words, it's a bug
---
Mostly downs and hate. I can't believe the game is basically in the same place that it was at launch. I've had my fun with it, what little I've played. If I had paid $60 for the game, I'd be much more negative about it, but I got a used copy from eBay for $12. For that price, it's worth it. Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves, but they're probably too busy counting their money.
---
It's in BGS's best interest to make this a success...it will happen
---
Your character is an unfortunately apt metaphor for this game.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
I just woke up on my only day off this week to try and login, just to get an error telling me my account lacks the required entitlements.   Why can't they just tell you they are doing maintenance on the title screen,rather than wasting my time trying to find out via their forum or here?
---
I stand corrected! He said "it actually works perfectly". I remembered wrong.
---
My only issue is your Scorched. Not as bad as Gourmand, but still... lol. Keep having fun, enjoy the game. Im enjoying it as well. If you want a downvote from me I'll have to use the excuse your Scorched, other then that... upvote.
---
I have enjoyed it but I did not start playing until a couple months ago. You know I have to say for all the heat this game has taken, I rather give $60 to Bethesda than the $60 for OuterWorlds. That is not saying Outerworlds sucked but I just did not enjoy it as much as the Fallout world. Bethesda does need to give unlimited storage for scrap to everyone however. I purchased one month of Falllout 1st and plan to cancel. They basically took something that everyone should have and now want to charge for it. I am against that but still I enjoy this game despite all the drama over some issues.
---
Yeah but the chance of missing even 3 95% shots in a row is 0.0125%. The chance of missing 10 95% shots in a row is just a little under 0.00000000001%. Meaning about 1 chance in 100 billion, given that your chances of winning the powerball lottery is 1 in 292 million, well, you'd have a much greater shot at winning the lottery 10 times than you would missing a 95% shot 10 times in a row.
---
I appreciate your optimism. I‚Äôm personally not there yet. I hope wastelanders changes my mind.
---
I like sandwiches wouldn't be considered lore because it does absolutely nothing for the world around it and neither does personal holotape logs or an not telling you how they shit themselves in the morning or some garbage. If you want to play by those rules though, every block of fallout 4 even has a damn story because of skeletons. But no, 76 has little lore. Again, played it a bunch. At least I can admit it's damn fucking faults and I don't really care if I speak with profanities or not, it doesn't hurt or help my point actually. 
---
You're just coming off like one of those bethesda fan boys that do nothing but defend bethesda even in pay to win. Bet you have 1st too.
---
I don't think the engine could handle terrain manipulation. Only option would be to have it floating in the void like people have been doing with camps recently.
---
I assume it's a slur because of Pearl harbor, but ninjas are also Japanese origin, so didn't strike me as a big deal. I'd just never heard that before, but people are gonna get offended if they feel like it, I guess lol
---
brave
---
yea
---
Thats just the math way my dude. Why my post got so negative feedback is stupid. I have not calculated the server lag, how old the engine is and that it is not made for multiplayer games and the biggest reason = bugthesda.
---
Hopefully not the pipe guns! üò¨ü§ûüèº
---
Very sorry for your loss. What a great friend you had to play the game with you even though he hated it. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôre going through. RIP.
---
May he rest in peace. I'm so sorry for your loss üíî
---
I can't believe the game is basically in the same place that it was at launch. I've had my fun with it, what little I've played. If I had paid $60 for the game, I'd be much more negative about it, but I got a used copy from eBay for $12. For that price, it's worth it. Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves, but they're probably too busy counting their money.
---
I worked it out in another comment here that you have a better chance of winning the powerball lottery 10 times than you do of missing a 95% chance shot 10 times consecutively.
---
Except pretty much all of what Fo1st offers should be in the base game. And people are expected to buy the game at full price first, when its fuckin broken. You guys are buying into future terrible fucking gaming practices for some convenience now.
---
Or have it go to a maintenance screen with an engineer vault boy.  Play the Wii menu music over it lol.
---
The game sucks ass. That simple
---
I also smoked for 9 years
---
Fun Fact: Salty tears can help replace your electrolytes !
---
I use level 50 pocketed heavy leather armour, and it has increased my carry weight by a lot, haven‚Äôt had any problems with it. I use the grafton high tracksuit as an under armour
---
That‚Äôs the infamous ‚ÄúDamage Bug‚Äù where multiple hits in a small period of time have a chance to be undone, looking like the enemy healed their health. It happens with plasma flamer, some explosive big guns, and very commonly with Tesla rifles and all shotguns.
---
The damage bug isn‚Äôt an exploit. The notes are likely referring to how people are doing monstrous amounts of damage with a meat hook and 3 shotting the Queen and/or 1 shotting pvp targets with certain guns + breaking 2-4 full condition armor pieces at the same time. I‚Äôve reported the pvp issue three times so it‚Äôs not uncommon.
---
Sure sure.
---
On what weapon?
---
Just my 2cents, Medic shotgun with vats crit build is pretty fun, great support for teammates close enough.
---
I'll keep you in mind for sure. Perhaps you could help out my group \^\_\^
---
I LIKE the game, if love it if it were a completed, functional game.
---
I hope Bethesda improves the game going forward, but let's face it, they've barely made improvements in the first YEAR and people still buy Atoms and 1st, so o don't have much hope that anything will improve. If people are giving them money for a broken game, why would they spend time making improvements? You're already giving them your money.
---
I'd still love that! Tbh idk why most devs wont do that, outsource their material for games
---
You could be right.  I don't know anything about programming or engines.  The concrete foundations that are in game now already are capable of sinking down into terrain and leaving only the flat surface exposed.  I'm not sure if it would be possible to basically take that model, slightly elongate it, and and use it as a hollow box.
---
There us a perk that when you scrap armor /guns you get more rare Items
---
Exactly
---
Concentrated Fire + VATS = Killing folks behind buildings, all the time.
---
would have been cool to release it on fo76 anniversary
---
which quest? because certain ones need certain actions to be performed so when you go to another server those actions have to be redone
---
Wanna do it when the servers come back up?
---
Giggity
---
Sorry for your loss man :(
---
Crackpot idea: Make an emulator to run just the holotape games outside of Fallout 76. Of course, I have no idea how feasible it is to extract the holotape games from the files.
---
The need to say your friend has fallout first..
---
There I said it for all the butthurt peoples.
---
Nice pic BTW
---
I fully agree with you on The Outer Worlds. Fun game but I don't see why everyone is comparing it to Fallout 76 other than it was made by Obsidion. I played &amp; beat The Outer Worlds but I can honestly say I've had much more fun playing 76.
---
Are you in power armor when you explode?
---
Happy Reclamation Day!  Let's stoke the fire!!
---
I ran into several instances yesterday where enemies continuously regenerated health even as I was damaging them down to 0. Plain old handmade semi-auto, so it wasn‚Äôt crazy amounts of damage, either. Hopefully they‚Äôre fixing that.
---
i dont get why ppl think i want a down-vote, but its cool either way. just putting out some positive energy.
---
The Scorched flair is kinda just the first thing i found..lol
---
Yea it's awesome to see. I try to help out lower players when I'm passing through lower level areas .
---
The swimming pool at Whitespring? Whoa !!!
---
I noticed that with my explosive lever. I don't notice it on my others though.
---
Have either of you tried doing Dross Toss with the Fire in the Hole perk card equipped? You aim the arc so the dot lands on 6 o'clock on the tire and you will always get credit.
---
Lol alright peasant. That $13 must have really hurt him for you to cry this much.
---
That's not really an exploit I wouldn't think.
---
So you admit the whole unlimited junk is monetization bullshit.
---
How much you want to bet they even tacked on the Atoms only at the last second because of the community backlash, and needed to ensure their numbers would be good? So they attached a deal better than what you normally get for atoms. Purely so at the end of the day when people complain, they can point to the number of sales **even if they are purely for the atoms** and go, "but you guys are lapping it up, of course we aren't wrong!"
---
Definitely. But its kind of been consistent with the rest of Bethesda‚Äôs missed opportunities.
---
 Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
I like scout because their isn't variance in the protection. No light, sturdy, heavy.
---
Have you ever played X-Com? It's more common than you think.
---
I‚Äôve seen that with Belly of the Beast, but not with other quests.
---
It‚Äôs just vibin
---
Yeah, it is planned to have a second raid there. But first they wanted to get the tech working with the first raid. But it is upcoming with new challenges and new rewards.
---
Oof
---
Yes. But you can craft multiple backpacks and switch them out as needed.  Maybe a new line of Pioneer Scout quests will give you a new backpack that you can put multiple mods on.
---
I haven't had any since the first year out of the vault 111! What happened was some settlers, out of the kindness of their hearts, fixed alot of our problems. The Commonwealth has become a better place because of them. They charged no fees or had any restrictions. I heard they have been banished from Appalachia though unfortunately. üëé
---
&gt;We also enjoy watching people get their panties in a wad when they dont get their own way and complain about the fact that people will pay for extras even though it in no way affects their own game.
---
Setting yourself on fire, and then laughing at those concerned because the smoke fumes are going to get into everyone's lungs is a funny way of going about things.
---
So long as its not a soft relaunch of all their prior bugs lol :D
---
I mean, it's probably better to avoid saying offensive things.  I'd get a little irritated if someone asked me if my wife is going to cook any Polack food for Christmas.  I guess it's harmless, but I'd get an immediate red flag that the speaker is very likely ignorant, or at least could improve upon their sense of humor.
---
I got it I think the day before yesterday. Didn't even know it existed before then.
---
Just about 1400, I was out of work for 6 months too.  FO76 was my job on those days.
---
Karma hate-farming is trying to get creative
---
I stand with this post!
---
I think they will; in the trailer they show a yellow house being inhabited by NPCs and it clearly looks accessible, I used to have my camp in the forest right next to that very house and it's boarded-up right now.
---
No explosive LAR here (yet), just a junkies.
---
a year's worth of entertainment for a small price compared to other forms of fun.
---
I‚Äôm glad. I wish they would do more. We need fixes!!!
---
Best: That feeling after doing a daily quest 100 or 150+ times, and THEN you see a rare plan/outfit pop up as your reward, mine was the Shielded Casual plan from Queen of the hunt, took me ages to get, but so excited when I did.
---
Worst: Scrapping a rare weapon to see if I learned any mods from it, because I had 2 (Tenderizer). Then, after realizing you don't learn mods by scrapping those and that I just destroyed one for no reason, I accidently scrapped my second one. I just stared at my screen for a bit, in confusion.
---
I lasted about 2 weeks after launch and never played again. Bought the limited edition as well. Game was just too broken at the time with duper‚Äôs and all the other glitches. Based on this Reddit‚Äôs posts it doesn‚Äôt look like all that much has changed either. So great year, just not on 76.
---
Yeah I should up to a guys base mid attack and power went out to his vending machine. It drove me crazy I couldn‚Äôt fix it.
---
F
---
Ah, sorry, missed that. Anyways TS is a no go with VATS.
---
I think they're simple flash games, so they may be possible to extract and play outside of the game.
---
Same here
---
Yeppers
---
Much harder things have been achieved, hmm I'm off work at the moment because of tinnitus üôÑ maybe I should attempt this haha
---
Reddit is the real game
---
It was communicated. Theres other threads on it. 
---
Its finishing the hotfix from the otherday.
---
If you run whitesprings you will get tons of springs if you pick up flip lighters. Yao Guai also have 6 on them after you kill them.  Most toys have screws and desk fans have them as well.
---
No, more like poor reading on your part.
---
It's really hard to say, but I'd have to say no, based on 2 things:
---
**Uncertain Timelapse for Players**
---
While, yes, Fallout 76 has existed for 1 year, the in-game date has always reset to the same day: October 23rd, 2102, meaning that we have no idea how long of a time gap there is between the Base Game and Wastelanders. The only mention of time passing is from the Overseer, and even then, it's left vague.
---
&gt;*"It's been some time since Vault 76 opened."*
---
**Massive Game Changes**
---
If Fallout 76 reflected the potential 20-year time gap, then the Appalachian Wasteland would be changed by more than just the arrival of NPCs. Bethesda would have to assume a few things about what's happened in the 20 years since the events of the Base Game and Wastelanders. Did we wipe out the Scorched? What faction had the most impact on the story? 
---
From what I understand, this is why New Vegas didn't allow you to continue playing after the Battle of Hoover Dam. There are just so many variables to how the Wasteland would've changed due to our character's presence and interactions, that it would be very difficult to decide what officially happened in the Fallout timeline.
---
If a single part of your sound cuts out, 99% of the time you can go into the volume controls and literally bump it one up and one down (or the reverse) and it fixes. Weird bugs, simple fixes, kind of fucking annoying.
---
Yes communicated just 20mins before servers shit lol
---
Not a friend. It was my brother. Probably did owe me money though lol
---
I'll be so sad if my pipe revolver is neutered.
---
Reddit is the real game üòâ
---
You can keep it
---
The salt is strong in this one lol
---
I know this is pretty old at this point but I gotta say, actual mean words and things that transcend the game, not cool. But if you want to blow some guy up next to a car or swipe shit right before he gets to it over and over, thats not really bullying, and I do think its pretty damn funny.
---
Yes lad
---
Hmm. I haven't noticed that bug for a long time.  I mainly use a quad faster fire lever nowadays.
---
They said when the first hot fiz was wrapped up that the issue was more than anticipated and would another maintenance would be required.
---
Donno why your acting surprised.
---
Sorry but you are wrong : I won't pay for Fallout First.    
---
Ans seriously... 17 days to answer, no one would have been hurt if you haven't replied at all...
---
üëèüëè
---
95% chance of missing
---
Hope so.  Would really like to mod up to 2-3 slots  like most armor allows.
---
Perfectly okay with them stopping the game for them to fix something broken,  we can't have it both ways people.  These type of things are usually done to fix major exploits,  who isn't in favor of that?  After all its been a year what do you expect for reclamation day
---
I doubt it's the damage perk card "double dipping." I've heard people mention something about the LMG being able to kill the SBQ in seconds regardless of the legendary effects, so it might be related to that.
---
Cuz the game engine sucks
---
Sometimes non-explosive enemies such as ghouls or radroaches start exploding after death. It sucks. It's not Unstable Isotope mutation because that doesn't kill you.
---
Double xp weekend.
---
I think the thing I've enjoyed the most has been searching for the various teddy bear easter eggs. There's so many of them, and I think one of my favorites was the drummer bear in the Cranberry Bog. 
---
As for my least favorite? I'd have to say dealing with people who only contest workshops to get a free pass to kill you repeatedly. It was always so frustrating and just overall irritating. But its not as bad as it used to be now I suppose. 
---
I think as far as what I'm most looking forward to in the upcoming weeks is starting to try to do the vault raids finally. I've been meaning to do them but I've got entirely too many games to actually focus down on any one thing for too long unfortunately.
---
Wait..... There is even a bug with vats?.....
---
Important question, cause I found the same thing a couple days ago, where do you find Railway rifle mods? All I have is the basic parts for mine.
---
I don't mind 1st but I HATE 18 dollar skins!
---
I awoke into a hellish landscape where nothing is as it seems. I cannot count the amount of times I've picked up an item that didn't end up being there. I've watched enemy threats heal their wounds as my fired bullets tore through flesh, I've seen moles burrow out of the top of standing buildings in explosions of dirt that cannot be. I've befriended monstrous creatures only to see them die upon waking up. Where my base of operations exists, I will often awaken to it being gone, only to blink and have it return to existence. I've seen landscapes shattered by nuclear fire, but when I add my own wrath from above, simple wooden structures are left flawlessly intact.
---
I wanted to give up once. I stood in a pool of water glowing so brightly it was as if god, himself, pissed there. I died... or thought I did. When I finally thought sweet release embraced me, I awoke to a change where suddenly I could leap several times the height of fellow man. Static electricity explodes at random from within me, and for some reason, I can swing an axe with newfound strength but forgot how to aim my weapon properly.
---
I found the base of my former kin of the Enclave... a computer told me X-01 armor was in experimental testing, but a few feet away stood dozens of weathered and beaten sets. I've had items magically appear in my pockets. I can't figure out how to open some boarded up doors or hotwire a car, but I've somehow pulled the required to build complex nuclear generators out of nothing but handfuls of garbage. I was a soldier, not an advanced nuclear physicist...

They say war.... war never changes. But I did. And I'm not sure it's for the better.
---
all cosmetic items you redeem via the atom shop during your first membership stay with you if you cancel it. the outfit, emotes, icons all stay. you even keep the scrap box and anything already in it, but you can't add anything to it until you renew the subscription.
---
that was adorable.  will u guys marry me too? congrats to you both!
---
There is a half-second delay during full automatic fire before your actual accuracy reflects what vats is telling you. Tapping the trigger to ramp accuracy up through concentrated fire and *then* going fully automatic will work better for you. You can use this to your advantage with critical hits to land the next 2 consecutive rounds at 100% accuracy.
---
I seem to miss on 95% headshots nonstop.  It's really evident when you have an explosive two shot, you can see the bullets miss the target by like 10 feet and blow up in the background.  There's really seems like there is still some kind of bug(s) with VATS hit chance.
---
nice! thx for the positive energy :)
---
Thats it?? There were atom shop sales for the 50th anniversary of the apollo mission, the day the bombs fell in lore, but only double xp for the games actual anniversary??
---
Amazing... They manage to place them in every single weekend Im away from home...
---
Yeah, I agree. But there's also a point where you're just deciding the other person's intentions. If it were me asking you that, it would definitely be in excitement of trying something different. But there's also asshats out there that don't think about the words they're using.
---
Not really.
---
I think with more specific builds there are other options available to you, like one my stealth sniper I like to travel light in either Scout or Leather Armour. 
---
However for a more all round Jack of all Trades, I find combat armour to be a good balance.
---
Stopped playing this shitty game 6 months ago. Will never buy another fallout game and will pirate the shit out of this series. Outer worlds was a better game.
---
Hey! If you can get hold of the plans to make Railway Rifles (don't quote me verbatim but I'm pretty sure it's one of the vendors in the Whitespring) then you can continuously build Railway Rifles and scrap them again instantly to start learning the mods for it. That's how I did it, and how I always do for any guns/armour I'm missing mods on :)
---
Might be worth a quick check on google for where you can find the plans.
---
Since like 80% of the game is on the exterior map, they kind of have to have these things or else the performance in those areas would either run even worse or they would have to have literally nothing in them but floors and walls. If that were the case I guarantee that people would be complaining about all the empty buildings. Not saying they wouldn't have their use or that it wouldn't be nice to have a truly open map, but there are always going to be some limitations. And for the most part, Bethesda games tend to focus more on exploring, so a bunch of completely empty buildings is a bit counter-intuitive.
---
A better, more performance-friendly idea that could be neat is if those boarded-up buildings had an extra function where you could turn them into an interior cell that you could use as a CAMP. Like you could go up to a boarded-up door and select "turn into CAMP". Then a door would replace the boards and depending on what type of building it is(perhaps make like 3 different interior layouts, you get a simple interior cell with boarded-up windows that you can place things into. Maybe you could excavate a basement, add rooms underground so that it still fits into the world logically.
---
I use VATs to teleport through walls
---
That's a short one.
---
Turned on, checked the Atom Shop, turned off! Wow, Bethesda has really pulled out all the stops. Wait... stops... Ah, maintenance!
---
I think there is a VATS glitch right now... Normally with my rifle the percentages change as an enemy is running up to me to be high chances for hitting. Last night I was farming scorchbeasts and it was consistently 95% and they were FAR AWAY. Not that I'm complaining in that sake but when I have mutants right in front of me that I am missing 5 shots in a row - thats a problem.
---
Double XP weekend!
---
DRYYYYYYYYYYY SEASON
---
&gt; Unfortunately, we are not able to bring these challenges back immediately. However, we are planning to re-enable all of them, including their rewards, in mid-December. Additionally, our next set of themed Challenges is slated to go live just a few days after that. Any Halloween Challenge progress you made during the October event will be preserved and can be used to continue earning rewards when they return next month. 
---
Just highlighting this part - those who were shafted by the GMT/EST confusion will get to finish up NW progress towards the Glowing Skeleton Costume. I'm pleasantly surprised Bethesda addressed this.
---
Because that would be far far too easy to farm.
---
Great pic!  Would it be ok for me to post the Verti-bird pic on a Facebook page where I'm an Admin.  Our members would enjoy that image!
---
DRYYYYYYYYYY SEASON
---
So you don‚Äôt believe there is the slightest possibility that they could be trying to divert your attention away from doing something surprising on the anniversary of the launch of the game?
---
Wow, I never noticed that the date is static. Is there a reason why?
---
Bullshit. You picked up some of the recently duped plans and since you were paranoid about a suspension you crafted this story to have an excuse if you get banned. Which you won‚Äôt.
---
Gee Mr Peabody, you're welcome
---
Can we talk about the elephant in the room?  The damn ticking sound EVERY second as it counts down.
---
The one I saw was the assaultron head
---
Sadly so. Expect global events and maybe another meat week or similar Christmas event as these are the only things that don‚Äôt require a ton of development
---
Nope, you get double xp in private servers too. Just logged on to check
---
How do you get mobs in nukes zones to spawn it take me and my group of friends 40 mins of each nuke B4 they'll spawn and we'll get 1 or 2 waves that it no matter how many times we dash board
---
Here ya go, Max dmg rifleman build: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwUOAgMECwoBAQEAKE8D6AED8AEDEAOWAQOmAQMNAkYDQQFuAwsDlwECpwED8QEDVwNsA1EDNgK7AQMZAwsCTwEDTwIEEAEFUQEGUQIHbgEIbAEJUQMKEAILEAMMTwM=
---
This takes advantage of a BE pipe revolver allowing for a max damage of 4.2k per shot (sheet damage)
---
**That's** how that works? Oh wow, I'm behind then. I just thought crafting the gun would give you the regular mods on it, but that's way cool. 
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
As a R6 player myself, I totally agree. Most my Ranked games are full of trolls and selfish players. I‚Äôm extremely thankful after a couple rough games I have 76 to always come back to. The 76 online may be toxic at times, but in game I‚Äôve only come across maybe three players who were genuinely asshats.
---
DRYYYYYYY SEASON
---
lol hes getting downvoted
---
I hear you, and like I‚Äôve said before it‚Äôs just my word. If I was that worried about getting banned to go through all this though I would‚Äôve just dropped them.
---
Private servers are still Adventure mode
---
To avoid negative pr from yts and gaming news sources misguiding ppl saying "first members get 2x xp, p2w!!", while conveniently leaving out that adventure and nw get it as well.
---
I mean if that's the case it's much easier than I thought.
---
Exactly. It JUST works.
---
Ok whale
---
I‚Äôve noticed I miss a lot more shots in vats, even when I see the 95% hit chance, when I‚Äôm using scoped guns
---
I‚Äôve always wondered if it was a bug but I‚Äôve just taken all of the scopes off my guns in favor of the reflex sights
---
That sucks. I was actually thinking of creating a new character this week and then this happens. Funnily enough, the same thing happened when I was thinking of creating a proper mule character just before the last double XP weekend before this one. Wish I could share this luck with you.
---
It was rigged from the start.
---
Jesus. [Bethesda, posting these fluff pieces every week since Fallout 1st.](https://gph.is/1nFHojT)
---
Hey there! Double XP works in private worlds as well.
---
I mean, it's less real helping and more that you get constantly showered with low level equipment that you can just dump on the ground for low level players. Like it's less nice players and more bad game design making everyone have too much of everything past the early game, so late game players drop oodles of everything all the time and subvert the early game for players and prevent them from ever having to engage in survival scenarios even in the short period of play where they might have.
---
:( Will give my Best today...
---
Ever considered the fact you might be a storm trooper?

I mean that would be great but I doubt it. I think the games back live isnt it?
---
Ain‚Äôt it a kick in the head...
---
Well, mostly because of the speed of day cycle in this game (20 times real time, one minute takes 3 sec) all our characters would have aged some 20 years in this year, next year we would all be old men and gone.
---
Can I join your private server
---
Can confirm the LMG fucking sucks after they did something to it with the other day‚Äôs hotfix
---
Yay, yay, yay!! Happy Dance right now!!! THANK YOU!!!
---
&gt;3099
---
that is over 8 hours a day. Why would you play this game like a full time job?
---
yeah, all it does is take an existing server and remove the possibility of anyone not on your friends list from joining. it is still functionally an adventure mode server. i'm surprised that needs explaining since people were so upset they weren't "true private servers".
---
That's the saddest Inside the Vault I've ever read
---
This server status site (link below) claimes the service is up yet I‚Äôm unable to login on Xbox 
---
http://fallout76status.com
---
I‚Äôm sorry but the files literally say it is IMPOSSIBLE for it to happen. If anything, somebody stuck it in the queen.
---
Right here bro, if you don't know how much something worth just Google that item and put price check. There is most likely a post on it.
---
No Man's Sky is my game of choice for freedom and calmness. This game frustrates me with it's constant glitches. But to each their own üëç
---
at less than 300 you can sell to venders for more ! :D
---
More like dolphin :)
---
Along with the outfits, you keep the scrapbox and the scrap you have placed in it. You can still access the scrap already in it but you won't be able to place more in it.
---
I'll just play Modern Warfare and finish up Outer Worlds.  Sucks there isn't much new but it's not unexpected.
---
For real. I really look forward to these every week. Last few gave been weak.
---
Thing is there's just plain better games that don't feel like they'll break just by giving it a wrong look, and arent broken messes even after a whole year. Tried the game myself when it was half off a few months back and when that honeymoon phase ended the problems hit full force.
---
Gotta love it when just getting out of your power armor is a coinflip on your game softlocking or not! That shit's just inexcusable. The glacial hotfix speed compared to say Warframe or other big MP games is quite dissapointing given how major these bugs are.
---
Very nice
---
no mention of the hackers in the PC version of Nuclear Winter, eh? not even a "we're working on it"?
---
I at least expected a "thank you for sticking with us through all the rough patches" or some similar comment of appreciation. very lukewarm anniversary post, Bethesda.
---
thank god we addressed the halloween event again though.
---
You ps4, I'm about to get on and drop a nuke. I dont use my mic though I just chill and farm leggos
---
I'm playing MW too man, really enjoying it despite some visual bugs. I'm also playing Nioh too thanks to PS+
---
worst: when i found a cat 
---
best: when i killed a cat in vats
---
Go ahead. Maybe I'll see it üòâ
---
Fo76 is one of my favorite games, despite the mess that it‚Äôs in. I don‚Äôt care for perfectly polished games, so I‚Äôve never really had much of a problem with the bugs. The p2w concept is a little annoying, but again, it really doesn‚Äôt affect me that much, as I don‚Äôt play competitively. The only thing that‚Äôs been able to take my fun away is the negativity in this community.
---
scrip it.
---
PC :(
---
Right on man!
---
spoiled fruit can produce a lot of gas in the stomach ü§¢
---
The basics of both should be mandatory
---
I have submitted the suggestion to Bethesda twice, never received any feedback, but I think it would be awesome addition to the game, that and... I'm still waiting for my Dog Bethesda!
---
[https://imgur.com/a/n1nH8CV](https://imgur.com/a/n1nH8CV)
---
sums up r/fo76 quite well whaddya thinking man
---
Same, it's been really fun.  First CoD I've really enjoyed since MW2.  Hadn't tried Nioh yet, but I'm sure I'll like it.  Big fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne.
---
Ahh sorry bud..
---
Double XP should be enough to convince me to continue playing through the weekend at least. But what comes next? 
---
Are there any upcoming purveyor sales or anything else new over the next few weeks? Those sales still seen to be pretty infrequent. I would think at least one 25% off sale per month should be the absolute minimum and maybe try to fix the mystery pick and bring that back someday.
---
Game engine will not allow it. Unfortunately, right now this idea is unfeasible.
---
Expect some MonHun vibes too, its definitely a decent game!
---
I agree. I‚Äôll be playing a lot of Pok√©mon but I‚Äôll def grind NW levels and atom challenges at least.
---
ROFL, I can't take you seriously at this point, you've moved the goalposts so much. First it was "you only have to have CE running to be banned". After I proved that wrong on you, now your moving the goalposts further.
---
It is, try again. Completely close the game and relaunch it
---
[Bethesda‚Äôs announcement on this issue.](https://imgur.com/gallery/fQSncHB)  Did you all see this bs?
---
I'd take 1 pretty powerful mod VS 2-3 basic ones. I use lead lined on mine and it frees my armor slots up to use other mods instead of lead lined. Backpack mods should be left as is.
---
Quiet you
---
This game has been drying up since the VAULT r√°ids... I just cant take this anymore... If nothing is annouced next week I Will be moving on until Wastelanders...
---
real cool re: halloween challenges!
---
Spontaneous human combustion, it happens.
---
Masochist to Sadist: Hit me!  Hit me.  
---
Sadist to Masochist: No.
---
Double XP will not entice me to play more this weekend. I already have three characters,  and don't see the need to start another. Since all the characters have their perks,  XP is meaningless.
---
Upvoted
---
They issued a statement a few days ago about this.
---
:)
---
I agree with you, but I looted a queen while she was bouncing off of the ground and got them. So he‚Äôs very fast at putting them in there. I‚Äôm not trying to sling bs, just sharing my experience. I know they shouldn‚Äôt have been there, but that‚Äôs how they came to me.
---
Then you weren't around when the second one hit and was literally "hey we're changing Scorchbeast scream attacks because they happen too frequently, see you next ITV"
---
Absolutely.
---
If the game's timeline advanced with it's day/night cycle, Nuclear Winter came about just over 11 years after the Vault opened- Reuben Gill would have escaped 6 years prior, or 109 days after the game launched. I mean, that *could* suggest they had planned on following the in-game time... Regardless, the timeline is definitely a mess.
---
Indeed
---
He is one of those losers that don't get enough attention in real life so he has to do everything he can to get attention on the internet by being a tool.
---
Just ignore him and he will go away.
---
They'll be pay walled by then probably
---
It's a good idea in theory but when it comes to gameplay I have trees that despawn when i place my stuff down only to respawn next I play
---
Check the Fallout news, they're doing something about it
---
I'm sorry but that helmet is so badly done in comparison with the raider one. Looks like you have a mini head.
---
Hey that‚Äôs good actually, you see 76‚Äôs good parts which allow you to enjoy it, you shouldn‚Äôt be hated for liking something
---
What? That's not a fluff piece my guy. This one gave us actual information and addressed a community issue. Damn people want to make it seem worse than it is
---
That makes sense right until they said it's been one year...
---
Perfect üëåüèº thank you
---
Hey that‚Äôs good actually, you see 76‚Äôs good parts which allow you to enjoy it, you shouldn‚Äôt be hated for liking something as long as it‚Äôs legal
---
Its been happening to me too
---
lol hate train still rolling or is this a new astroturf campaign my guy?
---
I've really enjoyed my first year in Appalchia, although the F1st annoucement soured my trust in Bethesda. I also feel a bit disappointed. A year ago I imagined that the game will make great steps forward in the following year. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the additions like the backpacks, scout challenges and player vending, but I expected more to happen.
---
I feel that I got more than enough bang for my buck (300+ hours for 80 Euro), but I don't play that often as I used to several months ago. I feel like I've exhausted what the game has to offer. I log on occasionally to shoot a few things, earn some caps and browse some vending machines, but it's not the same... I really hope that Wastelanders bring the feeling of excitement back!
---
I have a pyramid like that one. I don't do essential oils, but Crystals, herbs, candles, meditation yeah....
---
Choo Choo!
---
I‚Äôm really surprised that there is no surprise for the first anniversary üòê
---
Definitely op for taking all the workshops and getting 2k XP for each retake event without worry of attracting any "raiders"
---
Were you actually expecting anything more from Bethesda? Their superiors who are in charge of the dev process have long given up on this game that they had no real relation to anyway
---
Who says it would have to be 2-3 basic ones?   I mean having lead lined, high cap and whatever else seem like pretty powerful ones to me.
---
Sorry for your lost loved one Shireü•∫ this game really is shit may they rest peacefully now.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure how one would arrive at the conclusion that they wouldn't be part of this...
---
We are about to try it again to see if this one was a fluke. If you're in Xbox you're free to join.
---
Lvl 130, I havent played for months. Sometimes, I really want to, checking out new stuff and such, but on the other hand i cant find enough motivation to play again. I played waay to much and now im bored. Maybe Wastelanders gets me back, but knowing Bethesda i suppose it ends with a shitshow like at release.
---
Feel free to prove me wrong, i love Fallout but FO76 is just below average.
---
Take alot of workshops and  do event where their high player. Craft as ofen as you can.
---
I do not understand this rivalry tbh. I stand with most YouTubers, they do trash the game (and I too think it is a burning pile of shit), but if anyone likes it and has fun in it, why would I assault that person or flame him? Makes no sense to me, you do you.  
---
I also do not support your decision to pay for Fallout 1st, because I personally do see it as you paying money for Bethesda not fixing the bugs, ignoring exploits, not doing a better job with tech support and community management in general. I dislike that, yes, but I do also say, not only it is your right and your decision on how to spend your money, I do not feel like I can "trash" you even if I stand strongly against your choice.  
---
Have fun playing the game please.
---
Woohoo!!!! üíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉ
---
I always craft fully stocked handmade for lower level players, sometimes I will give them 2, one for the next level they reach
---
Players:  Fix the game!  
---
Bethesda: Ok, we're taking it down for a while to fix some stuff.  
---
Players: Completely unacceptable!
---
They are getting worse and worse. I understand sometimes can be hard having something "interesting" to say, especially if you do this weekly, but Jesus... is this all you have to say in your first anniversary? This Inside the Vault could just have been a 50 words tweet about when the double XP event starts/ends
---
He's downvoted because wishing this game didn't exist is quite dickish... He's basically implying that he'd prefer if noone got the possibility to play this game.
---
Thx!
---
I want to know why the fuck after 365 days why that damn cup is still floating in mid air by the house in between the Nuka Cola plant and Camden Park.
---
No, just no, armor doesn't even work that way, armor realistically only has 2 mod slots, the 3rd is a paint. You can't have lead lined and pocketed on 1 piece of armor, so why would you get both on a backpack?
---
Pouring out a nukashine for your loss, OP
---
And I respect your choice as well.
---
Should do a poll. I know I didn't, and won't.
---
There's also a good chance Wastelanders will also be the last 'content' patch as they haven't released any kind of roadmap or teaser for after-Wastelanders yet which they did months in advance for their other patches
---
Yesterday someone had a furious explosive, faster reload Handmade in their machine for 25k...I messaged them and asked if they were able to take the caps on right now, and if they could pull it out while I muled over caps. I didn't want to screw them over or give the void it's 10% lol
---
You're right, it's funny that people are reduced to hiding facts with downvotes. It isn't like they're gonna nerf the paid folks tho
---
Fantastic!
---
nothing for players that slogged through an entire year of this game? sheesh
---
Ok fine, bad example, I just don‚Äôt know why you wouldn‚Äôt want another mod slot? More mods the better and why shouldn‚Äôt the backpack have the same amount of slots as armor?
---
I've always felt like 95% is "you hit 100% of the shots  except  for shots that don't hit because of bugs/connection issues/something impenetratable between you &amp; target/bethesda magic". Bethesda's way for making it seem like you just got unlucky while in reality it shouldn't have been possible to hit anyways. No idea if that's true but I can hit an enemy standing still 100 times in a row without missing but miss most of my 95s against enemies when I'm lagging really bad or the game world is loading or vats locks onto them behind a wall etc.
---
Also gauss rifle never hits if you start charging before you enter vats afaik and sometimes railway rifle just won't connect a single vats shot till you exit and re-enter.
---
This is the saddest goddamn Inside the Vault there ever was. Also this one was pretty good. Would have noticed an XP bonus otherwise? 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/4p6SjK3uyZAtWwJRI7BLeT/untitled-entry-2019-02-06-at-05-55-25
---
Can't please everyone I guess. The Glowing Skeleton Costume acknowledgement from Bethesda needs more recognition I think. They rarely acknowledge bugged or nigh-impossible challenges - I'm pleasantly surprised they actually responded to this one.
---
It's not at all dickish. It's what he would prefer but He isn't saying that He doesn't want anybody else to have fun with the game.
---
I'm sorry for people that feel personally attacked by a statement like that. They must have very fragile egos
---
üëÜüëÜ This guy bought 2 don‚Äôt let him lie hahaha
---
they did? The only statement I saw from them since months was their "nu nu we no banning good people" which was quickly debunked by a few comments of known community members
---
I've been wanting to return for a while, got married a little bit into the launch and haven't been able to get back.
---
Then Fallout 1st happened and I promptly uninstalled.
---
üíù ‚úä
---
It's gotta be at least 50% from what I've seen. And I do a lot of shopping
---
Salty as fuck
---
Way more people than the number still crying about it.
---
They been posting fluff pieces since February my guy, this is the 2nd ever ItV but you noobs don't remember
---
A song, by first subscribers to bethesda,
---
*Heartaches by the number*  
---
*Troubles by the score*  
---
*Everyday you* *~~love me~~* *publish less*  
---
*Each day I* *~~love~~* *pay you more*
---
It actually was really cool of them to bring it back, and I already have my skelly outfit
---
S√≠
---
Hell yeah I did! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yeah, more mods the better,but,for me 90 RR from the back pack mod allows me use other mods on my armor such as brawling and weighted. If Bethesda did add mod slots to the backpack they would nerf the mods effectiveness. They aren't going to give us something without taking something away.
---
That's the surprise: there is no surprise! What a twist!
---
Holy hell no lol. Check your pipboy. The date always goes from Oct 23 to the 24. Never really lower but maybe higher into 25? Times are weird.
---
You're so loud you deafened him. üòÅ
---
Wait where‚Äôd u read about this? Is this true?
---
Take a bunch of workshops and just do the retake events, kill everything. Don't worry about farming all the shit and making relish etc, just sleep in a bed and kill everything
---
Are they still there?
---
lol someone got sucked up in propaganda
---
That‚Äôs the highest dmg build i was able to put together: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
Double XP was a surprise though :(
---
I think it could be done without terrain manipulation. Just some clever visual occlusion. But the way mods typically do it is by making thr basement it's own level cell, somewhat different approach and you couldn't custom shape the bunker.
---
This was the second ever ItV and only detailed two single changes
---
 https://bethesda.net/en/article/4p6SjK3uyZAtWwJRI7BLeT/untitled-entry-2019-02-06-at-05-55-25
---
Nah I expext a roadmap after Wastelanders... To soon to show Year 2
---
Well they're trying to not break their radiosilence too much after the 'money 1st' issue arose or they might have to actually think about a reason behind it because people could get the thought they would care about the game
---
They wouldn't have slogged through if they didn't enjoy it
---
Also added you. You'll have a message from me sayin hello \^\_
---
About 1/6 - 1/4 of the population of every server I'm on has something indicating they're First members.
---
Yep but as two of my tunes already lvl300 and other around 100 I‚Äôm using new lvls only to test builds
---
When I have them in stock it's ways for 252c
---
Only good for the daily rank up challenges for the 10 atom. Really the only perk I see.
---
On one hand I‚Äôm relieved we got a response and we will, one day soon, have our costumes. But on the other, I‚Äôm upset that it will be reopened for everyone, meaning I could have not done any of this at all and simply waited. And that we‚Äôre finally getting a costume intended for halloween in time for xmas. But I guess I‚Äôm being a bit of a choosy beggar considering Beth‚Äôs track record with addressing this stuff. So, I retract my calling it ‚Äúbs‚Äù but only a little.
---
Keep your head up dude! Try to focus on the good memories, and try to laugh when you think of him! I hope you feel a little better soon
---
It's on the new Inside the Vault
---
also, vats is 100% broken when you're fighting small creatures biting your feet. You literally have to run away in order to get hits.
---
which propaganda?
---
I had a fun experience where I was logged in and got knocked offline by someone logging in as me elsewhere... right after a big data breach.
---
Yes, it's entirely my fault for re-using passwords, but seriously? How the hell can we have a game that is potentially tied to so much money spent that has absolutely zero security other than a simple password?
---
Thank u!!! Going to go read this for myself. I was pretty bummed at the premature ending of those challenges :)
---
Love ya bro! 
---
Or gal!

Or whatever else you might be!
---
Fallout 76 for life my friends and happy reclamation day!

Back at ya! :)

Tell me, did you ever learn probability?
---
I'm all for seeing seasonal themed items, but returning Halloween Challenges mid-December, followed by presumably, Christmas items afterwards seems a bit late again.

It's ridiculous that we were earning Halloween paint and costumes 10 days into November, please don't do this again with Christmas stuff. Move your schedule ahead a week or two please.
---
smart money is on 2021 holiday for huge chunks of content to cease with the release of starfield
---
Thank you, I saw! I actually just posted the link   below in case anyone wants to see
---
They would have to come up with some new secondary mods. Existing combinations would be too OP. 
---
The backpack is already a big advantage with no drawbacks. It‚Äôs the reason they added in a basic version for low level players.
---
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
---
And we'll all stay free
---
Praise the Lord and swing into position
---
Can't afford to be a politician
---
Praise the Lord, we're all between perdition
---
And the deep blue sea
---
Yes the sky pilot said it
---
Ya gotta give him credit
---
For a sonofagun of a gunner was he
---
Shouting Praise the Lord, we're on a mighty mission
---
All aboard, we ain't a-goin' fishin'
---
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord) and pass the ammunition
---
Hot fix update, started at 10 this morning
---
I've been here since the launch, and wasn't a huge fan of "here's a preview of the preview" neither, but at least was something I suppose
---
This started as a form to have direct contact with your playerbase and know more about what's coming in the future. Now it just feels like a copy-pasted generic memo. This Inside the Vault could just have been a 50 words tweet about when the double XP event starts/ends
---
We will get exactly NOTHING in game because that's how much Bethesda appreciates us.
---
Fallout 1st members will probably get another 'i can barely even see it' paint job for the ranger armor.
---
There's an update going on, hot fix. Check their site or Twitter.
---
I totally get you. Just happy that all our progress wont be for nothing.
---
But I completely see where you are coming from.
---
The propaganda which youtubers perpetuate and claim that these people were banned unfairly. Yeah the guy tests exploits, and he tests them extensively before sending in a report. This time he didn't report it because he was either sloppy or didn't think they would detect an exploit he did "over and over" in a short amount of time
---
Sounds like you were trying to log in while the servers were down for maintenance?  They are back up now.
---
Yup now is fine!
---
Either a bug or you're the most unluckyist personnin history.
---
Is there a double exp weekend coming soon?
---
It‚Äôs active now until the 18th.
---
Believe it just went live for the 1 year anniversary
---
Fallout Firstier. For $200 a month, your ammo has no weight.
---
But they did address the playerbase's concerns with the glowing skeleton costume right?
---
An experience.
---
More bad than good.
---
And sadly unless Wastelanders magically turns this ship a complete 180, the last year I'll spend here.
---
I guess I could see how they'd arrive at this conclusion, because "private" is separate on the menu from "adventure", as well as the fact that BGS specifically says in "adventure" and "nuclear winter", instead of the blanket statement "all game modes".
---
It's not entirely out there, I suppose
---
I've got 150. How in the world do some people find time for 500+ hours?
---
thats just.... sad
---
Very nice!
---
thats... just fucking sad
---
Doing events and focusing on areas with a relatively high concentration of enemies, like Grafton Steel or Lewisburg, early on.
---
Some kid was getting bullied and saw I was a high level so he asked for help. I took care of the bully and gave him a TSE weapon as well.
---
your an idiot
---
I've leveled up 20 characters now and the quickest way still is to follow the main storyline until level 15.  Then get some Raider Power Armor and melee your way up to level 25 in the typical enemy spawn points.  Get points into intelligence early, this really helps.  Have fun!
---
Ohh... when was this?.. are you sure it wasn't Arktos pharma they were describing?
---
I have a junkies explosive shotgung and im experiencing your problem aswell to clearify i want to die
---
"You're"
---
...now who's the idiot.
---
You're no Nostradamus
---
Does this mean no double XP in Private Worlds mode?
---
‚ù§Ô∏è love u too
---
I‚Äôd like that, now that I have the build I need to practice it. I don‚Äôt run a bloodied build though not a fan of the small health pool. In a perfect world I would have an AAE gat plasma and strangler heart PA but haven‚Äôt gotten anything worth one and since I play solo I can‚Äôt grind the vault raid for vault steel and the plans. I currently use an AA/FFR/25 50. cal as a primary weapon but have a F/FFR/+agi Gatling gun and a F/50/15 Gatling plasma as secondary weapons. My IGN is the same as my username, I‚Äôll be on in about 7 hours
---
Oooo we got a badass with an opinion and a keyboard everybody! Look out he might say some offensive shit üòÇ
---
There are much other (and bigger) concerns right now than an outfit, no offense
---
What's your gt
---
Yeah so as far as Bethesda is concerned, they don't have to address a fucking thing
---
joke's on you as I don't even watch any YT channels for 76
---
I was more talking about Bethesda claiming to ban 'the right people' only for others to quickly debunk them by noting the obvious bunch of cheaters and hackers in NW that even get to boast about their 'skills' without consequences by Bethesda while it only takes them a second to ban a bug reporter who reported bugs repeatedly and it was known that we would continue testing them
---
Why the points in intelligence?
---
Im sure theyll recycle fasnacht and maybe make all the rewards obtainable.
---
Ya, I miss dogmeat. Even if he just chills at camp it would be cool.
---
And people complaint about it, and Bethesda promised Inside the Vault articles would be more interesting in the future. And they were for a time, not anymore
---
See also: How many people bought that *evil pay-to-win* Collectron.
---
In the same post they said they are actively investigating and working to address NW cheating.
---
I mean yeah, because resources are handed to you so much you can't even store them all and people pay 100+ just to have more space. Of course people give crap away. It's nothing in this game
---
FOR LESHIRE5K!
---
Yeah that was definitely the scariest part of this all. Now that I know our progress is going to be preserved, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve wasted time putting up with NW. I‚Äôm starting to calm down lol
---
Useless post, but happy cake day!
---
Internet.
---
It works in private too
---
My bet is on they'll obviously recycle it as it's already designed event but they'll forget about the rare masks again
---
People misusing your or their while calling others idiots never ceases to amuse me.
---
1.  That's how randomness works.
---
2.  Its not using a real random number generator - no one does - so there will always be streaks.  You just don't notice the low-prob hit streaks and only the high-prob miss streaks.
---
no it doesn't mean that at all.
---
Experience per kill/event is scaled with your intelligence.  I pass the egghead serum (+6 Int) to my level 2 toons and can reach level 15 in about 90 minutes.
---
Doing it in a chaotic manner,  I agree.. targetting someone because of who or what they are, not so cool...it's one thing to be an anarchist another to target a mob on someone disagreeable ...not sure that all came out right, but I hope you got the gist
---
I could have swore they said intelligence and XP was only fallout 4 and not in 76. I‚Äôll have to re-look, but was pretty confidant in that.
---
Yuck
---
but these have been going on since months and people are getting unbanned quicker than others are getting banned even though there are multiple videos showing them banning and them even taking a pi\*\* on Bethesda for not doing anything....
---
Yeah it would have been a smart move. Get some more exposure before black friday and the holidays, put some excitement back into the community.
---
https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/leveling-guide-farm-xp
---
Well guess im making that strength character ive always wanted
---
Whats the downside to egghead?
---
Great... thanks for the clarification
---
Thank you!
---
400 something around 18 days worth of time
---
That‚Äôs a great idea!
---
That's just event stuff, though
---
That doesn't anything about Atom Shop stuff.
---
Cheers...
---
95% and a instigating lever with +33% vats hit chance and still miss some
---
Negative strength and Endurance I believe.  It‚Äôs still worth it.
---
I sometimes wonder if this sub just crowds the obvious issues of the game that need to be fixed and then see a post like this and understand. But it‚Äôs alright, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt fix shit to begin with so onward with your odd requests.
---
Exactly what I was thinking, the game could really use some good news going into the holiday season after the last few weeks of negative press
---
Man why is every downside -strength? My 2 strength, commando legit has a ~1 next to strength in the pip boy
---
Minus Strength, minus endurance, so these are my rifle characters üòâ
---
Multiple Whitesprings vendors sell these plans.
---
Xcom
---
overweight?
---
That sucks, i was going to make a strength character
---
You monster! You want the one employee whos making all the DLC and bug fixes to also send messages of when he/she needs to put the game into maintenance on all the social media sites.
---
Probably stairs blue print trick, did a small video on it, it's near the middle :
---
https://youtu.be/nIXjTa4e-Gs
---
I saw bits for sale on a vendor, and I'm happy to hear that the plans for the Atom Cats paint is slowly getting out into the world (legit or not, lol).  You'd be doing a lot of people on your platform favours if you started offering painting services for t60s, btw
---
Hahahaha I‚Äôm just picturing this as an episode of the office
---
Well then just consider it a ‚Äúdump stat‚Äù, get a backpack and deep pockets.  You can carry over 300lbs that way, even with only 1 strength
---
If they release nothing - there won't be more negative press...maybe some will die down...
---
If they do release some info they run the risk of people bitching about it...why even bother fueling that fire ??
---
They should just do some FTP weekends here and there...
---
Hahaha! Thank you! I didn‚Äôt even notice that. How much better does this get üòÇ
---
Build under the map. Always flat there as long as you have foundations
---
I‚Äôll be sure to slay a scorchbeast for you both today. Sorry for your loss.
---
Agreed
---
Yeah its my dump stat atm and i have the backpack and deep pockets, it just hurts seeing my friends at like 400 without unyeilding
---
What's interesting is that they made the game's map look huge before release yet there is so much more to explore in FO4 despite being a smaller map. 
---
The game was clearly unfinished upon release. I think Wastelanders was planned as the finished product before the game even came out. You can tell by all of the locked doors in Whitespring Resort and certain terminals for doors that don't function yet. 
---
Just saying, I think there is a reason the world feels so empty despite the size of it, and I think a lot of places will open up after a few major patches.
---
that's fair
---
If you pick up an item you cannot pick it up again till youve grabbed a certain ammount of other items(180 according to the other guy, sounds about right) there is no time limit to this I believe you literally have to pick up another 180 items or it will never be there again, when I didnt play for a week I noticed this. Also goes for containers too i believe.
---
Theres a slight exception rarely sometimes when server hoping a lot, it bugs out and forgets what youve picked up allowing you to skip the 180 items.
---
I hope it's a daily. They said your progress would be restored and they cut it 12 hours early. I'm sure people that prioritized it would be stoked if their initial 2 week grind meant nothing over a 12 hour pull.
---
Longest answer: [Insert 50,000 word manuscript detailing every single bug still in game]
---
having fun with it...for a couple of coffees a month.
---
I'd rather an interior location for my CAMP...the slanted foundation piece could be modified to have a bulkhead door...which leads to an empty space (say 4x4 basement)
---
How much extra strain would it be on the game to add these?
---
It‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt bother setting in an actual vats % to hit system that works. That‚Äôs why it can‚Äôt go above 95% chance to hit so when it does miss it lets the player think ‚Äúoh I must just be unlucky‚Äù when in actuality the system is broken. Vats is and will be broken because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care
---
Fallout 76 players: " YOU HAVENT GIVEN US ANYTHING!"
---
Bethesda: "I dont even know who you are."
---
Didn't break my vats.. But my collection in pup boy says I have no scrip possum or tadpole badges when I had 2 badges of both and 190 scrip literally 5 hours ago
---
Yep, doesn"t mesh well with that build.  You can always remove it with radaway once you hit level 15.  I've done this before once I'm ready to wear power armor.
---
When you do the DMV quest the same thing applies, it does not checkpoint.  Do it all in one go or you'll get pissed pretty quick like I did.  I would start it and then something would come up and I  would have to log off. After the 3rd time I had to make sure I had enough time dedicated to getting it done in one go. Just FYI if you havent done it yet, might save you a headache.
---
Indeed.
---
Sorry for your loss man
---
Weekly reminder: This game is fuciing buddy garbage.
---
Remember 1st is the worse, 2nd is the best, and 3rd is the "Insert word that still rhymes but varies on whats popular in your location"
---
Thus based on that children's rhyme Fallout 1st members are the worse ;p. Also just kidding I'm actually quite jealous of you scrap box, hope they lower the cost to $5 a month.
---
Yep.  The Rocky Mountains are a very different structure, however.  They are much taller and karse, where the Appalachian mountains are older and more worn out.  I live in the SLC area too, and it's awesome to be able to take a 15-20 minute drive and be skiing or hiking in breathtaking terrain (depending on the season).
---
I was surprised to see they put SLC into the Last of Us game, that was kind of cool, although I was disappointed it didn't share /anything/ with the local streets and things.  I'd love to see a game that does something in the high uintas and down through to the desert areas (arches, Zions, etc).
---
Are you familiar with the term 'rolled a natural 20'?
---
Well you rolled a 1.
---
Scrap is pretty cool.
---
Fallout 76 changed my life too, I no longer preorder games.
---
They miss so many golden opportunities for this game. It just amazes me week after week.  Releasing some screenshots and teasing out some information would really excite the community.
---
Nah, completely empty.
---
Seriously, how was this one one of the biggest in-game events of the year.
---
How badly do you have to abandon the safeguarding of an IP for that to happen?
---
Same for me. If I miss the first 95% hit chance shot, which I do often because of this bug in Vats, I cancel Vats and re-enter. Then it works as it should. That initial inability to hit a 95% shot has been around for a while now.
---
Can't help with the VATS, but your lost badges/scrip/etc. is a known visual bug. Go to a scrip machine and it should show you that your scrip is just fine.
---
2 weeks in I quit this game
---
This means yet again all Christmas stuff is gonna be released a week before Xmas and not on Dec 1
---
The opportunity to have some Re-Reclamation Day would have been great. Or really, any sort of anniversary type of event or item.
---
Try close out the game?
---
They give warnings a day in advance on Twitter...
---
This happens for me with my shotgun.  Use VATs miss completely, exit out of VATS and reaquire at same distance, then it hits.  
---
My handmade shoots around corners.  I can snapshot a sprinting ghoul corners as they race past.  I get that the Handmade has better accuracy but the whole point of VATS is to compensate.
---
Oof at least they exist in game I guess thanks a bunch, i had a good laugh that they disappeared tbh
---
07
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
  I had the same thing happen after the hot fix Tuesday, thought I had lost 1000 scrip and 8 possum.
---
I run a junkies/bloodied build. You will never win a fight against a competitive PVP build using bloodied gear. The cool thing about the damage cap and Bloodied is that you can reach it without many perk cards. Move some points from damage and into utility cards.
---
When anticipating a fight, pop rada way and lift your HP up. You will have the survivability  and get your damage back when low. Use super simple to keep your regen.
---
Yeah...no.
---
Servers were down for maintenance.  Some of them are back up now.
---
Right. Teasing out info and new items invigorates the players. Screenshots that show enemies get people hunting and trading items. Idk
---
played for 2 weeks beat it. didnt find much of a reason to keep playing.
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised they haven‚Äôt added this.  Imagine something similar to the greenhouse in size, and when you close the door, you and everything inside is safe from a nuke explosion.
---
Definitely worth submitting a ticket. This bug turned up around this time last year, and again around August.
---
95% of the time it works 5% of the time.
---
Bethesda: You want new stairs? Here is some new turret paint!
---
Is that where the Halloween stuff came from?
---
It is another vault that was apparently planned to host raids. I recall (not 100% sure) it was confirmed about a year ago that it would be used in future content, but nothing specific, nor other news since then. There is an [old video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q45azpFl118) that shows what the vault looked like in last November, obviously a finished version would most likely be different.
---
We have double-XP weekends for all modes, so there's that
---
Bethesda: *You should be GRATEFUL*
---
Can't play today, sorry; maybe tomorrow. Also I prefer discord to reddit (mylkoo#9849), so perhaps drop me a message there.
---
While it is true, that Strangler and explo plasmas are great, that AA2525 50cal is very sweet; you're using 22 AP per shot in VATS - can' get any better than that. If you plan to use it exclusively for PvP, I'd recommend priming it, as it's flat 20% dmg boost. F25 Gatling is ok for sniping from afar (if you have a good aim); F50 GP is pretty much useless in PvP.
---
Also, to spice things up and broaden you inventory, you might want to look for explosive harpoons, executioner's heavies, quad gammas, explo/ffr LMGs... And basically any legacies, but yes, they are extremely hard to come by, if you're not dedicated trader.
---
Finally, if you haven't so far, put a jetpack on ultracite arm and stealtboy on x01 torso - it saves a ton of real steathboys and puts lot of people off-gard, since many rely on VATS, but are pretty terrible fpv shots (or use terrible fpv weapons, like Railroad, haha).
---
Gotta add tank killer and if stealth theres 2 perks to increase sneak dmg.
---
Client side lag ive been seeing things register minutes after they happen due to it even if your not laging they may be
---
sorry to hear that man.
---
lol double XP in a game where levels really dont do anything.
---
It is very exaggerated on Reddit and other online platforms like YouTube. I see more and more people with visable 1st items like the ranger armor and icons. The proof is in the reality of the game. But, the haters don't know that because they don't play.
---
If theres not bug causing the issue its because that 95% chance is theoretical probability not experimental  probability. 
---
If you missed 10 shots in a row you were just really really unlucky
---
Best - having fun with some of the early glitches and bugs
---
Worst - still seeing the same glitches and bugs a year later
---
I may not enjoy the game. And I may despise Fallout 1st. And I may have some very specific words for you about your choices in life if this was any other situation. But goddamn this is some bravery. So take the **UPVOTE!**
---
Just rename them with unique starting characters.  Like a number or symbol. Then they will be grouped together and super easy to select as sets.
---
Most of your damage comes from the agility tree. Covert Operative and Mister Sandman grant x3.5 on sneak attacks.
---
Ding ding. We have a winner
---
Depends if the legendary perks are good or not. I'm gonna stack until then.
---
Also, the game is mostly played at night time in the real world.  Imagine it being night in game 100% of the time, just because you *have a job*
---
If it's not 100%, you can - and will - miss. The odds are a bitch.
---
Yes along with all the weapon skins and PA skins (expect inferno mk1 to my best knowledge) for level list rewards
---
It's still better than ghost recon breakpoint.
---
I would love to build a legit bunker.
---
&gt; you haven‚Äôt found these rare items or don‚Äôt have enough to trade.
---
Yeah, I don't have a bloodied explosive plasma gatling to trade for someone's AAE Handmade... Trading is fucking dead as it stands since people only want greater value for what they have to offer.
---
That is subjective based on what damage you are receiving.
---
- DR: Metal
---
- ER: Leather
---
- RR: Trapper
---
- Hybrid: Marine
---
- PVE: Wood
---
It would be better to have some kind of bunker door object that loaded into a interior cell. Then have a separate budget for that area since you don't have the rest of the world loaded (though then it would remain to be seen if the world is that much of a framerate drag vs a bunch of individually rendered camp item.)
---
That is my experience too, plus PA.  I don't bother farming for legendaries or PA on private servers now, just other things.
---
I know the engine has a cool-down period to help balance farming, and it's tied to either your character, if not your account.  So if you just do the same thing over and over the respawns will be less and less.  I try to vary my farming locations to help with this, and it does help.
---
I suspect it's actually a good thing and is part of the overall design.  When creating an engine that runs for a long period of time but needs to respawn things in sections, you can't just have a big fat "reset" that puts everything back to a known point.  I think they build up over time, and also it varies as different levels of people enter an area.
---
For example, I wandered into the cabins at Whitesprings with my 12th level, and the various ghouls were 6th-12th (but still brutally fast and painful).  I cycled out and returned with my 140th level, and the 6th level ghouls were still there wandering around.
---
It's actually cool, if you think about it, and really not an easy challenge to tackle coding-wise.  The fact it does so many different things should be appreciated more, but instead people bitch about things that are annoying at times, but not recognizing everything else.  Perls before swine, in some ways :)  I suppose you appreciate it more if you are a programmer, perhaps.
---
Would be nice but I don't think Creation engine can do ladders
---
Agreed - relish is nice but ultimately it's like killing 10 enemies and getting an 11th for free XP-wise.
---
It is a minor difference, but for *"High DR+ER balanced set with no RR"*, a metal chest + metal limb + 3x leather limbs would give 267 DR and 263 ER.
---
I'm sure we'll have plenty of new stuff to spend capperinos on
---
Plus, look at how the flora and fauna have  changed in the couple decades since the bombs fell.  Doubling that should have a huge impact there as well.   
---
Don‚Äôt tell me that scorchbeasts evolved in 20 years, and then tell me that they didn‚Äôt nothing else changed in the next 20
---
I am!  Thanks, I'll even trade for caps/legendaries/aid--I have a big supply because I find it enjoyable to farm, so no worry.  I'll DM you.
---
Jawhol!
---
I searched it up, I forgot about that guy and that‚Äôs strange because I have spent around 200 hours in fallout 4. I didn‚Äôt know he was called ‚Äúgrenade guy‚Äù. sorry for the confusion.
---
Please think about this. Do you *reeeeeeally* trust the top minds at BGS to implement slides or fireman poles? Given their track record, the slide will probably just drop you to the ground, lock your controls so you have to hard-reset your whole system, and delete some other player's inventory for good measure.
---
Once someone cracks the game and gets an actual pirate server with user mods running, sure, then slides will be the bees knees. But until then... I'm not holding my breath.
---
Does the speedway receiver shoot they toy racecars?  That would be cool.
---
Sorry for your loss. üôèüèª
---
True.  Hrm :/
---
You buy it through the PlayStation store. You can buy it for 1 month it doesn‚Äôt automatically renew when your month is up.
---
you could cancel if you want to
---
Not much better but it is better than 3 days after the holiday.
---
Hah, I think you might have a touch of evil in that one.  It kindof ruins the purpose of helping out if you get to burn their resources :b
---
Maybe what they showed us in the trailers is all there is... :0
---
Are you sure? Also how tf did u know I‚Äôm on ps
---
&gt;Dude, don't give up the secret!
---
He says; thinking Bethesda is going to fix it. lololololololol
---
Longer still: this^ on end with no carriage returns.
---
Dammit now I need a fireman's pole.
---
Of course I did , I prefer the entire map to myself üòÅ
---
You forget this applies to NW too. You're gettimg double overseer XP too, so folks like me who haven't reached rank 100 yet can have an easier time with it
---
Cause VATS is dumb and a cheat. Well that's what I think and never use it. My knives seem to be fine. ;)
---
So you made this post just to get a reaction out of people and act like people who dislike Fallout 1st are negative Nancy‚Äôs ?Pretty sure that makes you just as bad if not worse than the people you mock.
---
Presumably you paid $60 for the game, plus the 1st subscription. If you got just a month, that's $73 total. Not counting if you got a special edition, or if you bought a full year of 1st, or if you bought Atoms. This is of course subjective, but to me, that's not a small price. Especially since other games, fully functional, less buggy and glitchy, actually finished games, you could get for the same price or less.
---
Also I couldn't imagine playing this game for a full year. Even if the game was amazing, still, I need variety. I'll play it on and off, but I took months and months long breaks in-between.
---
Not gonna lie, I had to google what a carriage return is lol
---
Didn‚Äôt know meant to type ‚Äúif on PS4 ‚Äú
---
No time limit,first time it took me 1,5 hours lol,i also got lost...now its an easy 25 min.no need for lockpick or hacker but it makes it easier tho,you can bypass the repair pipes thing and shut the laser turrets off.solo is best,less enemies.xbox?i can help u sometime if u want
---
 I'm over level 300. For the longest time I carried a BE handmade with the commando perk cards maxed out. Not that long ago I acquired a bffr handmade. What. A. Difference. My new fav gun by far.
---
But if they release anything i mean anything someone will say something negitive like the loot was horrible or they didnt give us enough notification or it feels like they just threw this together at the last minute... it might just be me but if they do anything they just get negative response... so they fix the game say as little as possible do it your way BGS ...
---
For me it seems to vary by weapon. With my hunting rifle it is really 95% that it hits, with my combat rifle it is inconsistent, and with my Gauss it is 95% chance you will miss.  The vats on the Gauss rifle is seriously broken. So badly I don‚Äôt use it.
---
I'm in my 40s level wise, I use 1 handed Melee and .44 guns. It is a 6 shooter which can be difficult to reload in close combat, but that's what a moded ski sword us for.
---
I thought the same thing while playing FO3, NV, and FO4. Who the hell spent the time and resources?
---
Some one suggested they were boarded up pre-war due to the economic conditions but that doesn't make sense to me. Every house? 
---
I know the game would choke if every house was opened but it still seems...off.
---
Its the comunnist posters for the BOS looking one like Lycan of skyrim said
---
Happy Rec Day, fellow SeventySixers!!!
---
Yeah but you also have to consider how many shots a person takes during a single session, in-game virtual bullets have practically zero costs and someone using VATS like uses it quite a lot. It's something that can realistically be expected to just happen.

I'm not going to dismiss OP or anyone else who claims to have experienced this, but I'm not going to explicitly believe anecdotal evidence of something heavily dictated by RNG. It's also believable to think that maybe OP didn't actually fire 10 shots, just that it felt like 10 shots? Or that the bullet did hit but the damage just didn't show up? We just don't know and taking OP's story as indisputable evidence of RNG being not to your favor isn't really all that helpful.
---
Really huge difference?
---
Same with the Purveyor. If I start there from last save the door is boarded.
---
I just hit level 70 - I like using a hardened hunting rifle with a long scope for sniping, with the Sniper perk maxed out. Staying away from enemies is my preferred way of fighting :)
---
when I have to get close, I use a combat shotgun - shoots fast, great damage when up close.
---
I want disposable companions as a caps sink. Pay a raider 1,000 caps to follow you around for a day and help out until he dies or his 24 hours ends.
---
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt sell them ;)
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right?
---
Really. Not damage per shot but damage per second.
---
That's why I included that even missing 3 in a row at 95% is extremely unlikely, and that's something I've experienced myself. So the more likely reason is, something is bugged.
---
Xbox defaults to automatic renewal which requires you to go through several menus to turn off.  Nice if PS doesn't make you do this.
---
I thought about that after posting... We're safe for a long time haha!
---
I love using the handmade and tesla
---
What have been the ups exactly?
---
The version of the game with Wastelanders could be too different from the currently public "1.x" branch, making it difficult to port content. Or at least that would explain the seeming lack of effort put into patch development for the last few months, and that very little Wastelanders related content has been data mined so far.
---
Bunker wise ‚Äî you can already if you know how to stack foundations and use the terrain. Here‚Äôs one I built during the last meat week. All the tricks still work: [Bunker build](https://youtu.be/mZ9ODp1VwUA)
---
Hi could we have more info - how are your S.P.E.C.I.A.L points allocated? Are you looking to respec to replace melee or supplement it?
---
Many melee builds have high strength so would favour a heavy weapons build (maybe a .50 cal at range) or a shotgun build (maybe a combat shotgun for closer quarters).  
---
If you want to supplement melee at range then a Lever action rifle (with rifleman perks) does pretty decent  damage but low dps so not good for crowd control.
---
If you are going to respec then go the stealth commando route with a suppressed automatic handmade or Fixer/combat rifle to get great sneak attack critical ps and pretty decent dps.
---
Cheers
---
 Have you ever played the game?
---
To be fair - I can't remember exactly if I read a loading screen tip or some Fallout 76 patch notes - but one of those two sources indicates that some environment objects can be removed by placing a structure down on them but they'll come back later. I believe I remember that the source I read this from was very brief and didn't give details (or I simply didn't/couldn't read on) about what would cause these environment objects to respawn "later".
---
TL;DR - The re-appearance of object environments could be functioning as intended? Or a new system implemented that has it's object placement checks bypassed by some programing fault.
---
Do we know if the new quest will be for +50lvl?
---
And it sounds like a choo choo train!
---
I used be, aae handmades along with melee, and other. I recently traded for an aae laser gun and have never looked back. By far the most damage I've saw. I do reccomend carrying an aaffr handmade as well though. That covers all resistances, maybe a tesla as a third gun. I carry a quad for events, mobs and when outnumbered in pvp.
---
Expectations: subverted.
---
They were, I learned them. I can apply the atom cats paint but can‚Äôt find the other things in any crafting bench, or camp crafting.
---
thanks for the link
---
News dump: Wastelanders will be free... to subscribers - $30 to the free lovin' scrubs!
---
IMO the main reason they haven‚Äôt is that no one is supposed to be able to build an invulnerable camp.
---
Rifle/Shotgun build here. Love my Handmades, semi auto with Rifle Perk cards, Tank Killer, Bloody Mess. Also got an Instigating Lever Action Rifle, great for sniping and one shotting enemies when running through lower level areas, Primed Gauss for sniping higher levels. Primed Laser Rifles with Beam Splitter and Plasma Rifles with Flamer Barrel, a lot of fun too!
---
I want a swarm of repurposed Liberator bots that scramble around my camp doing all sorts of things (repaint them tho, so nobody mistakes them for the original).  Perhaps even let us "program" them from a terminal.  All the menial things like you suggest, plus I'd love to also have a "montior" that tells me things like "TEH MOLE RATS R CHEWIN ON TEH HOUZ"
---
Headshots work for me with the lever action most of the time. It seems like some servers are more jittery than others tho and vats reliability seems to suffer. Sometimes it take a few mins after logging in to settle down but I do headshots in vats all the time. Worth it for the extra damage if you're able.
---
Nope or at least I‚Äôve seen nothing on it
---
Damn 90min! Bashing or main quest?
---
Playing during server maintenance is no bueno
---
Of course. But I still have to equip and stash all 5 parts. 5 times the effort. It works already in NW, why not in PvE?
---
It‚Äôs not meta but I basically run lever actions. Not top damage but I can still one shot a lot of things.  I am a vats stealth sniper build.
---
Sorry to hear that man.
---
Lots of disappointments, probably to many to list. I still enjoy the game very much and those outweigh the failures for me.
---
I see so much untapped potential with this game, that's the real disappointment. Fingers crossed they are working hard and will keep this game going for many years. Hopefully this is just the beginning.
---
I'd like a repair-what-you-can when you're missing a couple of pieces of junk (it's usually my corn actually).
---
Or a repair-all, really, not just when at lest one thing is broken. I think nearly every single piece in my camp has at least 1 point of damage, so everywhere I go in my camp the name-of-object and health-bar show everywhere I look.
---
You ever get care packages dropped on your house?
---
I didn't think the blueprints kept the items assigned?  But, when you despawn it "blueprints" your items in camp, but it's like a different flavor because all the camp items are still associated with the blueprint, and you can re-place to get back exactly what was there before (with merchant assignments).  So it's kindof a blueprint, but not one you make as much as cause, by moving the camp.
---
I have ended up making a 4x4 foundation separated from everything else, so when I move the camp my merchants are stored, and easily placed regardless of how else I want to build my camp.
---
Nope its not luck. It's absolutely a glitch. It's weapon dependent and somewhat server health dependent. And also body part dependent - much worse for headshots. 
---
Yes it's possible you could be that unlucky but it's happens way too often to just be bad luck.
---
Theres a few road bridges you can build under to get a good bunker feeling.
---
That's just a quad assaultrons head you can charge 20 times?
---
Explosive Surpressor‚Äôs +1 agility .44 pistol. It‚Äôs so fun to use!
---
That can be said about literally anything. youll always have people who love shit no matter how bad and half assed it is and youll always have people hate shit thats almost perfect thats how she goes you can never make everyone happy
---
Might make nocturnal prefix useful
---
I have but I did my best to only write based on player feed back, not my experience.
---
Literally renamed mine, "Choo Choo". Corny, but hey..
---
Unfortunately you‚Äôll never get this as an advertised option from Bethesda as foundations are unbreakable, thus a true bunker plan is likely off the table . That being said, you can still find ways around that to build you‚Äôre own bunker using the existing rules. Here‚Äôs mine:
---
[Spectre Bunker](https://youtu.be/mZ9ODp1VwUA)
---
Sorry for your loss hope your last moments with him were amazing!
---
Love my AAffr and AAe Lasers! Do you have them Primed?
---
I always managed to get teamkilled or voted out because I‚Äôm a random.
---
&gt;You act like it was going to be the same forever
---
No I'm not.
---
I'm comparing the last version of Map76 to fo76map as it is. 
---
&gt;but there's literally nothing fo76map offers that should be behind a pay wall at all
---
That's, like, your opinion.
---
&gt;Everyone gets pissed at Bethesda but no one cares when someone else does it like that guy?
---
I'm pissed at an econmic system that demands financially predatory behavior.
---
Cheating in PC NW is being addressed REACTIVELY at the moment. Bethesda hasn't come up with the final long-term PROACTIVE solution yet. Cheaters are being banned, but no one seems to be paying any attention to that. They see that the Map76 maker was ONE of many people who were banned for using a cheat engine on the PC platform, but somehow everyone who has been clamoring for cheater bans missed that major detail.
---
On my sniper build with 22 perception I hardly ever miss shots in VATS maybe you have low perception I don't know? What kind of build do you have?
---
Sont have that plan sadly.
---
yeah now that the subscription is out ill be surprised to see much more free content or if there is a good amount will probaby still be locked behind the pay wall but youll get the bare bones of it for free
---
No matter what happens there will be negative responses, even when wastelanders fully releases next year there will be negative responses. Despite that I believe any information on new content would be welcomed by serious players of the game who want to know what‚Äôs on the horizon. Silence is aggravating players more as many posts here over the past couple weeks have criticized bethesda for not communicating with the community whether over player concerns or lack of info on new content
---
Did they fix AA on energy?
---
I haven't had it happen with the SBQ but I have seen it taking longer than usual for the stars to pop up on legendary enemies and I have read that it happens when someone tags them before the star pops up. Not sure how accurate it is though.
---
Yeah as far as I know
---
Bloodied LMG rocks! But man, what an ammo hog! Works great on everything but the SBQ. I use a Bloodied prime Gatling plasma on her.
---
 The game is cake what are you babbling about? What you saw on youtube, what you read here. Not useful opinions, as they are all hysterical at this point. ;)
---
 The Outer Worlds sucks.
---
This is similar with fallout shelter. I have tiny chances of failure while rushing rooms. Never have had a success except the very first rush.
---
If you're specced melee, use a skate sword. Or you could spec unarmed and use a power fist. If rifles, the handmade. It comes in both automatic and non. If pistols either an automatic 10 mm or western revolver, depending on if you're specced to use automatic or non. If heavy use the 50 cal.
---
well, you have a 5% chance of rolling a 1 on a 20 sided die, so roll 10 1's in a row. See how long that takes, and get back to me. Cause I hit that 5% chance to miss 10 times in a row, often. It didn't happen just once and then I took to the internet. It's a constant thing. So when you happen to hit that 1 10 times in a row let me know when you do it 5 times in a row.
---
Somewhat server related too. Sometimes I get a session where vats is great and other times I miss lots of 95%. Also headshots seem more likely to miss even with high %
---
It's much harder than you think
---
Other suggestions here are all lies. 
---
Get another player or group to help- at least 1 player should be level 50+. Get a bunch of weapons good to tag enemies with (pile of Molotov‚Äôs works great, or just fast firing 10mm smg or whatever), go to high level enemy clusters (I hear Whitesprings is good for this). Tag enemies, then have the high level player finish them off. I‚Äôve gone from level 1 to level 8 in a *single* ghoul swarm at the clubhouse. If One Violent Night starts while you‚Äôre leveling up, do that event but make sure you let it last as long as possible (don‚Äôt max out the noise bar until the timer nearly runs out).  As you level up, be sure to apply relevant perks to max your xp gains (forget the names at the moment).
---
I doubt it is related to the subscription, there is simply not enough to write about right now, patch 15 seems unlikely to come before December (and it will be the last one this year, other than possible hot fixes like today's), and the author of these articles is probably not allowed to post Wastelanders information, because that is under NDA, and will be revealed only in a planned marketing campaign.
---
so you're telling me that the things that you have to pay for with fo76map don't seem like the same exact kind of thing that bethesda has been doing?
---
https://imgur.com/a/7jRPV11
---
"Share your custom locations with friends" takes literally 0 effort to do if its already storing those locations.
---
"Unlimited progress tracking" yet theres no mention of a cap before this?
---
"No ads" literally the only thing that makes sense to pay for except there are ad blockers which work very well.
---
not only does this map have very VERY little actual information in it compared to the actual locations from things but the map developer doesnt even seem interested in adding those locations instead relying on people using the app to do so for him. Letting the people using his product improve it for him? hmm sounds familiar...
---
Because it‚Äôs a bu- I mean feature.
---
J/FFR/15% reload 50cal. Point in a general direction and hold the fire button until there's nothing left standing.

PS4 Does do an auto renuwal. Go to your PSN account, subscriptions tab and change it.

I love the Fallout aeries and was first sceptic about Fallout 76 being an online when it was first announced. Then release day came and I started it up. The first few weeks were rough as the game was seriously broken and bugged. However, stuck the game due to the fact that I enjoyed it despite its flaws. However, I then took a couple months break once I reached level 100 (I was bored of the game). 
---
I‚Äôve started playing again and I still enjoy it as much as before and honestly it‚Äôs the friendly community and the continuation of its community that makes continue playing the game. It‚Äôs thrilling to know you‚Äôre not the only one genuinely enjoying the game and that there are others despite all the hate and backlash it keeps getting.
---
SAID NO ONE EVER
---
In all honesty, the only thing that ever bothers me is when the game crashes.  It's not often, but it happens.  It happens with other games too.  It does seem to happen more so with fo76.
---
Now, as far as the fan base... Bugs &amp; Bethesda go hand in hand.  So, if this is your first Bethesda game, then enjoy.   Players have always had to come up with work around for the bugs.  Should they?  No.  Do they? Yes, because it's like a in game game. Ha. 
---
The people who complain about such things as... Muh 3 star dropped a 1 star... Muh atom shop stuff is p2w... Muh caps are to hard to get... Such an entitled whiney outlook is directly from toxic shit hole websites and subs where people who can't think rationally or even critically go to to seek a place to fit in. Like... 
---
I've never seen anybody so dillusional that they keep playing something they allegedly hate and despise so much.  Insanity. 
---
I
---
One of my biggest disappointments was the "fix" to make events public events. Most occurrences of Uranium Fever and One Violent Night since then have been so bad I've usually regretted even going to them. For the first time in forever last night I did have an entire UF event to myself without a single other player showing up. The whole event oddly only spawned like 8 mole miners in total but at least I got all 3 legendary items for the first time in weeks.
---
Also an option to sort by body part it's for.
---
Going back on their cosmetic only promise, the way they handled their screwups and how they take community feedback and throw it behind a paywall has been disappointing. Not a day goes by I wish I could get a refund. the amount of frustration when the SBQ glitches out pisses me off so bad
---
I'm pumped about double XP. After grinding the glowing skeleton costume I'm actually getting better at Nuclear Winter and enjoying playing it. Want those PA skins now.
---
Gilman Lumber is just south of vault 76. The location you are thinking of is West Virginia Lumber.
---
If I had low perception but the VATs percent read as 95% thats not "95% if you had 22 perception, but you only have 2 so you have to guess." But I am a stealth commando with over 20 perception.
---
Whatever method they are using is apparently not too effective since most PC players report great frustration with the regularity of cheating, the thousands of available videos of such cheating support that claim. Most seem to be aware of the use of cheat engine by that user but they argue that using that program is not inherently the same as cheating, that is gaining an in game advantage. The user self reports that cheat engine was used to "poke around under the hood" so to speak, illegitimate items obtained from the purveyor were dropped.
---
Hey,quick question someone might know regarding 1st...
---
Didn‚Äôt see the sense In creating a ‚Äúnew‚Äù post about it,anywho.
---
Do you still get that Riot Armor If I decided too get 1st today?
---
Like when I got home from work or whatever,it was that just if ya got it last month?
---
TSE would be nice, but only Twoshot is really awful to use due to high recoil on base weapon, and two shot property make it aiming somewhat worse.
---
Wait there were Halloween challenges?
---
#MIGHT
---
because that would require more than zero effort from Beth
---
Oh yeah I‚Äôm dum. Thanks!
---
I think the easiest would be to use a trap door to take you to an interior cell that you could build in. Either that or an elevator, which could be more interesting.
---
Wastelanders was supposed to release around the Anniversary.
---
&gt; I would take what MMOG fails says with a massive grain of salt 
---
I do take it with a grain of salt. I'm just not sure why I should do otherwise with the "wrongful ban" claims.
---
There a loop that I do and it's mostly questline.  I run a couple of xboxes and use the high level character as a fast travel anchor (this saves a lot of time).  I follow the story and side missions through Morgantown  Airport.  I then do the events to join the Enclave.  This gets you to level 10 to 12 in about 45 minutes.  After this I try to find some events and kill things.  You have a pretty good mule at 15 with Raider Power Armor.  If you want a great mule though, you want to reach level 25 to get into Excavator Power Armor.
---
Yeah in NW, there's been two sets of challenges where you get unique skins
---
Fashion Week 76
---
Oh that explains it. I barely play NW as I am only level 13 lol. Good to know they‚Äôre coming back so I can try and get them. Cheers!
---
If you can manage to add something to the level might be worth looking for a laser rifle, tbh its a beast and i love mine
---
My biggest disappointment is the egregious monetization. Easily. It was different when BGS games were glitchy but moddable.
---
Even more crazy idea - armor should be listed as armor, and clothing should be in its own separate tab.
---
Players seemed frustrated that the "cosmetic only" promise was broken  so quickly, it seems to have sewn distrust. Since players can't self develop patches for this game the bug problem is exacerbated. No one complained about caps being hard to aquire or the rate of legendary drops although the latter may be a part of the game being perceived as too grindy.
---
Worked fine for me earlier this morning, eating contest failed on me after 3 dogs though
---
B25 handmade or fixer
---
but it would only be that one small piece that was invulnerable.  and I just mean from the nuke strike.  mobs would still be able to damage it.
---
Plus thats exactly the kind of thing that would actually make sense to put on the atomic shop.
---
Even if it was even smaller, like literally big enough for a stash box, a couple stations and some standing room.  perfect for people who have their camp in a high nuke area.  or people who want to set up for the queen, etc.
---
It‚Äôs been weird. The game started out rough but I loved every minute of it because it was new and exciting. When Wild Appalachia came out I think that was the most fun I‚Äôve ever had in a game, from Faschnat to the Sheepsquatch to the Boy Scouts. I‚Äôve still kept to my word that I‚Äôm taking this game slow, I still haven‚Äôt explored the Cranberry Bog or most of the Mire yet. I still haven‚Äôt completed the main quest because I want to do all the side stuff first. Nuclear Winter was kind of a let down because I expected more than just a BR.  I think I am one of the few people who was kind of bummed when Wastelanders was announced, I kind of liked the idea of there being no NPCs. Anyways I‚Äôm glad it was delayed at least because I really want it to be good. The last couple of months have been disappointing, Meat Week was all hype and was a pretty lame event.  The recent Halloween event was somewhat fun but lagged the hell out of the game.  I think my favorite memory of this game is spending my first 20 something levels up in the Toxic Valley, back when it used to get super dark at night the whole region looked amazing from all the glowing lights. Here‚Äôs to another year and I hope Bethesda finally grows a pair and makes this game into something unique and fun!
---
I know that, I was expecting some surprise anyway, like new vault raid, maybe some side mission hinting wastelanders, definitely something else then double exp
---
That's only talking about NW event rewards. Nothing about that means there won't be any Atom Shop stuff. And isn't Atom Shop stuff usually in a separate article?
---
Where can someone go for useful opinions? Since you exclude Reddit and youtube?
---
No kidding. I spent 2 months looking for good urban scout armor than thought ill look for forest pieces too. That was my main goal for awhile and i completed it. Now i just started a new character and it really sucks struggling to kill lvl 6 enemies.
---
You're running with the assumption that if you shoot 100 times you'll hit 95 times but that's not how probability works. You're just as likely to shoot 1000 times and miss 50 times, even possibly consecutively, or 10,000 times and miss 500 times, and so on so forth. With any probability there's always the chance of being unlucky.
---
Capture the workshop at Charleston Landfill. 3 "Junk" nodes there. Build junk extractors, power them up, fight off a wave defense, then wander around the map. Check back and collect junk. :) (including springs, screws, all sorts of fun stuff). There are also junk nodes (not three, but still...) at Gorge Junkyard and Tyler County Race Track. Free fast travel to workshops you own btw... (yes, there is a risk that some player will frag you for fun. Make sure to build a stash at each workshop and stash all your junk after each visit. Also, if you have the Fast travel target (under Misc, far right), put one down to specify where you spawn in when returning to workshop). As a bonus, you get plans, xp, stims, etc for defense successes.   
---
Later- Find locations with multiple Typewriters or Desk fans (Sugar Grove, Charleston Herald, Enclave Bunker at Whitesprings). Grafton steel usually has a few Loose Screws hanging around...
---
If you play 9 hours a day we need to find you some work
---
Buy it and then cancel auto-renewal immediately.
---
this.  Workshops grant an absurd amount of xp for low level players and a lot of plans that a new character won't know.  I wouldn't necessarily even worry about the retake event if you don't feel like it.  
---
Beyond that enemy dense locations.  So like, the penitentiary, charleston in general, places like that.  
---
Lastly since this is a new character, you can craft yourself a lvl 5 brotherhood sniper rifle, mod it to 50 cal, and craft like 2k .50 rounds.  That thing will one shot almost everything up to lvl \~15 or so with a headshot even without rifleman perks.  A full set of lvl 5 heavy leather armor will make you ultra tanky especially if you mod it with studded up to lvl 15 or so as well.
---
It's been a roller coaster for sure. Came out of the vault to be greeted by some friendly person helping me out, made a few friends, then they mysteriously vanished. Talked to lots of robots, got really lonely, grew a handful of weird mutations in the process from all the rads and started worshipping our benevolent leader, Mothman. Had a few cookouts with strangers, it was a blast. Launched some nukes to blow off steam. Travelled all over doing crazy stuff to get a backpack. Got tired of getting beat up by the big ugly bat monster so I started popping chems, now I'm permanently addicted and strung out. Had some more fun destroying robots in Whitesprings and painting effigies to Mothman. Built a haunted house. Tore it down and moved over to the river by my favorite theme park. Tried visiting a private world, got really lonely and shaved my head. Came back to the regular world and launched some more nukes and explored some creepy mines. My next life goals are to go that vault and try to get some creepy power armor and then to hide in a bush while the world gets burned up so I can get more cool costumes.
---
Vampires handmade is great. Furious is powerful, instigating decent too
---
Taking advantage of a bug is exploiting though.
---
There are ALSO junk nodes that you can find in the world. If you place your CAMP next to one, you can build an extractor on that, without the risk of PVP madness.
---
Compare this 20 year post war setting to the 200+ year post war setting though, it's pretty much the same. 
---
I *think* we only see such a drastic change from pre to post war due to FEV working hand in hand with the initial nukes that destroyed the world. Now as far as the smaller nukes that are being dropped on Appalachia, they may just not pack the punch that FEV needs to cause huge changes in various flora and fauna.
---
Stay strong brother.
---
I'm sorry. I guess I should have put it in the comments. I'm a bloody build
---
Hope you find it soon bud!
---
The waves of enemies that come and attack are only at Workshops - and sometimes it takes a while before it starts.  Enemies that attack your actual camp generally are either wandering enemies like packs of things that spawn and wander the map, or enemies that naturally spawn in within range of your camp, see it, and decide to bust up your stuff.  If you pick a spot in an area without enemies, it should stay peaceful in camp indefinitely.
---
I really do love the game. It just occurred to me last night while trading. I was thinking dude, you're giving someone tens of thousands for clothes. After you've done the quests and sbq so many times it can get old.
---
I love hunting for legendaries but honestly the purveyor was a horrible idea. When before legendaries you didnt want ended up at vendors or in a sack or suitcase by the vendor it gave people another chance to grab something useful or for a new player/character to get a decent starter weapon/armor piece
---
Now you just trade in your junk legendaries for fewer junk legendaries. I remember being fresh and the awesome feeling of finding a few scrap legendaries in the blue suitcase by white springs. It meant nothing to the player trying to lighten his load by throwing away useless pieces but to me that shit was golden 
---
Those things rarely happen now because everyone's saving for a few more script
---
Ahh I see. I thought it was like previous games where time was sped up and we never aged. I read once that 76 was simulation and thought that having a groundhog day effect support that theory.
---
Even the skull costume?
---
Im in the same boat as Chasethemac.
---
I love the game and all, but it really is a huge disappointment after a year. There is so little content and the bugs that happen just should not happen at this point. Ive had a lot of hope that things would get better, but the complete lack of communication and no content to justify the monetization of every little thing is just turning a lot of people who have been defending the game, away. With how poorly they've handled everything this year  and the controversies it makes me wonder if we even will get Wastelanders..
---
it just works - the king of lies
---
There are lots of names on the map. Easy to confuse.
---
If that makes u feel good...sure.
---
This is not a deep post.
---
Even the NPCs are giving up on this shitshow now- devs probably wanted a 100/year to let them attack more than one base a day.
---
This bug has been there since release.
---
I mean, yeah, I think they should allow all the new weapons into the legendary pool, just so we can farm legacy Gauss Gatlings before they cut it out of the legendary pool because its, well, too powerful. 2 months being able to find these new legacys would be sweet.
---
Wastelanders will ‚Äúarrive‚Äù and then be offered as a ‚Äúspecial play tier‚Äù that costs another 10/w sub.
---
Mark my words.
---
Yeah theres something so unsatisfying about unloading round after round into the sbq. The rush is really finding a good deal or somebody not knowing what they had. The biggest rush i had all month was finding a WS jumpsuit at the train vendor.
---
It's genuinely lovely
---
Hopefully that means that they are using most of their ressources previlously used on the Atom Shop on Wastelanders. The lack of new skins would be an acceptable sacrifice if it was the case.
---
If be happy with a dirt mind foundation.
---
Wait what? I went to make sure it won't auto renew and the subscription doesn't show up in my account settings. It took me to my xbox account subscriptions, but it wasn't there.
---
There are a lot of wild monster spawns (which are usually also tied to other random spawns, like the lemonade stand, or corpses with notes) plus the normal set spawns for areas/locations... So most of the time something can be in aggro range of your base, but there are definitely some locations that have nothing close enough to attack. I've only found one location like this personally, but I've heard of it from others.  
---
I'm also told certain things attract monsters, but I've never done any testing. I've heard crops attract molerats. And that turrets will increase the range that things will attack your base. /shrug
---
If your still playing this at this point, then it‚Äôs because your a serious fallout ip fan or your a sadomasochist.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong man, I‚Äôm all for it. I‚Äôm just saying that Bethesda would likely see it as a plan where-as people could easily cover the top with other foundations to make it impregnable to all except that rad haze scrotchbeasts drop. Making a bunker using today‚Äôs rules can be taxing and complicated, so most people just aren‚Äôt doing it. Another thing they‚Äôd have to adjust is the weird effect foundations have when you get too close. You know what I mean, how you can get sucked in or hover or are blocked from movement. It‚Äôs a SICK idea man, just don‚Äôt see it coming to fruition.
---
Thanks for the tips, really gave me a whole other perspective besides damage percentages and such(:
---
My love gun.
---
Bcuz that 95% is per bullet not a total overall so with each bullet you have a 5% chance to miss this is recalculated repeatedly and reset and random number generated each bullets so think of it this way your actually really lucky hitting that 5% chance every bullet lol but if you fire in quick succession these numbers and calculations are actually bugged bcuz that 5% will stack per bullet up to 50% so you will then have a 50% chance of missing
---
So you're not familiar with the term, then.
---
 I dunno. Both youtube and here are just nuts, so crazy people's opinions, fuel your research.
---
I hate this event with a passion.
---
why rifle and pistol both?
---
And would there be any difference if it was another torso with the stealth boy?
---
I find that some places just tend to not spawn enemies - or they spawn much more rarely. Depending on how long you've been in your spot, you may have simply not gotten attacked yet, or you've missed it somehow. Or maybe your base simply doesn't get attacked, because I've definitely had CAMPs that got left alone by random spawns.
---
My best guess is if you're close enough to one or more areas that spawn stuff but you're far enough away that you don't aggro what spawns nearby, there can be a sort of "clear and safe" area.
---
melee (pink bat)   exploding shotgun
---
Well I‚Äôm not angry or harbor any hatred.It just seems pointless to do this at all.
---
Seconded. Noticed this glitch the other day.
---
Stealth dramatically improves your rifle DPS.  If killing almost everything in the game with one headshot isn‚Äôt great DPS, you have some pretty high standards.  A bloody hunting rifle with a prime receiver can smoke a scorchbeast with one headshot crit.
---
I‚Äôd go for heavy guns if you don‚Äôt like sneaking around.  All you really need to worry about is making ammunition constantly.
---
I personally agree with you, but I can also understand how people wouldn't. To many this goes beyond "they have something I don't", and more "this will dictate the future of Bethesda's practices". I do think the sales of first will affect Bethesda's choices in future, but if somebody's already paid the price griefing them doesn't do much good. I do think its important to remember these people aren't just doing it to be assholes though, and moreso to make some kind of statement (hollow as it may be).
---
Don't bring R6 into this.  We don't care about your problems.  Try r/SiegeAcademy or just enjoy your broken game.
---
You're telling me that for it's one year anniversary a "AAA" live service game is giving the community...double XP for the weekend.
---
They could have had a little hat or backpack skin, or something, but it's basically nothing. I wasn't expecting much and somehow I'm still let down.
---
Same my cats never misses over 60% pretty much
---
Probably not. It is meant to be playable alongside the old content, and accessible to new players from early in the game. Although chances are that least the later parts of the Wastelanders quest line will be designed for high level players, or it will rely on level scaling (which is easier to implement in instanced areas).
---
It was a comparison bitch boy
---
They loaded 999 cells and one shot the queen
---
What from my write up do you disagree with specifically, what nuts opinions were shared with me? Where can an individual go to build a general opinion rather than an individual opinion?
---
Just cause it says 95% doesn't mean it'll hit 9 out of 10 times. Just means that every shot has a 95% chance to hit. I think if your luck is low it has an invisible effect on that number also
---
Sometimes you just get lucky with location. The most I have to worry about is 2-3 ticks occasionally. My friend's base gets hit by scorchbeasts constantly because he is right behind Fort Defiance. Location plays a big part.
---
I got a place on the road by the WS and ghouls spawn there but my missiles take them out before they can do anything. Every time a player fast travels to my camp, they respawn and sometimes there‚Äôs a legendary, it‚Äôs pretty cool.
---
About 2400 hrs now.
---
*Observation
---
Reactive bans are absolutely ineffective. By the time Bethesda has implemented the ban, everyone playing NW on PC with the cheater has had their experience ruined. I feel terrible for PC players, because NW is a really enjoyable experience for some people.
---
The parts of the conversation on reddit that I find disingenuous is "Bethesda is doing NOTHING!!!" and "Bethesda banned the wrong guy!" Both statements can't be true. Bethesda is doing something. It's ineffective, but it's something. Obviously there are enough people playing NW on PC that we keep hearing all of the outrage, so even though the cheaters eventually come back, Bethesda is slowing them down enough that non-cheaters keep playing.
---
What Bethesda really needs to do, and FAST, is to implement a more preventative anti-cheat system. The current system does prevent some cheaters from getting through, but not enough. There are plenty of online games with anti-cheat technology in place already, so Bethesda has plenty of resources to draw on. There's no excuse for how long this is taking.
---
Its not an accurate comparison and R6 still doesn't care about your problems :)
---
Office job + no kids + no hobbies besides gaming + husband living the same life üòÖ
---
Most who reported that they were enjoying themselves were fans of the IP and the sandbox.
---
Looking at your posts, it's seems you've done the admirable thing and quit 76...  To play ESO.
---
You showed them.  Evil bastards.
---
K
---
Lmao still wrong.  Why don't you just enjoy your $7 refrigerators and reworked fallout 4 skins?
---
The numbers you're throwing out don't jive with you telling me I don't understand how probability works because missing 50 out of 1000 times is still a 95% success rate. It's amazing people are trying to argue "you're just unlucky." You know, if someone said "I'm thinking of a number 1 - 20, if you guess any number but that one you win!" If you lost once you'd say fuck im unlucky. Ok now that number changes so your odds remain at 5% chance of calling the unlucky number. You guess wrong again. Wait a minute. Now after 10 times of this you'd say "well fuck there's something not right here the odds are not in favor I'd guess wrong this many times." Finally you get it. YES! Lets play again. And this happens over and over and over you wouldn't just go "well I understand probability so I guess this is just what happens!" You'd say something is amiss here. Just like when I was getting spotted in stealth just entering a building and someone said "take the perk off and put it back on" and it worked. Now I don't get spotted in broad day light in the game. I don't buy that I'm just the unluckiest mother fucker in the world cause I guarantee you won't even lose a coin toss 10 times in a row if you tried it right now, and that's 50% each try.
---
I actually made a post about the error codes, its a work in progress, but the error code it gives you for server maintenance is on there if you wanna check it out!
---
They could have given us an "I played Fallout 76 for a year and all I got was this lousy shirt." shirt.
---
Amazingly good.  I‚Äôve played a few MMO/online games in the past and always wished I got in on day one, because the dedicated long timers always had the best gear, really strong characters and could effortlessly adapt to changes.
---
I‚Äôm a pretty average player, but I have a trio of well thought out builds and top end gear for each.  I love the hunt for legendary gear, and the game has rewarded my persistence.
---
Depends on your gear. Get a high DPS weapon and plenty of stims and you should be okay. Would still suggest taking a buddy, sometimes it's easier to do certain things
---
I had to go into my xbox live settings and turn off auto renew.  I didn't see an option up front.  Not sure if you can change your default settings so that you are not automatically in auto renewal, but I must have gone through 3 menus to get there and then it gave me warning I was going to lose access after a specific date.
---
If you want enemies to attack your camp, set it up near fissure site prime. Seriously, you don't even get a break to scrap your junk there.
---
I've had my camp there for months and still do because it's meant to be a support camp for fighting the SBQ.
---
The scorchbeasts are usually the only enemies that can destroy my camp because I use foundations as walls and floor pieces for the roof (it's a bunker style camp). Their radiation attack can still go through the roof of my camp, and they seem to know that is the only way they can destroy my camp because they simply do not stop doing that attack move until I kill them.
---
Don‚Äôt me wrong R6 is still fun just why I always gotta get kicked for joining a random match? I‚Äôm good and Platt too but as soon as I get there, I‚Äôm kicked out...... it pisses me off to the point where I don‚Äôt even wanna play it.
---
Its bethesda, what do you expect, effort?
---
I dont really have any friends who play 76 tbh lol. I usually play alone or with my girlfriend, but she doesnt play too often
---
I save my mirco transactions for MK11 and R6S thank you kindly
---
Aver level 50 the only thing different is that number.
---
You'll want good gear a good weapon and at least a partner with the same.
---
They are the most difficult element in the game right now imo.
---
That's deep. Stick it to the Man.
---
That would work
---
Since I remain unable to replace it with a legendary sniper rifle, I'm still loving my brotherhood recon rifle for 50 cal.
---
Boii run me those gamer tags so I can whoop that ass in siege stop stalling
---
Same.  And agreed.
---
I'll make sure to try that then. Glad I found your comment, thanks!
---
Perhaps worse most who reported being frustrated with cheating were only playing the mode to earn a cosmetic reward. They seemed uninterested in returning to the mode after earning the reward.
---
At E3 Bethesda said Wastelanders will move the game forward like ~25 years.
---
Dealt with this last night, while trying to pick off some level 62 badguys from a distance. Several missed shots later, I enjoyed a cliffside brawl with the whole handful of them. Thanks, VATS.
---
I'm almost level 60. I use a Death Tambo, The Gutter, Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle, Pyrolator, Brotherhood Recon Rifle and a Fat Man. My Death Tambo is occasionally switched out for something else that I just feel like using.
---
I sadly purchased the game a while ago, but I have done the bomb day boycot and I dont plan on Ever playing another bethesda game
---
I hear you. I recently picked up the pioneer scout merit badge grind and I have really enjoyed it. When it first came out I got myself the high capacity plan and quit doing them. Figured I would start again by doing the dailies and campfire tales. I have earned 17 badges in the last few weeks and used 5 of them to trade for my dream gun. The only part that sucks is the plasma grenade mine......ughh
---
I can't and won't defend casual, soon to be "quick match", but if you're a serious player and enjoy the game then unranked is the best place to play Siege. Casual is toxic; the plague of modern society
---
I have 5 that I like to use.  My TSE lever action for normal situations and varmint, my TSE handmade for slightly larger groups, my QE combat shotgun for tunnels, my TS .50 cal for large mobs and Scorchbeasts, and my Zealots minigun for the Scorchbeast Queen.  Variety is the spice of life afterall.
---
That's been all year my guy
---
I have a pipe rifle build and if I had the caps I'd do 2-5k
---
lmao I hope you're not talking to me.
---
Edit: not a fluke.
---
Each reenter would respawn a similar another of glowing ones (aka a fuck ton)
---
I would agree if there was only a handful of people claiming to be banned for reporting hacking.... but on the scale that it's being reported....
---
Where there's smoke there's fire.
---
monster
---
Next time i‚Äôll play i‚Äôll check there :p
---
Stealth commando with over 20 Per? You should be hitting shots then. My only other thought it maybe the bloom from using autos is what's screwing it up.
---
The scraper perk (under intelligence) is your best friend when you need materials.  Grab a bunch of weapons and armor from dead foes, equip scraper, scrap them, and you will be swimming in materials in no time.
---
My guess is that they had stuff planned tied to Wastelanders and it doesn't make sense to release it now (e.g. the event had Human NPCs). 
---
So I'm guessing all we are getting is double xp, maybe something tuesday with the next cycle of atom shop
---
Half year, Wild appalachia was not dry at all
---
I mean double exp is pretty good
---
My main guy is a level 204 and a commando bloody/unyielding build, although I sometimes  rotate to rifle perks just for the fun of it. My main weapons are 1- Bloody explosive auto handmade with less vats cost, 2- Bloody explosive auto combat rifle (forget the third star), 3-Anti-armor faster fire rate (and I think less vats cost) Tesla for the stealth boy aggressors to eat, 4- quad gamma gun for fellow Bloody aggressors to munch on, 5- instigating faster swing speed fire axe for general emergencies, 6- ghoul slayers faster swing speed knuckles for White Spring  emergencies. Also working on my faster fire rate and bloodied rad rifles to swap out from time to time. I rotate in my two shot explosive prime Gauss or anti armor faster fire rate lever if I swap to non commando rifle cards. üëç
---
The communication thing has been bad since the beginning that‚Äôs nothing new ... maybe whats that saying‚Äù silence is golden ‚Äú maybe they are zoned in on getting the game where it should be i would like new content also but i would like new content with less bugs
---
Math and simple mathematical equations are beyond the scope of Bethesda's programmer
---
no matter if you enjoy it or not, you have to accept that it was released in a terrible state and all it is now is just slightly better
---
This whole game is fucked
---
Same here.
---
Im no sneaker.  Im more of an upfront shooter.
---
I have points in agility for dodgy and ap refresh, gun fu, adreneline.
---
Looking more along the lines of using Vats to just spray everything
---
There was the exact same scale of people claiming to have been banned for ‚Äúcrafting ammo‚Äù. Which turned out to be a crock of shit. 
---
So, yeah.
---
Not knocking you, this is a totally valid opinion...  but I have seen this "paying for the game after you have already paid for the game" POV stated on this sub repeatedly and you would think that Bethesda invented this idea.
---
When I bought Black Ops 4 for $60 in 2018, within 30 days I paid $60 again for the season pass so I would get the new map packs and characters on a regular basis.  On top of that, occasionally I would buy new skin packs for a favorite character or weapon.
---
Insert shruggie here.
---
That‚Äôs why I really enjoyed this game being online. Other players add so much depth to the game- found people to offer help/items, some role played as cool wasteland characters, some became non-npc companions, and yes, some griefed. This made playthroughs more fun than previous games in the series for me
---
Do they still give you the same amount of renown as a ranked match? I‚Äôm not going to lie I read what I ranked was but I said that sounds like casual lol so I left it alone. Now I‚Äôm going to check it out. And yeah I was talking to you. Are you on xbox?
---
Yea, I believe they stated that they are going to have to revamp everything, and if that's the case adding a human npc (I consider the bots (Rose) to be npcs) would be mote. All that work adding in a quest, dialogue or any major would more then likely be destroyed. And even 1 human npc would be major... you have to make the character, then dialogue, quest dialogue, death dialogue, don't forget voice acting, setting up sessions for that, thats not including the paths they take, their looks, animations, what they interact with, different interactions with different species, reset timers if they are killed. I mean... its a lot. Thats why Im ok with them taking their time on wastelanders. The more they rush to push it out to us, the more stuff is going to be overlooked or added with missing parts.
---
Yea but I think a lot of people (myself included) were hoping they'd make a bigger deal outta their 1 year anniversary given how rocky the years been yet still having a sting dedicated fan base.
---
Your taking about the automatic blueprints created when moving a camp. We are talking about manually blueprinting , two different things.
---
The (in game) community is definitely one of the best parts of this game, and one of the main reasons I log in every day.
---
Arguable, I think it feels like more than it was because we actually got content, but it was so little content
---
Bethesda didn't invent the idea, but they did launch an unfinished game for full price. Black Ops 4 was a finished game for full price and you chose to spend extra to enhance your experience. If Fallout 76 launched for $30 or so, I'd be more sympathetic to what Bethesda has done and I'd also be more sympathetic to spending more money on the game after my initial purchase.
---
xbox lmao. ok console pleb enjoy twiddling your thumbs.  Congrats on "plat too" I'm sure everyone is super proud of your accomplishments!
---
Better then NW...
---
Yes you can still get it. The fallout 1st stuff appears on it's own tab in the atom shop.
---
Bases in the forest get attacked much less frequently. If you want to get your base regularly attacked, move to the mire or the bog. Also, if you can put yourself near a regular spawn point for a bunch of enemies, you will be attacked nearly every time you log in.
---
Hmmmm...yeah, I can see that as much as I may disagree with it. Either way,  thank you for the civil discourse,  all too rare these days!
---
wrap up so the side quests for animal heads, scout badges and get a perfect full PvP set and Pve set  of gear. Also experiment with new weapons. loads to do man.
---
I just want to see this game dust itself off and be what I believe it can be. I really do think it's up to wastelanders to bring this about. They could add a new weapon here and there though, or quest.
---
Oh you‚Äôre a PC fuck boii you can game and jack off at the same time. Aww what a shame, I would‚Äôve enjoyed mopping the floor with you. But it sucks to suck I guess ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So how do Americans get on that? I wouldn't mind getting my $220 back for my broken game, knock-off bag, and mold helmet.
---
*raider salute* sorry for you loss... this shit always hits home for me :(
---
ERROR: YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER. PLEASE SIGN IN TO DISCONNECT.
---
I havent touched the game in a bit so i havent been able to test that out myself. Hopefully they fix that soon because thats really annoying. Knowing  Bethesda its gonna take a while and it probably wont get fixed
---
I don‚Äôt know if commando is going to give you the  DPS you‚Äôre looking for without stealth, but it will certainly mesh well with vats.  A combat rifle or fixer with true mods will give you the best mileage out of vats.  A handmade is also pretty decent.  You‚Äôll be spending a lot of time making ammo either way.  Get Ammosmith and Super Duper perks as soon as you can.
---
My two faves right now are my Junkies Grognak Axe with faster swing speed and a Vampires Lever Action. As for most fun, my ghoul slayers shovel wins and down for the satisfying sound it makes when I clobber ghouls with it.
---
Sorry for your loss man. Might I suggest creating a character of him, in memory?
---
Myself included, also
---
lmao this is getting embarrassing for you... why don't you stick with fallout? Or maybe delete this thread so no one has to cringe at your replies
---
Yeah, grab your credit card and go buy a duped legacy weapon. It instantly makes terrible players good.
---
820ish
---
Depends on what you need to do/what you are fighting.
---
I'm a melee player, vampire switchblade for most ground based things, but I use ballistic weapons for things that fly.  I do not have god roll legendary weapons, nor do I have any explosive weapons.  
---
I also like to at least try stuff I loot before I decide to dump or keep it, so I've experimented with lots of different weapons.
---
That said:
---
I took down my first SB @L51 with a combat rifle.  Took a while and a lot of shots, but it can be done.   The last SB I killed decided to screech once, land, and go toe-to-toe - the switchblade took it out.
---
100 levels later, I still melee most enemies, but in addition to the melee weapons, I carry different guns for different purposes. (yes, I'm overencumbered)  
---
To support that, I have stabilized3, bear arms, and bandolier.   
---
Out of PA, I have deep pocketed (ammo, aid, and junk) weight reduction armor.
---
IMHO, AA LMG is good all around.  I use it against SBs, cargobots, and vertibots...If I'm feeling lazy, I'll jump to high ground and use it against the other apex ground based critters (yogis, SSQs, mireluck queen).
---
Troubleshooters gatling also works well against the same enemies, with bonus damage to the bots.  
---
Either weapon also works well against those pesky L52 Col Gutsys...and Assaultrons.  
---
I use the AA LMG and gatling against the SBQ.  
---
Surprisingly, the vampire 50 did not do significant per hit dmg to the queen (compared to the LMG and 5mm gatling), but does OK against scorched and mothmen.
---
BTW, Fireproof will help protect you against the SB sonic attack.
---
  Just before mischief night, I looted a non-legendary gatling plasma.  Worked well for tagging the sentrybot.  It was reasonably effective against protectrons and Mr handy, but not Assaultrons.  Melee weapons still did better against the ghouls.
---
SMG for tagging during events like uranium fever, and a non legendary fixer for sniping when I'm already up on rooftops. 
---
If you have twisted muscles, but not class freak, be aware it reduces ballistic accuracy.
---
YMMV and all those disclaimers.
---
I never knew this, and that's a huge help, thank you. I've always wondered why I'll get in ruts where I cant find certain things I'm looking for
---
Maybe but knowing them the material to make the shirts wouldn't be available
---
I have several auto handmades including BE and AAE.  Bang for buck I think they are the best.  A good (auto) combat rifle can be decent as well.  I have a Vampire and Bloodied versions of each with FFR and they are underrated.
---
well i helped 3 friends launch after i talked them into buying the game. just haven't yet. lol. no real reason. 
---
also, to be fair, my character is flawed from the get go. i started during beta and my trophy for leaving the vault is on my beta. it doesn't carry over. lvl 210 &amp; never left the vault. haha.
---
But hey, Im sure its not the first time you‚Äôve been wrong, or the first time you‚Äôve been too insecure to accept it.
---
LOL.  Check out Rage Chronicles.  Not that he‚Äôs a bad player, but he doesn‚Äôt even have to try with a legacy plasma gatling.  Everyone dies in less than a second.
---

---
The numbers do jive. Just because there's a 95% chance you won't miss doesn't mean it's impossible for you to go use VATS from now until the end of time and never hit anything again. It's random chance. From what you're saying now as shitty as it is I just don't think it seems that absurd. This is also coming from a position where VATS has always worked fine in F76 for me and looking back VATS has always loved fucking you over like that from time to time.
---
10. 1 main 2 PvP build 3 to 10 mules
---
I've been using machine guns with drums.  I have 62 shots per drum, and I just sort of "spray and pray" :)  Can't understand why I'm going through lead and steel at such a high rate...
---
With the right perks and armor pieces, you can almost become invisible to NPCs.
---
As for a VATS build, it is possible to get unlimited crits and make VATS cost 0 AP.
---
For unlimited crits, you need 34 Luck, which can be achieved with a shielded vault underarmor (+2 Luck) and a full set of unyielding armor with 2 of the pieces having the +1 Luck effect.
---
For making VATS cost 0 AP, you need an automatic weapon with the -25% AP cost, aligned or stabilized weapon mods, a non-scoped sight, and a magazine that reloads faster than normal (the fastest magazine is not necessary).
---
I'm actually going to create a new character that is going to be focused on automatic rifles and VATS during the double XP timeframe.
---
Hope this helps!
---
To be honest i see a bit of salt but ill ignore it, fact is, if he wants to top off his be handmade there are two choices for commando, be laser or bffr handmade, and the laser is easier to obtain.
---
Level 294: Main, Unyielding Bloodied Heavy and Rifle, Trader with WWR armor.
---
Level 106: Pistol Gunslinger, Unyielding Pistol build.
---
I have one Mule, and 1 Spacebag.
---
New character today will be Berserkers build.
---
Welp, I'm off to scour the E3 footage for confirmation
---
No, its called schadenfreude.  You might have to look that one up.  Don't forget to cancel your Fallout 1st membership!
---
Point taken...  although as history played out, if you wanted to pay $30 for the game all you had to do was wait 30 days to buy it.  :)
---
I was a little pissed about pre-ordering 3 copies of the game at full price (both of my boys were Fallout 4 fans as well) then watching retail price tank that quickly, but you always run somewhat of a risk when you pre-order any game.
---
Most people would probably just assume their pip-boy was broken before coming to any fantastical conclusions about their reality.
---
I'm actually a bloody unarmed melee build but I also use a BE handmade. My other character is a straight up stealth sniper with her handmade and all the perks but my bloody character does far more damage with her gun even though she has like 3 perception and no rifle perks to speak of lol.
---
I find it to be hit or miss (yay puns). 
---
The moment I hit VATS the % is significantly higher than what is likely reality. Sometimes 95%, but not too often. Usually, if I shoot immediately, I‚Äôll hit but will sometimes miss even on 95%. 
---
I find I miss more frequently when I wait until it becomes 95% before firing. You know, when it should actually be that number. 
---
Usually, I won‚Äôt shoot more than twice in a single VATS trigger. If both miss I cancel and retarget. 
---
Oh, I use silenced lever rifle with a sneak sniper build.
---
Please don't give Beth more reasons to restrict building any further :/
---
The most fun was the first few weeks, exploring and discovering all of these cool areas.  Nuka Cola Factory, Watoga, Camden Park, so many interesting places, but the highlight was Whitesprings (and under it).  This was a safe place, with lush green lawns and some powerful robots protecting your camp 24/7.  We had that place to ourselves for like a month.  Eventually it became THE place to set up camp, the enemies got stronger and the robots became useless (not to mention having to server hop to even place the camp and the constant threat of nukes).  Since launch, I quite enjoyed the Sheepsquatch and Nukashine questlines.  As for horrors, it's the bugs.  The slenderman power armour exits, the wall of vertical lines, falling through the bottom of the map, the tiny instant-death zones.  Actually, that last one was funny.  My friend said she died instantly and kept dying trying to recover her loot from a specific spot.  I walked in and got it no problem and didn't understand... then watched a guy in power armour run by the spot and he just crumpled instantly.
---
Do you know what many TF2 players do? They trade hats. The only difference is that real money is sometimes involved.
---
It's some fixes plus dbl exp weekend. Also they are bringing back the NW Halloween challenges sometime in December to give people a chance to finish them since they were removed early.
---
Lmaooo FALLOUT 1st üòÇüò≠üíÄ that was actually funny I had to respond.
---
It's going to be useful when they roll out legendary players.

If you don‚Äôt find anything, then it was QuakeCon.
---
I paid $6 on eBay for this game, what makes you think I‚Äôd pay $100 for a subscription? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Better communication than recently. Glad they are going to standardize the time. I agree they should have given out some little thing, a different party hat to match our first one would have been perfect.
---
congrats you're a poor bastard! lmao pleb

Ok thanks fellow traveller. Heres an updoot

You're still here? Shouldn't you be saving up for a PC?

---
I know how you feel i miss 99% hit chance in x com 2 all the time
---
The only time limit is when you are resetting the reactors. You have 3 minutes to do that. Personally I kill all the bots and turrets first then I go shut it down, run and repair the pipes and then go turn it back on. 3 min from shutdown to repair all of them.
---
They could just make more areas I think.
---
Yeah praise them for fixing a mistake they made
---
Do you have a table or list of the AP costs of certain mods for various guns? I try to read them off the wiki but it's difficult with how they have it formatted and I can't seem to find another one on reddit.
---
Really? You all want an old event back? What about new events? Haha wowwwwwwww Bethesda is probably the only game to bring a Halloween event in December
---
Poor? More like smart, you know how stupid I would‚Äôve felt paying for that game full priced? üòÇ and nah I don‚Äôt wanna build a computer to game on üòÇüòÇ I have other shot to do with my life. üëåüèΩ have fun being a virgin ‚úåüèæüòäüòâ
---
Could have easily not responded to it like so many other early cut off issues
---
This.
---
7 Bungus-bloodied Meele lvl134,
---
Chungus-shottgunner lvl87,
---
Agnis-Energy weapons lvl56,
---
Amalia-Sniper/Sneak lvl96,
---
Jamison-Queen Killer, rifle pvp/bloodied meele pve lvl 114,
---
Blaire-heavy gunner in the works lvl24,
---
Mule- mule lvl3
---
b/c you are in the forest close to V76 - you will not get too many things, and nothing high level, in that area.
---
lol actually they're bringing it back a week before a Christmas themed event but shows you don't play the game or read the article
---
This, bloodied faster fire. I also have a quad faster fire, becuase not everything needs bloodied level damage to die.
---
lmao yeah you're a real genius /s back to plebtown you go my friend
---
I'd say I'm not old, but I've played 76 with folks half my age, so...yeah I learned typing on a mechanical typewriter.
---
1 character. no messing about
---
They tweeted about it before taking the servers down.
---
I saw it and I clapped.
---
I like the game, too, but cool story, bro.
---
That‚Äôs a really good idea.
---
People were outraged at repair kits... Which also drop from queens.  In game, you can also fix your stuff yourself.   The people complaining are just complaining to complain.  Not everybody can sit and play the game 24 hours a day.  Bethesda had made this game more playable to the casual and somewhat more casual gamer while aslo keeping the super diehards somewhat happy.  It's actually a very impressive juggling act if you think about it.
---
Only the one.  Level 251 currently.
---
The biggest disappointment for me was the scrapbox, but the must fun thing for me that they added, as surprising as it might sound to some people, was Nuclear Winter. I still play adventure mode, but I switch to Nuclear Winter when I get bored or run out of things that I want to do. I look forward to Wastelanders and the possibility of new game modes.
---
How could you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
Idk man if I keep launching the same nukes with no permanent damage, and fighting the same scorched with no real progress then I find out my pip-boy keeps resetting everyday...I'd start to question my reality lol
---
Solid point, if it's a Q/25 I'd could see that~!
---
How does this change what I said? You really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stupid to bring a Halloween event out in December? It seems like a joke to me.
---
VATS counts as Hip Fire, not aimed, there have been a fair number of reports of ranged weapon users switching to hipfire and seeing the majority of VATS misses turn to hits
---
I went from a bloodied vats rifleman using BE weapons like handmades, hunting rifles, Lever action, gauss etc and trust me commando is better.
---
First off go commando right now, sell all your gear apart from your be handmade and put a powerful automatic receiver on it. get rid of unnecessary perks and get gun fu and adrenaline.
---
down the line you will want to drop explosive all together and go for bloodied faster fire weapons. the ultimate guns are the bffr lvc handmade and any bffr or just any bloodied fixer. bffr combat rifle is a great way to start before you can afford the other 2.
---
Bethesda's customer support is "far from perfect"......
---
1 prime lvl 396 and 4 mules
---
Same
---
Bethesda's CS is incorrect 7/10 times.... :(
---
Those weigh less I imagine, which has to do with VATs cost (or so I've been lead to believe). I wonder does it actually lower it with a hidden stat change or does it merely cost less to use due to weighing less.
---
I was one of the people who freaked out of repair kits and the vendorbot/fridge.   
---
I'm now a fallout first subscriber and have since gotten the fridge and vendor bot. The repair kits, vendor bot and fridge have all had 0 impact on how I play. Even the meat, I use the fridge and cycle items through it now, but every day i'm still just selling or dropping tons of meat. I only use the fridge cause I think its kind of fun I guess.   
---
Even the scrap box hasnt' impacted my play yet. The only advantage with the scrap box I see is in the future when I go to make ammo I've got a lot more supplies to work with but I had 40k 556 before that even happened so that too has hardly had an impact.  
---
All things considered bethesdas is doing a good job holding too keeping utilities that don't affect the experience.
---
This idea has potential!
---
I have two.
---
The main is a Lv. 321 Bloodied Unarmed Melee named Courier.
---
The other is a Lv. 97 Bloodied Stealth Pistol/Shotgunner named (unsurprisingly) Pistol.
---
There was a special reward that was cut off by twelve hours and people were upset because they grinded days for it and didn't receive it so yeah it's nice enough that they bring it back for those players. Personally I don't give a fuck because I got mine. Just posting for those who don't read the article
---
Kill the bots too. Sentry's give 1400 xp
---
Right after we get a better way flag items we dont want scrapped...I still accidentally scrap my underarmor every other week
---
Mine also stopped working a day after the event. My hubby and 3 of our friends had the same thing happen. We're on PS4.
---
That‚Äôs certainly a good way of looking at what is absolutely laziness by Bethesda lol
---
You've got a point. If it's 20 years after reclamation day, then my guy is about 90 years old, but still runs around like he's 20.
---
Wishing I could play lol
---
Might start a new character
---
Right, not really, you just wanna go for the best overall stats, so could be x01 or t51b... I just use x01 for that extra rad protection in pve; and ultracite/strangler doesn't have stealthboy mod available.
---
This seems like an accurate description of the feelings of players I have interacted with.  Love this game, but the biggie is endgame content. Bugs suck, and a few really verge on game breaking(damage rubberbanding), but as mentioned, it's Beth, you just gotta deal. However, no engaging endgame will definitely strangle this game. I think everyone who still plays can agree that Wastelanders needs to be a home run. I can promise I will play through whatever is released, but if it isn't strong enough....
---
Feels today like the game that should have been the BETA.
---
So it doesn't seem to be a fluke. And considering the double XP, we will be running this quite a few times today.
---
Send me a message and I'll add you. GT is morningBTwould
---
Been on strike since the 1st announcement, (lol) but I'll be playing today in his honor. This wholesome shit is why I'm even still around. RIP
---
Wait.  Are you saying that if I was inside a big box of foundations, that I would be safe from a nuke landing on me???   I find that hard to believe
---
I made a real estate agent character and would absolutely loooove this.
---
Also if anyone wants me to build a camp for them, my boyfriend can confirm that I can contently fiddle with camp builds for houuuuurs.
---
I got all 5 slots filled, I'm just now starting to level my last dude and get the shotgun build finished.
---
1. Darla the heavy gunner- level 234, bloodied heavy gun build. This was my character. She's on a mission to complete all possum challenges and learn all the plans. The plasma grenade plan, and server hopping for magazines and robot chest plans have held me up for a while.
---
2. Cannon fodder- level 119, bloodied unarmed powerhouse. She started as a shotgunner that only played on survival, but then I decided I needed that sweet sbq killing fury in my life.
---
3. Dopey-  level 92 bloodied rifleman. This dude looks like me, but is much better at using a rifle than me.
---
4.Shannon Rivers- level 60 undetermined. I messed this build up by not being sure what I wanted to do with her, she started as being a mistress of mystery build(pistols with some melee) until I realized that she was gonna be hot trash compared to my others builds, kinda thought about making her a PvP build, but with how PvP has died I see no point, I'm currently switching her back to semi auto pistols. 
---
5. Mysterious shotgunner - level 24 full health shotgunner(eventually, gonna stay bloodied to level up). Started this one trying to role play as the mysterious stranger, then realized I dont't need 2 pistol builds, so he's gonna be my shotgun build. This guy was my mule for the longest time, still kinda is. He has so many plans.
---
I give unyielding armor to all my low levels so they level up faster, I also have 2 level 15 bloodied black powder rifles for sneak killing high level stuff. Most of my characters joined the enclave below level 10. 
---
I've been attempting to complete all the challenges in combat, kill robots and what not. So its good to have multiple different builds that are proficient in each weapon type.
---
Or get a better engine
---
This games looks like a flash game from Y8.com smh this is a AAA üòÇ
---
I got shielded last night doing the messenger in toxic valley or the mire
---
Fair point, I‚Äôm guessing a nuke would take you out. Wouldn‚Äôt damage the structure though!
---
This is fucking great.
---
Stealth sniper, pistoleer, cannoneer, monk and one open spot. 
---
Probably a comment to get downvoted it 1st should have given an extra slot. 
---
But here‚Äôs hoping that wastelanders gives 1-2 more slots.
---
Nuclear Winter.... It's time to get that sweet sweet doughnut skin for my beloved t51b!
---
A bloodied explosive/faster fire rate fixer seems to be the most sought after weapon, but it sounds like a heavy build would fit you the best.
---
I rename mine with a + at the beginning that way it sorts to the top '+Fatigues' and it doesn't get caught up in the clickety click of rapid scrapping.
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20191108231252if_/https://cdn.livestreamfails.com/video/5dc5f5d21780a.mp4
---
I have bad news for you if you actually think there's no cheaters in OW. 8)
---
Or even a new party hat to match our first one.
---
Not sure if this will solve the problem, but it should help~whenever filling up a machine be sure to be holding everything you intend to put in on your character as the personal inventory typically seems to scroll more quickly and doesn‚Äôt get caught stuck on an item like the vending machine does
---
Thanks, I'd love to see more little mini quests in the game, of course there would be additional lore as well. But because of being limited to only a few of the options per character, it would make things interesting, mutations were great in the beginning, but an extra little customization can't hurt. It could be setup similar to the pioneer scouts badge system, where we need to do specific tasks to earn towards that specific "class credit" or something..
---
They still ain‚Äôt fixed that? Jesus. üòÇ
---
Yes, this happens to me as well. Also with Boomer in the Mire.
---
The BE laser is impossible to obtain in game. You commonly get it through trades from dupers.
---
Impossible sadly. That would require work on Bethesda's part.
---
People aren't getting "unbanned." They're circumventing ban after ban. The people who are being banned in PC NW can just make a new account with little effort and get rigtt back to cheating. That's why they're not level 500 NW characters.
---
These cheaters don't care about their accounts. They're disposable. Bethesda said they're working in a permanent fix, which will presumably prevent cheaters from accessing NW entirely.
---
I must say... that cockpit is pretty friggin cool!  Nice work
---
I'll have to do that, great idea
---
NW
---
Didn't realize this was going on! Is it running through the weekend?
---
Like the many bffr handmades that have been seen after ffr got hot on the market, my man, chances are most of the weapons we use were duped at some point. There's no point in commenting just to spit salt in a discussion post, make your own and talk about dupes as much as you want. At least give the man an option that is "fair" to you.
---
1v1 me unless you‚Äôre afraid to get beat by a gamergril üòâ what‚Äôs your GT?
---
I got the Nuka Cola one but not the others...nice drop
---
Go outside for a few, it‚Äôs nice and the graphics are HD
---
Xedit
---
I comment because not everyone knows how bad the game sucks. Also I am hoping that 1 day Bethesda will get it fixed however remote of the possibility so I can play again.
---
I understand what your thinking.. too add to it, a quest idea could be you go to VTU and register for a Corse but due to the ‚Äúlarge amount of applications recently‚Äù only one course may be selected per student.. these courses could range from anything we see on the VTU diploma and provide a small potentially significant buff to your player depending what course you have chosen! Also a new diploma for you camp showing the course you selected..?ü§î
---
Wes Tek for super mutants, Whitespring and Charleston capital building for ghouls, queen runs for scorched. Oh and NW whenever my team is on.
---
Tonight I shall raise my bootle of Nukashine in the name of LeShire5k! Sorry for your loss.
---
in game
---
5 slots full. Only play one, but may play the second if wastelanders offers a compelling faction choice where you can't play both sides
---
Level 135 main
---
Level 5 explosives hoarder &amp; 30k caps
---
Level 2 Lone Wanderer 30k caps only
---
Level 2 Courier 30k caps only
---
Level 2 Sole Survivor 30k caps only
---
Double sucks for me as I‚Äôm away all weekend starting Friday, yay 1st anniversary................
---
I was of the impression that they fixed it at one stage but you know Bethesda, they unfixed it at some stage. That's my guess. Less depressing than the alternative.
---
I‚Äôm using Zz to get it at the bottom of the list but the reason is the same
---
Quit playing in mid-June after I returned from vacation. Waited for months to see if the game had improved or gotten better. By October, decided that I had no further interest in returning to fo76 and I uninstalled the game. If it wasn't for the fact that the fo76 Reddit was included in those that are delivered to me through the Reddit app, I wouldn't have any idea what was still happening with the game. I hope everyone who enjoys the game continues to get out of it what they wish to get out of it. I hope that those that still remain find the time they spend to be an enjoyable experience. If nothing else, I've learned that there is a hell of a dedicated fanbase to the Fallout series. It's a shame Bethesda hasn't rewarded them with a better product, but that's just my opinion.
---
The glow in yhe dark skeleton costume was not from 4's creation club. But since it was a glow in the dark version of an existing 76 outfit, it was still technically reusing assets.
---
Also, if you shoot utracite spikes you get ultracite spikes from the corpses. So, no reason not to prime since ammo is free and you don't need to craft it.
---
"Others" aren't debunking anything. People who are cheating in PC NW are simply create a new account and get right back to it. Bethesda is indeed banning the cheaters, but it's like playing whack-a-mole. The cheaters who know how to circumvent the ban can return with a new account. 
---
The Map76 creator was using an exploit that allowed him to get unlimited legendary items. Using an exploit like this is a bannable offense. He was banned.
---
 Why would you care? Just play the fucking game ... or not.
---
Expect it to be as hectic as your first silo run. (Vault is harder though difficulty wise imo)
---
If your going in blind, try a few times then take a break and assess what will make your run easier. Gear, perks, meds, etc.
---
All comes down to practice to memorize, dentifying issues and coming up with solutions. Dont be afraid to think outside the box.
---
Lol. Yea. I‚Äôm talking about a small prefab, specifically for you to survive a nuke inside of.
---
Nah, we are still here. It's just that folks under lvl 70-80 are not interesting, pvp-wise. You might still get griefed by some tryhards, though. \*Shrugs\* Life in the wasteland, I guess.
---
Lol, yeah I'm just over 120 hours.  Between other games, a full time job, and life in general I couldn't imagine putting in significantly more.  To each their own though!
---
at this point it's your fault and not the games
---
With all due respect, that's not our decision to make. They take the time to do it when they don't even have to. They don't want to hear complaints.
---
Until the 17th I think
---
Oh they will. It will be very expensive, but in terms of real world money.
---
Happy Anniversary Bethesda!
---
Fucks sake. Got an exam on Monday so I‚Äôm gonna miss this üò≠
---
Just killed 2. Thanks for that tip!
---
So they returned items that were vaulted a few weeks ago, so many weird decisions. I saw those plants and cacti and the green thumb bundle not long ago. They should really shuffle and add more items. :/
---
I was thinking worst case scenario I would just give all of my weapons and armor to random players. I've amassed over time but on second thought nevermind with that attitude.
---
1 level 320
---
Not playing this buggy game
---
I'm up the hill from the Overseer's camp and my camp gets attacked all the time, usually from any one of three directions. It's often Super Mutants or Scorched, but I've had mongrels, liberators, protectrons, eye bots, mole rats, and ghouls as well. All super low level, but kind of annoying after awhile.
---
Any idea how to find Ultracite Plasm Core plans?
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
I wouldn't just add some NPCs. The story for most settlements and groups you encounter were pretty much tailored towards it. For me personally it would take away from the stories these characters had.
---
&gt;!The stories pretty much tie into what we were all taught when we were younger but not many people take to heart in the current time. The lesson being: We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided (This being a quote from Harry Potter, but I think we pretty much all know at least one variation of it). !&lt;
---
&gt;!All of these settlements and groups perished either because of selfishness or pride or ignorance. I think some comparisons can be drawn between what happened to the humans in Appalachia and the Vault dwellers. If "we" don't get our stuff together, we are going to perish just as pathetically.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Personally, I took that to be a pretty powerful message...!&lt;
---
Believe they have
---
1 level 210 and 4 mules at level 2
---
Nukes don‚Äôt leave 200+ years of fallout or permanently mutate animals or people either.
---
Probably stat change, because even those mods that decrease AP cost tend to be heavier than the standard weapon.
---
Wait is it cause I‚Äôm not a guy? Based on your active subreddits I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why üòâüòâüòâ
---
Go around to fissure sites...kill everything there...then repeat
---
Np my strat is just to destroy everything im my path
---
üëçüòä‚ù§
---
I agree, except for the "ups", "happiness", and "so many more good ones" parts :/
---
Minievent basically, surprised they didn't do 2x exp, %50 off of purveyor, and activate meat week event. Maybe we get 2x exp next year and a birthday icon for free?
---
right?
---
Gotcha
---
Hell no, I kite my enemies and run a carefully balanced inventory most of the time. I DO NOT want stuff teleported into my inventory slowing me down. Ever.
---
Why would they want to? I play NW on Xbox daily. I have 2 level 120 accounts, and I'm very good at it. Would I be playing NW if I had to deal with that level of cheating? Not a chance.
---
Excellent suggestion! That'll be $20 a month, please! Oh, and there's a 70% chance that it'll actually just delete your armor and reformat your hard drive. Have fun!
---
\-Bethesda
---
That's Xcom, baby! 
---
(Oh, wait...wrong sub)
---
You need the plan for the prime plasma Gatling receiver. Unlocking that also unlocks the ability to make ultracite plasma cores.
---
Should be under ultracite ammo in the tinkers workbench.
---
Worst: When I first booted up the game.
---
Best: When I uninstalled.
---
You.. You. .  You . . . have reached -ERROR- ERROR-. Bethsaysduhh.
---
Farm Scorched Beast usually the level 80 ones drop prime plans. I've yet to see a lvl 50 SB drop prime plans. Also the SBQ drops them
---
Player Vendors are also a good source along with the market subreddit 
---
If you want to get extra plans to sell. Don't read them if the RNG hits a plan you know it won't drop anything but if you don't read the plans you can accumalate extras to sell. Usually they go for 1-2k depending on the plan. Good luck and they are a good source of income.
---
I figure it out and found out ap cost is not related with any stats that you can see when modding weapon at workbench, ap cost happened to be totally separate stat that is there just hidden for some bizarre reason. You can find those stats for all mods here: https://nukacrypt.com/search
---
And my commando build including weapon modded for lowest possible ap cost here: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
I believe you need to know the plan for a given prime receiver to be able to make ultracite ammo for it.
---
Doesn't just have to be expensive items. There aren't enough cap sinks in the game to spend your caps on.
---
Killin and Chillin. Laying waste to the waste in the wastes. Gonna get 180 this weekend.
---
Nah aligned mods weigh more than standard parts but have less vats cost
---
I do ZZZ so it drops to the bottom of the list. You're less likely to scrap it that way
---
18th.
---
You cant scrap legionaries.
---
Yeah that's sad though.
---
You need the "plan: prime gatling plasma receiver" and you get it from killing the queen.
---
Because this game is traaaaash dooooood
---
Crushed that no more stacking fountains exploit.
---
You can definitely solo this weeks vault as it is (in my opinion) the easiest to solo. Your level is more then fine for the vault it just depends on the perks you have. 
---
I would highly suggest you have blocker at rank 2 or 3 to help reduce all the melee damage you are going to take. Ensure you have plenty of meds on you as you will frequently get poisoned with a lot of high level mirelurk hunters and mirelurk kings/queens. 
---
Something to keep in mind is enemies are always going to keep spawning in each area and you need to stay focused on only killing what is in your way. It is nice on Novice as you can take all the time you need to learn what you need to do in each area. I would suggest watching a quick guide online to get a visual gist of what you need to do.
---
Also an important note is hopefully you are not just a melee build. You will need guns to kill the ending "boss."
---
Well it's pretty frustrating. They need to fix the fucking bug though.
---
That sounds perfect!
---
Give us a pvp zone with rewards, a few more raids, weapons, events. That's all we need.
---
Well I remember it used to be really buggy. Like if you logged in with power armour
---
you would almost always have a problem. I mean not that I documented every bug or bug
---
fix, but for me it's like night and day. Even if some bugs still persist, it's much better now than
---
it was a year ago.
---
I remember a time before any content for high level players. A time before even the
---
scorchbeast queen(or at the start when I would always freeze during queen fights - now it never
---
freezes during queen fights). You know, before burrows or project paradise. Shit even before
---
we had our own vending machines. Obviously now they have vault raids etc now.
---
I remember back when the stash space was half and before survivalmode/NW/private servers when people could
---
just troll and grief anyone. Now if you turn on pacifist mode or head to a private server with your friends it's very hard for people to troll you - basically impossible.
---
They finally nerfed explosive energy weapons. They buffed certain guns so now they are atleast playable.
---
They fixed the mods system, especially for PA and scout armour so that now you actually know what you are buying. They let you know how many mods you have and how many are left in workbenches. 
---
They allowed more space for camps, which for me is probly where I get most of my enjoyment from, building different camps. And there is finally enough variety for camp items that not every camp looks the same.
---
They have public events which are free to fast travel to, which works wonders for anyone trying to level
---
soloplayer. - just hop into an event for free, tag some mobs and fast travel back to your base after. Not
---
to mention now you don't lose your loot during those events..
---
The servers are more stable in general, it's less laggy. Even loading times for me have improved greatly.
---
I'm certain I missed alot of things, but just off the top of my head those things come to mind. The game
---
itself just feels smooth now as opposed to the early days.
---
I think im gonna try it when i get off work tonight, do you have any suggestions for how much ammo and aid items i should bring with me?
---
im so sorry for your loss. sending love from me and my ingame friends. will be keeping him in our thoughts &lt;3
---
&gt; Cheating in PC NW is being addressed REACTIVELY at the moment 
---
Everything with this game has been addressed reactively, using the bare minimum time and effort, screw the long term consequences.
---
Why do you think it took 2 iterations to get to the duplicate camp location "fix" (and still needs to option to keep trying until you find a free world that you can place your camp), why the mod scrapping bug introduced the bulk junk scrapping bug that lasted for many months etc.
---
I can't even think of a single fix that was fixed proactively. Maybe reworking power armour but you know where that got us...
---
I don't know where you're pulling that from my guy, that was never said there
---
I also like the idea but , 
---
You can do all of them and get all the buffs but only equip 1 or 2 at time.  
---
Or what I want but dont think others want to see is removing the caps from players. Let me get all the perks, let me get all the buffs. I'm level 200 I wanna be superman.
---
Bear arm, sheepsquach stuff and club, shepherds crook, fixer can be obtain only from purveyor and only by characters able to craft those.
---
... say what? Methinks you replied to the wrong thread.
---
I do "x - TSE" ect like x- chest, x - right arm
---
The pfp makes this pure perfection
---
They probably had them all planned out for Wastelanders.....and now have very little to write about
---
Bear Arm, Shepherd's Crook, Sheep Crook, Sheep Staff
---
I got an explosive anti armor weight reduction level 50 pipe gun. Pretty powerful.
---
They don't. It's an Australian ruling for a subset of Australian players.
---
Dont worry i'll remind you that you were wrong pal
---
Dude, let it go. This is comment chain is a literal metaphor for the saying "Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience".
---
Ngl player hopped up on chem and speed demon running from deathclaws would be freaking amazing
---
https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle_Fixer
---
Someone posted this link that gives stats on what each mod really does since the game tells you almost exactly jack shit on that area. Presumably it has other weapons and a lot of other stuff too but I had only used it for my fixer so far so I don't even know my way around there.
---
Same as us, and that thief over there!
---
i¬¥m 100% sure that they knew on Quakecon that they would have to postpone wastelanders.
---
Level of effort is just really low.
---
Also, i dont see 1st as an either or issue.  I see BGS trying to give us what we wanted.  tons of people asked for private instances...BGS decided to implement and charge for it...personally, i dont think its expensive, but others do...that cool.
---
I dont see it as a step to stop fixing bugs.  Its in their best interest to completely fix this game, and have a large fan base.  Why does everyone think BGS wants a quick milking of money and then they get out of town? Bad PR/Bad for future bus.
---
They want a happy fanbase.

Gunning for level 100 then as far past that as I can by Sunday night.  97 now. Almost there.
---
A lot of people here got up in time for Reclamation day, however, *no one came to wake me up.*
---
Ever since I've resigned myself to a life of isolation, living on the highest peak in Appalachia, watching the Vault folk kill one another and doom each other to Armageddon...while I line dance on my porch with the best view of it all!
---
Having the problem with VATS - I couldn‚Äôt lock onto a scorchbeast, and I‚Äôve had some problems with targets of all types nearby. I use mostly VATS so it‚Äôs making me crazy, and sometimes dead.
---
The scrap box has had weird mixed reports. It seems a small portion of users lost their scrap and were remembered by support while most simply had the visual bug but it was frequently reported and covered by reactionaries that everyone was losing all of their scrap.
---
No, that's not how private servers work. I've yet to see any convincing report or proof of preexisting player activity on a private server that isn't a result of being tied to one's character/account. I assume that technically the same server hardware for hosting is used but the worlds are reset. Until someone finds prebuilt public workshops or events in progress on a fresh server, there's 0 evidence.
---
The coverage of the price point was ridiculously skewed. Reactionaries and commentators would often reference it in way that only mentions the year price leading outside observers to think that was the only price or an upfront cost. Ask someone marginally outside the loop how much it costs and you're much more likely to get $100 than $13. (The ESO Plus was just a price-point comparison and to remind people that premium subscriptions for online games aren't unprecedented)
---
&gt; Bethesda absolutely deserves the hate. It's justified. 
---
The question isn't the hate, it's how much do they deserve. I've said it before and I'll say it again; Bethesda's actions barely reach the mild end of scummy things by the video game industry. As you go through the list ask yourself; does Bethesda deserve as much outrage as they got, **comparatively**?

Not even close.
---
No, you're right. Cause Biv, Rose, Grahm, all the scout bots, all the vendors, all the bots at Whitesprings aren't NPCs (non-player characters) at all, are they? smh

This. I might start dropping one stars this way just for fun.

I‚Äôd end up creating a strip club with those fireman poles...
---
A nice skin/cosmetic variety pack or some atoms woulda been nice considering we stuck with it bugs and all üòÇüòÇ
---
You dumped aid?
---
Depending on the gun you bring you will often spend anywhere from 1500-4500 bullets in a run with an automatic build. This seems high but there is no shortage of enemies in the vault and they are all going to be between level 50-90. 
---
For meds I would expect to go through about 30+ stimpacks for your first run especially solo. The poison REALLY hurts especially if you get multiple hunters or kings on you at the same time. Power armor is a must. 
---
Even if you fail a few times you will learn something each time to help you move faster for the next run. The hardest moment will be the reactor room on novice as you will be timed on repair steps so above anything else I would watch a video for that. It will be randomized for your run compared to another players but you can get the gist of what you need to do.
---
Everything I use was obtained from gameplay-- You know, farm legendaries, do events, player vendors, the purveyor. This is commonly referred to as the "gameplay loop." If you just buy the best thing on the market, you skip the gameplay loop and then complain on reddit about how bored you are, or how there is nothing to do.
---
I like to PVP. 9/10 actual PVPers I meet are all using the same stuff, and I manage no less than an even fight without the most broken stuff in the game. PVP has become a game of who has the best stuff when it should be who has the best build, tactics, aim, etc etc. 
---
Now, I may need to humble brag that I am one of the more knowledgeable PVPers out there. I don't have the best stuff, I leverage what I know about game mechanics, builds, and weapons to be able to compete with the Ebay warriors. A lot of the guys I meet with "the best stuff" don't know about crouching vs vats, they don't know about critical hit mechanics vs damage reduction, or crouch canceling melee attacks, or all kinds of shit. And even with all this knowledge of the game, I only equal out to about as good as a guy who just buys something broken. 
---
And that is the fundamental problem this community has. Ignorance. What is the point of learning how to build a character when you can just buy the best stuff? Every other week here I see how ignorant the playerbase is. People complaining about Fallout 1st servers being "old instances" because they don't understand how looting mechanics work. Or all those early hoaxes like the trade stealing exploit. The community should be gathering around discussions about builds, weapon stats, and more. We shouldn't be gathering around discussions about what duped broken items to buy.
---
1012 hours into this game and I still don‚Äôt like it
---
Oh look at you move onto the offensive, I've said my piece, have a good day.
---
Wait... there are legendary shepherds crooks??
---
I updoot your doot.
---
Armour was always a mess with durability calculations, no idea how it works for weapons durability is deducted when you hit enemy, shots missed doesn‚Äôt count towards durability loss, shotguns lose durability per pellet that hits target, explosive effect doubles durability loss.
---
That's such a Bethesda answer. Doing the absolute bare minimum than putting in that little bit of effort to provide content.
---
You think for a month? Aside from one or two things, this'll be the experience for every month until Wastelanders launches.
---
Whatever keeps you from looking inward, right? Hop along now then, go play with the other kiddies and let the adults discuss.
---
Almost 60 hour work week. That‚Äôs a lot of playing!
---
Personal underground bunker 125,000 caps.
---
I've seen one of his videos. All stuff I regularly fight against: legacy explosives, quad teslas, and stealth boys. The stealth boys usually come out after their first death. Perfect counter for me, smart play. My go to move at that point is to fast travel away and end the fight. Return, wait out the item duration, and go in for another kill when they are visible and frustrated.
---
There are some players out there that manage to be really good at PVP without using the broken stuff by simply outplaying the other. They are pretty rare though.
---
There was (and is) a lot of frustration, but at the end of the day, I've always enjoyed the game.
---
It might just be that I have a higher tolerance for imperfection than other gamers, or maybe just enough disposable income that I don't feel I need to measure my gaming dollars in strict "satisfaction per penny" increments. 
---
I think the game needs a lot of work, but it's a mistake (or just dishonest) to throw out all of the good in light of the bad. While I'm not supremely confident BGS can turn things around ala *No Man's Land*, I'm also not ready to declare the game a failure.
---
I've been wondering the same thing. I have a Sniper build, but I sure do seem to be a shitty sniper lol!
---
Yeah, because perish the thought that you have to make a choice in a roleplaying game. 
---
Why not allow all mods to be available at once? Not just for backpacks but also why not for weapons and armour? smh
---
Bugs and crashes bother me more then anything else.
---
Being on the final step for a standard vault 94 run after the strangler heart was dead only to crash from looting creatures is a kick in the pants. It is silly you cannot rejoin your team so long as they have not activated the terminal.
---
You're over thinking it.
---
Power Armor Heavy Weapons is going to be my 2nd character if I ever take the time to start ine.
---
I would recommend using Z. I've dropped weapons on corpses before trying to reload in gunfights.
---
So you are taking the position that understanding things is not something that people should care to do. I disagree.
---
He didn‚Äôt even bring up Outer Worlds. Why are you shitting on the game out of nowhere?
---
Nice, mine was not long ago so I paid legacy price lol
---
Going to link this to the official boards to see if anyone there has seen/heard of this happening.
---
"Surely this 'I'm badass but I'm fair' story will get me loads of karma !"
---
Not only is your spamming of this link annoying, no one cares about a 9 months old ITV.
---
Playing BL3 and TOW.
---
All my slots are filled up, scrip and cap are maxed out. No need to get more XP.
---
I need endgame content, not double XP.
---
This has got to be the most half-arsed anniversary announcement I've ever seen.
---
I agree, here is my heavy gunner build if you are looking for some inspiration https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
It shows how much Bethesda cares for its community. This is the amount of effort they're willing to put in for their first anniversary.
---
Will be exclusively playing NW
---
I'm actually expecting this. Bethesda has a history of delays.
---
That actually WOULD be kind of cool. Different colored hat each year
---
Noticed it for the first time yesterday. It must be a new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù lol!
---
All I heard was "can I still dupe?"
---
Yeah I was doing final tweaks, delete an item, place an item, etc. Then logged in on Tuesday and had to delete 10 floors before I could place anything at all. Must have just been a glitch, tore down quite a bit of camp and rebuilt and now it feels bigger than it was before. Idk.
---
Sadly, this is not a new issue. Just shows how little Bethesda thinks ahead or how much they care for their community. Slightly better than absolute abandonment but this is very much a loveless relationship.
---
Do you think this Bethesda has that level of attention to detail?
---
I have 5.
---
Level 218 - Power armor and heavy weapons build.
---
Level 73 - VATS pistol build. Currently uses pipe pistols and a big iron. I can easily swap it out for a rifle build if I had the perks.
---
Level 60 - Bloodied melee build.
---
The last two are under level 10. Haven't developed them yet.
---
3 characters. 
---
2 around level 130 each. One of them used to be a survival character. 
---
1 is NW only. He is level 17 but has another 20 or so level ups available in adventure. Again, only really use in NW so haven‚Äôt bothered actually leveling him up. He has done zero quests in adventure mode.
---
Plasma weapons are just weird dude. Made the weapon automatic? Vats cost go up!
---
I just saw one sell for 17k and one for 20k this week
---
 Understand the game. Peoples opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.
---

Is that normal?
---
 Its a youtube thing. ;)
---
Drink some corn soup, chew some bubblegum, and maybe decorate a tree with a Grafton Monster.
---
That was the worst one we ever had is all I'm saying lol, no comparison
---
Imagine a game where you had to actually play it for stuff. 
---
*Shudders*
---
I rarely use vats, but man that things got some kick to it üòÇ I would think shooting balls of plasma wouldn't kick harder than shooting .556 but hey I guess they do
---
Okay....
---
You want a blow job as well?
---
Yeah, we get it! No. One. Cares.
---
Were you the level 16 i killed 10 times because youre acting like your hurt lol
---
"Surely this sassy comment will do the same!"
---
I'm good with bj's. ;)
---
I would argue that in a community game the community matters. And in order to understand the game you must therefore understand the community. There are recent incidents of community response changing the outcome of games and movie franchises.
---
Meh, I would have just tested it if I wanted to dupe. More checking to see if adventure mode double xp weekend is going to be unstable and lame, as they aren‚Äôt offering double xp on private servers.
---
You're welcome good luck farming may the rng gods be with you
---
Lol. You have never playtested/beta tested/reported a bug in a game , have you? They literally ask you (at least any company I've seen) how to REPLICATE the problem. If you want to report a bug, you don't just go "hey.. I found a dupe bug." that doesn't fucking help them at ALL. 
---
There is a famous protection paladin in WoW that constantly breaks the game and does crazy shit then sends it to Blizzard with video proof and uploads it to his youtube channel and doesn't get in trouble for it. The only difference is Blizzard actually hotfixes those bugs instead of letting them go.
---
The amount of people that are actually willing to go to these lengths to find bugs are extremely miniscule. You don't actually want to ban these players, who are helping your game..
---
be cool until you scrap that gilded minigun or all of your modified tenderizers. =P
---
I think you should just be able to do something similar to borderlands 3 and flag stuff as junk. then you have to positively identify something as junk and can scrap all junk.
---
Or they could not. This game is already fairly grindy and adding exponentially increasing expenses will only hurt the casual experience. New content should be welcomed, new time/ resource sinks should not.
---
I'm level 315. It's boring. What you're saying is completely different than what OP is talking about. This would be for further specifying a characters background and making them unique. At least that's my take away.
---
It happens always on PC for me. I don't know what the hell Bethesda did, but it is always crashing for months. It wasn't the case during the summer though. My experience is exactly the same as yours. Weird sounds, frozen screen. I have a gtx 1060 and I play on medium graphics. I don't know why the hell it crashes becasue I can run BF5 on ultra with 60+ fps, so it's clearly not on my end.
---
I updooted all of your doots.
---
I‚Äôm starting to be of the opinion that legacy energy weapons have to be nerfed.  It seems like someone has one in every public event I join.  Clearly people are duping them wholesale, others are pulling out their credit cards, and the guns are wildly overpowered.  Even without consideration to pvp, there‚Äôs a major problem when there‚Äôs 2-3 players attending a Scorched Earth and melt the queen five seconds after she lands.  You have to be high end DPS to get any corpse loot, and many players get nothing.
---
Definitely is for me.
---
Got close to 2,000 XP just from Dross Toss!
---
I‚Äôm too old to juggle multiple characters, manage mules, and all that Jazz. 
---
I have two characters. 
---
My main is Level 373. TH Melee build since Level 3. Collect Grogs and Super Sledges. 
---
My secondary is Level 3 and is only used to store caps. She has no camp, no power armor, no nothing, but she does have 25k caps. Lol.
---
I will sometimes get legendary armor but nothing more than a 1 star.
---
Private servers are adventure mode and get double xp.
---
Players are reporting when they get online for the first time that day, and they join a private server, that locations are devoid of enemies and loot. Not all locations and it doesn't happen all the time, but it is happening. That points to the private servers being, in some way, reused servers.
---
And no, Bethesda isn't the worst gaming company doing the scummiest things (I'd argue that they're close though). But to me, it doesn't really matter how bad they are, it matters that they're just bad. A guy who breaks into my house, doesn't hurt anyone, steals my stuff and leaves, isn't as bad as someone that breaks into my house, kills me, steals my stuff and leaves. But they're still both bad.
---
 Certainly but reddit is not the Fallout 76 community. Its a basket of mad kittens and trying to gain understanding by taking that seriously is where all this madness about every little thing Bethesda does comes from. That reverberating with youtube creates completely false narratives, that are then extended by the stupid here.  
---
 Its amusing but dumb.
---
I kind of wish the Double XP was talked about in advance.  I'd contemplate starting a third character, but I really don't have any goals in mind.
---
Im actually loving it, ranking up on the NW
---
2 
---
Level 125 heavy gunner
---
Level 7 melee build( just never got into it)
---
Correct, AP reduction depends per weapon mod. For ballistic weapons, typically res dot sights, aligned barrel/stock, quick magazine, and automatic receivers reduce costs. Energy weapons are much different though. Automatic barrels manage to add to AP cost. Someone already linked you to nukacrypt search, it is a fun place to play around in.
---
Btw, you can reduce AP costs to zero on the right weapons with the right mods with the -25% AP cost legendary. I have both a combat and handmade rifle with a vats cost of zero.
---
All I can say is holy crap you really nailed it.  And without saying "literally" even once :)
---
You can easily solo this week raid on novice with a stealth build. I would suggest using Unarmed weapons if you have high STR so you don't have to waste bullets. 
---
Having 1 or 2 poison resistance armor pieces also helps ALOT if you get spotted by kings or hunters.
---
*some* frustrating moments?
---
For when legendary deathskull radscorps take over the world. It never hurts to be prepared for the apocalypse that happens after the apocalypse.
---
I was thinking some kind of event or something
---
Until they can learn to tell clothing from armor, I'd be very wary of that option.
---
It has been around for quite a while.  I noticed it farther back than this past May - but May is when I took the screenshot I featured in my initial posting.  I am still seeing it now.
---
I dont think they released it yet
---
I have one with two shot and faster fire rate on it. Completely unuseable outside vats. I am looking at the stars if I free aim that thing fully automatic. It does manage to obliterate everything in vats though. No recoil there.
---
NW I'm getting that pink sprinkle PA dammit.
---
Absolutely unfair to say they don't give a fuck.  I'm sure they care...they just have no idea how to fix it.
---
It‚Äôll rotate in, replacing the normal ranger Armour in a couple months I believe
---
It's not available yet.  Chances are they'll tie it to resubscribing to 1st or something like that.
---
Actually there's something super accessible about fo76.  I can very quickly get into what ever type of gameplay I want.  Want to chill?  Do things at my camp.  Want to shoot things?  it's one fast-travel away guaranteed. Want to hang with random strangers?  check map, fast travel.  None of the other games I play let me choose what i want to do, when I want to do it, so easily.  I really thing that's why I keep coming back to FO76, whatever I feel like doing, I can.  Closest alternative would be GTA-V and I didn't like that much (forced me to kill the police at the very start, which I have a  problem with)
---
Sounds about right, I'll just stare at it idly until it's released and hopefully be able to pretend I'm back in the sweet Mojave
---
They're called red and white string lights. I can't tell because I bought them, but they might still be in the shop. Also they might not actually be nuka cola lights (I've been told) but they do project the logo like I said, so that's what I'm using them as.
---
They need to be fixed. Something about explosive and energy damage gives crazy damage. Bethesda tried to remove them from drops, but dupers foiled that.
---
Thank you! They've done a top notch port
---
Thanks for the offer...it was just the culmination of a really lame playtime. The realization that I had the armor and deleted it because I thought it was a bug, all while I was collecting to build that same armor. I haven't even looked at what mods are available because I alt+f4'd out of everything.
---
What do you mean? You've been proven wrong about what this dataminer **actually did** in his efforts to test exploits (plural). I can only assume you were **only** talking about the testing the bug that allowed account/password data to be shown. That bug doesn't require you to change memory values. I know that. I wasn't referring to any specific bug, just the use of CE in **any** of the bugs/exploits he was testing. I think you were given some false information at the start of all this, and just assumed it was **only that specific bug**.
---
He may have only changed memory values when trying to work out the Purveyor exploit (mentioned on [map76.com](https://map76.com)), and not any others, but that is still inviting a ban **if it made a change in his gameplay that could be detected**. 
---
Yes, I know you will be banned by running CE if you do not change CE's exe name, so obviously he had to do that. But right at the start of this conversation **you said** that he didn't do that and this was the reason he was banned (ie. because he wasn't a cheater). In you're own words:
---
"**No, bethesda anticheat is terrible, and they didn't change the name of the program because they didn't modify any memory so they didn't figure there would be an issue**"
---
THAT WAS FALSE INFORMATION.
---
Tbh he may have said reported an exploit himself (on [map76.com](https://map76.com)), and implied this is the reason he got banned. I didn't see that at the time. As the situation played out it became clear that he did not report the exploit himself, but he did test it successfully, more than one time. This is what lead to him being banned.
---
would be impossible because of the collision detection on the foundations itself
---
He is saying a couple quests that result in player buffs but you can't do them all.   
---
Im saying let us do them all and select a limited number of buffs that are active (Option 1)  
---
Remove limitations, let us have all these new buffs in addition to removing special caps so I can have all the perks (Option 2; probably not popular)
---
Excellent, I'll get in touch with my boys and will start grinding for those fluxes.
---
Cool story. 
---
Needed a unicorn.
---
All of you get the updoots
---
Wow I totally forgot the fruit hat. See... goofy shit like that they should bundle with a unique emote or something. A fruit hat with a dance to go with it would actually be entertaining enough to spend 500 atoms on.
---
Agreed except at least it gives that  one star nocturnal leather leg a purpose.  There's a lot of legendaries that no one would ever use that you couldn't even scrap etc.
---
Big bend tunnel, after a run, log off and back on and it resets, you can level up every 10-15 minutes
---
I'm going to delete this post. Please focus on the raid post and not this one. It's very confusing and frustrating.
---
Your friend is the real MVP.
---
I'm not here for the karma (obviously)  ...
---
Yea I‚Äôd just run scorchbeast queen. Doesn‚Äôt take long to get them all.
---
Again what feedback did I receive that you feel is inaccurate? You‚Äôve objected to my summation without giving any specifics.
---
I'd just like foundation pieces that don't have the invisible ramp.
---
It's so fucking annoying when I build a multi level camp and then find I can't walk up the stairs because the adjacent foundation has an invisible ramp stopping me.
---
I like both of those ideas. Having cosmetics seperate from the useable stuff is always helpful.
---
Horrors? The entire journey from level 1 to late 20's, maybe 30? Best? Mischief night, base searching/ building with my bud, and sometimes the random encounters with other players
---
Same one since beta for me
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the explosion adds 100% damage, like old TS/E. The fact that you can obliterate yourself even with Fireproof and a dense torso makes me believe that.  Maybe they never adjusted it on legacy weapons, or the damage adjustments on energy guns is behaving strangely.  You shouldn‚Äôt be able to merk someone with splash damage, but it happens.
---
are u on ps4 if so i have one for sale for 1k caps
---
I can't say I share that view.  
---
Indeed, people asked for private servers. That was the first thing people have asked about since the "live service" announcement because that changes everything. You can make and install mods for your private server, you can have a much higher camp limit on your private server, you can have a much higher stash limit on your private server, this and many more things you can do on your own private server.  
---
What we got is literally just the ability for you to ban strangers from entering the same public server with you. You still have to be always online, you still share all the limits the "live service" puts on you, you still can't use mods, you can only kick everyone from the private server you would play at. And you should also pay for that monthly. A singleplayer game that they've made into an online-only live service to sell you so you could play with strangers and then to sell you the ability to play this new online-only live service game without strangers "because that is what you've been asking for".   
---
As to improving the game. They do not want a quick milking of money. They want to milk the whales constantly, for considerable amounts of time. They do not care how big their b2p player base is, because they've already paid for the game. All they do care about now are payers and whales they can milk. If those two categories keep paying for whatever Bethesda offers them, be it hats, utility items, subscription, anything else, there is no need to fix the game. Fixing the game will not make you pay them more. A new skin for Atom shop will, though.   
---
So when you offer them another $10 bill for not fixing the bugs, not fixing communication, not improving the game, acknowledge that. "I will still pay you money even if you are not going to change anything in your attitude towards the game. I am aware I do encourage the same attitude further on and confirm I will still be paying you if you continue not working on the game, as long as you put more stuff I want in the Atom shop. Sincerely yours,  dj5150reddit."
---
Oh, I know. I mean, how do we Americans go about getting legal action to fix said problem. Hypothetically speaking, because I know it isn't going to happen
---
Yeah that's why I don't like two shot weapons, they're fairly weak, as well as having more recoil in general
---
Remember my post here, Christmas stuff will come on December 24th, it's on a Tuesday. Mark my words.
---
I'm not a toady like some of the blind Bethesda fans but I still am disappointed. How could you not be? Their first anniversary for this game and this is all they could muster?
---
For me, this just shows you how much they care for their fans and their game. It's a loveless relationship.
---
lol. We have the same base location.
---
The quests themselves are what the RP would be is what I'm trying to say. As of right now we're all doing the same thing, which is everything that's available. OP is suggesting we would have to make a decision and add a background to that specific character. It would break the RP aspect of the entire suggestion if you could have one character do them all. From an RP perspective it wouldn't make sense for my "stealth" character to do "leadership" training type quests as a stealth character is more than likely going to be a loner.
---
No it was not
---
Guess I picked a good day to get my teeth drilled. Totally missed it.
---
I'd come visit. lol
---
So what you're saying is you took a PVP workshop and somebody PVPd you?
---
this is an mmo. People are allowed to grief other people. Deal with it.
---
Easy gramms.  Did you take your blood pressure pills today?
---
Mark my words, Christmas items will come December 24th, on a Tuesday.
---
Ohhhhhh. I'm glad you clarified.
---
An interesting and fun idea, I don't think I'm on board with that.
---
Are you a member of Fallout 1st Prime edition?
---
There have been a lot of aholes on lately. I fought a group of 5 and another random that were going around attacking players at train stations and player vendors. Had two guys doing the same thing the night before and killed one of them twice and took his junk. His buddy with the 400 cap bounty ran away after his friend kept dying. There are a lot of people that are bored and can't find anything better to do. Attacking a level 21 guy in a workshop is pretty despicable though. At least pick a fight with people above 50 if you don't want the workshop.
---
1k to 1.5k
---
That‚Äôs still pretty awesome.
---
This is ridiculous how dare they PvP at a workshop. They need a hot fix asap.
---
/s
---
Why are they pushing more and more atom shop content instead of fixing bugs that have been around for 11 months?
---
Sounds like you should stop playing casual, that's  where the worst people are. High elo players are generally much better in Sige. Just like you noted about high lvl players here.
---
Yeah it irritates me but if people want to subscribe that‚Äôs up to them. Not the one to judge people on how they wanna spend their money. 
---
Game is good but I wish they would release the NPC‚Äôs they have been promising. 
---
To me, Ghost Recon: Breakpoint is far more broken than FO76.
---
Funny in an ironic sort of way.  Same thing happened to me at about the same level, and at the same workshop.
---
I was a 17, took the shop, got chased across the map by 3 high levels, repeatedly killing me.
---
You may be surprised by how much steel (and other stuff) you can collect just roaming around.    hit morgantown airport, kill and loot anything that moves and pick up everything that isn't nailed down.  First aid boxes in the hangars usually have stimpacks and disease cures.  While you are there, do the event.  Loot the bodies.  Then drag yourself to the local train station.  Scrap what you need, sell the rest to the bot.  
---
repeat at morgantown high.
---
 Specifics do not matter. The madness that is reddit these days is fed by you assholes trying to get some kind of recognition.
---
 The game is great. I am so tired of defending it, that I'll attack people trying to hurt it at this point. Most believe ... WTF is your point. You don't like the game and want it to fail, is all I get.
---
yeah it is when you can play fo4 instead and get all the stuff from fallout 1st for free and more lmao.
---
As is, endgame is boring after a while. This would add a new twist to our individual characters..permanently, not temporarily like mutations.
---
Haha fucking reddit
---
I would not mind an "Armor Chassis," even if I need to drop it as a furniture first to enter it.
---
Still waiting for the hackers in nuclear winter to be taken care of so I can play again.
---
Nope.  I'm the level 187 who just killed your post.
---
You need realy powerful gear, like legacy gear, a shit load of stimpacks, and aids will be welcome, like chems or that insect repulsive. Also, be sure to have a fully optimized build before entering, and do the mission in Novice mode at first.
---
Interested, hoping someone gives an answer
---
Wait. So you need the fixer plan to get legendaries in the wild? Why am I only learning this now :(
---
They are surprisingly good in vats. Criticals on automatics seem to apply on the first three shots you shoot. Two shot makes that six rounds. It feels like I'm getting six criticals per activation.
---
Quad, Faster Firing and either Junkies or Two Shot would be my dream LAR.
---
Bruh prime?
---
Its been several months since I did that one, so I may not be remembering correctly, but IIRC, there's an object behind door #1 that briefly opens another door.
---
Man I remember reclamation day. I got so drunk the night before I overslept got out of the vault 2 months late, and had a friend come over and help me out. Though I‚Äôve still had a great time exploring the wastes and making some friends
---
It always spawns at the little building others have mentioned in Harper's Ferry, but be warned, high level Super Mutants, Scorch, or Ghouls can spawn there. The Super Mutants can be problematic for lower levels. Ghouls too since their attacks can be so OP.
---
If you have the caps, I'd just slip into the Whitesprings and buy from the black powder shop in the lower level, it's safer. They sell the plans too.
---
Ohhhhh I‚Äôm a dumb dumb.
---
It is a small bug easy to fix - if I miss the first shot, I just toggle concentrated fire to the next body part and then back - then my shots land.  
---
If you don't have concentrated fire you can exit VATS.  And as the others have said wait a beat once you enter VATS - you can kind of see/feel when your gun 'settles' in VATS and if you shoot before that it can trigger this bug.
---
My brother died
---
Give karma
---
Also, curious to know how you get in the lasergrid room in the ski lodge near top of the world. Underneath the robot vendor there
---
yes, add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Thanks, I appreciate it. I‚Äôll log in a post to it to when I can in case people have more questions. I do have other posts with some pics, sadly no video of the looting because I had no reason to be recording my 300th+ queen fight or whatever but a friend of mine are going to do it again tonight and I‚Äôll record my looting in case.
---
That was the same idea I initially had! I think it would be better for the players but probably more complicated to implement. That's why I just nuked the idea and simplified it to 'plant sign, sell house'. xD
---
Last I heard it's still bugged and you can't get the TNT dome key, or you can't get to the keypad to enter the code to open the wall or some such. Needs a patch I guess.
---
Yeah. It's an extra hundred dollars a year and comes with Mega exclusive early access Atom Shop Items and a personalized thank you note from Todd saying thank you for giving us more money even though we make millions in Atom Shop Sales. You should get it. It's off the hook
---
Because the people that create the atom shop items, and the people who work on the atom shop/web page, are different groups with different skill sets, and they don't overlap.  They in some cases are probably not part of the same team, and may even be located in completely different states.
---
So your angry that you feel I‚Äôve attacked the game. But you can‚Äôt identify any attack. Why are you so upset then. You are clearly quite frustrated.
---
Please please please this.
---
There are legendary shepherds hooks. I bought one for scrip from a player vendor that had reduced weight.
---
It's tough to keep caring when Bethesda bones you.
---
Nope your just the level 187 im going to downvote everytime your stories pop up...lol good luck on your posts
---
B25 Fixer would be the best.
---
It would be pretty sweet if they would give us cat companions that let us use CATS to target who they attack.
---
Yes! That drives me insane. Sure, I‚Äôm aiming at a face ten feet from me, and none of the shots hit? Have I joined Cobra Command??
---
I find that 10mm is super common to find, as it drops so frequently from enemies in addition to typical areas you find ammo.
---
if you see a 95% hit chance in vats and you miss 10 shots in a row it's because you landed in the 5% 10 times
---
The Encryptid event drops them. They aren't too difficult to get.
---
When I was a bloodied vats build months a go I had a bloodied ffr vats crit fill and I could almost snap that crit shot
---
&gt; /u/xOutCast76x : Nope your just the level 187 i'm going to downvote everytime your stories pop up..
---
"Surely this witch hunting post will not get removed by the mods ..."
---
I get it. Workshops open you up to PvP so that players can‚Äôt dominate the map and have all the workshops to themselves. 
---
But if all you are doing is initiating PvP so you can kill someone and not then farming the workshop for resources how is this not any different to attacking someone at the camp whilst they are AFK to spark their mutations so you engage in PvP and destroy their camp. 
---
On a side note attacking a player lower than lvl 50 is akin to king hitting a 10 year old at a park who can‚Äôt defend themselves from the bigger kids. And why... Just cause you can!
---
I get what your saying but the fact that a level 150 is chasing a level 21 for a few bits of scrap is stupid.
---
Honestly avoid the workshops like the plague. People like that don't even want the workshop. They do it when they see a low level they can pick on. Don't feed them. Gather scrap around the map instead. Much safer.
---
Right on the spot!
---
At the moment I just play BL3 and TOW.
---
If it's a bug it'll probably get fixed.   Look for VATS accuracy ammo in the atomic shop soon.
---
Vampire PA build
---
Oof did I push your buttons wrong? I just was pointing out how said some people are to be level  150 and to take the time to chase a level 21 for a few bits of scrap.
---
How much for a groggy axe? üò≠üò≠ I wanna display one!
---
I didn‚Äôt read all the replies, a guess maybe a mutation that give a -55% gun accuracy with no ‚Äúclass freak.‚Äù It is just an idea.
---
No. Way. I mean I might be able to shuffle my life savings around
---
Many people are excited about nuking the same area and looting the same boss over and over again for a year now, don't judge.  
---
They seem to be buying fallout 1st too, and sales exceeded expectations, so it seems to be working out for Bethesda too. Everyone is happy.
---
Yeah you could probably make a killing selling the paint for power armour by making the sets and trading them over!
---
&gt; The hardest moment will be the reactor room on novice as you will be timed on repair steps so above anything else I would watch a video for that. It will be randomized for your run compared to another players but you can get the gist of what you need to do.
---
/u/Retromania91 this will probably be the most annoying part mainly because you don't know any of the spawn points for anything. My recommendation is to bring in at least 5 fixed Mainframe Cores (from a silo). If you get the repairs steps for Catalyst Containers or Interlock Keys, collect them all first before putting them into their respective places. If you fail to find enough in the 2-3 minutes you're given for a step, the ones you've collected stay in your inventory and you can use them when you rerun the process.
---
If you put them in as you find them but fail to find enough, the ones you put in will go away forcing you to find more (they do respawn in different places as time goes on though).
---
Lol dont worry ill let everyone know to downvote you ...again good luck on your future post...lol youll need it
---
Thanks for the advice! I just came back after I heard they were revamping by adding humans and was met with stuff like this :/
---
Their backup plan was clearly Fallout 1st.  I‚Äôm personally happy about double experience weekends,but I‚Äôd really prefer they give us some warning a few days in advance.  I just spent a few hours just getting a new character loaded with gear so I can take advantage of the experience bonus. I‚Äôm trying a pure energy rifle build this time.
---
I'll take the advice, thanks. Some people can be real A holes but some high levels guys are on the contrary and just give me stuff for no reason.
---
Well after learning the plans I couldn‚Äôt find it to craft, so nothing. I have to dig more into it, but the only thing I was able to find and apply was the atom cat paint
---
A few tweaks to your strategy will save you some aggravation.  Step 1, approach and take over the workshop in a crouched position (this keeps others from seeing your icon).  Step 2, immediately after taking the workshop, leave.  Step 3, if no one has contested your workshop after 10 minutes, fast travel back while crouched and install your extractors.  Never be at your workshop if you are not crouching.
---
Didn‚Äôt they make a change where you no longer deal any damage to players until PvP has been activated? If so, then attacking you shouldn‚Äôt have done anything unless you attacked back.
---

---
My subscription will end soon and i will leave until wastelanders. I play since BETA but there is no way i can keep going with no content at all . Sure, skins and events are fun and i appreciate it, but we need endgame stuff, besides the vault raids
---
Seems like you might not need my help though with all the negatives on this post alone
---
Mostly right. Not sure about that shrinking player base though. I keep seeing fresh faces.
---
Is it? It's a role playing game. There are no levels, just varying levels of experience. What's "stupid" would be if you were to do the same thing again and expect a different result. Workshops are PVP zones.
---
Not defending it, but I can understand. When no matter what you do, the community is filled with nothing but hate, why bother to do anything?
---
Damn that sucks! The probably told you, you could have them, knowing learning them would amount to nothing! 
---
500iq bgs support play, atom cat paint has been reported in game before so I guess they could afford another coming in!
---
Right, thanks dude. I like workshops due to heir easy farming nature so when I'm met by some sad level 150 it sorta gets me riled up.
---
I believe if you put a rifle stock on a pipe pistol, it then takes advantages of both rifle and pistol cards.
---
Think my damn Pip-Boy is busted, says it's only been a day! Tap Tap Tap.
---
I was looking forward to the vault raids but they disappointed. I've typically got enough friends online to have a full group and we never run them. I'm looking forward to wastelanders but I'm cautiously skeptical that it will also arrive as a dead balloon. If it flops that'll pretty much be the death knell in my opinion. Sorry to be another downer.

I think what s/he is trying to say is that s/he feels you have a biased population sample and the this sub is only a small representation of the FO76 community as a whole.
---
So much hyperbole, so little fucks given.
---
If you want actual hard numbers (sourced from NukaCrypt, which possesses datamined values) using the Combat Rifle as an example:
---
* Aligned Long/Short Barrel: -5% AP Cost 
---
* Aligned Stock: -5% AP Cost
---
* Forceful Stock: -5% AP Cost
---
* Quick Magazine: -5% AP Cost
---
* Swift Magazine: -5% AP Cost
---
* Reflex Sight Dot/Circle: -15% AP Cost 
---
* Automatic/Powerful Automatic/Tweaked Automatic/Focused/Prime Automatic Receiver: -50% AP Cost
---
* Hair Trigger Receiver: -10% AP Cost
---
* Vigorous/Snappy/Steadfast/Hasty .38 Receiver: -5% AP Cost
---
This generally applies to all weapons, with some (shotguns, plasma and laser weapons) being an exception.
---
They don't do it for scrap they do it to PvP. 
---
Blame the removal of survival servers. They have no where else to go for it
---
Alright, I'll take your advice with a pinch of salt. I'm just thinking that if you were walking around wearing power armour and a guy wearing not as much armour or weaponry comes along and starts using a low level workshop just to get a few bits of scrap, this guy could be farming out the power core place.
---
Link it to a door?
---
I guess I should have been more specific. I was asking in terms of technical improvements. Bugs, glitches, etc. How has that improved. Because for me, I see little to no improvement. Yes here's more content, but it's hard to enjoy the content when the game doesn't function properly.
---
A level 150 beating up a level 21 is definitely demonstrating mad skillz. Next up, the 150 can take on the challenge of battling radstags. 
---
Supermutants and the Scorched both  usually have weapons that scrap for steel. At level 21 I‚Äôd suggest the Wade airport as an easy run - you don‚Äôt have to take the workshop, just clear out the supermutants and harvest all the weapons, steel, and adhesive over there and then waddle to the rail station then head over towards the capitol building and environs.
---
If pacifist mode is on, isn‚Äôt PVP only active within the workshop zone? I don‚Äôt think they can PvP you outside the workshop area. It used to be anywhere on the map, but I think they changed it to just the workshop zone area. I could be wrong.
---
Fair enough, but their are plenty of people their level on the server to fight, so why a level 21 (except for the resources part.)
---
Thank you so much for this answer I was going crazy looking for an answer in game and online. I guess I should have expected a answer like this though....Another recycled reward and people think Bethesda is still actively invested in this game. #Bethesda- Disappointed Again!?!
---
I am sure they care very much about not giving a fuck about anything, but they just have no idea how to fix not giving fucks.
---
&gt;/u/xOutCast76x: Lol dont worry ill let everyone know to downvote you .

Brrrr. ....  scary üò±

There‚Äôs an access card not to far away.

Nothing for Thanksgiving? Not even a meat week rehash?
---
Does beg the question why we didn't unlock a combat shotgun skin with the rifle one though guess that's next years reward on private servers only as public servers are bound to be dead.
---
Because people buy that content.
---
Aoe mutations will still trigger and killed the player that has them if they continue to attack long enough, even if PvP doesn't trigger which is what they attempted to do. Most of the people that attack random people usually leave after they realize the aren't going to win in PvP. I initiated PvP because I enjoy killing assholes.
---
NP - I did some testing last night and think I have the info I needed now :)
---
Unfourtunately it's human nature some people just like being jerks. Some do it because they want survival back and they figure if they piss off enough players maybe they'll get it.
---
Some people just want an easy fight. Basically jerks.
---
Lol good one??Not sure what to say to that. You run out stupid sheett to say yet lol dont worry ill be here all day
---
Yup. Xp isn‚Äôt hard to get by any means but it does make it pretty effortless to get the daily challenge.
---
&gt; ill be here all day
---
But your posts won't be.
---
&gt;Not defending it, but I can understand. When no matter what you do, the community is filled with nothing but hate, why bother to do anything? 
---
Because it's their job to. 
---
Especially with customer support. They need to be responsive to their customers and deal with their issue as best as they can and they're doing neither.
---
The thing is that there are a bunch of people, here, youtube etc. that would love nothing more to love Bethesda and this game but they just can't in good conscience do so, myself included.
---
Bethesda just hasn't earned it and that's what they need to do.
---
Sorry I was at work when I posted that. I'm on xbox also. Gamertag: BiggBoi JDT

Neither will your karma lol
---
What a great first person shooter where the first person shooting is bugged.
---
Maybe the 95% is based on their drop rate formula which means 95% equals -110% chance.
---
you on ps4? i got fo1st and we can take workshops together
---
And 90%reduced weight doesn't equal super cheap vats cost.

Same answer, Pal

There is of course no way to prove it is a representative sample or not. But if someone feels it isn‚Äôt then they should have specific points they think are in error.

You'd understand if you ever played pokemon how powerful that missing 5% is.

You spelt atoms wrong

I don‚Äôt think the general feeling is cruel or bitter criticism. I‚Äôd say negative feelings are more frustration and disappointment.
---
Level up in nuclear winter on a fresh character, that way you'll have the levels saved up for whenever you do decide
---
All game design is iterative, so this is pedantry. I understand your point, but find my Jack o'lantern sniper paint is glorious.
---
Agree. Great community. I have been gifted things along the way and I have also given to others. There‚Äôs a lot of hate about the game but I enjoy playing it. Most of my encounters with other vault survivors is positive.
---
You have to finish the missions for Rose
---
Ya, no great loss. I enjoyed the day of excitement I got from it.
---
They talked at Quakecon about developing an on board for new players. Since the settlements are instanced, us high level buyers should be fine
---
Been wanting them to allow Underarmor to be worn with PA, but this is a better idea!
---
I have a few characters that look like me, but I made my bloodied rifleman look ugly as fuck and filthy lol
---
They are all better at doing everything than me, except making soap, cuz you cant make soap in this game.
---
I stopped taking Workshops months ago. Its good when you need scrap, yes, but realistically there are so many ways to collect scrap, and the majority of the time you can get much more, much faster than at a workshop with an extractor. Also keep in mind you can build extractors at your camp, so maybe think about building at a steel/iron node. 
---
Invest in the scrapper perk and break down weapons and armor, some of them can give you quite a bit per weapon. 
---
(I learned this the hard way) Don't carry all your junk with you all the time, so when you are killed, there isn't much loot to be lost. 
---
Google (or reddit search) Mappalachia. It has detailed maps of everything you will need including good farming locations for scrap :)
---
We're in the ash heap region here I think, only 720p.
---
If I do play it‚Äôll prolly be Nuclear Winter
---
Yeah, I know, I hate it... The very first two things I wanted to add was Jangles and Jumbo Mr. Fuzzy lol
---
I've sent a ticket in about it, but unlikely anything will happen.
---
Until Bethesda starts acting right, I'm not buying shit so I don't care what or where it is. Fuck Bethesda.
---
In a large player base it should be impossible to tell new from old. Biggest feedback for this point came from active traders with large friends lists who identify fewer friends online.
---
Can you post a picture of the stuff you could craft???? Or a link to imgur or something?
---
I really wanted to try Berserkers during the day with Nocturnal Armor and use a Nocturnal weapon at night. I tried it for a little while and then just went Junkies lol
---
Never count your chickens before they hatch.
---
Also, what are your sources for your info? I haven't see anything regarding either a remaster or work on the next Fallout that was from a credible source.
---
I stopped playing when fallout1st came out and now  having trouble getting back into it.  Played for like 15 minutes last weekend.
---
I‚Äôm on the fence. I don‚Äôt play fallout 76 because of their shit. If thy continue it I‚Äôll drop them completely
---
People really like asking for things to spend money on here.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôll have to check what plans I have and start rolling 2-3 star melee
---
Currently have 4
---
Slade,  lvl 96 - Enclave Stealth Melee assassin utilizing bloodied melee weapons
---
Havoc, lvl 135 -  BOS Bloodied Power Armor tank build using emergency protocols, nerd rage and other DR perks
---
Raven, lvl 90 - Stealth Sniper with bloodied handmade and fixer
---
Pierce, lvl 76 - Raider Commando, Tank, and junkies build (favorite build)
---
They're probably putting in the same amount of effort that they put into the anniversary post to sort out those issue.
---
Come on man you sure? I dont mind you commenting a few more times so i can call you an idiot again.............lol
---
I can‚Äôt remember exactly I know when I googled shit I got some articles about Todd Howard hinting at a remaster but you are right that could have been a grab at straws.
---
I found this started happening when they did the update that messed up gun fu. Ever since then I wiff 95% shots all the damn time. Very annoying
---
Yeah that pretty much sums up my feelings on it all.
---
Log cabin walls Christmassy rugs would be awesome
---
Hopefully nothing like fallout 76. I‚Äôd like to see a very mature/dark fallout game where choices matter and there is no going back. No respeccing skills or traits, weapons are deadly and everything has weight regardless of difficulty setting. Stuff like that. Fallout 4 had some good things like its gun play and loot but everything else was dumbed down. Since fo76 is an asset flip of fallout 4 the same also stands except they managed to make the world feel even more dumbed down.
---
I recommend just sneaking in and doing the Retake event, as that doesnt show on the Map to everybody else like the Defend event does.
---
His source is Probably his circle of friends that are still crying over the fridge and scrap bot lol
---
I posted a pic of the armor if you wanna look in my recent posts.
---
Here's my guess - don't look for anything substantial until closer to the 23rd which is the four week mark when Fallout 1st came out.  The first batch of renewals will be hitting then and I would expect new items for Fallout 1st members to encourage renewals for those that are month to month.  Perhaps around the time period we'll hear about a patch 15 as well?
---
Vault 96 was supposed to be released in the summer with 94 but was pushed back and is probably being worked on more due to 94 complaints
---
Personally hoping 76 goes for a long while.
---
When they turn into meat piles they sometimes move it's a pain but look around you'll find them.
---
Also if they clip through the groung when they turn into meat piles they generally respawn where you can find them.
---
Either way it requires a little waiting I usually get the missed ones on a second loop. It's a pain but at least you can retrieve most of your loot.
---
Agreed. I want to see them make it possible to be a horrible person in the game without having dlc. Just the choice to become a raider or like start you‚Äôre own faction.
---
This gave me star wars intro chills. Add rolling yellow text, intro music and stars in the background please.
---
Sounds right.

Can confirm there is definitely crooks. I have a vampires swing speed crook I keep just for hearding those dummy cows.
---
Yep. üòÅ
---
You're in a good spot. Near Vault 76 is a nice low level area and you're immune from being nuked.
---
You can actually stealth boy in power armor, that was changed at one point
---
Idk. I‚Äôm hoping hey fix shit but right now it‚Äôs just not for me. Personally it feels really empty and lifeless. I liked the way fo3 and fo4 did things in that aspect.
---
Yea they have legendary crooks. I got 2 ina row at the last purveyor sale.
---
Can you get any weapon AP cost to 0 without the -25% vats cost legendary effect? I don't think that having weapons cost 0 AP was intended considering how other stacking effects like armor penetration work in the game, so I guess that the legendary effect is not working as intended.
---
That is incorrect. Wastelanders is set ONE YEAR after the residents of Vault 76 emerged, meaning 2103. This is stated in the description of the trailer.
---
https://youtu.be/R2XdwS4lcZM
---
That would make my wall of text more appealing. Ha ha.
---
Yeah, but you purportedly created map76 because you care about the community and its growth. Removing all of the community resources because Bethesda caught you doing something you shouldn't be is the epitome of being a petulant child and taking your ball and leaving so no one can play. What you've really proved is that you're just as big a dick as they are.
---
Pacifist.  Find a preacher outfit and extol the virtues of turning the other cheek to the new level 2s exiting the vault.
---
For me, it happens if I trigger VATS while looking down the sights/scope.  Ironic that taking time to aim guarantees a miss.
---
I‚Äôve done it within the past month, so if it‚Äôs not working then that‚Äôs a very recent thing.
---
That makes alot more sense now
---
Its like the camera bug
---
No, it's because it's tied to the server not the character. If it was like the other fallout games, it wouldn't be an issue.
---
Vending was awesome when it dropped. Checking out other Camps and buying random plans you hadn't learnt yet, not even rare ones! Also the Scout quests, I've never started a proper new playthrough, but it would've been cool to have the Scout quests when I first started and just completed them while I progressed. Game's mega!
---
Going by their track record, It most likely won't be beneficial to players . Can't wait to see what weapons suck after this patch.
---
You need to do the process again, I believe. Google a walkthrough, and it should tell you what is reusable and what isn‚Äôt.
---
Yeah, i fire at the same time i hit vats button, hit em every time...goooo PC
---
Lmao brilliant
---
move to whitespring, hordes of ghouls will show up regularly
---
I'm doing Berserkers for the lulz. Planning on wearing Lifesaving armor that is broken, and dying for Revenant to give bonus damage.
---
thought this was going to be about 250DR..
---
Yea I have this happen everyday. They don‚Äôt turn into meat piles, they just drop into the map! I see the blood spatter but no body‚Äôs. Very frustrating. I wish you could equip a card that highlighted dead enemies too! That would be a game changer.
---
Even if you have all the perks you want now all the experience you're gaining afterward will come in handy when they release the legendary perk system.
---
It will  be called Outer Worlds 2. Can you imagine what would happen if a competent company made a game similar to Fallout series.
---
I don't think any of the remaining player base are capable of changing their opinions or losing hope even if Wastlanders are canceled, let alone delayed or released in the same state everything related to fallout 76 has ever been released.
---
Well for starters, one of the dataminers in the group has been unbanned already. If they really were just hacking I don't see why one would get unbanned at all
---
Yea but at least you are able to complete this challenge.
---
And if they had given some commemorative cosmetic are you so sure you wouldn't be complaining about how lazy it was that it was all they gave you?  This is another case Bethesda can't win because no matter what they did people would bitch about it.
---
Unpopular opinion but I didn‚Äôt like outer worlds
---
I'm just guessing here, but I think op might have objected to
---
&gt;this seems to be in-spite of the game not because of it 
---
&gt; It is universally agreed upon
---
&gt; The economy has been greatly damaged by these exploits persisting for the entire year  (*makes it sound as though nothing has been to fight duplication exploits and they have just been allowed to fester, which isn't true*)
---
&gt; Most believe that monetization has peen prioritized over quality content.
---
&gt; One year in the situation is fraught to say the least. A player base that is frustrated and distrustful of the developers priorities. 
---
Basically, if it is not a representative sample then anytime you refer to "most of the playerbase" or to the "playerbase" or "community" as a whole then the resulting data would be flawed and biased.  
---
You are correct that there's no way to prove whether its a representative sample or not.  However, it doesn't look as though these same questions were posed to the r/FO76FilthyCasuals group which splintered off from this one.  Since the Filthy Casuals view this sub as "too toxic" many of them have abandoned it entirely.  So there is a population segment that was missed.
---
And, although it is purely anecdotal evidence which means we really can't draw any hard conclusions, I do personally feel this subreddit only represents a percentage of the entire playerbase.  When the Collectrons were released in the Atomic Shop, this sub blew up with P2W complaints and people claiming that if these were purchased it would be encouraging further "p2w additions" to the atomic shop.  However, the vast majority of camps you encounter in world have a Collectron wandering about.  Therefore either A) This sub is filled with hypocrites who post one thing and then secretly do the exact opposite or B) this sub was sincere but we are such a small percentage of the population that the boycott was negligible
---
? I did not state I have any issue with it nor that I have issues wining? I play decisively with my friends. We are all 76-100. I think you have have miss interpreted my comment. I was simply stating what a premade is. We win quite regularly. "Bar the hackers in some games". I am confused by your comment, my apologies. Are you saying I do not want premades? No...I wouldn't play if I could not play with my friends.  Are you are referring to Wows 40 man BGS? That was a reference to explanation, and is not relevant to NW. I am sorry if my wording was wrong.
---
Well they gave up on Survival rather quickly; a mode that actually matched the Fallout series, for Nuclear Winter to copy the beating-a-dead-horse battle royale fad. It doesn't even make sense by design because you're in a team and Overseer of what exactly, everyone is dead. 
---
Then recently they've forced participation in NW for Holiday items. So my dread of Battle Royale taking away from the base game has begun and will probably worsten with time. That is my biggest disappointment. That, followed by Fallout 1st of course: Obiviously because they are straying from the monetization system we were told it'd have, which is cosmetic only.

All 5. Have destroyed 2 over 50. Right now: main bloodied hvy gunner lvl 218, ex-BoS he is old like me, lvld on sneak rifleman, but hvy guns are in his blood. Pistol packin' momm lvl 91, pistols are so difficult, she loves cats, lives with Murgle and honestly gets played least. Melee trader lvl 141, young and strong he grew up in the Vault, stronger than an ox, keeps his vending machines full, and hopes someday to open a franchise with Graham the super mutant. Sneak rifleman lady lvl110, she is dark as night with dark green hair,  a NW special, she will soon earn me frog legs. Finally, a shotgun Medic junkie lvl 137, addicted to his own supply, who's very charismatic and helps his teammates lvl faster or defend themselves. He lives on the tick spawn indicated for stings and things, calls himself "Tickblood Tim" sells stims and antiseptic CHEAP, and has a "hidden" vending machine with his drug supply price super high, and a fine selection of junkie weapons. Just today I was thinking of deleting one to start a new toon lol, but couldn't choose who to kill.
---
If there were any "surprises" they would have been caught by the dataminers after a previous update.  Beyond that there's nothing they can do other than server side stuff.
---
well, thats just so odd to me I go days without encountering bugs like that.. are you on xbox aswell? ive never had problem witth quest markers. the trick with leaving crafting station is you need to wait until you are completely out of the leaving animation, one of the joysticks will bring you right back in if you use it before you have completely left the workbench
---
Yayyyy double xp, cuz after a year we aren‚Äôt capped and there was no end game leveling design in place anyway.
---
im sneak / vats build, but dem sharp knuckles always save me when im out of ammo

Best: Approaching Mount Blair, then discovering Ash Heap on the way. Was blown away by how vast the world was, desolate yet so wild and colourful too! Silly me couldn't even see over the Savage Divide at that point. Ha!

Worst: Dying in a Fissure and trying to retrieve my loot bag, for ages....
---
There turn to pick.
---
Its very easy to understand, it was the lowest common denominator that Bethesda could ship. Its a broken piece of software that launched broken, is broken, and will continue to be broken. 
---
Bethesda has a venture capital firm $450 million dollars deep in them with a 25% stake in the company. If they didnt immediately make a return for them on their investment that VC firm would leverage the current owners out so fast they wouldnt have time to clear their desks. 
---
Which is also why no more investment of dev time will be devoted to any part of this game that isnt directly related to generating more revenue. Youll never see a fix for this bug, but youll get some cosmetics and a subscription plan for things you should have had on launch. 
---
Thats the beginning and end of it.
---
*If
---
Sounds about right.
---
It has been a fun year. Met many people I now call friends. I've put in over 700 hours. That is a first for me. I remember when I put 100-150 hours into FO4 and my girlfriend thought it was too much.
---
And how the hell do you miss a punch at 95%.... it's a fucking punch!
---
Thanks dude! :)

1- level 150 wit da tse mg42 booling it across Appalachia

---
Don't run the power to the door frame, run it to the power point on the useless switch. Still very hard to get to open from the inside.
---
&gt;are you so sure you wouldn't be complaining about how lazy it was
---
I'm pretty sure you won't believe me but, no I wouldn't have. I know you didn't ask but I am a FO1st subscriber so I do support this game and hope it does well.
---
It's very common for MMOs and the like to have celebrations for anniversaries and whatnot with little MTXs and one off items. BGS decided the way they would celebrate is to flip a bit for double xp and call it a day. It's a bummer, plain and simple.
---
I see why it's not sticked. This is just embarrassing.
---
Its just that there are many other games that do individual aspects of 76 better as a focus. For example if I just wanna turn my brain off and go nuts on a death spree, I can just fire up Warframe and drop in at any popular defense/survival mode and chill with some autogrouped players while wrecking face. Then for going full creative you have games like Minecraft and its many mods. One of 76‚Äôs many problems is that it does a lot of things, but not exactly all that well in regards to other games that take one or two of those things and just run with it. 
---
It just feels like a dollar store experience. Especially since these other games at least have something as basic as *text chat* to help people talk to each other. Much easier to break the ice.
---
Have some patience
---
this actually happens to me almost every time i take the dirt track. always some lvl 150-250 to one hit kill me when i think i‚Äôm in the clear.
---
i guess this kinda thing bugs me because i always go on mic and offer to hand over the workshop in turn for my life + scrap, and even offer health items to show how harmless i am/to be further generous but they never seem to care. 
---
at least i‚Äôm not alone, i guess. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The problem here is that they obviously had some sort of problem with Wastelanders, which made them delay it between 3-6 month (depending on when in Q1 it comes out), and with problems to fix, well, the last thing they want to do is create hype for a product that is currently delayed and possibly broken.
---
So yeah, we want info, but it is currently not good for them to give too much info. Not until they know what will work out and not with their plans.
---
Whitespring ghouls, Charleston capital ghouls, Wes Tek super mutants, queen runs.

---
lol, I should have mentioned its okay to nuke the mirelurk over and over again but it sure would be nice if there was new endgame content!
---
This crime won't go unpunished.
---
I understand the frustration. 
---
That said, I've seen this from basically every online game I've played. I suspect that sometimes they find problems which need to be addressed immediately, and taking down the servers to stop a potential problem from happening could be more important than giving players a few hours to finish what they're doing.

If its not working your hooking it up wrong.

It does, but it isn't possible due to the limitationd of the Creation Engine
---
I am finally going to pass level 200. Sitting at 196 currently.
---
Alright
---
Is it the pink one? Like the Slocum Joe paint in fo4? I don't like NW personally but I would kill for a pink PA paint and would grind like crazy for it.
---
There was no backup that can match Wastelanders, but they're going to work on bug fixes and minor quality of life improvements. No idea what those can be but I keep bugging them about the pet taming system.
---
makes sense, wastelanders needs to bring in people as rich as those in new vegas 
---
i want the whole economy of fo76 to change, now you can just sell everything you find and have 1400 caps a day easily 
---
then all ammo is sold for 1 cap for whatever reason, mini nuke is the same price as a .38, it dont make sense 
---
maybe prices should increase as you level up, stimulates player vendors even more
---
Whats your psn?
---
We have new information. There will en a new NW event in a few weeks. It‚Äôs not a lot, but it is new information.
---
Ive spent the last year pounding my hands into bloody stumps on the door of the vault, begging to be let back in.
---
You contributed nothing to this post
---
Magness1993, you have a group?
---
He didn‚Äôt do it for the scrap the workshop could generate. 
---
He did it for the scrap you might have had **on you**. 
---
You‚Äôd be amazed at how many people run around with hundreds of pounds of junk on them and let themselves get flagged for PvP. 
---
I had a guy a while back pick my bedroom door lock **while I was standing right there**.  Five seconds later, I‚Äôm looting over **400 lbs of junk** from his corpse. 
---
And now with Scrap Boxes?  Expect more PvPers looking for your junk since they don‚Äôt have a stash limit anymore.
---
This deserves 2 x LOLs
---
I haven't played it myself as of yet. My point is basically if some company were to develop a Fallout like game competently, what a great thing that would be. Even the rumor of such a thing may force Bethesda to work a little harder at perfecting Fallout 76. Nothing like competition to to sharpen the quality of a product.
---
Or you know. Be able to play NW while they update adventure mode. Something.
---
Currently I have friends who may do the raids but they aren't always active, thats why I'm looking for people.
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs aware of that. If he hadn‚Äôt said ‚Äònon-legendaries‚Äô then someone would have said the exact same thing you just did.

"To start off there are people who  seem to be genuinely enjoying the game, but this seems to be in-spite of  the game not because of it."
---
I'd say more accurately, enjoy the game because of the game but in spite of the bugs. 
---
"It is universally agreed upon that this game is buggier a year later than most other games are at launch."
---
Universally is not a word that should be used lightly. I'm critical of the game and where it's ended up one year later, but I don't agree that the game is buggier than most other games at launch. I actually don't come across many bugs now and my issues have largely been about performance, lack of in-game reward updates, and monetization. There are still bugs going around but most launch games I play (at least comparable ones that share technical and design contexts) are on par.
---
Other than that, I agree with much of what you've written. It's a shaky situation, but I don't personally expect Wastelanders will be a homerun. I would be content with the upcoming camp improvements and Wastelanders just adding in decent story content with more earnable rewards and maybe a hardmode. From there I think the ultimate success or failure of the game will be heavily dependent on how mods are handled in 2020.
---
Bethesda didn't even remember it was Reclamation Day.
---
Ahh, luckily I dump ally junk into my stash so that's lucky, I've had a few people give me advice on where to get scrap that's less public and therefore less chance of me being killed.
---
Yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. I would love to see someone scare Bethesda into shape. They have gotten far to lazy and greedy.
---
Back when my camp was in wire springs I never got attacked but now I‚Äôm on a acid nod near west tech and I normally see a few Gouls and rats
---
Yeah no shit.
---
Lol ok fair enough, happy cake day
---
If this is supposed to entice me into playing the game, it‚Äôs not working.
---
you on ps4? i can help you if needed
---
Honking your horn for no reason lets people know you're an idiot, won't down vote you, but you're still an idiot.
---
People fall for it every time tho.... certain kinds of people love a good hate-on.
---
It's right under the doormat right in front of the lasers if you're on the quest, lol.
---
You know if you take all the frustrations with the game and set them aside I‚Äôd say that this game honestly kinda made the last year a lot more enjoyable. I haven‚Äôt played a mmo in over 10 years let alone put more then 20 hours into a game. I‚Äôm at 1300 hours now and met a ton of people that I look forward to chatting with when I get on. Made me seek out more games to play with people. The amount of humor that comes from this game amazes me because we can all reference either what state the game used to be in or mechanics that got patched out/changed.  The days of the most glitchy sbq fights and every one blowing them selfs up with tse weapons everywhere, all the duper wars, slap damage and being to just destroy people‚Äôs camps how ever when ever you wanted, meeting players by accident cause you didn‚Äôt know your mic was one whilst slaughtering ghouls. Honestly it baffles me how there is a large mass of players who stay angry spread nothing but deceit for the developers, preach their opinions about it, and stay stubborn about a video game. 
---
Sure it‚Äôs bugged sure there‚Äôs some things I don‚Äôt agree with that Bethesda has done but at the end of the day I still love it I still play it I still have fun. That‚Äôs what matters and I have some good fond memories of the game. So 1 year down I‚Äôd say it was good.
---
I essentially said goodbye, and you couldn't resist one last snap at me could you? You just keep cementing my perspective.
---
That‚Äôs wishful thinking, I‚Äôve almost given up on that with Bethesda.
---
"Scrap All Weapons, Scrap All Armor" would have been clearer imo.
---
This strikes a chord with me, I lost my best gaming friend through this game and it hasn't been the same without her since. üôÅ 
---
I hope you heal soon and find more friends to explore with! üíúüôå
---
I have 1 friend usually active who does r√°ids with me
---
if i see you i'll kill you 
---

---
Great, now you want a class war between diploma graduates vs non grads
---
I hover between 20k up until 28k then I turn off my vendor and go shopping. Usually just to place the cheap things back into my vendor for a higher price lol
---
The event I speak of happened before all that changed...late January/early february.  Not even sure pacifist mode was even a thing then.
---
Like in MMOs with pets
---
Lol. TRUE. WestTek I'm clunking around in PA with my gat and I manage to surprise half the mutants standing around. If I took my stealth build there they'd be half-clipping through the doors trying to bee-line to my location to mob me.
---
The "there's no profit in fixing anything" doesn't work on games that are designed to have an open ended lifespan. It's not an offline game that's sunset on it's last expansion that's only trying to mop up the last few "complete edition" bargain bin sales. Games like that, yeah, there's no profit in fixing anything once you've paid them for it and especially after you've bought all the DLC.
---
With games that are online and are intended to receive episodic updates for an open ended lifespan, especially games that offer premium subscription services, they never stop promoting that game to new customers. They promote the game differently than offline titles though. Games like 76 are usually promoted via player referrals. Their goal is to make their active players feel like the game is worth recommending to new players. The current price of $10-15 helps a lot with that, but they still need the playerbase to feel like the game is being fixed and improved or even with it being cheap they won't be likely to recommend it to anyone. 
---
So they do have a strong incentive to fix and maintain the game. I just think their situation was caused, initially by poor management and then exacerbated by poor sales and an immediate price drop that killed their revenue stream to where they couldn't properly support/develop the game. Hopefully the money they're pulling in with subscriptions is able to rectify that and Wastelanders will be the turn around point for the game. If not the game will die with Wastelanders.
---
Rest in peace, fallen brother.
---
It's interesting to me how many folks apparently didn't even read the subscription page, since it has a FAQ, that explains this very thing. You get to keep it.
---
not too difficult to get. priced at 10-15k... tho in the other hand i got mine the 1st time completing the event. I wonder can i still get it as a reward?...
---
Same to you man. Appreciate the civility.
---
My condolences. What an awesome brother to play with you even though he didn't like the game very much. Maybe it was a bit of love/hate since he loved other Bethesda games? I'll drink a Nukashine in his honor tonight my FO friend.
---
well cement yourself in delusion all you want, just leave me out of it lol. feel free to not respond, this has gone on way longer than needed. you tried to guess my motives and though process and missed the mark, when I told you that you could of just said ‚Äúok‚Äù. im not sure why you insist on trying to tell me what you want me to to think and feel, or what you assume I think. if you cant accept you guessed wrong, I cant change that and I wont bother trying. so im trying to say goodbye as well, no need for a response if you are trying to do the same
---
What a strange question to ask during someone‚Äôs grieve. üò°
---
Ehhh three. Primary is my main obviously. I have a farming char at level 12 and a serial killer at only level 6 but only gets experience now by pvping others.
---
nice astroturfing, Bethesda. We See You.
---
Some of u ppl read way to much into a simple statement meant only give out positive energy...u dont need to accept the gift. ;)
---
Old old old bug they never fixed. You just restart vats on the first miss.
---
They have them in ESO. Would be nice if they did that here as well.
---
West tek
---
Only if you need to respec or are below 100 levels.
---
190, 110, 55, and  2 mules
---
Conspiracy theorist? That's cool too.
---
Because the community isn‚Äôt 100% full of hate and if you always play into your critics you‚Äôll never please your fans
---
On my subjective opinion this: https://youtu.be/dsnWFaf6A4I
---
NP  
---
As you level up, you can change the location.  WS works at higher levels.  Two circuits through there and the exterior of blackwater, and I hit the daily cap limit.
---
The only reason I take workshops now is for the plan it awards.  Take the shop, While it is ‚Äúclaiming, head toward the green line.  As soon as the claim is complete, step out of the zone And move on.  Pacifist on.
---
If I can find a good sniping spot outside of the zone, I sometimes do the CG enemy defend event for another plan, but generally ignore that, too.
---
I usually get a ton of xp farming whitesprings and killing robots over at Wotoga
---
Here's how you can tell they weren't part of a glitch: Bethesda didn't ban you.
---
If they were, you'd already be swept up and tossed out.
---
Dropped out about 6 months ago intending to come back when it was less broken I'm still waiting. . .
---
" Well it's been one year of ups &amp; downs "
---
There were ups? I guess if you count screw"ups" as ups that's technically true.
---
Nuking is still definitely the best way for xp, if you don‚Äôt want to nuke whitespring maybe try Morgantown, has a decent amount of ghouls and even events I‚Äôm the nuke however it has little amounts of legendaries
---
YES! It is peeeeeeeeenk! And it has sprinkles on it. Only need to be lvl 44 for it xP
---
There is also a Slocum Joe's but I find that to be not as impressive. It's got a grey-brown basecode with yellow and pink stripes at the shoulders. But the colours are a bit faded and it has rust in places. That one is unlocked at lvl 29.
---
Mmmmmm I have a Jamaican ginger cake üòã
---
Do we have a double xp weekend coming up?
---
All of your junk are belong to us
---
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!??!?!?!? Okay well now I know what I am doing this weekend. Hopefully my team is willing to carry me like a sack of potatoes because I suck at NW but I NEED THAT PINK PAINT
---
Mambit7 but I‚Äôve had to go offline
---
Currently happening cause it's reclamation day
---
No intention to change your mind. This isn't Failnight, get that shit out of here, and give back real pvp via survival.
---
So what, you want them to release it unfinished and buggy? So people can complain that the whole game is completely broken, and has ruined their life completely and destroyed video games forever?
---
Oh great i have the weekend off can level up my wifes character, cool thanks
---
Its done pretty well. I don't really play it, Im not a battle royal fan but of the battle royals I enjoyed it.
---
Are you seeing the launcher black/grey out as well?
---
It used to be a 30 minute timer.
---
Stick to Morgantown, get a bat and just clear the airport and train yard and u will have plenty of steel. If ur on ps4 i can hook u up with good armor and weapons for free....let me know i will be on tomorrow  all day
---
Sorry to hear that mate just think of the happy memories, there is a amazing community for F76, RIP
---
Gung fu melee build is the best.
---
I'll agree it doesnt necessarily fit the FO universe but I like that it is there and was a free add on. It's nice to play a few rounds and experience pure multiplayer without having to switch to something cartoonish or too much of a twitch shooter. So, yea it doesnt exactly fit, I felt the same as this post at first, then it grew on me as a way to experience something else without switching to another game. Not saying those dedicated games are any worse or better at what they do I just dont mind the different look from a FO perspective.
---
I would like to know because i only wear unyielding combat armor and for the last couple weeks i have been leveling up hard. My armor has yet to break at all,  what's up with that?
---
May he find peace and happiness in his favourite video game. Perhaps one day we'll all join him in his travels.
---
Sorry to hear of your loss. Hope you can remember the good times together in the game(And the bad.) Make sure to post some pictures of your time together. One Love! May peace be with you.
---
I find it to be rewarding although whenever I look up a melee build it's never included.
---
What level do you run gu fu at.
---
As someone who doesnt play BR games very much I did enjoy nuclear winter alot at launch. And technically the ring of fire is a nuclear fire storm closing in from the 100s of nukes launched on earth so it does kinda make since. 
---
Now personally I wish they put in a different minigame like even making the pip boy games competitive wouldve been better imo
---
Too bad i wont get to play saturday and sunday. Rip DXP.
---
I just wish these things would happen when im nit busy.
---
Suggestion make all next week a double xp event in celebration of the recememation day.
---
What about a refrigerator you could climb in and survive? ....but maybe only if you were wearing a fedora.

They flat out lie many times to the community that support them and some people just decide to lie down and take it
---
As a spin-off, don't really care. Much like Fallout Shelter.

So long as it doesn't become a part of the main game, I'm cool with it.

---
Dense BoS Heavy Combat Armor Chest with Polymer Scout limbs. Some folks prefer Leather limbs for extra energy resist &amp; light weight.
---
So it's ok because everyone else is doing it.  Gotcha.
---
Main -395, ALT - 103, ALT, 101, MULE 55 and on my Alt account .. Aid Mule Level 30 and Scrip Mule level 28
---
reality check, theres going to be bugs whether it comes out in March or next week. Maybe there will be less but your fooling yourself if you think it will be bug free come launch.
---
TBH he could have mistook you for a mule account. It's not like we know a legit low level player from a mule account in the few seconds before PVP is initiated.
---
Happy 1 year and not even a special event to celebrate it, just some lousy double xp weekend hooray!
---
Except they haven't done much of the bug fixing, have they?
---
76.
---
Technically about twice that, since I switched platforms after the first 76. But 76. Because the game can't be wrong.
---
I‚Äôd rather them patch shit out as quickly as possible (such a new dupe methods) then waiting for convenient time for their players.
---
Virtual reality pods.  Upon our characters stumbling upon the vault, ZAX lured us into one of the pods along with other vault dwellers.  We then have to constantly fight in a virtual space to repeatedly become overseer to fulfill his algorithms.  Vault 112 had the pods, and the den in good neighbor did as well, I‚Äôm sure other vaults had them too. - this is how I explain it to myself at least üëç.
---
The previous vault residents either all died off of heart attacks in the pods, or ZAX conducted a live experiment with the residents and learned from that error that ‚Äúlive subjects‚Äù don‚Äôt come along often.  Hence the pods.

Bethesda:

***We noticed there was disappointment over when the Nuclear Winter Halloween Challenges ended. They were scheduled to conclude at midnight on November 12, but unlike our other events, this was scheduled to GMT rather than EST. Going forward, we will be crystal clear on the timing for these events so there is no confusion.***
---
***Unfortunately, we are not able to bring these challenges back immediately. However, we are planning to re-enable all of them, including their rewards, in mid-December. Additionally, our next set of themed Challenges is slated to go live just a few days after that. Any Halloween Challenge progress you made during the October event will be preserved and can be used to continue earning rewards when they return next month. So, you‚Äôll have another chance to go get that spooky glow-in-the-dark skeleton outfit. We‚Äôll get all the details together closer to December and provide a full update then.***
---
That wasn't the point and you sound like a gradeschooler right now don't let your annoyance from the game distract you from the argument the author is trying to make.
---
What mirelurk are you talking about
---
Random encounter. There are a few of those.
---
Warming xp... Took me a second.
---
Anywho. A good place to farm xp is Big Bend Tunnel, I start at the west entrance, in the ash heap, and go east. I used to go into all the little side tunnels trying to get every scorched, but now I only really do the big turn off in the middle.
---
Nuclear winter. It's kinda like quadruple xp, since last time you got double overseer exp and then it doubled your adventure exp. Getting 3k adventure exp for a round of NW is awesome.
---
Did you inquire about sadism/masochism?
---
Yeah that would be great. I'm actually really surprised no modders on PC have done this yet. There's a mod for Fallout 4 that does that.
---
The closest thing to helping with this on PC is the Better Inventory mod that lets you filter in your pipboy by item type so if you only want to see armor pieces you can do that, or only left arms, right arms, etc. It comes in handy if you carry two different left arms or something you don't have to dig for them you just tab to the "left arm armor" tab and every other item is hidden.
---
I had no idea you needed the plans, I just had it.  If you're on XB I can craft you some.
---
No, I'm saying you've got to pick your battles. Is that a hill worth dying on or is your time better spent elsewhere?
---
Personally I think Fallout First is overpriced, underbaked, poorly timed and incredibly tone deaf. But I don't really give a shit because it's a relatively small fish in a very scummy pond.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was gonna be bug free. But there‚Äôs a dedicated group of people who just want to shit talk this game and look for every reason to do so. 
---
So wanting to have it come out now is just gonna get people ammunition to talk shit, rage quit, fake rage quit. And complain that ‚Äúthis game is totally broken ‚Äú
---
No one wants that obviously.
---
But the point is that Fo76 has no endgame and needs constantly new content. And now we are at a point where a lot of people have done everything at least twice if not ad nauseum.
---
Since Beth is not communicating with us, we have no clue where we stand.
---
And if you are being honest, if a game has no endgame and you've played it through, it looses it's appeal to be played. Add to this all the age old bugs and regressions, together with the missing cheat protection, make those who love the series more than mad at the shortsightedness of not having a backup plan.
---
If you're on PC there's a mod for that already. It's on nexus mods. Lot of people using it, no issues.
---
Currently no, but we cant say for sure they aren't working on it. Dont get me wrong I'm doubting it myself, but hope for the best prepare for the worst as my pappy always said.
---
If you happen to be on PC the Better Inventory mod does that.
---
So sorry for your loss, I'm going to give out free supplies to newbies in his name
---
It‚Äôs not in most builds because of the fucky targeting issues of melee in VATS
---
I have a bunker glitched into the side of a mountain
---
I updooteth your dooths
---
Remember horse armor? Bethesda single handedly caused the majority of those other travesties listed by setting into motion a series of events that modern gaming can never recover from. Never forget. 
---
Just kidding, well kind of.
---
Doot doot
---
I don't care too much about this kind of thing, but I am definitely **very** surprised that double XP is all they've done. A generic repeat event we've seen many times before, that does nothing more than tweak some numbers in their code. This is to my mind the second worst thing they could have done (nothing at all would be the worst). 
---
In the end there are four big reasons why this feels to me like they really don't give a shi, and that's not the kind of speculating I normally engage in:  
---
1. Basically every other game like this I've played celebrates this day, it's your *birthday* for crying out loud
---
2. Celebration is good for the fans **and** the employees who are working on the game, sharing good vibes between communities and respecting the creation of a world
---
3. Something unique, generous, or just really fun would have been a nice gesture after the recent delay of Wastelanders and the FO1st stink
---
4. It could have provided something good for games journalists to talk about, because it's been all negative recently
---
Yea, I'm just baffled. Why, Bethesda? Why just a simplistic ITV and a generic double XP event?
---
Ah it was just for a bit of fun lol
---
She looks about as fresh as Paladin Taggerdy! But she's always been in the game.
---
Ohhh noooooo! Sad ... soz.
---
[They did](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3LwSVbjz8rWVRirlbnQxdS/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-celebrate-reclamation-day-with-double-xp)
---
Dont make a medic support build. I tooke inspiration from Captain noob and made one and theyre kinda useless cause nothing is that hard in game atm
---
I have 3 pure builds. Melee, heavy weapons, and stealth commando. All 3 have very nice perks to using them but medic was just useless and regret dumping 70 levels of time into it
---
Idk if it's been mentioned yet, but luck rating factors in I believe. My character has a stupid high luck and I hit nearly every time even if I'm not in the 80s or 90s. It's a multiplier I believe
---
Ahh ok, ive obviously skipped way past that mission lol
---
Is it inline with most fallouts?  No.
---
Do I play it?  No.
---
Do i care if it's a game mode that others like?  No, why would I and why would you.
---
You will wake up to find out it's only been 1 year since the bombs fell and you've been replaying the same simulation over and over and over to prepare you for dealing with life outside the vault. You will wake up to help prevent the events that were simulated to you.
---
Lol that would be an epic plot twist but the chances of it are less than zero.
---
This hurts my heart to hear. So sorry for your loss man.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss man‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Pushing the boundaries is fun!
---
Yeah she‚Äôs been around forever as one of the random event spawns. I have photo mode pictures taken with her from many months ago (as well as the dead trick or treaters found in the same places).
---
There is a perk in perception that allows you to target certain body parts
---
On xbox tap the right stick to select. You have to have concentrated fire perk equipped though.
---
That's the one issue I have I think it's due to the fact that it prioritizes the closest one in the direction your character is facing opposed to the one closest to you.
---
This. Solo I get 5 to 7 runs in before it clears.
---
I'd argue that Nuclear Winter is the most immersive Fallout experience we've had to date.
---
In the past, we got to read terminal entries in vault after vault, learning secondhand how Vault-Tec used ordinary people as subjects in their highly immoral Vault experiments.
---
In Vault 51, we get to BE those experimental subjects and experience what it was like for the unfortunate Vault residents who were not in a control vault.
---
I am such a huge dick for not continuing to develop and maintain a free tool for you. Just a big giant assholes for not spending a lot of money on bandwidth every month  and spending time maintaing the server for you. You are right. Everyone should spend all of their time and money providing free stuff for you, otherwise they are just being childish. 
---
What they caught me doing is tracking down exploits that they have proven time and time again to be incapable of doing on their own. And you know what, I did that for free too. And my reward for that was being banned and being labeled as a cheater. 
---
So yeah, I am taking both of my balls, and leaving. And no, you cannot play with them.
---
Same here, tried it on my melee guy awhile back and never turned back. I don‚Äôt get any use past one rank level though, I just use it for the fast targeting effect and typically one hit kill things anyway. Great for ghoul mobs and anywhere mole rats turn up.
---
You're playing on xbox buddy.... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The next fallout will be wastelanders. Fallout 5 will be released in like 2024.
---
Double XP is something they do randomly when the number of people logging in starts to drop. It's literally a 'nothing special' event and it just feels like someone went to work, sat down, and someone else said, "hey happy Reclamation Day" and they went into a panic trying to quickly whip something up. 
---
"oh hey I know. Double XP. Whew, that was a close one, almost totally forgot what today was."
---
Perhaps
---
"It's just Beth" isn't an excuse for having a terribly built game and a broken engine. All that means is that you should expect to be disappointed by anything Bethesda makes.
---
Grr, its my wood scraps.
---
I think the issue with cheaters is that as fast as bethesda can ban people, the same people can get a $2 account and do it again, there isnt a shortage of dirt cheap accounts floating around from all the people who quit or had their accounts hacked ect..
---
I have porn for this and it doesn‚Äôt frustrate me like fi76 does, so different strokes and all.
---
Sorry to lose someone from the community and especially that you've lost a friend. 
---
He obviously enjoyed your company so appreciate that! We can all rampage across Appalachia, crossing paths whenever.
---
But you made a dear friend. It's very kind of you speak in memoriam. He had a good friend in you, sir.
---
That's what I have missing then I wondered how on F04 it was almost a given, its amazing how much I rely on it,thanks for the tip üòÉüòÉüëçüëç
---
The horse armor was not the first microtransaction in gaming, just the first to bring public attention to it.
---
He's one of many, I don't watch him, I don't know who he is. But sadly he has got a point there. Fallout 4 was good, Fallout 76 started bad and is even able to get worse.
---
I wish I was good at NW... I'm shit
---
The feedback I got was universal, happy to have other opinions. As for your first point the bugs are a part of the game.
---
I make six figures, have bought collector editions, own every dlc from morrowind thru fallout 4, and have dropped hundreds of more dollars on purchases or donations related to my favorite games. I was expecting to do the same for Fallout 76 when it got less buggy, never really happened.
---
I do not like paying for being scammed during my gameplay. If they left game mechanics alone instead of grind balancing them to force me to do something I would have bought lots of cosmetics. Maybe not as many since I think their prices are too high per item (I measure relative value too much I guess).
---
That said I plan to give Fallout 76 another chance at some point, not another dollar, but I figure I want to see the rest of the game world I already paid for before they hide it entirely behind paywalls.
---
Sweet I just need to either obtain or activate that perk then üëçüëçüëçüòÉ
---
Hey look we have an unintelligent Todd Howard sheeple here!
---
Also, NW has lore explaining how it fits into the Fallout universe, how WE (the Fallout 76 players) caused the ring of fire, how it takes place AFTER Reclamation Day, and how it possibly ties into the virtual reality simulation mentioned in one of the Enclave bunker terminal entries.
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs a tank at the munitions factory.
---
I think you're the only nut here lmao
---
A cheater would not call the Bethesda support and tell them that they cheat. he was doing the job that people at Bethesda do while being paid, for free.
---
Would make floors much more useful as it would be needed to roof off the basement. I like this idea it would make a nice area considering some players have very large foundations.
---
I'm glad you were able to repeat that, and I'm glad we're buddies. Did you have a point?
---
Ok, if that's true, they are liars.  I still love the game and dont mind paying for 1st.
---
Ha I already quit so I'd say not well
---
Where did you find that?
---
Not a trader but yeah, my friends list of 30ish people who a while back would almost all be online are narrowed to the same 4 or 5 people who play now, when an update drops a few more will be online for a few days, then drop off again, I myself dont play nearly as much as I was playing, maybe every few days for a couple hours now instead of every day for the whole afternoon and evening
---
I think this is true obviously Fallout76 is flawed theres no denying that but we're all here because we still enjoy it (hopefully), just think about Anthem at the very least Bethesda is doing something now is the constant atomic ship updates and fallout first the right direction no...no they aren't but its proof they haven't given up.
---
They literally forgot it was Reclamation Day, and Double XP was Bethesda's version of rushing out to Walmart during lunch to buy flowers and a card.
---
It's the "ooops I forgot to get a present" present.
---
Wasnt that only in the Beta?
---
I'm working on starting up a YouTube channel to teach the skills necessary to succeed in NW.
---
True I mostly use it at Whitesprings/The Burrows. I even tried using grim reapers sprint although that turned out to not be great.
---
You're talking about cheating while playing on Xbox. The cheating issues are only witH PC which you don't play on so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So, what are you saying exactly? That you should hardly ever see new players?
---
I'd go even further than that. Some bugs they've had to re-retroactively fix. Not sure how many exploits they've patched, unpatched, hot fixed, then broke again...
---
\&gt;  Change my mind. 
---
No, just let those that like play it. You have no disadvantage.
---
Also prevents power attacks in vats, which is why I don‚Äôt bother, lol
---
I regularly get them and already know the plan. I got two plans in the last 4 times I've done it.
---
Disagree. The whole game is a spinoff. That mode is a lot of fun and retains a lot of what makes fallout fallout. The lore you unlock in vault 51 is great as well!
---
I could have done without the "change my mind" meme lol.  I mean you started out respectfully, and its a valis point to me, but I honestly don't care much about it myself.  I mean I dont do battle royales so idk how much water my opinion holds, but I think 76 more of a spinoff to me.  There some aspects of the scorch I like (mostly biased coz I love when things can get mutated from things like the virus from re or the flood from halo and ect) but the scorch plot just feels shoe horned in to me. Digressed a bit, but is it the random ring of fire itself or the mode itself?   Would it have been better if they wete gonna do a BR mode that they should at least have tried to add a fallout flair to it if possible?  Idk.
---
  The only thing I like about BR mode is the option to try and start anywhere on map, tho it would be better if it was random location, and in survival mode, instead of everyone starting at the same spot every session, then it would (maybe) encourage players to be more adaptive and work with what they have, and it wouldn't always be those few guys hogging the best places/resources each time.   I know they could make a b line toward it, but at least therell be a somewhat better chance for others....maybe.
---
In reality, you have a 5% chance to miss per shot, every shot.
---
Wastelanders was supposed to be here by now which was "fallout 1 year later"
---
I haven't launched a nuke but I did notice that the mole miners during uranium fever failed to spawn legendary. They were just mole miner supervisors :/
---
On a constant basis? No. Be real.
---
I think the point you‚Äôre making is sound. That by directing all the hate and attention towards one actor it actually undermines the larger issue of it being an industry wide problem. And by making BGS the lighting rod for that criticism, it lets rest go about committing the same bad practices, business as usual without so much as a slap on the wrist as far as community outrage goes.
---
You misread. I said that I love playing NW on Xbox, but if I had to deal with the extensive cheating that PC players deal with, I wouldn't play NW.
---
I never find myself using power attacks so for me it's worth the trade off.
---
I get where everyone is coming from about this, but honestly, I'm just hoping they're so goddamned busy making Wastelanders amazing that they just did something small like this for the anniversary.
---
Lesson 1: git gud
---
I agree. It‚Äôs definitely not buggier for me.
---
I‚Äôve done it more times than I can remember. Oh sweet they‚Äôve got that assorted lights set of plans.....I go to learn on and I‚Äôve got 10 of them
---
There was a time when we could actually build freely inside of houses, that was much more fun than watching some glitchbuilder forcing Beth to restrict building again.
---
There's a tank right outside the travel point for Huntersville and then an APC, maybe two, on the north end of town.
---
Theres a tank near the Junk spot west of that food packing workshop.
---
No. losing 10 bullets the the ground isn't something I doubt pay attention to.
---
Idk, quakecon? E3? In one show mr Howard talked about starfield as next AAA rpg, followed by tes6
---
Gt listerfeign here.  Send invite
---
I hope the same!! I do wish they made it a bigger event, but I‚Äôm happy for the double XP because I‚Äôm trying to level up to switch up my build and stuff
---
I never saw anything about a new fallout at all tho?? There‚Äôs a dlc coming to 76 called wastelands but I haven‚Äôt seen anything about a new game. Could you link me that?
---
Leave the world then rejoin.  Your private session instance  stays active for a little while even when unoccupied.  They'll be back when you return.  Rinse.  Repeat.
---
No matter what Bethesda does, guaranteed that this sub will be filled with posts proclaiming it the worst thing ever to happen in the history of video games.
---
I was playing with a new guy last week who was all about getting his char super chonk and I‚Äôm here for it!
---
Just reread the OP.  Did everyone leave?
---
üëçüèª
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
Supersledge power attack too stronk, lol
---
I know it wasn't first. It was just the weirdest, most unnecessary and unnecessarily expensive one. I'm just saying the fact that Bethesda eventually ended up here shouldn't be entirely surprising. The entire industry got here and are now or soon will be selling pointless cosmetics and other microtransactions that dwarf the original purchase price of the game itself. 
---
I'm just glad the gaming industry creating a huge backlog of games that I can slowly work my way through if the industry gets bad enough that I don't want to play any new games in the future.
---
I hope the same but in all actual reality I bet they are mainly focusing on what other cut content from the game can be put into the atomic shop for money

I¬†often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle... and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.

What makes you think that? Is it statated anywhere? Is my 21 luck too low?
---
Doh!
---
Reclaiming what though? Everything just re-spawns, sometimes I'm unable to maintain my suspension of disbelief.
---
Some outfits definitely look more chunky than others.
---
APC at Westek
---
Tank at BOS base near Glass Caverns
---
I have yet to use a two handed build due to the fact that the only legendary I've found is a stalkers super sledge (9 of them) so I'll have to take your word.
---
Bethesda games having bugs are kind of amusing in a single payer game where you can enter console commands to fix issues. In a multiplayer game they're unacceptable.
---
The Atomic Shop as everything is on a repeat anyway, just need to wait.
---
Which I think is ok so long as you can‚Äôt clip through the foundation blocks and fall into the void / sunken place. They‚Äôd have to remove the ‚Äústickiness‚Äù of foundations though.
---
Why does the left pop vinyl say Fallout 67?
---
So somebody with access to the dev room either planted it on her body and OP just happened to get lucky and pick it up, or this whole thing is just flat out bullshit.
---
There are many APC, Tank and Vertibird locations.  Anything specific you are looking for ?
---
Yeah ofc, that‚Äôs what I meant: wastelanders will be the closest thing to a new fallout for a cpl of years ! Sorry for the confusion.
---
Ohhh ok I see what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm waiting for it and then gonna try going back to 76

Thanks guys. Wonderful community!

Is this what late stage delusion looks like? lol

What's this Outer World? Everyone seems to be saying good things about it. Is it as good as they say?

just looking for the opposite opinion m8

thats about right.

A little bit of flatland. And no scorch beasts nearby
---
One final salute for a fallen soldier
---
Is it actually any good?  
---
I used to play cod way back in the day but my last one was Black OPS I think, they started to feel less like a war game and more like an over the top action movie where the worlds rests on 1 man doing crazy stunts.  
---
Have they gone back to the "your just a soldier fighting in part of something much bigger than you" or is it still "jet ski jump over a battleship while nukes fly and you have to shoot them from space with grappling hooks"?
---
Yeah, we gave up but will try tomorrow night so I was trying to figure out if it works or not
---
Im only disappointed i cant play this week!
---
i had no idea
---
I read it here but i'm skeptical as well.
---
Why are people still subscribing to Fallout 1st then? , surely with all the negative media Bethedsa would pull the plug unless they feel they have enough subscribers and that's why I think they may keep it, I'm frustrated but want to wait for Wastwlanders before I disavow FO76 and FO 1st
---
You missed the entire point of the thread. Its not "get it out now", its they should have had a back up plan in this case.
---
 If you like a directed, CoD style RPG, its for you. I don't.
---
They are working on wastelanders...
---
At level 190. Shooting for 200. Working on lvl 1 weight reduction armor sets to trade on reddit
---
Why? So you could bitch about that too?
---
 Us smart people use the word stupid. Its shorter and easier to spell. ;)
---
I felt the same about power attacks until I acquired an instigating, 40% power attack damage power fist. It is a beautiful thing.
---
I normally don‚Äôt have many issues in vats, but I unloaded a full magazine into a scorch East‚Äôs head yesterday at 95% and missed every one with my handmade.
---
I run from level 1 to level 3. Level 1 is good enough if you struggle with agility points. Level 3 is just overpowered. 
---
I like it because you just butcher big groups of enemies in Burrows or West tek.
---
Just using my pleb hammer to level, lol

No legendary in my hands, no-sir

Also, only 1* cards from each 2h perk card, because screw wasting 6 card points for +30% when I get that much off 1star cards &lt;.&lt;

Alright tomorrow I guess I'll try to solo it and then once everything is spawned I'll have him join, ty

With a large player base you‚Äôd expect to see new names all the time since only a tiny fraction can be on any one server at any one time.
---
I've been delivering pumpkins to one robot, and honey to another robot. That's all there is to do anymore. The daily challenges are getting boring too. It's almost the same thing every day.
---
Happened to me today as well. Three crowned bosses, no legos.
---
So far, the campaign feels grittier ( I'm about 7 missions in ).  It has some messed up moments too.  The Multiplayer is fun, TTK is really low, which I like because  I've always enjoyed hardcore. Co-op is a mixed bag.  It's fun to a point.  But the enemy spawns are insane and pretty unfair, probably  my least favorite  part of the game.  Also the challenges  ate not tracking properly  right now.  I'm playing on ps4 but I hear the xb1 version is not in great shape.
---
I know what you mean. I find it extremely useful when I want to clear crowded locations like West tek or golf club. I play on ps4. When you use mouse and keyboard it might be not so useful. I'm not sure about that.
---
And we have little insight of what it will look like. I‚Äôd like to hope for the best but they haven‚Äôt even shared any more sneak peaks of new creatures or anything.
---
At least I will get the pink donut PA paint this weekend. It will not be pain taking slow.

I want to build a community of traders that produce chems and medicine for other players.

Getting a good legendary for all the new guns, learn all the plans, get the regional outfits, and to complete my grand quest I must aquire all 5 of the super uber rare fasnact masks.

Personally I see no point in putting it above 1 due to the already ludicrous amounts of damage melee characters pump out.

Bring back Dogmeat!!

Yeah that would definitely change the way you play the game.

Oh well. Might as well go back to older games in defiance of current practices

Generally surface level stuff that doesn't directly confront the underlying problems, lengthy diatribes about tax avoidance are very likely not to catch on regardless of how impactful and important they actually are. Marketplace of Free Ideas and all that. 
---
Usually the subject of the outrage at least alludes to the underlying problems though. The outrage at Blizzard over Blitzchung speaks to a larger problem of media companies pandering to China to make money. The "surprise mechanics" outrage spoke to companies trying to sell gambling and dodge laws regulating it. The outrage over the Epic games store spoke to market manipulation by Tencent. But the outrage at Bethesda speaks to... nothing really. One of the last holdouts of industry integrity getting money grubby? That's hardly anything new and the attention could definitely be better spent elsewhere.
---
At the very least I have seen some of the more nuanced discussions about Fallout First talk about shareholder influence and corporate structure. "Gamers rise up and destroy the stock market" is a hard sell, but hopefully it'll catch on one of these days.
---
The length of the ‚Äúbug round up posts‚Äù says there objectively is a large number of bugs.
---
Fuck I hope so
---
1. NW had a very lore friendly reason behind why the mode and the ring of fire exists. It is another Vault experiment and the ring appears due to the constant nuking done by us.
---
2. It is actually one of the few relatively bug free and balanced part of Fallout 76 (the other being the Atom Shop)
---
3. It mixes PvP and PvE very well, something that most BR games don't do at all.
---
4. The cosmetic rewards are very good and better to earn them than have it all in the atom shop.
---
5. If Bethesda manages to get a good anti-cheat on, NW will likeky be the part of Fallout 76 that actually survives into the future, like Fortnite's BR mode.
---
Last  time the game had a meta, they shat on it. TSE, Cav, Sent, and I believe Assassin was nerfed on armor, so I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Vats, like everything in this game, is really inconsistent.
---
Do you guys have NO idea what the actual Vault 51 lore is? It is right there in the game.
---
Agreed - but there is a point here that the effort is likely needed with that specifically being delayed. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it should have been crazy effort but allowing one of the art team members a morning or two to retexture a few objects ‚Äúfor the day‚Äù would have gone a lonnnngggg way. 
---
There‚Äôs a nominal amount of objects that could have been used that wouldn‚Äôt have needed anything more then a new diffuse texture. 
---
Anyways - I semi-patiently await Wastelanders *(again)* with great fervour. 
---
Sounds like you are too!
---
it‚Äôs because of that I think because of that - they aren‚Äôt doing themselves many favours by letting this anniversary slip by *(in this manner)* which just heaps more pressure onto the now 2020 release.
---
Right. One year of patience wasn't enough.
---
It's not lol idk why people hate bloody build so much that they have to spread false rumors about it... People been spreading that same rumor since the got nerfed in January lol
---
*Look of confusion*
---
You don't know how impossible that would be with the engine.  This is the problem with many suggestions.  No one considers how difficult it would be to actually implement, just how cool it would be if it was. 
---
 The only possible way to do this would be a door with a loading screen.
---
You are a consumer on a message board for a product created by a for-profit company. 
---
Yeah the scaling on some is pretty intense compared to others
---
How about a button that plays the game for you while you enjoy your new Fallout Ultra Mega Omega 1st subscription at just $599/month?
---
Did you learn that, for whatever reason, people downvote you on this sub just for asking questions?
---
I mean... we had a pretty good sneak peek a few weeks ago. Seeing as it is probably still 3-4 months away I am ok with waiting to see any more.
---
Always want to simmer, never a rolling boil
---
Yep.üòï
---
Happy Cake Day ! üòâ
---
Seems weird, why would you tell "Hey my weapons are about to be nerfed so i sell them to you, deal ?"
---
They talked about the future nw and offered to fix the Halloween reward thing.
---
2020? Lmfao there's been a mod out for months that did it perfectly. Slightly convinced fo76 has an anemic dev team
---
I totally love it, even if my aim is a bit off with power fists.
---
I spend a lot of time collecting things to stock my store with. I have a few things that sell really well. The mounted bug plans are popular so I go do that repeatable a lot. Some people just don‚Äôt want to do it over and over I guess. They‚Äôd rather just buy it. I also do the daily and weekly challenges for atoms and whatever events I come across. I also try to drain all 1400 vendor caps available per day when possible. I stay busy.
---
Also interested in build suggestions for an NPC. Always treated charisma as a dump stat before but thinking I may boost it a bit this time and try to as social a character as possible but generally balanced towards combat otherwise.
---
I just try and enjoy the game and not hype up something like the anniversary. Original plan was for wastelanders to be released with the anniversary. I‚Äôm not going to expect them to create something new for the anniversary and delay wastelanders further. I‚Äôm just waiting for wastelanders, don‚Äôt need extra skins in the atomic shop that I probably won‚Äôt but anyway.
---
Clown outfit is probably the best haha
---
Doesn't the community know what the community feels, thinks and is? 
---
So we really need someone to like and prod us and then tell us what we know?
---
For me to be satisfied I just need 2 things.  Just 2 things.
---
1. Improve the fucking performance.  It's just as awful and maybe even worse than launch.  Bugs too.
---
2.  Stop fucking nickle and dimeing me on microtransactions.  Stop pricing everything twice what it should be and adding more and more pay to win bullshit.
---
Compared to any other game out there it's really, really low. Noone wants to risk a hardware ban unless playing from a cafee in SK
---
You‚Äôre in for a long grind learning radium rifle mods. It seems to unlock mods less often than the handmade. I am leveling up a lower level character this weekend w double xp. Otherwise, I do events and go shopping with my characters that are already leveled up.
---
I don‚Äôt pay attention but I did learn there are people that refuse to accept that people who care about the game may be frustrated or disappointed.
---
Damn, I‚Äôm so sorry about your loss dude, he sounds like a great guy. RIP.
---
A lot of this is true, but the tone of your post seems to be that people are giving Bethesda *too much* shit, which I wholly disagree with.
---
Many of the things you listed have exactly nothing to do with the people playing their games. While that doesn't make it any less bad (all of those instances are actually arguably worse than just releasing a broken game), it does mean it's not something many people will actually interact with or even be aware of.
---
Fallout 76 is garbage. People are angry because not only is it garbage, but it is *still* garbage a year later, and now they're asking for more money without fixing the issues that are already there.
---
Being angry about that, being *extremely* angry about that, is wholly valid, regardless of how terrible the industry is as a whole.
---
I hope not I just got a \*\*\* bloodied meathook and \*\*\* bloodied pipe revolver I was going to try out.  they nerfed it litterally 8 hours after I got them? ugh.
---
Remember sitting on each others bags when someone died and coming back to your basic little shack to a bag of junk and aid from a unknown stranger? Those were good days.
---
I remember showing newcomers white springs for their first time that was alot of fun.
---
21? Sure... You have every item giving you +1? That's the only possible way
---
Yeah, nodded off and moved my camp on accident.
---
*Nerf nerf nerf*
---
Maybe we should buff something
---
*looks at things like mutants, damage while aiming etc...*
---
Nah, they‚Äôre good. Let‚Äôs beef up enemy health and armor while we‚Äôre at it
---
You are legion.
---
I never heard what it was today.
---
Yes, bc Bethesda‚Äôs word is worth a damn anymore. 
---
Dear Bethesda. You‚Äôre liars and have proven yourself to be nothing more.
---
This is pretty good, and extra points for not showing any individual bias. I've had bugs, though I don't feel like they've been as bad as what other people have experienced. Sometimes I'm bored, so I play other things, but this game is still in my daily rotation. I definitely don't hate the game.
---
I would recommend everyone temper their expectations for Wastelanders. I'm skeptical it will add anything more than 2 factions that can give you quests, and that there will be 8-10 quests for each faction. When we get done with that, back to square one. I certainly hope I'm wrong, and that we get a ton of fully fleshed out characters who all provide quests on top of the main Wastelanders quest line. I am excited about the possibility of existing locations being changed due to the presence of human NPCs (hopefully other than the space station and the farm).
---
Thanks bro ur a legend
---
Wish I'd had a crash counter üòõ
---
Most other games absolutely do individual aspects better. But that's part of why it's easier for me to be more forgiving of 76's flaws, even though they're glaring &amp; obvious &amp; frustrating. It's not difficult to find a game which has one major focus &amp; executes that focus extremely well  -- because it's much easier to create a game which is more stable &amp; better designed when it doesn't have as much functionality.   
---
So far, the random people I've played 76 with have ranged from ages 6 to 67. They have been of many different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, economic situations. I've gamed with trump voters and socialists, popular extroverts and people who have no real life friends or family.   
---
I believe that's partly because it provides something for so many different play styles. I've never even launched a nuke or finished some of the quests and I've logged countless hours. Lots of my in-game time has been devoted to making camps to entertain and/or help random people. Many of the gamers I've met are totally the opposite -- they primarily grind for new gear, or try to complete every possible challenge &amp; achievement very quickly, or etc. Having totally different areas of knowledge / skills can be helpful when you're teaming up with other people.   
---
I admit that I've often actively avoided interaction in other games. Not everyone is reliably kind when they hear a female voice on a mic, and sometimes I'm just not in the mood to disappear &amp; swap to my higher level character &amp; suddenly return to obliterate them. :P   
---
But it's also often been because they didn't provide as many ways for people with different interests / skills to still be able to contribute to a team. It makes me happy when I can introduce people who have been playing since the beta to something that I knew about &amp; they didn't, or to still have ways to be useful during a quest even when I don't have the perfect build / best legendary / etc.
---
Thank you u/_Joe_Momma_
---
Can't tell if you're trying to honor your friend or bash this game for upvotes?
---
I play on PlayStation. However I have a buddy who plays on Xbox and he encounters many of the things I described also.
---
Basically. The stupid thing is that since they effectively killed pvp outside the Failnite mode, these nerfs are totally bullshit. If the game is nearly 100% pve, then let us have our stupid overpowered perks, weapons, and armor. No one is gonna complain that they queen dies 5 mins sooner
---
I wouldnt dare fall asleep on 76.. might end up dropping all your stuff lmao.. no reload there
---
It's equally possible the sub revenue funds future content and extends the game's lifetime.
---
IDK, we'll see what happens.
---
But if people are buying Atoms and buying 1st, for a broken game, why would they fix anything? We're already giving them our money.
---
Dont hate the player...
---
East of tanagra town?
---
I uninstalled from a terrifying existential realization I was wasting my life preparing/leveling/equipping/training for quests I just didn't give a s\*\*t about completing.
---
Point blank range, AA Gatling, miss 5 shots in a row. G√ºd. u/CarterG4 explained this once to me.
---
Gt kittielickie.  Have a group of friends that always invite new people in! Just add me
---
&gt;But do they deserve the amount of hate they get compared to the rest of the industry?
---
Yes.  Absolutely.  Some of the things you've listed sparked a lot of outrage at the time too.  But something you'll notice with a lot of these that you've listed is that they aren't anti-consumer.  What Bethesda did is.  While Randy "trainwreck" Pitchford's alleged interest in child porn is hilarious in the most fucked up way a 20 car highway pile up can be, it doesn't really affect anyone buying Borderlands 3.
---
Bloodied has already been nerfed quite a bit. It's already losing popularity among the PvP crowd, and other options are driving the market instead.
---
To get the darn Pink Donut PA paint!
---
How DARE so many peeps enjoy the game /s 
---
Lol
---
Fuck the scorchbeasts, we need all factions to work together and figure out how to compromise the invincible material.
---
Honestly. Its the character. If u go for public events n 1 shot kill everything. No one is happy about it. I use a level 40 AA 10mm SMG durig events. So others can have a chance to loot too
---
Hey batman! Thought I'd say hello, still use that fixer you sold all the time. I have a good feeling about this game and Wastelanders. Your points are probably what keep Todd up and night while communists at Zenimax ride him like a pony.
---
I've been running around with the antlers from last christmas all year, guess they will return from the vault
---
Some people are just nuts for TSE weapons. Its justified on some IMO. I sold a AAE faster reload mini for 30k the other day, but just about every TSE heavy or rifle i've sold goes for at least 15k, usually 20
---
I usually just hit the golf club cause it's most efficient. Maybe not the most legemdarys but most xp for sure
---
?
---
Biggest complaint about the Atom Shop from me is the pricing mode is fixated on ‚Äúwhales‚Äù and not the masses. I think they could get wayyyy more MRR (look it up) if they sold things at the prices they ‚Äúsale‚Äù things at
---
As for P2W - ehhh I just wish they wouldn‚Äôt cut content and put it in the store (*Scavenger robot specifically)*
---
I'm very happy it's been an amazing first year the only thing I've disliked is the change in community. Theirs so many negative players or maybe they are just the loudest. Either way I was stoked about 1st and cannot wait for wastelanders!
---
I like to take my xp out to a nice dinner, eat some oysters and some chocolate cake for dessert. Next we go for a stroll around the park and watch the sunset. Finally I take my xp back to my house and things really start to get hot. 
---
...wait, what were we talking about?
---
Cheers for Batman!
---
Yes, Vault 51 is actually the most immersive Fallout experience I've come across. We get to BE Vault-Tec experiments instead of just reading about them.
---
Wastelanders has ADDED NEW CONTENT SO MUCH ITS now just for subscribers. Plebs who do not sub will have to pay for the expansion.
---
They will just mimic eso with 1/1000th of the content.
---
This is the reason I quit playing myself. Would have 95% hit chance and miss almost 90% of my attacks.
---
I just sat through both videos, unfortunately the timeline was not mentioned in either. We still only have the "it's been some time since the vault opened" quote from the trailer. 
---
The "one year" remark in the trailer description *could* just mean that the DLC will be dropped one year after release as they did intend to release it this month, but that's probably reaching a bit. It most likely does mean one year after the vault opening in-game.
---
I like to see newbies receive my low level legendaries for fun. But worry some greedy folks will just take everything away... to search n give away is way too tedious for me
---
I wish, but it won't. Because this isn't an indie company, it is a greedy AAA with enough money to fund it. But they won't care about it until it gives them money and that is exactly what this is.
---
Don‚Äôt hate the player - hate the game! And I don‚Äôt mean FO76 but capitalism lol
---
I enjoy it a great deal. But giving them 100 dollars a year is going to make sure they keep doing this
---
Fallout 1st was supposed to launch alongside Wastelanders. It wasn't a backup plan.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs been bugged from the start. I had max luck and agility and would miss constantly.
---
3, my level 300 main. My level 24 I used to get trophies I missed in beta, and my level 9 that I been using for level up challenges.
---
I would like to know which mirelurk I should be nuking as well
---
If they discover a dupe method shits going offline asap I share your frustration but it's best for the community.
---
From someone who does a lot of (non-gaming) server maintenance, you are correct!
---
If it‚Äôs still a bug I would guess it will never get fixed. It‚Äôs a day one bug.
---
Great fun exploring the map and upgrading my character, but now combat is ridiculously easy and there's nothing to do except little things like finding all the magazines.
---
In a lot of cases it depends on the target and how you're lined up with the target.
---
Super Mutants are notorious for displaying 95% on headshots while you're crouched with their back turned to you, but the shot won't connect until they turn around.
---
Oh Bethesda, won't you ever listen?
---
Sounds nice on paper, but requires completly different engine programming methods, which means deleting the game and make a completly new one from the ground
---
Or maybe make sure they keep making new content
---
How can anything Bethesda says be trusted with so many broken promises?
---
9 total. 1 @ LVL 251 adventure/113NW. 1 @ LVL 107 adventure/120NW. 1 @ LVL 230 adventure. The rest are mules.
---
Fyi. I use my furious gatling gun for queen. And used 50 cal for daily. My gatling produced more damage to queen n 50 cal provides me with ground cover quickly
---
Why? There is nothing wrong with it... Every rpg has a end game glass cannon build
---
Many AAA titles give the players a little gift every day just for logging in...
---
Well I agree, but they had to put it out for the cash influx.  It‚Äôs suboptimal, but if it keeps the game going that‚Äôs cool with me.
---
Then guys like yong will have a stroke [https://imgur.com/Xd7stXV](https://imgur.com/Xd7stXV)
---
There are bugs, performance issues, imbalances, rampant cheaters in NW, and increasingly pay to win items being added to the game but the real issue is I can't make my character a fucking ham beast.
---
