Asking questions and providing opinions in no way equates to griefing, negativity, or contradiction. Stay soft, and try to improve your reading comprehension.

Aaah, gotcha. Glad I wasn't more snarky in my reply than I was :D
---
As the game sits, with all its new content (90% of it tutorial and map exposition/introduction material), it is now almost at launch readiness (all of the blundered attention to detail glitches, spelling and grammar errors, vagueness in item/mod clarification and poor communication of what players are supposed to do, uncompleteable challenges and tasks, holes in the map that you can fall through, and other simple playability glitches .... aside).
---

---
Yeah ... it still is bad on content compared with games that launched ready and got good scores of about 7.5/10 or better.  This is just the truth of it, regardless of how us fans enjoy the franchise, the game is still not really at its starting line.
---
&gt; I did workshops extensively and then they were nerfed, then they made it possible for people to challenge the workshops without getting near them, so I stopped. 
---
So you stopped doing workshops because you could be attacked, but you said:
---
&gt; 4 gave me the diversion of building massive settlements, settlements that would encourage me to abandon my current activity *to defend them*,
---
A little inconsistent.

I'm not a smart man, but there are tutorials...

Apparently there’s an INT curve meaning the higher your INT the higher the chance to discover a mod while scrapping. Normal weapons are easiest to discover, radium rifles are hard, and armour is the hardest.
---
I scrapped 10 and got one mod, and then I scrapped another 10 the next day and got 3 mods. I boosted by INT up to 25 because I think that’s the cap for raising the Mod scrap chance.
---
Fireproof maxed, Healing Factor, and a decent amount of energy resistance (like electrically grounded) will negate most of the damage.  The flames can be out-healed with stimpacks, and also even the after-glow healing from the stims (super stims obviously being more effective).  Many people are able to fast travel out in these situations especially right after hearing the door sound
---
Excavator calibrated and 2+ strength never leave home with out it
---
This would be cool but relisticly it’s not something Bethesda would add
---
" I was here first and therefore the enemies spawn accordingly to my level to be a challenge for specifically, me. I would have been completely fine sharing the enemies with this person and not hog them as the person before me did. It's not me being entitled, it's me saying the game dictated these enemies towards my player and not theirs. "
---
Namely the Chemist and Musician Possum badges.  The Musician challenges simply don't recognize when you play an instrument, no matter where nor how long.  The Chemist challenges are apparently glitched and don't recognize when you complete the Syringer challenges.
---
I strongly agree with giving it a buff to rad dmg.
---
I just shoot people and run around naked
---
Still sounds entitled. Will also throw out there that you can also leave if you don't like what he's doing just as much as he could have
---
It would more just be postponing the problem until the local vaults unseal or people from other parts of the country come visit

As you level, your base will get more allowance. I've seen some absolutely astronomical builds from super high levels.
---
I think this shines a light on a pretty critical design flaw with 76, compared with other games in the "survival MMO" space. My mind jumps to Ark:SE for the comparison since I've got plenty of experience there. Every Ark server is unique, as opposed to 76 where you can hop from one server in 76 to another and pick up right where you left off. In Ark, anything you've built, any progress you've made stays on the server where it actually started. There are specific methods of moving items and characters from one server to another, but it's pretty niche and not meant to be done on a regular basis. If a clan had their own private server, or there were public servers built to handle higher player counts, the syncing issue wouldn't be a problem. It wouldn't have to run 4 different versions of the same clan chest if it only exists in one place. Camps and hypothetical clan bases would exist continuously instead of being loaded in and out depending on who's present. If everyone in that 40 man clan were all on separate servers, and all started modifying the clan base at the same time, syncing that shit would be a fucking nightmare.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
TL;DR 76's server system really isn't designed for a fully implemented clan system like we're talking about. Significant changes would have to be made for it to be feasible.
---
I'd be so happy if some of the Fallout 3 outfits went to the atomic shop!!
---
You can survive for a bit but still gotta heal yourself quickly and fast travel. And I figured the Asbestos mod on my armor would help, but "Immune to being set on fire" doesn't apply to a flame trap attack lol.
---
Whitesprings and surrounding areas are the only location along that strip that spawn level 68 enemies. Whitesprings spawns ghouls as low as level 9, therefore stating it's aimed for low level players and higher level mobs are simply there to give high-level players a reason to visit it. If the location wasn't aimed at lower level characters enemies wouldn't spawn at level 9 or even 32.
---
Thought they were removed.

Can i reduce the price with stuff to make flux and legendarys to scrap?
---
Welcome to the wasteland bud, and to answer your question about the build area you can't increase the size of it you're stuck with what you have
---
That's why I eat my spoiled food and drink from whatever random sources of dirty water I come across.
---
That's a fantastic idea. The game would need dedicated servers where everything stays put in order for clan bases and storage to work in the overworld; like the server the base is built on is the only base where it exists, and you'd have to log in to that specific server in order for the bases to be present.
---
Your solution actually reminds me of Trove. Back in the day, a few friends and I pooled our resources to get a club world, which was instanced like these mini vaults would be. It's a fantastic way to work it in without Bethesda having to reorganize their server system.
---
Buy the Heavy Leather plans from any Responder vendor as soon as you're able, that shit will see you through to 50+ easily.
---
Craft light leather pieces and scrap them until you have the Studded upgrade which can also be applied to the Heavy version you're wearing.
---
By the time you have Studded Leather you'll likely have the mods you want for your play style, ie. Muffled/Sleek for sneakiness or Light/Ultralight for AP points, etc.
---
Leather upgrades every 10 levels, so 10, 20. 30 etc. If you're bothered about it you can server hop spam on random encounter locations in the Forest region for the Trapper plans (plenty of posts about this if you have a look) which upgrade at 15, 25, 35 etc but there's really not much need, plus it's a pain to have enough ballistic fibre as both sets will need it from around lvl30 onwards.
---
I'm full of Guinness as I type this but I've read it over and it all seems legit, plenty of sober folks around to correct anything if needed I'm sure 🤘
---
Can I reduce the price with stuff to make flux and legendarys to scrap?

The only way to win is to deal with the scorchbeast queens, and distribute the vaccine you make in the story. Doing  nothing in this world would see a flood of scorched animals slowly pushing out as any viral infection would, and slowly infecting the rest of the wasteland. To use an old quote: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil, is for good men to do nothing." ~Edmond Burke.
---
I go 3x per day on average and have got a handful of decent weapons. But 80% ( or higher ) I get shit that goes back into the scrapper immediately so the purveyor can hear me doing it.
---
I find it the most nerve wracking part of the game.
---
I don't actually have empathy for Bethesda.
---
They have admitted to launching a game they knew was broken.  They did NOT say so at the time of launch to the people paying full price.
---
They did not say so for months after launch, making excuse after excuse.
---
They have said so now.
---
That the work to FIX what they broke is hard or tedious or frustrating because of the communication of the people that pay their bills and give them employment ... well they should own that and dedicate a larger number of employees to the task.
---
That's called customer responsiveness....... I get that the IT department is not to blame, but their company gave the product to customers that are not savvy on IT communication ... it's their problem that they created..
---
Yes. Sometimes people will accept trades alongside caps. Sometimes junk or ammo.
---
bloodied builds are indeed much easier to fall victim to the flame trap though even then I've seen some able to survive the onslaught.  In that case radiation emitters could also be used to finish the job.  I wasn't aware of the Asbestos mod and would have thought it would work at least a bit.  Rest assured that if you decide to keep spamming stimpacks, junk or no junk, you're costing the trapper oil, aluminum, rubber, and screws each time they break
---
Im level 42 now. Should i still use leather?
---
Really it would have been a great idea to have custom factions back in Fallout 4. Sure, the Minutemen were "your" faction, but you didn't really have any control over them. Couldn't set policy, give orders, choose uniforms and equipment that everybody would use. The best we had was giving our settlers certain items and using headcanon to fill in the rest.
---
No, no you dont.

Whataburger's door is always open..

Long johns work too.  Under armor usually plan sold by raider vendors in the divide.
---
Simple: It's a cap sink. Events + fast travel are basically loot boxes. You spend currency for a possible chance of rewards but sometimes the event is just not viable. Keeps rewards based on RNG and keeps people in the game grinding for more caps.
---
I sell all unradiated food at 10c each... Dog food 10c... Water is virtually free so...

Should've walked in, gave him a smooch and claim the workshop along with a marriage.
---
I just hate that if you dont have a tse or a bloodied weapon, you cant survive. It seems just like a big cluster fuck of both. But then again adventure mode is still filled with those types of people so its kinda fucked.
---
Not gonna lie, I had to reread that 3 times before fore I realised it said "nuke" and not "nude"

i was referring to the class action lawsuit suing  them for them selling a "broken dysfunctional product" or something along those lines. unaware of current status of that
---
Addiction.
---
The RNG is designed to be addictive (always teasing ... never pleasing) .... you keep playing because you still don't have the things you want to make you feel like you finished.
---
They only made it so energy weapons cannot obtain the explosive prefix anymore. any that exist currently are still in game. Two Shot Explosive can still spawn as any ballistic legendary 2 star effect

Really? I get the following and only the following from that quest despite doing it 6 days in a row:

- stingwing

- radroach (most common)

- bloodbug (least common)

Not gotten anything usable from her either!
---
I have 3 characters. My main is a melee str/cha support build that can also use heavy guns,hes also my main crafter and builder. I also have a stealth sniper. And my newest creation is a hybrid bloody berserker build, I haven't fully decided what I'm going to go for but I have a great foundation. Starting a new character is much easier to deal with once you understand build requirements and limitations, plus with player vending implemented finding plans and gaining caps is not such a huge chore.
---
Why not both?

I would like to see a “You’re dead” taunt or emote. Some threatening emotes for the raiders and cultists out there.

That doesn't sound ad good as you seem to be making it our to be... Is this sarcasm,  am I wooshing.  Gah my poor brain...

I found a legitimate use for mini nukes and missiles. During nuke runs you can shoot the mainframe cores to destroy them. One missile will destroy any within explosion range. Makes that room really easy

HOLY FUCK in 1500 hours in and I’m just now... ahh!!

The only thing with glowing meat is all the rads make rad level maintenance a lot more frequent if you're doing a bloodied build.

I haven’t figured out how to do it but it needs to happen. I really want the look of a realistic bar.

---
I suspect op is being facetious, but I’m not certain, it’s maybe 50/50 👀
---
Correct. I think it just feels like a bigger camp budget because you get more raw materials and plans as you level up.
---
Agree.
---
I have fully built, modded, and painted sets of every other set of power armor and all they do is occupy stash space.
---
The “Tonka Truck” was always just too useful to retire.  Now with the four horseman skins that change the appearance of Excavator I can’t really ever see myself using then others.
---
My hope is that we get the power armor display racks we had in FO4 so I can just use the others as camp decorations.

Did a couple of SBQ events yesterday . People were dropping like flies ( it was in the nuke zone ).
---
Encryptid is good also - high casualty event.

There’s always the option of quitting and reloading the game if your death is imminent. Sure, if you’re midway through a daily quest, it’ll be gone on reload but at least you get to keep all your junk.

For the exact location, follow the train tracks west out of the Charleston Trainyard. When it crosses over the road, hop down on the west/right side and the deposit is just off the road to the left, behind a big tree.

Look up datamined items for last patch (9.5 I believe) There are some mailboxes which seem damn odd to add to the game as just a random decoration item when ignoring so many other requests.
---
Bargain hunt. People tend to be locked into one weapon type in this game and often find good weapons they don’t need. They often sell them at very reasonable rates. The three guns I have relied on for almost 40 levels were all purchased for less that 1200 caps (a furious handmade, quad lever and instigating hunting rifle). I only recently upgraded one. And none of my guns came from drops. I have had good drops, but only for stuff I can’t use. Use the trading mechanics to swap up.

It doesn't need a rework, but a server-wide notification so a large group of people participate.

As far as I could tell, his Camp was fine. The Vertibots kept the fight from getting too close. I did walk around his camp afterwards to make sure his turrets were okay though.

I seem to have finished the overseers line, the last was where she gets upset about a guy in the basement you have to kill.

Although I do still have a vague 'follow the overseers journey' quest, it has no waypoints, nowhere to go, but I think it finished with that last guy in the basement.
---
The scaling to other players is a real problem. I was fighitng low lvl 5 mobs, then walk 2 minutes to a new location and get attacked by six lvl 35 super mutants!. That is very annoying!

You still running that 10mm sub?
---
Either way, I just want to know if I'm actually hurting it.
---
Thanks, I've been looking around for him inside and outside the plant but haven't been able to find him. Died to random landmines and getting jumped by a mass of mobs that just randomly appeared. No quest, multiple deaths, yay fun
---
Mines are badly nerfed because if you drop a third, the first will explode. In other Fallouts, against a mob or large creature I could make a minefield and sneak back to snipe and the target would wander into the mines. In 76 two mines just doesn't help enough. Plus I've blown myself up by dropping the third mine enough.
---
This is the answer. I had the same issue after coming back after leaving the game 4 months ago. Its the ini, 100%. Its in a completely different place then the game files.
---
Food factory? What the shit? Am I missing something?
---
I use missiles a lot when I encounter scorchbeasts, or for the queen. The mod for the computer visor that locks the targets is pretty useful when your enemies fly.
---
I think that's mostly hearsay. I run a bloodied character with full unyielding armor so my Intelligence is always in the mid-20s and it's still a shit learn rate. I've scrapped ten in a row and not learned a single mod. I've also learned two in a row once. Total crapshoot.
---
I really wish you could go inside the other Vaults. But I guess they just ran out of time or something. Maybe they’ll do it in the future or something?
---
The Kaleidopore is in the Arktos labs where Project Paradise is. It's the multicolored one scattered around the place.
---
yep done grafton, the mayor quests, finding the kid, did all those. Did the ashheap, took over mount blair. So now I'm just wondering around this big empty world, almost never see a player, no quests, getting randomly attack by either mobs that are very low level or suddenly 30 levels above mine. yay
---
I do run a Bloodied build for the sake of PvP, but it's just on my Gauss Rifle, and I don't think it's always entirely necessary. You can still fight back, but it does seem like everyone you come up against in survival is running explosive something. While the meta is clearly the meta for a reason, there are counters out there. 
---
I'd like it if PvP was approached with the same regard that the story makes about you all being from the same vault, instead of arbitrarily targeting people who are just levelling up, trying to "rebuild America." Hell, it's not like "raiders" wouldn't be able to see if someone took a workshop, even, and contest them there, so pushing every member of survival into eventually becoming a target just seems over the top when you consider how many actions make you a target already.
---
Thank you from 5 months into the future.
---
Some of the vendors do, but unlike the plans, they are not always there. The mods will spawn randomly, you'd need to server hop a lot of find them (if you can find them). 
---
Your'e probably better off buying the plans or buying mods off another player.
---
Alternatively can also pay someone to add the mods for you.
---
I want to lower your price
---
It's annoying but I need god roll armor more than I need god roll weapons. I just make sure I have enough of my daily limit left before I buy something. If it's a wood piece I immediately turn it into scrip.

Definitely banned. For life, probably all future Bethesda titles. Super sad..........

Pretty much. these guys say they supply some of the biggest pvp clans and I believe it with all the supplies they take in. I ordered 30k 5.56 off them and it's a 3 day wait.

Perhaps I should've been more specific. I cannot afford to use any form of rug to hold them in place due to budget purposes. I came across this photo of someone's camp and they have all three pressed together nicely seemingly without the use of the rug glitch.

I wear a Mr. Fuzzy suit and sometimes they'll see me in the shadows like a ghost. Most will even go to the spot they saw me and look around. Then depending on my mood I might jump out and cut them once and run away back out of sight to let them get their bearings. This is where they start running for their lives.

That's cool and all, but teach a man to fish...

There is, but any Chameleon seems to get the job done. I run one Chameleon Forrest Scout leg, and I barely get noticed. I do have all the Sneak perks maxed, so your mileage may vary.

This is good information. Lewisburg’s rooftop greenhouses also grow multiple Ash Roses.
---
Haha some low levels have gotten close to killing me but none have succeeded. I wouldn't mind if one did, would be funny and I'm sure they'd get a kick out of it too. But just a fair warning, if you see a Mr. Fuzzy suit in the distance, your best bet is probably just to run.

That would definitely help. The whole thing is a bit buggy though.

You can find that flower in the basement of arktos  where the quest project paradise spawns. Ash rose can be found on the rooftop gardens in lewisville?lewisberg? (forgot the name) . Bloodleaf can be found in the river in flatwoods. With the greenthumb perk, you should be able to get more than you need.

How about instead of being a dick about playing game with other people, you do what literally everyone does when there's too many people at WS, either do Westek or server hop.

That's good! I usually do that too, fix anything that might have been damaged. I'm glad that's a mechanic in game

Absolutely correct, hes ruined the game for the poor kid

Todd Howard has to kill you now.

I've been waiting for this since like Fallout 3

Also, min/maxed stats, stacked buffs, god tier weapons/armor doesn't make you good at PvP. It means you have to rely on multiple crutches to get any pks.

It's gonna keep happening until they implement the option for doors to close by itself

r/Market76 is where you can buy some legendaries, getting a TSE Handmade may cost you about 8k and FE Gatling Plasma more than max caps

Had some dude do that to me today. I went through the Poseidon plant to get it all up and running and then went and grabbed the workshop. While I was running the Workshop Attack even that goes along with it, dude ran up to me and killed me in one shot. The game would only let me respawn at that workshop for some reason, and he did it again as I was trying to leave.

Same as yours only it's a mole miners gauntlet.

I'll buy one from ya :)

I think it’s only awarded from an event.

You should definitely wait til level 50. The quest in Watoga...."Mayor for a day" rewards you with the All Rise legendary. Very effective weapon at max level. I'm  level 254 and still use it.

You likely won’t get a specific answer.  I’d call it a sellers item. Price at 10k and have a chance of getting a nibble.  I doubt it would go more than that, but you never know.  I went weeks without selling a stealth boy, and then one day someone wiped me out of 40 of them plus 5 lvl 3 ones.
---
I only say 10k because I’d personally only go around 5k and I’m a cap miser.  Others seem to spend a bit more freely only rare plans when they can make good caps faster than getting lucky drops.
---
If you’re wanting to buy it, good luck is all I can say.

This is literally the godsend of renaming weapons, to avoid the accidental sell or to identify your prime stuff when you’ve stashed loot ready to sell

Increase the amount isn't the only thing they should consider. It doesn't always really increase the difficulty, especially when The Burrows is so narrow.
---
Adding a feature to change the difficulty by x2 and x3 (including the rewards) would be just as effective, but they would have to consider Instanced Dungeons
---
Pretty much my thoughts as I watched a level 300+ run around Harpers Ferry with a gauss rifle, sniping every single mob on the map. Didn't even loot them as far as I could tell. Just killed them all and ran off.
---
Wow that answer is really good. A lot more than I ever expected. Thank you
---
Well, you'd have to be reported or have something identifiable.
---
Fallout was a turn based rpg.  
---
Then it was a FPS 
---
Now it’s an mmorpg. 
---
Never said “non stop action”
---
It’s entirely possible that movement and gameplay dynamics for the series can and will change. 
---
Maybe not in this iteration but that’s what the suggestion forum is here to, to suggest. 
---
So, with that I SUGGEST you quit with negatively, because people like you do not perpetuate the world forward.
---
This is why I use a key coded door. Only my friends get access to my 4th vendor with foods and drink for a cap each.
---
I would use my X-01 and Ultracite more often if I werent always over-encumbered.
---
Yeah at this point I just want someone to make me one
---
Better yet, just add the bandoleers, belts and pads from the armored vault suit as new layered armor.
---
Now that your letter has been read, I'm sure you've left many people dead.
---
That broken gear you use, sparks an anger issue.
---
And this is what most shall say.
---
"We don't care", have a nice day.
---
Just a suggestion, bud.
---
Either way thank you ou for your time
---
Don't be a luddite Luke!
---
Funny that you think they would do a Q&amp;A session.
---
Tse gatling plasma it was a gift from a friend, ive been using it since it was worth 3k. few months or so i would say ive had it. My favorite weapon. Never selling it never scraping it.
---
I enjoy the art of negotiating, mostly with high level monsters, i dink them a few times with my weapon and lead them on a happy trek to other players camps, where I'll let them help evict them, by destroying their camps.. standard enclave business.
---
As much as I love to see  them, they never mentioned their intentions of doing this.  So your "when" is more a matter of just "will"
---
I am pretty sure if you take a workshop, Pacifist or no, he can contest it and kill you.  
---
I’m pushing 900 hours and can count the negative incidents I’ve had on one hand.  Hope you have the same luck I’ve had.
---
Dunno if this was posted already or not but is there a way to map out all of the trashcan/food storage containers so we can fully utilize the can do perk? Thanks!
---
And SITTING POSES!!! 
---
My character looks so darn depressed, no matter how much fun I think we are having. Which then makes me think that this is her true state of mental well-being and she is a slave in the Fallout World being forced to risk her life in pit fights against all sorts of nightmarish creatures, that if they don't kill her give her more diseases than a frat boy. Her only comforts are eating and drinking disgusting food and drinks, sleeping on a dirty bed with no linens and listening to the same 12 songs on a constant loop, while being force fed copious amounts of alcohol. This leaves me to believe all the bugs and glitches truly aren't Bethesda's fault but are the result of our avatars rising up and showing their discontentment; trying to get us to give up and quit of our own free will therefore granting themselves the ability to choose their own reality.

Welcome to our raider group.  Introductions.  That's Gnasher, he handles our food raids.  That's Blood Knuckle, she trains the orphans into real raiders and sends the useless ones to Gnasher.  Dog Nut trains the animals, but he also, uh, enjoys their company, so I'd stay away from him.  Thundercrotch handles the brothel, still don't know if that's a guy or not.  That's Theodore.  There's... what?  No no, he, (sigh) Theodore handles our finances.  I don't know why he insists on Theodore.  Moving on, those are the twins, Dyno and Mite, who handle explosives.  They work together since they each have a missing arm...
---
I’d say pick up every weapon and scrap it until you no longer learn mods from scrapping
---
Yes. Modding is something you'll be doing throughout the whole game. Guns very rarely come with the perfect mods you want, and the only equippable mods you can find are completely randomized, they can't be crafted. I think you also need the appropriate perk to put them on, all it does is save you the materials and helps if you don't know how to make that specific attachment
---
That doesn't really make that much sense. You could say that of the Atom Store team but the a lot of the people who create new content i.e. DLC content, would also be the very same people that would be ideal to fix the bug.
---
Yes, I get that some aspects of the content team would be of no help - story, art, etc. Though for the coders, rather than work on new code for their area of speciality can focus on fixing bugs relevant to their area.
---
OP's request is perfectly reasonable. There's a limit to how much attention is paid to fixing old issues vs creating new content but this lull between content releases would be the perfect time for hammer out as many of the more significant bugs.
---
Somerset is an amazing weapon i wish i had a max lvl. But then again its pretty much only thing keeping my mid pistol build alive so guess we just hope for more or better in a bit.
---
And then keep going because suppressors sometimes make you work for it.
---
Bloody explosive 50 cal. Found an anti armor explosive 50 cal and traded it for the bloody version. It cuts through the queen like a hot knife through butter.
---
That’s great
---
... and dump butcher pete forever!
---
It's lonely out there in the wasteland
---
Do you have a sign up reminding people to close the door after themselves.
---
I mean I get it's nice that people know to do it anyhow but a gentle reminder near the door wouldn't hurt either.
---
Beacuse I want perks that actually change up the game instead of more weight modifying perks. Half of the weight modifier perks should be passives anyway.
---
A Two Shot Exploding Tesla.. fires projectiles, which helps a great deal for picking off groups in one shot. 
---
And my Instigating Gatling Gun - double damage and 50% more limb damage
---
I always try to offer caps in exchange for workshops. Most higher levels are happy to tango regardless but some end up regretting it and talking trash. Like bro, I gave you an out. Don't get mad at me.
---
Diseased Mirelurk Hatchlings. Highland marsh has some nests that can spawn them if you walk on the eggs.
---
You get it from diseased mirelurk hatchlings. If you have mutations like electrically charged you will need to take rad x so they can hit you without you killing them.
---
Someone showed me my calling a few months ago, and I was blown away by how hard it would have been to find without a guide.
---
In all seriousness, is this the thing Todd was talking about when he said “there’s something no one has found yet” ?
---
This un-marked questline totally changes the franchise, and has some pretty wild implications. And it started in fallout 3, continued to 4, and now 76. 
---
I hope they give him a marked quest at some point in the future. Too bad people will think he is “new content to save face”. He’s been here for millions of years!
---
woah. what do you meen sheepsquatch shards? did I miss something?
---
Wrong! Everyone liked that.
---
You got me until the last part
---
Then let me also ask this, how long will the items stay in an in game container before disappearing?
---
It’s a plan you get from doing the free range event - you can make darts from the quills
---
Yeah exactly they’ve never said they are doing it so it’s a we’ll see kinda thing
---
Bloodied faster fire rate Lever Action~
---
+60 carry weight. 1lb.
---
You can carry around several to abuse their insane mod upgrade benefits.
---
Really?? I totally thought this would be random. Ok thanks.
---
Wat?
---
Great thanks
---
Yea
---
good advice thanks,
---
So I pickup a quest for lewis from a poster. Head over there and six lvl 18 supermutants and one boss lvl 22 attack me all at once. One has a rocket launcher, a couple come melee and the rest shoot automatic fire from a distance.
---
WTF, how am I supposed to fight six, with them throwing grenades, shooting rockets and melee all at once.
---
[deleted]
---
subpar levelling is a noticed trend, but the only way to reduce it is by bimodial interactions between the plasma shifted minotaur and the spin reducing quantum angel spear.
---
this was a good idea in fallout 4 where a good portion of the enemies you fight are humans who are vulnerable to radiation, but almost all the enemies you fight regularly in this game are highly resistant or immune to radiation; the only humans are other players and even if you PvP a lot, the radium rifle is still too weak to be considered top tier
---
What days will you be on next week? I'm on Xbox and would love to take advantage of this, if that's what you're on.
---
Yep! Good place to do it is the highland marsh in the top of the mire - there’s a king and queen that spawn and a bunch of nests - kill them and any random mirelurks and then wait for a diseased hatchling and there you go. Takes some time it feels like- I think it took like 10 freaking minutes of just letting it hit me
---
?
---
I've been using the same instigating supersledge with swing speed since 45. I'm 152 and it's still my go to.
---
Fanatic fans and Bethesda are already doing bug fixing. They down vote all the problem related messages so when enough down votes has been given there is no problems anymore.
---
I never drop my spoiled stuff unless I'm over encumbered and booze and buffouts don't help.. I also turn that shit, literally, into money (caps)
---
I don’t follow
---
The grind is to expand your perk card collection and to acquire more recipes. This gives you more ways to deal with the game mechanics and more ways to use your items.
---
Capital building in Charleston!!!
---
I’ll give it a shot. 👍
---
Yup hard to beat a good instigating unless you are running low life
---
How
---
Same. I feel better being able to tidy up if I accidentally bring mobs to a Camp.
---
Had one weird situation where one Camp turret was shooting the other turrets there and I couldn't stop it. Very weird.
---
I normally "escort" low players through tough parts of the map, usually WS and let them instigate fights, which I'll finish so they can reap rewards/xp and if i see 'em in trouble i'll drop stimpaks or revive them and even watch their dropped loot til they respawn in. 
---
I'm nearly at lvl 140
---
I wish they would do what NMS did a few huge updates without much notice.
---
You know it man! The grind is real 💪
---
Cant scrip due to the 150 per day limitation
---
I know this is controversial but I quite enjoyed them when I had a break between settlement building. Just the odd one here or there and I'd have to go to a random place to do something.
---
Don't get me wrong; I was annoyed after like the third one I did and realised it was an endless loop but I'm glad they were there.
---
If you’re talking about that BE one then yes, on a different toon it’s my main weapon and I’ve affectionately named it “The Fork in the Road”.
---
Because it's a sandbox game.
---
No lol definitely not. Win some lose some always.
---
Then how am I supposed to finish a quest if im 15 levels below the enemies
---
wtf!!! I've done free range a bunch of times. never got that plan. I was wondering what those quills were for. thanks for the info.
---
and no I dont believe there is. the only card that might work is the one in perception that adds an arch to grenades but idk.
---
Because that 1 is different to other take photo at region challenges.
---
 
---
You actually need to use the photomode in specific locations that are listed
---
Yeah there’s a TON of plans from free range
---
Just for curiosity, where did you found plans for shielded raider leathers?
---
Also coolness facror... Nothing says you goofed when a rifleman puts you down with a pipe wrench!
---
Nocturnal explosive gatling plasma
---
It was my first ever explosive drop, got it off one of the like five times I ever went to a nuked whitesprings. This was already a good weapon by itself, but after I figured out the gatling plasma has a beam splitter, the whole world changed. This thing is ridiculously overpowered. It destroys anything it touches. With this and a handful of super stimpaks, I managed to beat the impostor sheepsquatch pretty much solo. Even during the day without any heavy gun perks, the damage output is one of the best I have. At night time with energy perks, it will instantly mow down glowing deathclaws, fog crawlers, and yao guais before the game can comprehend what's going on. Landed scorchbeasts die to a few moments of sustained fire. Even a sheepsquatch will only last so long against it.
---
Only problem is it breaks really quickly. It's more than a fair trade-off imo
---
I have a tse handmade im thinking about getting rid of
---
I CANNOT believe I missed that. Uuuuuuugh thanks so much.
---
Honestly I dont remember. I acquired them along the way and never thought anything of it but now im glad i did. Worth spending a couple flux to make.
---
Poetic. I don’t use broken gear though. I’ve been running a new survival only character for the last few weeks with a no outside trade/transfer clause and it’s been super fun and super frustrating at the same time. This was a harmless little venting session.
---
I need it on a character still. I'll add you and we can server hop until one of us finds it.
---
TSE Combat Shotgun. I paid 1000 caps for it way before the prices got crazy.
---
Why should the reply include "yeah we received information on this last Xday and the last time it was touched was when before launch"? They'd spend more time harassing QA for info than communicating with the community
---
Yup. One day I’ll learn the, or a, stabilised mod for my sniper!
---
Fire in the hole perk affects the weapons range and shows an arc when tossing them.
---
Nah, just frustrated with some of the survival modes mechanics.
---
Love this idea guys and this will help greatly when I'm at work and my girl is on.(She gets nervous and always seems to find someone how thinks their cool.(PVP...No.....PVP PVP PVP....)
---
No problem. Good luck.
---
Smartly? If your stealth sniper, can you headshot? Stealth boy in and out?
---
Or
---
This is a sandbox game.  It's designed for you to take time away from the main quest and adventure elsewhere so you can get stronger.  Go for a walkabout, find all the locations of the forest, kill the Grafton monster or protesters, do other events.  Enjoy the rest of the game and come back stronger.
---
We've all been there! But now there's hope.
---
Since the Nerf most prices have dropped dramatically. Whats the price range youre looking at in parting with yours?
---
I wouldn't mind a few more quests.
---
Haha just messin with ya :)
---
Smartly im indoors also im lvl 25 so no stealth boys and i can go anywhere cause there are lvl 45+ enemies everywhere
---
That's in fact what happened. 
---
I spent significantly more hours playing every other ES and FO game. 
---
FO4 was just predictable and over filled with cliches.
---
You called it (A) I wear excavator power armor all the time with calibrated shocks for +200 carry weight. I'm being somewhat facetious about backpacks, since a backpack is a mundane thing in real life, but I see the value in game.
---
Yes Bethesda please add Gods gonna cut you down by Johnny Cash
---
I never expected Fallout 76 to have a rich quest line &amp; vast amount of directions, or things you can choose from like in other fallout games. 
---
And to be honest, I'm okay with it. To me, this fallout game isn't about the questline, it is about delving into a new environment interacting with other fallout fans and developing new strategies and tactics to get the items you want. Developing a character into the waste-lander you want to portray to everyone. Finding a new group of people to grind with, or barter.
---
In nearly all high level RPG games, there is some extent of grinding to get what you want. Challenges, achievements &amp; events are used in nearly all RPG's to increase content, too. 
---
The player base is what this game is truly about, I have no doubt they'll release another single player fallout with a much deeper story line.
---
 But as it stands, if you take your time with the game, there is a lot of little things to read, stories to piece together, some puzzles and hidden things. It may not have the content previous fallout games did, but it isn't finished yet.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
In my experience if you are mass crafting you will not see the icon pop up on the left every time. Typically it will even go off several times after I leave the bench. Keeping track though it is firing off as often as it should. Easiest to track with food items. This is on PS4
---
Added
---
bottlecap mines in 76? wtf really? HOW
---
Them cali shocks are dope lol nothing like 500 carry weight loading in Excavator!
---
Who took your motherboard? Molerats?
---
Ah okay, I haven't tried any of those
---
What food factory? Food that doesn't expire?? Where?!
---
Am i suppose to let them kill me repeatedly till I catch disease? Lol
---
This made my day
---
It’s a free world.
---
No no heal yourself lol just let them hit you and remember it has to be a diseased hatchling - the normal ones don’t count
---
Like a microphone?
---
Sounds fun!
---
I have the harvest option but it won’t harvest. Do I need a tool or jar or something or is this a glitch?
---
There's a ScrapBonusInt.json, but I don't know whether it's used for scrap chance, scrap junk or neither. The variance in the table isn't huge anyway, and so it would be difficult to prove statistically whether it's used or not. Some sample values are 0.75 at INT 1, 1.0 at INT 3 , 1.2 at INT 10, 1.3 at INT 20 and 1.325 and INT 25.
---
All scrap-learnable armor mods use the medium armor chance of 0.75%, while the Radium Rifle uses the low (0.65%) and very low (0.45%) armor chances. Other ranged ballistic weapons normally use a mix of the low (15%) and very low (10%) weapon chances.
---
Yeah they are diseased alright lol
---
Same
---
Which system are you on? I *do* have a berserker build and I may be interested if you've figured out a price.
---
I think the same, I had fun in survival mode and played it like being in adventure and avoided other players watching them doing things and they had no idea that I was close. Since the last changes I stopped playing survival mode, because it's dull and pure death match. I personally think that no player should be marked on the map. If you wanna kill or rob someone go search them, instead of checking the map every second. For me it's unplayable now because when you're marked on the map you are dead and get farmed. Total bullshit the last changes...
---
Also, if you're a high LVL. Don't eat food, so you get the famished debuff which increases the chance to get the disease. Go to Highland marsh. Kill off the other enemies so it just you and the diseased. I found that some servers are bugged, so if the diseased spawnling attacking doesn't give you the disease, try another server
---
count me in...psn: bazookagooch
---
Me reddit Noob with the home run counter lol
---
Blackjack and hookers!!!
---
Hahaha. I was getting bored waiting for him to infect me and I had a snack lol
---
Also I think taking radaway decreases you disease resist
---
Sit down kids and I will you tell the story of fo76 hate.  It all started on that fateful e3 day, when todd howard said "all human characters you meet will be an actual person".  People didnt like that.  They took it as "NO npcs in an online game let alone an online fallout game, what kind of stupid idea is that.  Bethesda I want my dialogue options!"  So you can see people were already dead set on hating this game from the very first announcement.  Add the buggy launch and other various things like the canvas bag fiasco, and you have the perfect shitstorm.
---
I’d be more happy if we could wear them over our armor like other outfits.
---
Lmao I got one of said Assaultron Heads as a 3 star purchase from the Purveyor.
---
Yeah, probably a bugged server.
---
The missle launcher weighs 20 unmodded tho, the handmade only weighs like 22 when its fully modded, with the triple barrel and other mods on the missle launcher, the missle launcher can weigh over 40
---
Nope, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. Thank you!
---
Best place to do it is Quarry X3.  Kill everything but the Queen at the little building across the water, lure the Queen to the building and let the hatchlings all come into the room (Queen won’t bother you once you’re in there).  Make sure you take Rad X and a Radaway to up your disease chance and get rid of your explosive weapons until after you catch it.  There you go!
---
Just got it from highland marsh hatchlings thank you
---
Nice!
---
Oh I guess I'm at the point where I have pretty much all the perk cards that I want for my various loadouts, so I'm not compelled to level up.
---
That type of logic doesn't work to well on Reddit. I agree, though.
---
One of the few things I'd actually spend money on for atoms
---
Lol little monsters broke my leg armor
---
2 player holo decks that you can play on a console or terminal of some sort
---
Still adds 25% damage though. The pellet count doesn't really matter. Main problem is that it increases the spread by 150%.
---
Explosive might be pretty weak on shotguns since the nerf, or at least not disgustingly overpowered like it was before.
---
Once you get a good receiver and barrel, that's pretty much it. You can pimp it out with a paint, I have a camo skin on my civil unrest and it looks awesome.
---
A timer still provides you some contextual information.  If you log into a server and the SBQ timer is still at 25+ minutes you can know that you stand a decent chance of getting there before it's dead, or if it's at under 5 minutes you can write it off as a lost cause and yourself the fast travel caps.
---
Also not all events could get just timers and could get progress bars, i.e. for SBQ it would display the % of health remaining.
---
Worth it.
---
Took my ages to get that stupid disease. Had to server hop many times.
---
Inside Seneca rocks
---
on a farm thats north west of vault 76
---
Rifles
---
This. Or wear our armor over them like under armor
---
Totally worth it
---
The mire has a lot of really pretty places to build
---
Glad I'm not the only one irritated by this.
---
I just wanna be a ghoul man
---
Tse minigun
---
I found one finally today in one of the houses at Whitespring. In the kid’s room in the container by the bed.
---
Don't we already have fire breather power armor? Or was that only a datamine? I know I've seen it
---
Have your experiences in the game really involved so much unfriendly behavior that you doubt stories of friendly actions?
---
I'd give my soul to Todd for that
---
Hm I use succulents,rugs,lamps,skull they may have used the succulents and bowl but like how it look I'll have to get back to you on that one.
---
Its near flatwoods. Its got a food processor that makes things like Salisbury steak. Though sadly not Cram or dog food.
---
Nice, I'm still dry out in the wild, they just don't spawn for me.
---
Just invest in armor with this perk. I got one and i always had more than 50 weapons on me.
---
My pvp experience has mainly been level 25 characters attacking me while grouped with two higher level players who one shot me when I get tired of being nuisance attacked and retaliate.
---
Ooh, yeah, maybe like, your character drags their thumb over their throat? That'd be sick.
---
Sometimes the food just hits the spot better. Like when you start collecting Canned Dog Food and put out the Good Doggy perk cuz you prefer the extra beefy flavour. It’s an apocalypse, I just prefer the dog food 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It's a female corpse that is hanging off a railing it's kind-of inbetween the rail station and posiodon
---
I bought the same few month ago 10K.
---
right? like damn
---
I had that happen to me, too! I think it's a bug that makes one turret register as an enemy, but I don't know why that would even be a thing.
---
Nice work with a nice view.
---
I'm level 170 and even I would've been fucking stoked to get that! Hell, even if it was a lvl 35 Gauss I still probably would've been stoked lol
---
Mine is just a Bloodied Gauss. Full stop, no other effects. Adding Prime Capacitors bumped up the damage by 80, though. Granted, that's at \~25% HP *and* with Adrenal Reaction mutation.
---
At any rate, I love giving stuff away as well. It's no Bloodied TS, but I *did* get an Instigating lvl 35 Gauss a few days back. So I gave it all the best mods, then stalked tracked down the nearest player to 35 on that server and gave it to him. Then escorted him through the whole "Find what happened to Tagerty" quest that culminated in a run through Glass Caverns. 
---
Tried to get him to give me all his T-51 PA pieces so that I could slap Nuka Cola paint on it, but that's a huge task to convey with no means of communication and he didn't see I had Requested them all in the Trade window :( oh well. heh
---
yeees, man with all of the bullshit put aside, why can't a dude just play some fallout it doesnt matter if its 76, online, offline, exploring the world and seeing some new shit like we never have before in a game still is immersive, like walking through a fallout 4 good ENB? so be it, its a new world to explore, with some familiar stuff.
---
Rusty pic, Ashe heap.
---
They had a sweet protectron-looking skin that was mostly red with some yellow bits on the arms and the mask. I think it would be awesome to have a permanent set of firebreather skins in the store
---
Wait, there aren’t hookers already? Dang, I think I did something really really wrong last time I was in Flatwoods then...
---
nah nah nah, its:
---
".  .. :.: ::. .:. ."
---
A wholesome edgelord
---
15k caps? I'm nearing level 40 and I can't seem to keep them in my pocket.
---
Jesus Christ, would you like them to just snap their fingers?  Rub a magic lamp  How many times does it need to be explained every time someone complains about a bug that this shit takes TIME.
---
Is your problem more important than all of the other bugs people are still waiting on to get fixed?  Because otherwise it has to wait in line while they work on other priorities first.  Then they actually have to get to work on finding out what went wrong, and since this was a sudden bug that means something else they did caused it, which means they can't necessarily undo it without possibly breaking something that, and then they have to try to find a way that fixes it that doesn't then cause an entirely different problem elsewhere.  And THEN they actually have to compile that bug fix with all of the other ones and get it sent out for console certification and THEN you get your fucking bug fixed.
---
That is a major ball ache! Sorry to hear that : /
---
Meanwhile I get people that bring high level enemies to me so they will kill me, take my stuff then call me an asshole for getting in their way.
---
I was just "that guy" who was selflessly doing an extended drum solo while someone else furiously attacked me, then gave me the big thumbs down after the event. Sadly, I didn't figure out why they were so peeved until much later.
---
People REALLY need to start using mics, especially for counterintuitive situations like this.
---
Definitely Wednesday through friday. In the morning. Pacific time. Sometimes I get on for an hour before work the other days. Saturday is family time so I'm hardly on.
---
I'd love to be a super mutant lol
---
first rule of patch club.. dont talk about bugs...
---
I'm gonna build a camp near the southern Belle hotel, the bridge leasing up to it can be built on, so you can fortify the entire bridge and plant crops underneath. There's a few holes that you can probably build stairs/ jump down into to get under the bridge.
---
That actually would be a pretty funny game mechanic. If you aquire all mutations then you turn into a super mutant and then subsequently die after a short time before you are returned to normal....or something a little bit better but you get the idea.
---
lol...
---
kill more mobs
---
Second rule of patch club... don't talk about bugs...
---
Damn straight gave him the 10k caps trophy 😂
---
Kill things that you can cook later
---
Before the nerf to Two shot and the explosive perk I used my two shot Fat man all the time.... But now anymore
---
Me too! Quite proud of OP
---
But what if they are 15+ levels higher than me and they are everywhere
---
I found one a few weeks after you sold me that vats one, I still use both everyday.
---
Did we all forget that everyones dead already and neither faction knows we actually exist at all?
---
For a second there, i read "turn them into Super Mario!" I was like hell yeah!!! Shoot some fireballs and fly!
---
suppressing explosive lever action. I have terrible luck =(
---
Then get up high and kill the mobs
---
team up with people! what system do you play on? doing events with other players and teaming up gives an xp boost
---
Got him. Join my world and FT to me up at Wavy Willard's.
---
Wow buddy this is a pretty significant bug and what is your problem I dont like seeing improvements before fixes but you need a chill pill bro
---
Where do you get all the acid to smelt it?
---
how recent did he talk about the "thing no one has found yet?" because now you've got me interested if there's still a secret out there waiting to be discovered.
---
If you're under level 40 or so, fastest way is to team up with someone high level, tag high level enemies that spawn and let your high level buddy take them care of em.
---
I like the idea of 3 different game modes. I think Bethesda is trying to go too far with the survival mode. I feel like it should just be hardcore... to hell with all the other changes, like leader boards and whatnot. Just make it as close to realistic as possible. I.E. no fast travel, hunt on sight, no compass pips or showing up on the map....things like that.  The first mode could be for people who hate pvp. I do think there should be incentives for using either/or.
---
That would be wicked. I'd pay for that skin in game
---
NaH I didn't forget. We're still doing jobs for those factions so...
---
That's better than my recent one. I fast traveled to Charleston train station for the get a pic of the grafton monster at night challenge. Had some time to kill before nightfall so I wandered over to Poseidon just in time to see a bunch of scorched take down the low level player who had taken the place. I revived him, cleared the scorched, and built him a fusion generator after he started building medium generators to power a resource extractor.
---
Isn't that for the amount of scrap you get? I'm pretty sure I've seen a difference in that at different intelligence levels.
---
This is why I am a "Good Doggy". Dog food is *everywhere*, and at 40% with the perk, it fills the stomach.
---
If I run low, a trip to Watoga will typically net you 12 cans. Near the BoS vendor are two food carts which usually have 2-4. Then the coffee shop which is also right there, anywhere from 4-8. Might get another 1-2 from the tables outside the Appliance store next door. Then over to the west side of town where the PA is behind the lvl 3 locked door, there's usually 2-3. Up the elevator, check the skybridge (civic center side) and 1-2. Back over and through the monorail to the roof top bar for another 1-2. 
---
That, combined with the cans you'll find during your travels, should be enough for like 24 real life hours worth of playing. :D
---
*Who's a good boooyyy?!*
---
You and me both lol
---
This also 👆👆👆
---
Turns out vault 76 wasn't such a controll vault after all. All deaf and only able to use simple ways to communicate... 
---
unless they are bonded by friendship then they can communicate telepathically...
---
 it was one of the mutations...
---
I lost 3 turrets.  I don't think they were destroyed since my camp is in the forest and only lvl 1 spawn.  They just dissapeared.
---
Do you guys use the Un yielding Sentinal set or the Cavalier set? I have the Cavalier set already, but I could sell for the Sentinel if it’s better.
---
Why do you want to contract these diseases?
---
I think it's pretty well accepted this is the case.
---
Bloodied Gatling Gun + 10% damage bonus when aiming.  Hard to argue with 450+ damage a shot across hundreds of shots before reloading.  Bought it from a player vendor to upgrade a 1\* Bloodied Gatling Gun.
---
Power Fists with swing speed are crazy.  I'd love to have Bloodied version of that, although I'm sure a Furious or Executioners version would be decent too depending on the circumstance.
---
Fair enough. I guess I’m just a little slow at connecting the dots lol.
---
Could be an error , happened to me once from the 50+ time i done that event. Sometimes the green ones are empty and the orange ones have stuff and sometimes the green are filled and orange ones empty
---
I'm Cap'm Jack Sparrow, savvy?
---
Exact same thing happened yesterday to me
---
 Sorry got distracted with the basketball game lol I would consider trading for your tse shotgun.  Mine is max level but only 2* . Don't know about duping I've had this since lvl 50.  Haven't sold it because of sentimental value hahaha .
---
I replied to the last email they sent me on my support ticket. I asked for an update on the bag and they replied. Didn't have to open new ticket. If you did your part way back when and got in before the cutoff date then I'd just chill and wait until your bag comes in. If everyone starts getting theirs and yours is still MIA then hit them up again.
---
So, you might think it's bad, but like... I craft 400+ of them at a time to vendor. That's how I stay capped at 125K caps on both accounts. And since this is a specialty character that I'll be bringing out just to do SBQ... it really isn't as bad as it seems.
---
They can never create them fast enough to keep up with consumption, so ehhh, I'd rather something repeatable to give me an excuse to go pop muties and sheepsquatches. If I want quests I'll load up a different Fallout.
---
Lol I got a 4x ammo broadsider the other day:
---
run away and find weaker mobs..
---
You need to always carry the 3lv animal friend , otherwise the  random spawn event  won't spawn any  tamable  creature
---
As far as I recall from when I compared, 4 had three times as many quests as 76. On top of that there were settlements and radiant quests, so while I didn't play daily, it did take me a very long time to complete 4.

I got you my man. Similar boat with my shotgun. 2 star TSE that I acquired. Whats your gamertag? Id be happy to do a swap.
---
Just saw your message on my way
---
Exactly what i was thinking
---
I asked about last I head of it, and was told it's a dev room thing. I'd rather not, harmless though it might be, although please feel free if you know otherwise, redditors, I'd love to make some before next holiday season. I plan to run around in my holiday t51 dropping caps to one and all..
---
I'd sell/ trade mine psn: ryanburns003 by sell I mean caps
---
Assault rifle
---
I'm going to inform the devs now to make sure they're aware. I am sure they are already, but just going to double check :)

So... you poop in the corner?

My 5 sentinal pieces would beg to differ. Every other class of weapons have weight reduction perks.
---
Darn woodwork redditors who hate the idea of fixing stuff. "Oh someone wants explosive vents or workshop needs support bugs fixed? That's f\*c\*&amp;%g stupid I enjoy pain and suffering!" \*Downvotes Post\*
---
That poor 45-70
---
I like the look of it for a new melee character.. does anyone happen to know if it matters what level your character is when you get it? Eg if you get it at level 20, will it be a lvl 20 weapon or max level?  
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah I think there should be a balance. I and the people I play with don't mind the bugs/don't run into anything game breaking. Our real killer is running out of reasons to play (For my friends at least)
---
I've had this happen when I was right next to my camp and was a little over encumbered.
---
Sounds like a good side mission Lol Sometimes im just walking and some just die out of nowhere. I dont touch them i just look at them and die   :(    i knew i was ugly but not that ugly.
---
What plans, is the question. I am crawling through tons of common junk trying to find a faschnaut balloon plan, and all I see is the stuff every level 20 has picked up a few times, often at silly, silly prices.
---
In the same vein, I'd really like to be able to place a chair in front of my terminal so Im not just crouching to use my PC. Let me have a nice gaming chair BETHESDA PLZ?
---
This. Would be great if they were considered as an under armor.
---
Gt smokeyourboots1 won't be on until after the game . send me a message on xbox and ill invite you when im on.
---
Bloody swing speed is better in my opinion
---
How much you looking for I'm on right now
---
I think it scales to the Lvl of the character who gets it
---
lmao It is *literally* to the west of Flatwoods. First workshop I came across at like lvl 10. Took control of it, and since Poseidon was up and running I was set for power, configured it to "Salisbury Steak" and after a couple hours had enough to last me for a week of playing. You can set it to one of 3 different kinds of food, IIRC
---
I even set up two doggy bags on the street with 4, and 4 purified water.
---
Sadly, back then, stuff we dropped despawned after like 10 minutes :(  
---
Not like that anymore, which is nice.
---
But since you've asked....  
---
Did you know that the huge mining machine at the center of the Ash Heap is a workshop?  
---
Aright... but did you know it's a *functional* mining machine? :) 
---
You can create "Power Cores" (or Modules? one of the two), which it takes 4, and then power it up by pressing the big red button in the main control room. Then up a level (and outside), at the end of the conveyor belts (south side) is a machine which spits out refined junk. Of ALL kinds, and by the truck load. It's basically all of the mining machines that we can build on Ore deposits, all rolled into one. But again, it's *already* refined. So it spits out "steel" and "lead", not the ore :D
---
So play/do something else. There's no rule that you have to play fo76 so much, if you're getting bored playing something else will make 76 feel fresh again when you come back. Every time I feel like 76 is starting to become more of a chore than a fun time, I just walk away for a week or so. Come back and love the next month of play.
---
You shouldn't be disappointed that this game isn't perfect for you and you should understand that it is perfect for someone else.
---
You are 100% Right, turns out there is a random world spawn next to my house, it can be either a dead raider body, a briefcase, a lunchbox, or some toolbox, and if it's anything other than the toolbox it seems to spawn a ton of extra grass/rocks/logs in the area that just clip through my C.A.M.P.
---
Sorry I was busy. Are you on now?
---
I have had many mire lurks do this in the past 2 weeks, legendary and normal.
---
Agreed, but they've dangled this thing right in front of us. Took me less than an hour &amp; most of that was getting to starvation heh
---
No problem. I’ll be back on around 6:30 central time
---
&gt; It shouldn't be up to the player to make the game interesting.
---
Yes it should, that's what a sandbox game is. This isn't a themepark game like the other fallouts, it's a sandbox. If you don't like playing sandboxes, move along.
---
I wish there were more interactive quests like this in the game
---
Thanks :)
---
I woulda liked all these free weapons many levels ago. It’s definitely a nice freebee though. I’ve had my BDCG for over a hundred levels. I’ll never get rid of it.
---
Then stop using that pocket... as there's obviously a hole in it! lol
---
That is awesome! Had no idea that existed!
---
Realized recently that for all my playing I usually unlock the same 5 or so workshops, if I bother to unlock any at all.
---
I need to do more just general exploring, I guess
---
If you can power attk alot it is better than swing speed and makes you very hard to kill. Also bloody ss is not easy to get
---
Alright that's cool, thank you for this by the way, I'm sorry for the low price, I'm down on caps.
---
They’re all over the place; not just in white springs. Harper’s ferry, Grafton, etc. I’m hoping they’ll have a featured use soon.
---
No no, the workshops here are hard to defend from other players. In fo4 settlement defense was auto-win if you just showed up. Totally different, one holds your hand, the other is a fight for dominance. This whole thread OP has complained that bethesda isn't holding his hand guiding him through an entertainment wondershow. When people suggest things for him to do, he says stuff like, "players shouldn't have to make the game interesting."
---
There’s a challenge under the “world” section of challenges that gives you 80 atoms to have contracted, what I believe to be, all of the diseases in the game. It’s 22 diseases I think.
---
Never had a pet but i do find it annoying that players come over and kill my brahmin. But at least i can easily repair and it's back. Can't imagine what a hassle it is to replace your pet.
---
Can take hours and lots of server hops
---
Are you using rank 1 or 2?
---
It could be for any number if reasons. If it's someone like me it could be because:
---
 I'm looking to clean a place of junk and I'm familiar with the spot.
---
I'm doing an event in the area.
---
It might be where I put my camp for the time being.
---
Regardless, if I know your there I'm going to show enough common courtesy and offer help, some items or both. If my presence is pushing up the level of mobs I'm not going to just stand there indifferent. Heck, I'll even weedle down the enemies and make sure you get in a tag.
---
It’s like FO76 is a variant of the vault experiments.
---
Probably missed the flatwoods stuff because I quickly wanted to move onto higher level areas, and the only times I usually go back there now is to farm raw plants that spawn along the river north of town.  I don’t think I ever explored further west than the robot facility, except maybe once for a quest.
---
Its nothing but worgen role plays
---
Still more than what FO76 has. Also Fallout NV had change in that the choices you made in previous quests dictated more of what happened in future quests.
---
Except there's literally an entire mode designed for that purpose. Are you upset that you get wrecked in survival and can't pick on the people who aren't interested in pvp in adventure?
---
I haven't gotten another pet until they institute the pet protection like they said they might when they where talking about camp protection
---
More people need to see this post because some I think don’t know they’re pets and start opening fire. Especially if it’s a pet like a mirelurk King. I saw one in a camp and instinctually went to shoot it. Luckily when I hit vats nothing happened and it gave me that second to realize what it actually was.
---
I agree, an there are some pretty good daily an weekly quests if you keep an eye out. Like the weekly challege we have right now for the deathclaw gauntlet. It is by far my best weapon Ive came across...which is kinda sad tho as well. Because I'm level 104, an play damn near everyday 4 to 6 hours. But ALOT of that time is spent gathering, an fighting cause of random encounters. Think the camp system is nice also but, About every 3rd time I fast travel back to my camp Im bamboozled by 3 scorchbeasts an 10 to 12 grunts with it?!?!? What sucks about that tho is I will seek cover to change weapon or take chems. An they will start to fly off into the great unknown with half health to hardly any health. Moral to that stupid story is, I don't get any goodies from them. Even the scorched grunts will be empty. Welllll, I really went off topic...sorry guys. I do love the game lol
---
Yeah, exactly. It has been proved time over time and confirmed on several occasions by Bethesda that camp budget do no increase with level, yet this myth keeps surviving.
---
Cranberry cobblers give you +5％ to exp (can find cranberries at a farm in the North of the forest), and if you check vendor plans and find a Cranberry Relish recipe that will give you +10％ to exp. Add that to the well-rested bonus for a pretty good boost, and complete missions and quests in Survival mode if you can
---
The purveyor gave me a 3 star bloodied explosive light machine gun. I did not like it but understood it is valuable to other players. I managed to trade the lmg for something that i like.
---
Did this and it worked a few times... no longer working. Any ideas?
---
PC wise, amazon had it for $25 about a week and a half ago, then it was $35 last week, it shot back up to $56
---
Xbox is $37 on amazon
---
Playstation is $24
---
Probably about as cheap as you're going to find it on legitimate sites right now. 
---
Amazon has dropped their price on the game at least 3 times since it launched from what I've seen.
---
Its weird, my brother tried to kill my Yao Guai and did no damage to it at all with a mini gun, but he did have pacifist mode on, so might be that. Otherwise I notice when players spawn at my camp, sometimes scorched or super mutants do too and they kill the pet
---
Yeah not much of a mystery there. Best you wear a mask from now on.
---
I'm guessing, they uniform is skirt for women and shorts for men, so it allows men to buy/wear the skirt and women to have the shorts.
---
If anyone's got the shorts on PC, I'd happily trade you the skirt XD
---
Close, Asus took it, bad board
---
What do you think they are for?
---
I like this idea--perks for each PA. I'm not big PA user, but I always carry an 'optimal' set of Excavator and T-51b. It's a shame the differences between the 'best' sets are negligible.
---
I don’t know anything about coding or games, but it doesn’t seem too difficult to put clues on computers or some such.
---
I have had a 3* Black Diamond Skinblade since almost day one.
---
Its not modded with Shards. Add incisor, martial artist plus the 40% Swing speed 50% damage increase when below 50% health that is has, and you have a VERY fast VERY lethal Melee. Native 140 damage.
---
Wait a bit e3 is near so its not too far fetched to expect a sale or something
---
Bethesda's store is 50 percent off
---
The game has been on sale now and then, so if you wait it will surely pop up on sale again. The common media thought it had been reduced in price because it was on christmas sale shortly after its release, like most things during chritmas. But it was just the christmas sale. However, the price has gone down some and every now and then you can get it at a really good price, so keep you eyes open.
---
It is easy to get your money's worth out of it though. Lots of people (me included) has played hundreds of hours of good fun in the game as long as you like exploration, camp building and challenges.
---
Hey, anyone have trouble with the BOS mission heart of the beast. Cant get the termial to work. Done this mission probably 8 times. 4 this week alone...literally the only mission I haven't completed
---
Great points brought up here, I haven’t played much Survival since the introduction of the survival points system. Between having no interest in ever having an exploding weapon that isn’t a grenade/missile/mininuke launcher or getting a full set of sentinel/assasin gear and that I stopped finding any friendly players I’ve just lost interest. I enjoy good spirited PvP in FO76, but if I wanted to play pure deathmatch I’d play a different game.
---
Don't let herd mentality get you down. I paid full price at launch and never complained....much like many other people who still play.
---
I'll tell you something crazy about them, and after you hear this you wont be able to unsee it:
---
They are all on the right side of the door, and they are all made for the left hand. What kind of psychopath would construct a hand scanner like that?
---
From my time on the FO76 sub, it sounds like the consoles aren't as friendly a place as PC. However, I still have seen plenty of people on here that *are* on consoles more than willing to go out of their way to lend a hand.
---
So with that said, I agree with you on wondering what OhGodAScorchBeast has experienced to make them doubt this...
---
Like during Fasnacht, after the event ended we would all drop anything we had gotten that we already had multiples of. We were all more than happy to help each other obtain the things we hadn't yet gotten, or more importantly, help those who weren't able to spend a much time as some of us on grinding the event every time it showed up.
---
Again, my only experience with FO76 is on PC, but since Dec 4th when I finally got it (friend DLed and mailed me it due to my 24gb/mo rural internet), I would have to say that for every 1 "jerk" there are 20 nice people.   
---
I am genuinely sorry to hear that your interactions with players have been the opposite, /u/OhGodAScorchBeast :\\ 
---
It's this "milk of human kindness" in the community which makes me love FO76 so much. Content-wise the game doesn't offer as much as FO3 or 4 (or NV) did, but the awesome community makes up for that, for me at least :)
---
Most people say so, but the way that the power attack stacks with Crits is insane... insane... I’ve played with both, and I much prefer power attack on the powerful weapon and run around with SS knuckles for fun.
---
Game is broken needs fixing first keeps crashing n causing bsod.
---
Having almost never seen him till last week....
---
In the past 2 weeks killed 3 of them....all
---
In the random spawn “scene” spots in southern savage divide....I was pet hunting.....dude spawns alot there.
---
Both Wise Mothman and The regular one.
---
Does that happen? So if it's a pet vats will show white?
---
I've been given a few  Assaultron Heads too. One with anti-armor and +50% crits, now it just has the crits. Who needs the AA anyway?
---
Imagine getting a 2\* Quad and then losing the best part of it after you relog ..
---
It did nothing. Like how now you can’t do vats on the whitesprings bots or other players in adventure mode.
---
But everything, literally everything is mostly one hit anyway. Maybe a high level death claw or the sheep squash are the only enemies that take more than one hit. Why power attack anything if it’s done in one swing. Those that take more than one swing, I’d prefer faster swing speed.
---
I really like my anti-armor ultricite gatling laser that fires 40% faster. Don’t like to use it with PA on as it seems to eat up fusion cores really fast if I do, but I can take down a regular 65 scorchbeasr in about 30 seconds if I get clean shots.
---
I also have a quad exploding combat rifle but I just don’t like that one as much, recoil is just bad.
---
Hey can u help me with that picture.
---
yeah those people are the fuckin worst
---
I tend to claim a workshop every time I log in and i've only had that happen to me like 4 times total, if that counts. In fact, once when i was lvl 40 or something a level 200 dude showed up at HZ-21 after i had finished the defend event and i was like "oh shit are you here to kill me? you can have the workshop man i just don't wanna lose all this acid and nuclear i have in my inventory" and he was like "hell no i hate people like that. Do you want help with anything?" and he invited me to a party and we built some shit together and he took me to some high level places to lvl up quickly and he made me a bunch of dope weapons and stuff at my camp. And he was Dutch so he had a neat accent (also my sister lives in the netherlands with her Dutch bf and he is like one of my fav people in the world so i always get excited when I meet Dutch people because I've been to the Netherlands to stay with them a few times - I live in Canada fyi)
---
anyways basically griefers are obviously the worst and when they take your workshops and one-shot you repeatedly they are being dicks. But there are more friendly people in Appalachia than there are assholes in my experience!
---
Taking over Hemlock Holes grants x3 acid deposits, usually with pretty easy defense events.
---
Hopefully it will result in:
---
* Us joining and dedicating ourselves to one of the factions (Responders/Raiders/BoS/Freestate/Enclave)
---
* Us recuiting NPCs to our Faction T.O.W.N.S. (Teamwork Oriented Wasteland Neighbourhood Systems)
---
* Us competing for control over areas and using these areas to rebuild in the name of our Faction.
---
* Establishing contact with surviving non-human races Mole Miners, non-feral Ghouls, less aggressive Super Mutants like Grahm and hopefully his kin.
---
Whatever it requires to be photographed needs to be on screen in front of you and listed on screen top right while aiming the camera. I found this out earlier top with the scout challenges.
---
I had one for a long time. The damage sucks and it never killed anything.
---
Add the glitch where is couldn’t be aimed down from a height , and it was worthless.
---
The dps makes sense that way. I don’t argue. But every person that I have fought the queen or imposter with has swapped out their SS for PA the damage is that much different. Especially when you’re doing sneak multipliers.  I’m excited for this new feature that allows to show damage done.  Then we will all have numbers to share.
---
Why does it take so long? Does the perk not always work?
---
I'm playing a different game, but when I'm done with the match I'll message you and help you if you're still on then
---
Personal player rooms? Instead of building a C.A.M.P they can just rent a giant room to build in? Kind of like how Final Fantasy Online does it, maybe you pay weekly/monthly or extra to have more rooms and stuff.
---
Blah blah
---
I run a vats crit build with 14 luck and basicaly every crit perk. Certain guns, like ones that have to spin up (minigun/gat laser) or crank (gatling gun) can have problems in vats and many guns use too much AP per shot to make them viable, but with the right rifle and concentrated fire on headshots, you can absolutely wrecker almost anything in the game.  Esp if you focus on silenced rifles and add in a sneak bonus.  Also need gun-fu in agility to jump targets
---
It won’t work for pvp, but then only a few builds really do. For regular gameplay however, it’s amazing. Get a few guns with vats chance/vats cost/crit refill/crit damage mixed on as secondary effects (on top of an executioner’s for example) and you can wreck stuff. I also use a troublshooter’s vats/crit for robots, got one for ghouls, a zealot’s for scorched. It’s fun build, and you don’t need to be low hitpoints or have 10 addictions or run god-roll armor sets to be OP.  AP refresh on armor is ideal but not necessary.
---
When the game first came out, VATs was way less stable. It still doesn’t work for some guns or for melee for flying creatures etc for for rifles/pistols it works great.  I also think most people forget (esp people who played FO3 or FNV where it FROZE time and the player) that you can move around and even jump in VATs now. I think players of previous fallouts forget this and just stand still, which makes it much less effective esp when trying to maintain sneak.
---
When it comes to that I don't agree as dps isn't so important when you do 1500 a hit do I don't mind either way this works wonders without having to grind mur the purveyor, vendors or legendary farming 😊
---
Definitely probably the best earned weapon so far I think.
---
Ok but that acronym is perfect though! Yes, I’m hoping for these things as well. How do you figure the nukes will factor into this? And how do you think they could make a faction control aspect (and towns too for that matter) compelling and rewarding if you always get put into different servers whenever you log on?
---
Omg, I never noticed this!
---
There are only specific creatures it works on, and they are random spawns.....VERY random.
---
Oh, ok. Now I want a pet lol.
---
True. It’s definitely a good weapon. I started with a bloody 1* and haven’t used a different mele since. Traded up as I went along.
---
I get that. FO4 was my first game so I don’t have anything to compare it to.
---
Me too
---
If your pacifist , it does not count in  VATS as an enemy.
---
Which means either people are not paying attention, or intentionally taking them out cause your first hit is free....
---
This was a quest in Far Harbor already, though
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Surely the has been more than one murder mystery in history. 😋
---
They aren't pretty, but thats the reason they exist. They can be moved.
---
I dm'd you about me being back on what's your ign?
---
Have this happen to me also,mayby two times
---
Might be in the “advertisement posters” set
---
Damn that looks awesome!
---
I had thought so, so I had bought them and it sadly was not in the set.
---
Aww :( I have it but I’m not sure how I obtained it then. Best of luck finding it tho
---
I catch someone in my camp and the door is open I lock them inside. Yea it’s just a Bobby pin and shuffling your cards a bit, but I decided it’s enough of a nuisance to get the point across.
---
1 cranberry relish an hour and plenty of rest
---
Rank 2
---
Not everyone knows the rules for contesting workshops. My first time was just past lvl 100, I was contesting with a lvl 10 and wanted to just scare him a little bit, so I shot him (thinking it would reduce the damage since in my mind we weren’t in PVP yet) and he died.  Felt bad and followed him to his camp to give him some stimpaks and rad away.
---
You might be right! I leveled up cap collector but I'm pretty sure it's just eating my caps at this point. :(
---
Dailies and events are like an improvement on radiant quests
---
I am glad to hear you're a decent person. As for people down voting based on the title alone LOL Welcome to the "who got time for that"? era. People who downvoted probably didn't even read the entire title. Just enough to get the jist, then move on!
---
I'd accept that but the guy chased me while I was popping stims and trying not to die to his explosive weapon. Chased me down to Poseidon completely exiting the workshop area.
---
My deathclaw still shows as red and if I spawn at my camp when I join the game - for a few moments it shows as unowned and I have the ability to kill it :/ I really wish they would introduce protections for pets as well. I did choose pet &gt; shop and made a shop on my other character since I don’t want to lose my deathclaw.. again
---
But they have weight reduction cards for every weapon type but rifles: heavy melees, Pistols and shotguns all have cards that don’t require you to need the armor perk
---
This has always driven me crazy
---
That’s why you always shoot them before they even have an opportunity to respond. Sorry your niceness got taken advantage of.
---
What the hell happened here?!?
---
any mod you buy doesn’t require perks unless you buy the plan
---
I think if you get the mods themselves, you can apply regardless of perk or resources.
---
If you buy the plan so you can craft the mods. That might require perks and definitely require resources.
---
I would be terrorfied
---
Exactly what I want to know!!!!!
---
🙋🏼‍♂️
---
Just an Update ---&gt; based on your feedback I cut the price of the maps from $500 each to $35 each ..."Attention Walmart shoppers"
---
As an additional thank you to everyone who commented and the game population as a whole i dropped pretty much all my prices by anywhere from 50% to 90%
---
Lawd knows I luvs me da peeps dat be livin in da wass'lan
---
Not ruined, I support gifts but I think giving someone 15k could take away some of the satisfactory progression feeling in the game. Nevertheless it was a kind hearted deed
---
Seems like the kind of person. Who wants to destroy things but not face pvp., Too many consequences for them.
---
I guess in buying the mods from the enclave vendor? Never seen plans available
---
To x01 mods even have plan versions?
---
//that’s what the gutsys say when they find a dead robot
---
i don’t know honestly i don’t use much power armor anymore
---
That's odd. The wiki said that rank 2 would produce a third cannonball but rank 1 would not. That's a real shame because I just made a whole build with the broadsider incorporated in it and left my agility at 2 just for this purpose. 
---
Hopefully it's just a bug but at least super duper should still work
---
I know. That’s also what I say when he says it.
---
Yes they are in the modus vendor in the enclave bunker
---
They do as of last month. You can buy them (along with the x-01 military paint) from the armory guy in the whitesprings bunker. That's NOT the military area, it's on the other side of the bunker, with the factory-looking room, close to the science and medical wings
---
I want a holotape of sanjay briefing the event as a reward
---
With all the vendor kiosks?
---
Early on (like lvl 30) was fixing some things are whitesprings when a 150+ lvl guy bought out ever vender while I was at a bench, all I needed was some water so I gave the thirsty emote and he dropped hundreds of random rounds and other junk, even some food but no water 😹 then disappeared
---
I love just wandering the FO and TES maps. More so than playing the main quest... I've actually not "beaten" Skyrim or FO4 lmao However, I have been to all four corners. From the highest points, to the lowest points, and everything in between. To that end, I personally still feel I got my money's worth. heh
---
There's so much to see on the map which aren't even legitimate POIs, too. Murgle the cat, in the Ash Heap. The lone cabin in the far North-East corner of the map. The skeleton on top of one of the Mansions just East of Charleston (need Marsupial or a Jetpack), laying in a pile of probably 50 empty Nuka Cola bottles. The Raider camp in the way North of the Savage Divide.
---
And, of course, Grahm and Chally the Moo-Moo! Which, sadly, I haven't ran into them since Patch 8...   
---
I absolutely love Grahm's banter, especially the ""conversations"" he has with Chally! Honestly, if Grahm and Chally ran for President, I'd vote for the.
---
 Sounds like you need to hit my weight loss clinic. I stock sets with the weight reduction affixes. I can make that 24 lb handmade weigh .24
---
Coolio!
---
Bloodied +50% vats crit dmg handmade.
---
I didn't know this happened to other people.
---
Heavy Gunner perks stacked max, Bloodied Mess.  If in PA, Stabilized (for aim, not the glitched energy AA) and One Man Army. If bloodied, Nerd Rage.
---
A "stash" that is conveniently the same size as magazines...
---
Box of Angel Soft tissues...
---
And a curious white stain on the carpet...
---
Uh huh. Just so happened to "run across" this.  
---
I bet you run across it every day around that same time, don't you? ;)
---
If you want to up the damage you can prime it, but then you have to farm ultricite ammo mats. 
---
Outside of that just perk cards
---
Me neither. Maybe the turret accidentally got shot by another turret. No idea for sure, unfortunately, beyond that turret suddenly showing as hostile.
---
I've also had Molemen and robots both show up as friendlies though while in the middle of fighting each other. I sat back with some unpopped corn and watched.
---
Yes please, and make all the Clue references!
---
Agree... not to mention that Ultracite doesn't get all the mods...
---
If you still have that gun I'll pay you 15k and give you a bunch of serums to sweeten the deal.
---
Using spoiled food to cook up explosives that ultimately kill others who drop their junk, potentially giving you the other ingredients? Well done my good sir
---
Don't forget demolition expert 😉😁
---
And even IF it were a top priority bug IT STILL TAKES ALL OF THE STEPS AND TIME I BOTHERED EXPLAINING IN THE FIRST PLACE.  The ONLY time you will EVER see immediate fixes are if they're purely server side tweaks that only require bringing the servers down briefly to patch them without an update or if it's an ABSOLUTE emergency like the one and only hotfix we've ever seen so far when they accidentally overwrote a chunk of the games build with outdated code.
---
Unfortunately Demo Expert has no effect on the damage card of explosive Gatling Plasmas! Which sucks, cause they are my current fav!
---
Seems like a shitty situation for them.
---
I don't know where within the Whitesprings resort you would find each vendor. But....
---
Camden Park and Grafton (not the station by the one north of the station) always have the Excavator plans.
---
Watoga Shopping Plaza (BoS) vendor bot has all the T-51b, T-45 and T-60 plans. 
---
The enclave bunker - military wing has all the X-01 plans.
---
SBQ drops the Ultracite plans.
---
As for the mods, each vendor has a chance to have them, but very rare depending on which one your'e looking for. Unless you plan on server hopping for hours, you might be better off buying the plans to craft yourself, buying the mods off someone or paying someone to craft them for you.
---
The best attribute of the Ultracite is it's radiation resistance.
---
It sucks even more that radiation damage don't benefit from damage boosting perks/chems/legendary effects. Doesn't matter if you are doing like 5k damage per shot with your radium rifle. Your rad damage will stay 15
---
Had this show up for me just after... Patch 6 launched I think it was. Whichever was the first of Wild Wasteland.
---
Mine was also Scorched, in the Cranberry Bog. Was quite excited to see this new beast, which I had noticed in the Wild Wasteland advertisement, but saw no mention of. Was bummed when it turned out to be a bugged description :(
---
I get Philadelphia experimented into the goddamn walls or floor often myself and have to fast travel just to get unstuck.
---
I don't understand the point of locking up an entire house. Maybe a room, but no one can steal furnishing.
---
Ah, yeah, that would be a pain. I don't run bloodied so I just pop a Radaway when it starts to get to be too noticeable.
---
Awesome. I'll probably hit you up next week. I'm only playing during the week, weekends are for the wife.
---
It has mods but the best ones are RNG dependent in the worst possible way- meaning you can only get them in the form of plans from the scorched beast queen and they have  a ridiculously low chance of dropping. 
---
Look, they don't have to be pathetically easy to get but good God.  Instead of being too easy, goes to the other ridiculous extreme.   Kill the scorched beast queen 100 times, and you get plans for explosive vents about 70-80 times.
---
I think you mean: Three-Star Legen......
---
*...wait for it...*
---
...dary!
---
Anyone else experience fleeting excitement when they run into stuff like bobby pins or clipboards in real life?  Like just for a second I'm like "Ohhhh.  I need that"
---
Yeah someone killed me once because I spawned into their place, then told me on message I shouldnt have come inside.  Like WTF?!
---
Ah, that sounds awesome! I wonder if it would have been different if I had a headset. I left mine at work, so I was playing in silence. Maybe if I had it, I could heard if it was a 10-year-old kid or some shit.
---
"over a month" means absolutely nothing.  Any updates since then haven't neglected to include a fix for this out of spite, it's because those patches existed before this was even a problem.  They aren't just finishing up an update and releasing it the next week, it can take weeks for updates to get properly checked on Bethesda's end and move through console cert before they're actually ready to be pushed out to everyone at once.  Even IF they managed to find and fix this bug the day it was found and STILL wouldn't likely be seeing it until the next update at the soonest.
---
So if I were to buy the plans, not the mods, what perk is necessary?
---
If you can find someone to craft you the BoS recon rifle it comes with a suppressor, hardened receiver and recon scope. It can be crafted at level 1.
---
I scrapped about 100 marine armor hoping to get me some buttressed mods. I boosted my INT up to mid 50 after hearing about the bonus and got a pocketed/asbestos something mod. Big disappointment
---
i'd sacrifice the underarmour stats just for the rad resist and helmet.  
---
and also can put on my (deep)-pocketed armour over it, that'd be nice
---
Gordon Gekko would be proud.
---
From what I seen if you have pacify mode on other players can damage you pet I had a few people shoot my megasloth and it did no damage to it
---
Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling? A fresh boot of the operating system? Are you running a x86-64 processor?
---
Wont work, gotta pick it up yourself
---
I once had a random Sentry bot by Belching Betty give me threats while following me and killing my enemies? It was so weird, and they were long gone when I popped into the mine and back out.
---
When The Action Hero was out as a weekly reward, I did all the crafting with my lvl 3 alt and I got me a lvl 45 version
---
Or have locks work one way... not exiting...
---
I personally always close the door when I leave a camp by another player. I'm trying to be very polite when playing with others.
---
Part of the reason everything is full price again is because of the improvements they have made. When it first released, it was essentially a $10 game. Now it's actually worth the price tag. 
---
That said I never regretted since I trusted they would fix the Bugs.
---
That would depend on which mod specifically. Some of them don't require any perks. If they require a perk, it would be the Power Smith perk which allows advanced power armor mods to be crafted.
---
What platform are you on? Which mods you looking for?  I'm on PS4 and might be able to help you out.
---
I spawned into a few that have extractors in them... they’re locked as well but so are the doors...  no way out except to fast travel...
---
Obligatory post that I'm the 420th person to upvote. Feel my dank.
---
Oh ok thanks for the tip
---
I keep a list of names of the players with that same exact "Fire Sale" camp.
---
I then go and get the usually-there Power Armor out of the shed from the mine to the north, walk it down to the entrance to the vending machines, "Drop" it right in the doorway, and pull the Fusion Core. :) 
---
I'd have been fine with it, if they just kill me and didn't steal my junk. OR if I was playing in Survival, which I wasn't. 
---
Joke was on him though, as I didn't buy anything, *and* had just left Flatwoods where I gave all my junk to a new player lol
---
Xbox, sadly.
---
I want to craft the reactive armor or the Tesla coils on my x01 torso.
---
Tesla fists and of course the carry capacity for my legs. All x01
---
Assluttrons rooms... WS is really a brothel...lol
---
Everytime I read that line, it's in Hulk Hogan's voice.
---
I’d rather have some more tales from West Virginia hills
---
I lucked out and got an Executioner's handmade the other night which has the third perk of 90% reduced weight. I'm never letting this thing go.
---
I'm weary of skins.
---
Reports everywhere that the skins are glitched and may cause legendaries to loose attributes/stars.
---
Buyer beware.
---
Dang, this will always be on my mind now. When I see a robot or enemy die when I look at them, I always assumed they'd rather take their own life than by my sword (gun). :/
---
You might have to be far enough back to get all/most of the target in the frame. I took a shot of Top Of The World from right underneath and it didn’t work. I had to go all the way to the railroad station before it listed the name on the screen and counted. 
---
There are also fossils right around there, if you need them.
---
How does a player become “built for PVP” if they aren’t already ⁉️
---
DONT BELIEVE THE LIES, JOINT THE INSTITUTION
---
I've got dense torso armor and Fireproof perk equipped; explosions of any kind don't really touch me.
---
Oh, is that so. I never knew that.
---
It's in the communist poster set, weird naming scheme for that set!
---
I actually often wacth the caps from the map, while looking my vending customers.(just to check I don't go over max) Opening the map always shows caps. Opening pipboy may show caps. Or you might need to switch view.
---
And the weight is kinda relevant too as going over carry limt prevents fast travel.
---
But time should be displayed more. It's not displayed on all pipboy pages so it's stupid that you need to click several times to view the time. And then switch back to normal inventory view. So time could perfectly also be diplayed on map.
---
Those who don't intrest in time, there are several perks that require specific times. Like healing and rad curing. I wouldn't want to use stimpak if it's 5 AM because then 6 AM is right aroung the corner and it heals to full fairly fast.
---
It requires radiant or nearby power
---
Thanks! Additionally, do you know where I could get the plans for the Communist Posters?
---
Idk the science but it's significantly faster
---
I dont have pylons lol but I did just build a rolling door, or do like conduits provide power to lights too?
---
Thanks
---
I know they say they cant do anything but reduce weight is the 3rd star and explosive is the 2nd star, so if they saq the item was 2 star but had weight reduction that would technically be impossible? So they could tell you are(except about lying what the 2nd star was) correct.
---
If the item only has a bolt but no actual number listed for power requirements,  then it doesn't require a wire to be directly connected to it.
---
Items like lights just require to have a conduit or power radiator nearby for them to turn on.
---
What Platform?
---
Actually if you get one from a friend all you have to do is sell it to a Vendor bot and then buy it back.
---
How about the propaganda posters?
---
Try checking out the Harpers Ferry and Watoga vendors
---
I. And wait to experience this. Someday I hope!!
---
I know that I just figured lights that didnt need to be wired together needed a pylon but I dont have one built but do have conduits inside and outside my house
---
PS4
---
I've always used the cache at Overseer's or at the church in Flatwoods.
---
Well T-51b has level b upgraded armor, which is 2 levels higher than base which is what Ultracite is based on.
---
I'm still playing if you want to join
---
This is a great idea!
---
Lucky you!
---
I fought him several times near Seneca Rocks, between the mountain and observatory.   Also several times at the random encounter spots near Crevasse Dam.  When you fast travel to the dam there’s an encounter within sight already, behind that is a pickup truck w a toolbox in the back, follow that road until the crater near the crashed trucks and there’s a second encounter.   Recently I found him at an encounter spot on the north east side of Watoga on the road.
---
Me to but you can fast travel to Vault 76 for free
---
Modus is so cliche with all the pauses haha (I know it's on purpose) but I like the intellectual side.
---
Shut yer yapper.
---
I believe it's considered one if the beat in the game...
---
Will do
---
Both
---
This would toss melee under the bus entirely.
---
Just add varying difficulty levels and make everything have however much more damage and armor per difficulty.
---
Meat Hook is kinda crap even when compared to unarmed weapons from my experience. Might be a decent backup weapon if your main melee breaks but other then that probably not worth much.
---
So how do i know im in your lobby?
---
Could put a stash box there as well so that, if your stash box is full, you can just transfer some junk to the container without having to get over-encumbered
---
Beautiful
---
I picture a wooden box with a handwritten "free" sign above it lol
---
If we could have a Camp at V76 we could open a Goodwill.
---
Thanks, I ended up doing that!
---
Yeah I converted one of my old four story foundation bases into a pit with a deathclaw used to bait peeps with a shop was kinda funny to watch but yeah alot of work to find a high lvl random..
---
You want "Swing Speed", sorry. The Meat Hook is a "fast" melee weapon that happens to have godlike DPS when it has a Swing Speed bonus. You don't see Super Sledges and other powerful, slow weapons in PVP because of that STUPID one-shot filter Bethesda put in the game a couple months back to stop one-shot kills. The new meta is DPS because of it. And the Swing Speed meat hook has some of the best for melee, currently.
---
In the Greenbrier (the real Whitesprings) the doors within the main building are ballrooms and event rooms. The outside buildings are cottages you can rent. I’m betting something similar considering how close Bethesda recreated the Greenbrier
---
OP here: I ended up getting it for about $30 from Bethesda.net, thanks to the heads up from u/Ender_0 See you in the wasteland! Especially those of you going to Wasteland Weekend this year!
---
Weird and amazing! Like the Insultbot except way more menacing!
---
true
---
Well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
My latest build doesn't even have doors. Got tired of finding them open.
---
Check out his other channel that has the machinama videos he did during his WoW days.  Different vocal pacing and quite funny.
---
It’s glitched, that warning never pops up. I’ve restarted the game and it still doesn’t work.
---
I've been so out of the loop on this, so I look forward to seeing what's been done. I did play the beta for like 40 minutes, but was kind of meh about it. But, I've got the wasteland itch so I figure it's time to give it a fair shake.
---
Why not Zoidberg
---
I'm on PC. I just hit level 11 and find myself checking the map often to see if a higher level player is closing in. Sometimes they sweep into a location ahead and ransack everything.
---
Bethesda probably just didnt want to make interiors for all of those rooms
---
It doesn’t work, it functions like a note and offers no options. Can’t open the map or get the warning to pop up. Changing severs and restarting the game didn’t fix it.
---
No, its a fact. The battle royale market is flooded and no one will come back to this game to play a battle royale unless Todd Howard himself is personally playing each and every match.
---
When is this e3?
---
Make it a baby stroller that makes a crying sound when they get close.
---
It’s no problem. It’s always nice to help out a fellow player
---
Sunday 8pm EST for the Bethesda conference.
---
I've got mine to \~1605 dmg passively without adrenaline or any consumable buffs. It nearly killed a level 65 SB with just a normal power attack. My meat hook is still stronger but at the cost of using less defensive perks. Still, this is now my new primary. Add consumable buffs and sprint/sneak attacks and I can say that it truly is an unstoppable monster.
---
Honestly I completely disagree. The best part of 76 imho is the diversity of tools and ways in which we are able to make our own fun. Its what I love about video games in general. Its what pulls me back to Minecraft after almost 10 years of playing. The reason I vouched for this game so hard through its launch and controversy is I saw the true potential the game has as Bethesda has created a world that we get to help create and then continued to listen and deliver on the things that the players want to see in order to augment their experience. Sure quests are fun but what keeps me coming back is the characters, experiences, and memories I’ve created and the interactions I’ve had with the game and the community that motivate me to continue to play.
---
Ok, thank you 👍
---
If you pacify it and immediately server hop it will not be red any longer, and remain not red. Also may not damage your CAMP as much with it's aoe (in my experience anyway... mine kept popping my balloons till I did that.)
---
Sounds like a personal problem
---
Right? But I'd love to get that caliber as a receiver mod for the lever action!
---
So glad I finished the Rose quest line. Same thing happened here. When I get to making alts, I'm gonna use my main to craft decent gear so I can level up faster, then fly past the rose quests so I only have to hear her once
---
I bought 5 maps yesterday from the machine at the Nuka Cola factory... each time I opened it, it gave you a warning. 
---
Have you tried buying a new map?
---
I walked past some bundles of wood at a gas station a little bit ago and thought "hm I always do need it".
---
I stopped playing for 6 months...picked it back up a few days ago and am hooked again!
---
I do somewhat agree. But I am willing to see what it's like before jumping to conclusions. I think it's more likely than not; going to be horrid. They should really be fixing all the broken and unbalanced mechanics before doing a significant expansion toward PvP.
---
Leave the door open and Super mutant squatters will get it.
---
Okay, but jetpacks and flamethrowers?
---
Meat Hook has one of the highest possible dps in game, if not the highest.
---
Gamma ray guns?
---
Be there in 10/15ish if that's cool
---
It's solid. You can probably deal like close to 1k damage with it assuming you have the appropriate perks/upgrades.
---
Gamma guns or the Executioners modifier on a high RoF rifle, I also avoid explosive weapons as most tend to run fireproof as well. Critical hits also bypass DR and the passive resistances.  
---
I main a bloodied heavy gunner.
---
To be fair they made it very clear that select items were leaving and discounted them. That’s kind of this weeks “Chillout” thing.
---
PvP.
---
Honestly I'm not the best when it comes to PvP in fallout so my 2 cents may not be what your looking for. but..
---
I use a gamma gun against bloodied players. that and there may be some perk cards to take that reduce damage from certain weapons types but I only use fireproof because I hate TSE weapons. why a gamma gun? you may ask.
---
not many players protect against rads when they use bloodied builds. and the best part is that most "meta" builds require them to be highly irradiated to get more damage with whatever the weapon they are using (especially melee.) they will sit at 80% to 90% rad damage with only 20% or so health  and will usually do health regeneration and basic damage protection but not radiation
---
all you have to do is pull one out real quick and shoot them two maybe three times and they keel over from radiation. can't guarantee it will work 100% of the time cause they might have lead lines armors or have some rad resistance perks but then again I mean...come on.
---
who uses a gamma gun? lol
---
Making legendaries more common doesnt seem like a good balance change, the goal is to have less bullet sponges
---
Cool! No more radiation damage in nuke zones or anywhere else, no more diseases, all the mutations, get to hang out with all the cool kids at West Tek, get to basically be in power armor at all times without even wearing power armor, I see no problems with this.
---
Thanks for holding him! I’ll just be here hopping until he inevitably dies.
---
Ultracite has superior rad resistance, which is supposed to give it a situational endgame edge in nuke zones.
---
Do what you will with this information.
---
He died rip
---
How do you tag them
---
Rip in pieces. Thanks once again though!
---
Just shoot them once with any weapon
---
Welp sounds simple enough...
---
That usually occurs when a person is over encumbered. Why Bethesda decided to program it that way is still an unknown.
---
WOULD YOU LIKE TO?
---
My guess would to prevent someone from running an area like westek, finishing up with 600 lbs of assault rifles then just dieing and respawning at a train station.
---
Shhh, my child, drink this nectar of atom. ..
---
Tripod could prove interesting. But when you mod that 0.024 pound camera with a tripod, it’ll weigh 27 pounds cause...Bethesda.
---
I know I have seen them open more than one time before, specially during nukes. I don't know how to open then tho.
---
Future dlc, we will wake up and actually go outside the vault
---
Would the corpse just outside the Vault door work?
---
God sake, stop posting this kind of begging already, they won't add any music, at least in regular update. 
---
Do you realise that Bethesda can't just simply add it in game? 
---
Okay, Johnny Cash for example, how much it could be for a in game usage? Simple answer - shit load of money.
---
I'm quite sure that Bethesda won't spend about few hundred thousands bucks for a several songs that you just asking lol.
---
If you're on PC, try to mod your radio or smth if you want personal music.
---
I bought it in November, but didn't really get to playing it till about February and March. Is definitely a lot better than it used to be
---
A power connector bleeds power to 9 tiles (3x3) horizontally and two stories vertically. If you place a power connector on the center roof tile, power will radiate to each adjacent roof tile, wall, floor, foundation, and even the ground.
---
This happens to me when I play on one server for a long time.  People log off of the server and people don't seem to log in after a while.
---
Don't worry the same thing happens here
---
Some guy goes into the golf club kills all the ghouls , takes all the gold outfits etc 
---
And leaves nothing
---
So many core systems and functions in the game are broken or poorly done, they really do need some type of "summer cleaning" patch. 
---
All the new features are great, but I'd much prefer a few less features and a more complete and balanced game. 
---
A lot could be done with some real focus on bug fixing and game balance all around!
---
How does that relate to halloween in the West Virginia?   As a costume? Enemy?
---
Is this the one where you have a chance of finding more caps in caps stashes? Be sure to actually press the "search" or "transfer" button, opening the full UI, this is how perks like this activate.
---
Agreed.  Come in, play my piano, take a nap on the bed, admire my fusion generator, just close the dang door when you leave!  You'll let the blood bugs  in.
---
Just go in pacifist mode. They're considered part of your camp and are immune to damage as long as you don't engage someone in PvP.
---
🙋♂️
---
it would be cool if you could hook a pressure plate up to the door like minecraft so it will close automatically, I feel you on this 200 %.
---
Come out to the coast, well get together, have a few laughs!
---
We call it rake damage, as if your character is wandering around seemingly safe, and steps on a rake out of nowhere
---
Yes but no. Lol great if i use it bad if they use it against me lol i was actually thinking about this earlier. Rad x or rad-away syringer.
---
No joke.  I saw a roll of duct tape in my parent's secretary and my first thought was to scrap it for adhesive.  🤪
---
Wasn’t the meat hook recently fixed so it didn’t use both melee card types?  Unarmed and one handed I think.
---
Screws are so hard to find.
---
I will have to check it out lmao
---
I get what your saying man fuck these but hurt people.
---
The only thing I want is long press to do actions with animations.
---
  
---
There is nothing I hate more than crawling into bed while a ghoul attacks me, and ultimately kills me before I get up, all because I wanted those sugar bombs.
---
now i know what a tv dinner feels like
---
They have 20% hp, why you don't shoot first and kill then in one shot? O.o
---
Is that the royal “we”?
---
You're pathetic. Grow up.
---
...you know those quotes NEVER get old.
---
I’m always looking for plans I don’t have yet. Especially cosmetic stuff for my camp. Ammo sells well at my vendor, but I don’t buy it much (I sell everything for 1 cap per bullet).
---
Are we communists now
---
Are you still in game development?
---
I don't think so? I see a lot of other people calling it rake damage, so I said "we" as a player base that experiences it and collectively use that name. But I'm not sure what you're asking.
---
Maybe an enemy like in FO3? I don't want to see them in Appalachia. They were nasty. 
---
Maybe some jack o lanterns on porches would be okay
---
I'll paste what I said in another thread:
---
Nuclear winter is almost certainly going to have a new PvP battle Royale game mode. But why is this a huge issue? 
---
All of the dlc is free, and the game mode will be optional. I am confident there will be LOADS of new pve content announced at E3 coming for the game over the next few years. Some of you might not like PvP, but there are people who do. And who knows, this new game mode might bring in an influx of NEW players, where some of them actually stick around after the hype is over. New players are GOOD for 76.
---
I typically just look for plans at a good or affordable deal. I personally sell all my plans for 50-100. 
---
Now I’ve found people will buy ammo. 45’s are pretty hot because of combat rifles. Had someone buy a bunch I had before I moved up to the combat rifle. I sell all my ammo at 1 cap. 
---
I have no use to buy chems. I get so much I typically sell it off to make more room. 
---
Rare or not as common outfits could sell.
---
I really like the prototype skin on the ultracite too. I bought it awhile back.
---
-laughs sadly in modified Gauss rifle-
---
I agree with Mega Sloth about plans, and recipes. It's almost like a collecting addiction! I'd also add Stimpaks... Everyone seems to have diluted and super, but I've found regular Stimpaks to be quite rare!
---
Definitely fireproof as number one due to the amount of explosive weapons. Then imo Ironclad and then life giver
---
An Exterminator’s Explosive Railway Rifle that I missed with the automatic receiver. I got it from the legendary vendor. Love that weapon....
---
Now I want to see a trash talking 40 year old single mom wrecking in pvp woth a bloodied build...
---
What will be "pathetic" is if these developers wasted dev time on something the game doesn't and has never needed. The battle royale hype is dying out and it will come off as nothing more than a cash grab. 
---
Unless of course the developers have figured out the amazing formula for a vastly original take on battle royale. Although that is unlikely considering these are the same devs that couldn't get player vending into the game for 6 months when it was in the original trailer.
---
Because we have serendipity on
---
Instigating DCG with swing speed. It's the reason i hardly ever wear power armor.
---
It will not bring anyone new into the game unless it is utterly original. Count how many BR games are on the market as of right now, no one wants to play another half hearted stagnate battle royale.
---
What system are you on?  If you're JUST starting, just do the quests for now.
---
Tbh plasma gatlings not all that great better just give it to me
---
Definitely Fireproof. Lifegiver is superior to Ironclad for typical DR/ER values, especially beyond the first card. Adamantium Skeleton might be another option, because explosive weapons also deal a lot of limb damage.
---
They need to fix the durability of this weapon first. I have a two shot and it breaks before 40 rounds have been fired through it.
---
They are going to announce more at E3 for 76 than just the new PvP mode. Relax. Remember when people were doom and gloom when they announced survival mode for wild Appalachia? Look how much new pve content came with that dlc. Bethesda knows their player base. There will be other FREE content to come this summer.
---
I agree with you that battle Royale is over saturated right now, but to say that it wouldn't bring in any new players at least short term is incorrect. New players are good for this Game.
---
Yeah same, i dont stop paying because i cant Complete a challenge or a weapon doesnt repair properly or something, but i will stop playing if i log on and think, "well, what do i do now?"
---
tried it the other day, didn't work for me. Used to work.
---
hey, me too! see you then! :D
---
Ok so I have 5 endurance, so after the 3 in fireproof what do you think would be the best way to spend the last two points?
---
Yea that’s kinda what I figured, thanks for the response!
---
I’m on Xbox One
---
not even close to true. I never use chems except when in a rad zone, and i have to eat and drink constantly. If it was 45 to 50 minutes this thread probably wouldn't exist. If i go 5 minutes between drinking I get thirsty, same with eating. I also have 1 point into eating and drinking perks.
---
Fantastic idea.  
---
Would love being a behemoth!
---
Maybe when private servers are out but it would be difficult to do with how it is now i agree
---
Sure does -50% disease resist
---
Thanks. I’ll try there as well
---
Wait, how do we lock our shit?
---
Pets aren't killable unless you're in combat with that player... So, your pet is dying to NPCs that other players are just ignoring. There is also a bug where you pet can just randomly die but it only happens when you first get the pet.
---
FO24: Stalin Edition
---
Sold mine for 3k.
---
Red names. Must die. I don't make the rules sorry.
---
I wouldnt say they are close by any means, the map of 76 is a scaked down version of the entire state remember, and they are literally in different biomes of the map, seperated by a mountain range, 2 rivers and multile towns.  
---
We also see the scale of the map when you see the scale of the nukes that we drop, in theory, the red circle of nuke zones is about city size
---
I wish I had read this thread before I took over that workshop and got 6!, 6! Packages of sugar bombs the “wrong” sugar bombs today. :(
---
Yes, yes it does.  
---
And do you have any candy that doesnt taste like roofies?
---
I don't think they will ever make them work with underarmour/armour, since it pretty much means you don't take any RADs and having that would be so much better than PA. 
---
Hazmat Suit + All Armour + Backpack? 
---
Negates a lot of damage, and also RADs.
---
I can, why can’t you?
---
Blast Hardcheese
---
I get pretty shitty rewards every day myself. usually end up waiting until the next day to rescrap.
---
Yesterday I spawned under someone’s camp. It was awesome being stuck under the wooden support floor and having to fast travel to a nearby map marker. Then to track my way up the hill to find nothing worthy to buy for myself.
---
Mythic chameleon deathclaw or alpha chameleon deathclaw would be nice and increase their DR and give them incisor and fireproof perks
---
Ah, can’t now, but I’ll try to get to you next weekend, GT is IIIRipPacIII
---
I look forward to meeting you.
---
Would either of you let me revive you in water it’s the last thing I need to finish being a tadpole😃
---
Same here. 20 minutes later it was a 2 star and rescrapped, didn't even know the bug existed before that.
---
They should add a machine that lets you load in the Holotape games you've found, and people visiting your camp can play them and try beat your high score.
---
No it is not. There are many game breaking bugs still in the game, and the game should be playable before they shit out more content.
---
I mean, with best DR I think you want heavy BOS Combat is most defense
---
Was gonna upvote but it's at 69. I don't make the rules...
---
Marina armor would be better than BOS no? I could be wrong idk
---
...I feel like a fool now, I didn't even realize there was a search option, how many caps have I missed out on!
---
Do you not understand? No ones gonna about bug fixes if there isnt new content dumbass
---
i just want pockets with my hazmat suit
---
I'm surprised they haven't added a horde of deathclaws event.
---
Well, in terms of easiest to get it’s heavy BOS but apparently after a quick search is Forest Scout Armour
---
I've started using my map marker as free advertisement for my shop, at this point. I've got a safe room, so even when I'm being hunted, people can still come and buy things while I wave through the walls and invite them to trade. There's no way to hit me to engage in PvP, so the CAMP is safe, and sometimes I'll even just go AFK and take a nap, see if I get overtaken on the leaderboard.
---
Man, if they can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t *deserve* you.
---
I feel like armoring real low level players defeats the purpose of the game. Later yeah, sure obliterate everything with your sweet gear. Low levels should scramble just like we all did. 
---
If you want to really help them out just sell some sweet outfits for cheap. Just my 2 cents.
---
Plans, serums, screws, springs, gears, ammo. Can't ever have enough screws and I rarely see people selling them.
---
I’m so happy you said this... I’ve killed scorched, mutant, and ghouls with deathclaw gauntlet and was about to lose my mind.
---
Hi could either of you help me by letting me revive you in water it’s the last thing I need to finish being a tadpole👍
---
As of late I've been looking for specific junk. For me there's only a handful of plans I don't have yet so they're not high on the priority list.
---
Polymer forest scout has the best DR? I would've never thought
---
I'm in the same boat. I pop into my armor for rad resistance and stabilized and that's about it, I carry enough ammo to sponsor a queen fight and on my standard armor 5/5 pieces have ammo weight reduction. 
---
Bullet farming fits a raider lol
---
Mama DOLCEEEEES
---
Well it’s what I read 
---
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3xzjx/best_nonpa_armor/
---
I look for everything and anything under priced.
---
Be careful with orbital strikes. Any explosions that can stagger melee builds under the queen are not good.
---
Currently I hunt for outfits, but also buy all unknown cheap plans, and if fuel is 1 cap I buy it all.
---
-That's your opinion
---
-No, it's a fact
---
Why are you like this?
---
Wrong god... Says you!
---
Wow awesome
---
For scientific purposes, whats your lv when found this last pet?
---
And finish to translate and dubbing your non English clients.
---
Had this happen to me as well, I thought it had something to do with me recently completing that same event and emptying the boxes.
---
What college?
---
Because you go from ~300/320 to ~800/450 and are therefore overencumbered. And if your stash is at 799/800 then you don't have a lot of immediate options.
---
By going into Power Armor you lose the 90% weight reduction (for ranged weapons) that 5 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor gives you.
---
It's not as if Bethesda won't show off things like Doom Eternal, Starfield, Elderscrolls 6.
---
You are absolutely wrong with this whole BR thing though, I know for sure I'm gonna give it a shot. Some BRs are really fun ( Apex Legends, Spellbreak ) like let's be honest though, ever bethesda RPG is the same exact game yet you still consume them like crazy.
---
More low level legendaries. I’m starting a melee build, I don’t need a god roll, I need a level 20 anything to get me to level 30
---
Being able to mod the Hazmat Suit would be awesome. 
---
I've found a level 1 Hazmat Suit and if I could put some pockets on that it would be awesome. 
---
If this comments gets looked at I'd suggest the following mods that all take up the only mod-able spot on the Hazmat Suit:
---
Pockets: +30 Carry Weight, +40 DAM and ENG Resistance. 
---
Deep Pockets: +120 Carry Weight. 
---
Sturdy: +20 DAM and ENG Resistance and +50% durability. 
---
Comfort Fitting: +25 AP, Faster AP Regen Speed. 
---
Strengthened: +75 DAM and ENG Resistance. 
---
Then have a second slot called "Paint" where you can change the look of your Hazmat Suit.
---
You can join the Mistresses of Mystery! We don't care about your gender and we have a history of fraternising with raiders anyway! Besides, free ninja training.
---
Seems like they're instanced. If you try it more than once in a 20 hour window you don't get loot.
---
About double.
---
\*asks you to kindly leave in Norwegian\*
---
Oh damn! This subreddit is filled with people who will defend everything Bethesda does...
---
I hope they do get booed for implementing a game mode that literally NOBODY asked for.
---
Pretty little Bethesda jockeys, grow up. You know who you are.
---
Metal/leather depending on what you want to resist, metal for ballistic leather for energy.  Combat chest+leather limbs for highest overall.  Though robot/trapper/marine is worth considering for built in rad resistance.  
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2vh4g/new_research_complete_guide_to_the_best_armor_sets
---
OP wasn't clear, but I think they are talking about enemies based off the other comments they posted.
---
I got a GOD roll fat man that I am building a character just to use. Its bloodied +50% crit damage and 90% reduced weight. Did 1900 damage on my main character who was at like 75% heath and not specced for it at all.
---
I think back a lot to the vault from Far Harbor, I know there was some controversy behind it but I'd love to see more quests like that involving robots and mysteries.
---
Stimpak syringer would be more appropriate as there are perks for radaway, there aren’t any “heal other” perks or weapons.
---
Now that I think about it something like a stimpak like gas grenade would be quite interesting.
---
Yeah, the game has started to crash far more frequently.
---
Not a personal problem...
---
Gamma guns won't work on me.  Most of my armor has rad protection.  Wanna chew through a bloodied build?  Carry anything ranged with an Executioner's perk.  Double damage if target is under 40% health (which most of us are because of adrenal and unyielding) and they're done for.
---
Keep your distance with ranged too.  Lots of bloodied builds are melee.
---
Good weapons and lot of junks.
---
Not sure...maybe, but a lot of times the amount you can store on a corpse is very limited
---
I just pumped 1150 scrip into the legendary vendor and got fully screwed.  All garbage legendaries.  Not to mention I dropped 4 three star ones for my alt to pickup that never dropped.  They just evaporated instead. The first one dropped.  The other four never showed up anywhere.
---
So fuck the legendary vendor and this buggy ass game.
---
If you see census violence near the power station just north of watoga it's usually deathclaws, like 4-7 of them anyway, it'd be cool if they had real hordes of them though
---
It does just feel like a way to appease people who want to PvP quickly, show off their good tier rolls, or grief. Having low level players getting marked while they level up seems like an unnecessary punishment, since stats are capped at level 50, and most optimal builds rely on gear to be competitive in PvP.
---
 If this game's builds didn't have such a massive divide between default, even just best in slot modded weapons and "God tier" legendary rolls, it might be more tolerable. I'm in solo farmed gear with maybe one or two purchased items, and they're not a one of them meta pieces, realistically. 400 hours in, I can say it's been punishing as a solo player in survival.
---
 That wasn't necessarily always the case when, as you put it, the game wasn't just a deathmatch in survival mode. I've been one shot by explosive laser shotgun fire over 200 meters away, and doing ~3000 damage with my one star Bloodied Gauss Rifle does less than 50% of their health at the same range. I'm sure that's like every piece of their sentinel's assassin's proccing that 75%, but it's more often than not that I lose because I'm not running with weapons that, at this point, aren't acquirable outside of private trade.
---
 Legacy explosive energy weapons might be the thing I've seen more than any other, and frankly, I'm not sure why explosive does more damage at all. Just make it add an AoE, and you've got yourself an actually balanced mechanic, with things like dense mods and fireproof.
---
I kind of think a BR mode in fo76 might have legs because as you said, it can be utterly original.  All the other br games are either straight up fps shooters or have limited classes that are prebuilt for the player with little to no way to customize the "build" beyond the guns/gear.  
---
fo76 on the other hand has the perk+SPECIAL system which allows for a vastly deeper level of character builds and customization along with thousands of combinations of items and legendary effects.  
---
To make it a real slam dunk though, imo, it would need to be totally seperate from the main game and exclude leveling.  Let the BR players all spawn into the mode at a fixed level with access to a set range of items with weapons/armor geared towards various types of builds.  This would present the current BR playerbase with something new and interesting that they don't have to go and level up a character in adventure mode for hours to level/gear up.  It would also let the devs better control the items that are used and allow for a more balanced pvp metagame.
---
As a person with have 5 different mutations on my character, I say yes it would be great addition.
---
Toaster?
---
pvp as is... kind of shit, gear is horribly unbalanced and groups crush solo, dupers have the ultimate gear advantage that will honestly take everyone else months/years to overcome
---
this new mode seems like the only way to filter out all the duping/teamstomp/gear issues, everyone starts naked and you find your own gear... solo vs solo, team vs team
---
I think it will be better than survival sure, but it is balanced around survivals failures and not a move to solve any ongoing problems
---
I really hope they get around to fix duping for good and introducing a new tier of equipment. Game can't succeed unless they do. What good is a loot/survival game when duping exists? It ruins the economy which is the endgame.
---
Wrong.
---
You ripped yourself off.
---
Would be great for PvP where all people do is hopp around like rabbits on cocaine shooting at the floor
---
Fucked if you think you'll be getting screws etc from those weapons though :(
---
While the event is active player on player damage is  zero that includes orbital strikes , I’ve been in the middle of a strike several times and never taken damage .
---
God you people whine about absolutely everything.
---
It might be good but I feel it would be taken advantage of or might make the new player too dependent on others.
---
Start at the bottom of the food chain and work your way up.
---
Hella wood pile in Helvetia too. I picked up 120+ there without woodchucker perk
---
You really think people are going to put up with the shitty netcode and the insurmountable bugs the game still suffers from?
---
Apex players couldn’t live a whole month without content before jumping ship. This game mode won’t stay alive, the market is too vast.
---
I ran across it in a vending machine and promptly bought it. My main is a bloodied ranged character and I like trying out different bloodied weapons for giggles. Can’t wait to have some fun with it.
---
How exactly is he pathetic? Because his opinion differs from yours?
---
Learn to discuss before blatantly insulting...
---
If anyone needs to grow up, it's you.
---
At level 25 I was taking out level 50 stuff.  You need to manage your perks, weapons, and mods better.  Also more sneak attack head shots.
---
PvP is the true end game.  Have you never played an online game before?
---
Seriously... The only platform with an actual keyboard and we can't message but others can?  What asshatery is this?
---
A syringer dart tipped with your blood that transmits every disease you have to the other player
---
Heavy BOS combat for chest, scout limbs.  Heavy metal also works, but you lose a lot of ER.  Heavy leather limbs are pretty close.  Marine is decent but doesn't really excell in any category.  Don't think there is 'heavy' marine.
---
I was just saying, too, that some of these rolls need to be rebalanced for the sake of the game's PvP, as a whole, anyway. There's too much power creep already, and I assume they don't have 5 star slots on legendaries for no reason.
---
 If they made explosive just an AoE effect to your bullets, and not add damage, it would bring things that have been "God tier" rolled back in line with other gear, giving you more options that are viable.
---
 Legacy explosive energy weapons are just too good to ignore, not to mention explosive in general being the number one roll I see in PvP.
---
Yeah stagnate battle royale modes where you spawn in naked are true endgame content, you got it buddy.
---
Executioners weapons.

I believe she’s going to West Virginia University in Morgantown? Don’t quote me on it though, not 100% certain which one it was
---
Seeing anyone on the map is poor game design for the name of the mode.

Explore the map.
---
My two characters are Vault Resident No. 69 and Vault Resident No. 420
---
Wow vault tech university itself! Tell her not to date anyone named Evan.
---
I would be! I need to revive an ally for a quest I have, my GT is Inq Trevelyan. I generally play in the evenings (EST time) and I should be on tomorrow late afternoon and into the evening.
---
I’ll have to come back once I’ve gotten there in game to find a witty response to that lol
---
That’s a very good answer. Thank u I’ll definitely try the Vats crit
---
I've suggested even only showing locations on the map when the player isn't hidden, so that running, or engaging in combat, would reveal your location on the map until you were hidden again, for bounties or leaderboard. I feel like that mechanic would make playing with a map marker more tolerable, and interesting for player interaction.
---
There could be a level limit on the items you can put into the box, and a limit on how much the new players can take out. And after you level up once or twice you can no longer remove items from the stash, that way people who have been playing a while can’t loot it for gear
---
VATS will help you.
---
In game hit start to go to map, left bumper to open the menu, in that menu there is a photo gallery button
---
Open that and it'll have your photos, x to delete
---
Hope that works :)
---
Cheers dude
---
ive only come across this once or twice. not an issue
---
Kill 'em. Get those sweet level 1 legendaries. They can be very valuable and useful for new characters.
---
So you want devs hard work to be Hated.....what the fuck is your problem man? Just don't play it
---
Only in fear factor but that’s enough to constitute it honestly why not they got the model
---
There's many ways to implement battle royal.
---
Class Freak 3 does NOT work on Speed Demon.  My character goes through hunger and thirst bar like he has dysentery all the time.  My character is not diseased.   People I play with do not have Speed Demon and don't have to eat half as much food and drink.  Is ridiculous.
---
Happened to me with a super mutant
---
Yeah, I never drop my spoiled food.  It goes into my stash until I get around to making fertilizer.
---
This is something I want.  I am making sacrifices to the old ones now.
---
A 'community update' or something along those lines. That sounds pretty good.
---
I’ve been playing fallout since fallout 3 first released and personally I hope there’s a battle Royale, then we can all be on level playing field in pvp and I’ll wreck kids with their duped legacy weapon and armor. I’m not defending Bethesda’s anti-consumer tactics but because it’s an online game, this will drastically change how we pvp in fallout 76.
---
Pull out a Tesla rifle, kill all of them in almost 1 go. Collect easy legendaries and some scrap. Leave.
---
Grounded and Scaly Skin mutations are a must.   50 DR, 150 ER.   Ironclad perk costs 5 points but gives you 50 DR/ER.  With most enemies all you need is a hazmat suit.  With these mutations/perks, scout armor you can roll from the purveyor will be nearly top notch.
---
Beside being bad ass why man ??
---
Adventure or survival?
---
&gt; anyone is coming back 
---
No. Game developers should never try to get anyone coming back. Their main income is direct purchase of the game.
---
I hope they will make a PvP mode that I could try.
---
I can't try the current ones without having an easy way to dump and pull back my tons of drugs and OR junk I have. And while I can burn most of the extra junk the drugs and food stuff is why I can't do any PvP.
---
If they would have classic Battle Royal where everything you have, gets stored into a container(happened several times in past games), so everyone starts with 0, I could do that.
---
And yeah the battle royal mode does fairly clearly seem to be coming. We just don't know the specifics.
---
If anything you'd start with nothing and find perk cards and guns. Its an interesting concept for sure but unfortunately we already know it won't go smoothly whatsoever.
---
Who the fuck cares about what you say here on reddit? 2% of the game population.
---
ty
---
Most that played BETA had to play a second character to earn the trophies/achievements they got in BETA to register for the game.
---
Really? How?
---
Im level 198 and I've done none of her quests.
---
I got quad 25% fire rate 25 vats cost.radium for this.
---
I agree, somethy needs to be done to make them dangerous. Just making them a bit harder to cripple would probably do it. Usually for me just 2 or 3 shots from a shot gun with full enforcer perk and it's down.
---
People raged about Survival mode like it was the only feature of Wild Appalachia. We will get something PvP centred but it will not be the only content. 
---
People are acting like Nuclear Winter is gonna a battle royale mode and nothing else. A battle royale mode would be GOOD. PvP right now sucks, there is no structure. Hopefully they add some.
---
Post screnshots of you being able to craft it or it didn't happen.
---
do you still have it? good to hear its still happening at least.
---
Furious gamma gun or executioners weapons. The furious works well with the radiation damage.
---
Some players will do it to expand on their storage limits since each character gets 800lbs. They have 1 main account they play with and 4 "mules" which sole purpose is to hold all their junk.
---
Tell it to a lvl 235 guy named udokill, who took from me Poseidon workshop yesterday and shot me (lvl 59) down each time I claimed it back. 
---
Well, I was fast enough to collect the cores though and the jerk had to break up his other business 3 or 4 times for nothing :)
---
I would think so, although youd have to buy a new copy of the game
---
different builds is the big thing, and if you have a way of transferring gear between them you can effectively have 4000 pounds of stash space per account, and 125k caps as well. Usually this requires friends you can trust, or 2 accounts. My wife also plays so i can move stuff quite easily with her help or if she's not on i can move it myself just have to run back and forth between 2 rooms.  I like the different builds aspect the most although the convenience of having more storage can't be overlooked.
---
Same thing currently happens for me with Rose. Very annoying.
---
Yeah started using pipe pistols and have been noticeably seeing no difference in having licensed plumber equipped the gun just breaks fast
---
yes you can. I do this all the time, as I have 2 consoles. my wife also plays and she does it as well.
---
I use a bloodied gamma gun on the SBQ when my Tesla Rifle gives me the damage bug. For whatever reason the gamma gun still does damage through it.
---
Yeah thats fine. Thx
---
You couldn't at the same time but ovecourse u can load ur psn on another console.
---
Yeah ive been trying to get my son to drop minecraft and join me in Appalachia. Hence the 2nd console. Cheers
---
It's been patched
---
1) Follow the main quest line to completion.  Listen to every holotape.  The story told by doing so is great IMO.  Heartbreaking at times but great.
---
2) Start the Pioneer Scout quests as soon as possible so you can accomplish many of these tasks while on your greater adventure
---
3) Find the in game camera early.  In addition to being necessary to complete the daily and weekly challenges it is a fun toy to use.
---
4) Try to complete all the daily and weekly Atom challenges to get points to spend in the store
---
5). Tour other’s camps for inspiration in building your camp.  Move your camp frequently as you progress enjoying the opportunity to try new builds at interesting places
---
6). Claim workshops for the plans they provide but unless you enjoy being repeatedly murdered immediately server hop after doing so.
---
7) Possibly most importantly decide early on if you want to play a melee or ranged character.  After this use one of the various build calculators found around the internet to map our your goal build.  That way you can make better choices about where to spend your attribute points and cards.  
---
P.S.  If you are undecided go melee.  Having leveled 4 characters to over level 100 I will tell you melee is by far the easiest build to play PvE in this game.  No endless farming ammo.  Cheap repair costs.
---
8). Make friends.  The game is fun solo but really shines with others to play with and help you along the way.  I play on Xbox as well, GT = “Valyrian Stahl”, and am always willing to help complete a quest or answer questions.
---
I've been trying to get my wife or daughter to game with me for years, she finally started watching me play, then started playing on my xbox while i was away for work for 3 weeks. So when i came home i bought her a ps4 for mothers day so we could play together. its fun.
---
I'd love that. We could even play for caps, have some tournaments and stuff 🤔
---
In their what now? 😳
---
This is awesome, just confirmed it works.  I had already looted one there an hour earlier, but when I joined his server it was in the basket. 
---
The weirdest part was that the Royal Jelly didn't appear on my friend's screen, just mine.  He's never looted any either (just discovered the cabins tonight).

Unyielding build and use the meathook one swink kill on just about every thing.
---
And getting THIRSTY only matters if you're using the perk that requires you to be Well Hydrated, otherwise you don't get ANY penalties until you reach Parched status and the bar goes red.
---
If you're using the perk then no shit you're going to be drinking often, having to keep yourself constantly topped off is the trade off for the bonus.  With speed demon and moving CONSTANTLY it takes ten whole minutes to go from Well Hydrated to thirsty and from Well Hydrated to Parched takes roughly 38.

I saw a post that someone got it a month ago. its pretty disappointing that they would have a cosmetic mask we can't obtain. I read that it had to stay in your inventory and messed with the event anyway so oh well I guess. thanks.

Purveyor, sell the good ones or drop them to some people

Post a pic

Just tonight I was doing the Free Range event (I’m only level 16) and when I got to the farm, a legendary level 50 Sheepsquatch appeared (still not sure if that was scripted or I just had catastrophic bad luck) but I immediately abandoned the Brahmin I was supposed to be defending and turned heel, running away from the monster. It unfortunately began to chase me, so I ran and ran with it still right behind me until I came across someone’s CAMP. About five turrets started shooting at the Sheepsquatch while I ran inside the CAMP and desperately messaged the owner “legendary sheep @ your base!!” I continued to cower inside the CAMP as the Sheepsquatch roared and howled outside, not only fighting the turrets, but also trying to get to me as I took the occasional potshot at him from inside the relative safety of the CAMP. And that’s when I heard it...the heavy clunking of armored footsteps and the rapid fire of bullets and explosions. I cautiously opened the door, and sure enough, the owner of the base and one of his buddies had shown up, both decked out in power armor, one of them wielding a flamethrower, the other chucking grenade after grenade in between bursts of gunfire. They eventually managed to kill the Sheepsquatch, and the owner gave me a wave emote, stomped quickly around his base to make sure everything was in still in one piece, and then they both disappeared before I even had the chance to finish looting the body.
---
I look for deals. I sell magazines 20caps a pop, so if i find any for less than 10 i buy them all. I sell maps for 50 caps a piece, so if i find them for less than 25 i buy them all. I buy non perishable food for 8 caps or less, any items i know I can resell to a vendor for a profit also. i basically look for deals, cheap plans are always on my radar and so are popular weapons that are underpriced. made 7500 caps profit on one weapon last week for example, and i probably undersold it myself.
---
Survival, forgot to write
---
Build your camp next to hers. You have your space and she has hers. If you feel like your missing her click your sprint and in 10-15 seconds you’ll be together.
---
Distance makes the heart grow fonder..or something? Just play the game together.
---
Well if it's survival mode then yeah that happens.
---
I downvoted because you should have just killed him and took it. No one cares if you bought it.
---
Scorched Earth’s Completed, total events completed.
---
then. don’t. play. it. other people may enjoy this content. you don’t have to and it’s clear you won’t. so. just don’t play the mode.
---
Can I add you also? I really like looking for nice players :) zforzombies2016
---
Me and my friend couldnt get it to work with raider leather and sack hood with hoses :(
---
I’m level 87 and just learned about it for Pharma Farma. So sad thinking about how many meds I missed!
---
I never thought of the gambling aspect but that makes the idea 7600% better
---
come to my vending machine I farm the queen and sell all the plans for 50-100 caps. :)
---
I would 10000% be ok with looking like a sentient Ghoul &lt;3
---
Play more, devote yourself and your life to Fallout 76.
---
Just joking ofcourse.
---
Battle Royale is still one of the, if not most, popular PvP genre
---
Exactly. But then imagine seeing all these homeless vault dwellers. They lost all their caps they had to sell their camps to survive.. Eating some old rad rats, dreaming about that juicy scorchbeast Queen steak...
---
&gt;MODUS is another thing on its own. This is again just my opinion, but i REALLY hate how he pauses....when he... talks. It doesn't seem like he have to find the right words, it seems like he is deliberately dragging out the time it takes for him to finish a sentence. Why would he need time to find the right words? isn't he a giant super computer?
---
I think that mimics reel tapes and other analog tech. All the super computers in fallout are analog.
---
You want a high rate of fire weapon. You have to out pace the serendipity. And if they have assassin sentinel armor you will need to stagger them to negate the damage ignore.
---
Other than the popular mule, you can make different builds. 
---
Personally thats why I create different characters in a game in general; For a different style of play. I’m not into the mule thing. It’s doable, I just don’t have that kind of patience.
---
EX MACHINA
---
Instead of being a dick try reading. No where did I say anything about well hydrated. I have the perks that extend how much is restored when i eat or drink, and its still to often and takes to much food. I burn through tons of water and food and don't use chems. I also have herbivore mutation and drink/eat soup, still doesn't last long enough IMHO. As soon as my ap stops regenerating thats a negative effect, and its sure as shit is not 38 minutes a pop after filling my bar.
---
&gt;and you get plans for explosive vents about 70-80 times.
---
You've not learned them?
---
Let me die for you
---
Marine armor gives rad resist if you upgrade it. And I don't mean the lead lining mods, the regular upgrades that give you more DR&amp;ER will add some rad resist on this type of armor.
---
But look at the competition. Are people going to move from fortnight and apex and BO4 for a 60 dollar FO76 BR. Keep in mind all the bad publicity a launch.  I just don’t think a BR game mode will help the game and would most likely slow the development of PVE content do to the constant update for the BR to stay popular. However I don’t like to speculate too much and eagerly await E3.
---
All like 15 of 15 stimpaks? What?
---
😂 brilliant when you online what’s your name to add you
---
You drop half your aid in survival when you get killed.
---
Not the same but you can play Blast Radius on Tabletop Simulator if just want to check it out for kicks.
---
You can join me now - P_Shepard 😁
---
Demo expert and AA shouldn’t work with a gat plasma so idk what’s going on with you. Both only effect ballistic damage and gat plasmas have neither, as a explosive gat plasma collector the VE is the best all round, farming and pvper the only area it isn’t the best is boss fights where the FE can solo a queen in 10 mins
---
It would be nice if they'd restore the terror of finding death claws. Like 3 or New Vegas. In those titles I was instantly worried when I heard or even suspected there was one. Cause then they only needed a single pounce to get you and unless you saw/fired first with a heavier weapon. Your chances of winning we're never guaranteed. Especially if they were grouped. The quarry of New Vegas or the town in three with medic armor were two places I took very serious even with a Max level character that had good stats and gear.
---
Fast forward to Fallout 4 and they only showed up alone and we're stupid easy to put down after you got power Armor and a decent gun. Sure you'd get tossed around and break an armor piece now and then but it was nowhere as bad. Eventually it became a dull experience to which a simple spray of bullets or a missle put the beast down.
---
And I know this opinion probably isn't shared with many others. But I really wish they'd bring back that feeling of dread. That need to plan something and hope said plan worked. Especially in 76. Being able to go through and have that nuclear wasteland experience we're your not guaranteed anything if you're reckless and the solution isn't always. 
---
"I have a legendary weapon set. I can just run in and kill everything while my heavily upgraded Power armor stops the damage."
---
mostly mules and different builds. Some of us picked lots of shitty/situational perk cards in beta or early game and decided to clean the slate and start again knowing more than you did before. I deleted my beta character because he was an absolute mess
---
Buttressed my dude
---
Nuke zones, events. On events has to do with server( I think), if you do and event and you don't  get at least one legendary I would sever hope until I find the events that have legendary in it. For me it helps as well with finding legendary enemies in the wild.
---
I'm just as confused as you are then cause I seem to do more damage to everything than my other buddy with a FE gatling plasma. He takes little slivers from the queen and I take bigger chunks away from her. It takes awhile for him to kill the sheepsquatch but only a good 10-15 seconds to down a sheepsquatch even the 3* alpha at arktos
---
but my friends trapper piece is standard no mods and it has 26 rad resist
---
The royal 'we', refers to the way Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of her other realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith speaks. 
---
She will often use 'we' (or the alternative pluralisation that is grammatically correct) when referring to the Crown as an entity doing something, when she is in fact the Crown herself. Or alternatively refers to an individual as 'one', eg. 'One must always refer to us as Her Majesty'. 
---
The linguistics of the Royal Family is rather interesting, since many pronunciations do not appear in other English language accents. Particularly in the case of Her Majesty.
---
ahh..ok..thnx for the info..but i think my piece is broken because it has been modded.. but still no rad resist
---
Ye fe only shines if you have beam splitter (personally you should ALWAYS have beam splitter on gat plasmas) and are carful to not hit anything else, it isn’t great against regular enemies even the arktos alphas it’s only really good against the SBQ and Imposter.
---
Anyway, switch demo expert on and off see if your energy damage changes
---
Yeah there pretty heavy and take up a lot of stash space. I’ll hold onto it for you though.
---
Also do u have adrenal reaction or a better build etc? Could also just be wifi connection and speed, like I have terrible internet and it can sometimes take several shots for the first couple to register
---
May I join the raiders? I got bored of being a responder. My passage of entry was baiting a guy to shoot me when he was trying to kill mole rats. I then attacked him which lead to his group ganging up on me. I successfully killed a group of 3 people (1 had an explosive weapon) with a three star legendary death claw gauntlet... guess you could say I’m an unstoppable monster. I got a lot of junk from it and they got revenge so by the end of it I gained 300 caps.
---
Ye trapper is underrated
---
Absolutely. No worries.
---
Same with robot both of them have high rr
---
It's worth noting (in my opinion) that my photo gallery photos don't make the console jump like my characters do. I'm on Xbox so i guess there's a tiny chance it'll be different, but odds are the pictures will not move over. They of course are still on the console they were taken on, just not on a new one. Just a little detail you might want to know
---
ikr..its  not bad at all
---
No? If anything my buddy has better wifi then me, we have the same build and I don't have any of the mutations besides marsupial and speed demon
---
Hmm idk then man, could just be your a better player or they finally made AA go through energy
---
And if that’s the case ima have to find my AAE gat plasma, still think VE is best, you just don’t die so long as there’s a target it’s amazing can tank anything including vats crit bloodied builds. Given I’m not exactly lacking in terms of having vanguard sent marine (on my gat plasma dude) or basically any other high tier armour set you can think of but still, just having the VE is amazing coupling it with vanguard sentinal is godly
---
There is a ton of bugs that are related to tesla rifles. mainly cause it came out with the automaton dlc in F4 and didn't ever get an update to fix some of the damage calculations and strange hitbox shenanigans. However when they ported it into F76 it did fix some minor graphical stuff. (mainly the static electricity bug where your "feet" region in first person would have a still image of some static partial effects that would illuminate slightly which technically carried an illuminated debuff to your stealth rolls.) that was fixed but everything else wasn't
---
Idk man, I could be just dumb but even other players that I run with say I kill things faster then my buddies
---
Yes I have learned them. That doesn't stop then from dropping.
---
Nah I’ll have to do some testing u on Xbox?
---
Hmm.... It can do *most* containers. I just don't know about trashcans. Either way once I can be at my pc I'll see what I can do for you
---
What platform?
---
Ps4 sorry :/
---
I just completed this quest after several failed attempts. Here’s a rough step by step guide that I followed 
---
1. Acquire SB DNA 
---
2. Get note from Fort Defiance (to start the quest)
---
3. Access terminal at VTU 
---
DO NOT LOAD DNA TO CENTRIFUGE YET!!
---
4. Go downstairs and power up the generator 
---
5. Go back upstairs and load DNA into the centrifuge 
---
6. Access the terminal and analyze the DNA
---
If you did it correctly, you should get a pop up message telling you you loaded the DNA correctly between steps 5-6 above.
---
Hope it works for you fellow vault dweller!
---
pc
---
See my reply above. Hope it helps!
---
I think it's balance. It makes sense. You have several high level PAs to choose from. And then ultracite is perhaps a bit in project state still.
---
Your right, if you have 15 stims and 15 radaway and 15 other aid items you could lose all your stims + other stuff, you’d have to be incredibly unlucky but it’s possible
---
Damn
---
Tell me your screen name on PS4 so I can block you. Nobody has a chance against you in PVP with that thing.
---
I think it would be cool and the whole game will likely benefit from the extra focus on combat mechanics. Im sure a big part of the community would really enjoy content like this if implemented well.
---
Hmm that's odd. I've not received any extras. Some of them are clearly made so you only get them once. Have you learned all of them?
---
This would make a huge difference. 20lb rifles limit your options in a big way.
---
I do it for builds and camps
---
Last thing i need , a fuwking pack of deathclaws hunting me down
---
Nah but fr would be cool for high level areas
---
no time for that braah, give us more pvp modes and koool skinzz yeaaah
---
&gt; Some of them are clearly made so you only get them once.
---
This is nowhere close to reality. Virtually everyone I know has gotten the explosive vent plans countless times and a guy I play with got reactive plates at least twice.
---
Not all of them, I didn't. I had 5 stimpacks and dropped 1.
---
Smart. Those electricity bills get pretty wild in Appalachia. If only you could build a generator that could run indefinitely without any type of fuel... ._.
---
I definitely will, I’d love to see what they’ve come up with..
---
It's just common courtesy bro. In WV if you leave the door open you'll get mad mosquitoes.
---
Lol. I'd fast travel back to your camp and just teleport outside. Dont you get a bounty if you pick someone's lock?
---
I mentioned this in an earlier post as well, looks like people got the message
---
Radiation resistance is among the worst of all power armors.
---
While the story is good don’t follow it all the way or you will die over and over the guy saying this probably level 200 and doesn’t remember what it can be like to follow the quest
---
I always get a little weird about people sleeping in my bed. I have a tent outside with a moth man sleeping bag for you. Think about what I do in my bed and kindly stay out of it.
---
You can get prime plans from SBs... as well as decent guns... I got my first LAR from one at about L35... try offering more sacrifices to the rng gods :)
---
Lolol I always find a good mediocre rolled weapon or two I have been looking for and blow em. Then bam!!? can't resell the damned weapons! A lot of them are actually kinda good but you know META! Get travel agent and sell straight jackets from the asylum. Pretty much just try and save those caps!
---
we need swarms!
---
ARE YOU READY TO DIE FOR YOUR COUNTRY,DAMN COMMIE!!!!
---
On ps4: in build mode look at your door/water/resource and hit L2 I believe. Should bring up a menu with four options, each being a different level of lock.
---
Making popcorn for 9pm cus its going to be BR stuff.
---
most enemies can spawn there but i have come to really hate the mirelurk kings almost as much as the scorchbeasts, they are both just bullet sponges that offer no real reward for killing them
---
Critical hit?
---
Or maybe a light mod that adds a star and reduces weight! I'd be happy with good raid that drop light weapon mod kits!
---
So... 600 hours on FO 4 divided by the six hours a day you play gives you about 100 days, so less than six months. 
---
I suspect you've put more time into FO76 if you're playing six hours a day.
---
I get heart emotes from buying 3 star scrip items or sometimes like fairly ordinary 3 star armor. I think a tumbs up would suffice.
---
Thanks, I think this really highlights everything for me. And I’ll try and take you up on the offer to quest whenever I’m online next
---
It was fixed.
---
having high level, I think one can afford to spend money to travel to a decontamination shower, build one or put on perks to get you down the radiation, in an adventure so I do and survival will only cost you some extra caps and cautions.
---
Although the truth is quite disproportionate, they should always leave you with at least 25% of any basic aid item you possess. A partner lost more than 300 stimpak and I refuse to play in that mode because I have perks of weight reduction of help objects that would be impossible to put in the stash.
---
But when you have low level and you can not pass things with an alter ...: S
---
I sell to vendor lol
---
Exactly
---
God I love that!!!
---
Whyyy are you here? Just to complain about someone complaining, who *actually* plays the game? Go away.
---
People often sell Legendaries at the Whitesprings Artisan Corner, can buy a bunch of 1-2 stars for 50-200 caps.
---
What about like in fallouts 1 and 2? In fallout 1 you had to go into an abandoned building with a deathclaw mother to wipe them out. In a game where even super mutants had below 100 health, she had 320 and incredibly high resistances, pretty much on par with the brotherhood armor and only inferior to power armor. Without end-game weapons and a powerful build, you would literally not even be dealing damage to her. With 13 AP, she could close the distance pretty much instantly, and is faster than you unless you min-maxed the absolute highest amount of action points possible (10 agility, 2x action boy, bonus move). Don't forget how powerful even a single swipe from her was, and how a critical could wipe you out even through power armor.
---
Use the gunsmith perk and always repair it with weapon artisan.
---
I can craft only one. I sell that maybe 300/350 and then 400-500. Lucky it's marsupine, I think it's more desired. Most of my flux comes from queen event, and I don't do it much. With more flux I'd sell more.
---
But I've brought some few other serums I might use myself, for like 300, and then relisted them for 700 or so. If someone buys one, well the caps should compensate for not being able to use it. But I'm not really expecting them to sell.
---
I think higheest price one could except to get, is about 550.
---
Don't forget the annoying as fuck sound they spam at you constantly. I usually take my headset off when I'm fighting one, can't imagine how bad several sound at once!
---
Unfortunately I have limited experience with the OG fallouts but that sounds terrifying and exactly what an encounter with a death claw should be like
---
Nice, thank you
---
Yep. I posted about this issue earlier this week...

Problem is they don't appear as pets... they have a red health bar and appear to be an enemy...
---
Team medic (lvl3) allows you to fully heal others each time you use a stimpack. But more options would be nice.
---
There are too. "Friendly Fire" under charisma: It heals your teammates that are hit with your flame weapons. You can use a Flamer,  Cryolator Flamer Barrel, Plasma Gun/Rifle Flamer Barrel, and a Shishkebab. 
---
You're right though.. Since the perks doesn't include molotovs or special weapons like Perfect Storm, it should include grenades or some other sort of weapon that heals. Something that works better than Medic legendary weapons because honestly, those all kind of suck.
---
I would love to see somthing like that imo alot of the time fanart and mods are superior to the actual game anyway.
---
I play the game on a fairly regular basis and how people are in the hundreds of levels is still incomprehensible to me.
---
Water jetpacks and flamethrower flowers?
---
I used to have an explosive build, too. I had so much explosives that I had to always carry them on me because my stash couldn't hold them.
---
Any energy weapon with an explosive effect
---
I used to get copies month ago as I didn't really want to learn them, but then I gave in and started learning them. I've also picked up many of them from watoga station briefcases. I've not done a ton of the queen, but I think I have more or less all primes learned and Im not even fully sure if I've received any ultracite mod plans lately.
---
So I don't know. Ill see the next time I do it.
---
Hahahahaha. How many fucking screws did you go through doing that?
---
Carry 125k caps instead of 25k
---
including the gatling laser? I know you just said any energy weapon but I got this weapon as a drop in white springs. That or it was put on a corpse by another player. what would a two star explosive gatling laser with 30% to scorched be worth?
---
I had some eyebots and another time some protectrons doesnt matter to me tho anything is better than those Damn snake ghouls
---
&gt;I hope to fuck they get booed.
---
You misspelled "bombed"
---
Every time I unlock a suppressor attachment, its after i thought everything was unlocked for that weapon and I hadn't received a new unlock in 5 or 6 scraps.
---
I've already learned all the prime receiver plans...
---
Their rewards aren't worthless, but they totally are not good enough. The exp from wasting the time and effort downing a scorchbeast is worse than a max level deathclaw or yao guai, both of which are easier and less annoying to take out. That's pretty much the issue - scorchbeasts are just too annoying. They blind you with their attacks, stunlock you into a heal cycle outside of power armor, summon a bunch of scorched to tickle you until you waste the time and ammo killing them, and waste a massive amount of your ammo until they decide to land. The reward for that should be way above anything that other enemies give you, not basic crowned loot and a tiny chance at a prime plan. The ultracite they give you is nothing special because of how easy it is to get - they should drop something like stable flux too. At the very least, they should be the same as a sheepsquatch, guaranteed to be at least a 1* legendary
---
I doubt it would be put there by another player. I could be mistaken and it could just be the combination on two shot and explosive. I dont really know. If it's legacy and somehow you got one then probably 8-10kish if its not then 2-3k
---
It was indeed terrifying. I didn't dare fight her until I had hardened power armor, a turbo plasma rifle, and a nearly max level critical build that one-shot pretty much all other enemies in the game
---
Happened three times in row. So i guess there is big chance.
---
Correct. Particularly works great with scrapper.
---
The only other theory I've heard other than it being a terrible worthless battle royale crap-mode, is the possibility of some kind of tower defense mode. Which would be kinda interesting if that happened. Though they would need to fix the barely functional turret A.I. before that would work. (Since turrets often completely fail to fire on enemies for no apparent reason, even while being shot at or eaten by an NPC.)
---
thank you.
---
Must be a bug, my advice unless your a pvp player and a high lvl don’t keep aid items on you in survival or better yet don’t go into survival
---
Sorry to interrupt you forget one, namely flying away when you almost killed them. Happened to me a couple of times, really annoying.
---
https://i.imgur.com/eRo61Ah.jpg
---
I have impossible weapons 😂
---
Is ammo really that valuable to people? It's so easy to make hundreds of rounds by the time you're actively killing scorchbeasts.
---
The only way the team can redeem themselves if it is indeed that gimmick genre, is if there are other numerous additions packaged alongside that we'll also be able to enjoy in adventure mode. Such as new guns, equipment, perks, enemies, all that good. If there's none of that, I will be very upset and disappointed.
---
Fallout 76 needs focus right now.  And adding a drastically different game mode that splinters the playerbase isn't going to help. Especially if it's going to now also require Bethesda to pay attention to balance, and other issues. They can barely keep up with adventure mode, no way they can maintain a good balance with Survival, and whatever this other competitive mode is.
---
Bloodied ambush rifleman who runs fireproof here, executioner weapons and gamma guns are a pvp nightmare for me so thats some solid advice, bloodied builds are glass cannons, attack first or by surprise and youve got em 7 times out of 10
---
I would like an option instead of throwing to the ground that would put something like "donate" and could only catch them characters with less than 3 hours of play (to avoid sellers alters) where also could not be released anything higher than nv5 or even 10, nor any explosive ammunition / energy, but so perfect for very low level equipment, consumables, ammunition and planes.
---
Also, I would like you to get a poster that you said was placed there by other players (you could even put your name on it). If you add to this a challenge / ranking or reward would not be bad ...
---
Even those donations could be made to be randomly dropped into supervisory caches with higher level items (before nv50).
---
It's not strictly because of the PVP. Even though pvp is the worst part of the game, not because IT IS PVP, but because pvp is BROKEN AS HELL because the game is still hilariously imbalanced for it. (Mostly because of legendaries, but also because of player HP compared to player damage in general being balanced strictly for PVE and even then not that well.)
---
Then to add to that Battle Royals are on their way out, that genre has peaked and is now on the decline towards hopefully something actually good replacing it. (I can dream, but it will somehow be something even less enjoyable I wager.)
---
I have a bloodied build and i have 2 Unyielding, 2 Bolstering and 1 Chameleon piece and i have around 500 and 250 dmg resistances and i do notice a difference with 500 and my other sets that have 200-300 resistance
---
So because you learned everyrbing, SB are trash now for rewards? Lmfao , okay..
---
Maybe the ability to name your pet would help?  I'm usually smart enough to know if I spawn into a camp and there's a deathclaw walking around and not laying waste and carnage to everything in sight, that odds are, it's a pet.
---
People would have a second or two to think about squeezing that trigger if they see it's named Timmy rather than 40 Diseased Deathclaw.
---
Just a suggestion
---
It's honestly a terrible idea, the strength of Fallout is in story telling, exploration and PVE combat. BR stands against all of those values!
---
Meh I disagree if your in a survival server you shouldn’t be able to just stay invisible by not getting in pvp ruins the point of a pvp imo all players should have a area the size of a nuke that says hey this person is inside this area, also a survival radio that announces where pvp hotspots are like, 3 kills at white springs station or shots exchanged between players at overseers camp
---
I had trouble reading what you said :|
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/457/838/404.jpg
---
I'd rather they made no PA the best and gave them all pros and cons to encourage a variety.
---
Hmm. Can ya maybe help me optimize my build?
---
Yes, but imagine if the devs hadn't wasted all that time on that crappy survival mode and instead spent it adding a ton of new real content to the game, or a gamemode that actually gets played by more than 3% of the playerbase, like a hardmode for endgame players to find an actual freaking challenge in the game for once or something. That would have brought back a LOT of players compared to the barely touched pvp mode.
---
I would not approve the announcement or play a competitive pvp that is totally unbalanced with broken equipment and full of usable bugs for a minority with bad intentions or unfriendly where the player's own skill is not sufficiently rewarding.
---
And I want to think that no company would therefore like to announce something like this without having taken enough, but quite precautions (survival is still in beta ... but the normal mode is as if it were also XD).
---
Honestly as annoying as they are I don't think they should drop a legendary with how strong they are currently. Maybe beta pre-nerf scorched beast should have but not the current ones. Otherwise I completely agree with you.
---
Good morning satan
---
I yesterday played in survival a few hours, even the top players were up to nv20 ... it was fun XD.
---
Actually no, they would make a hell of a lot more money via atomic shop bringing back a ton of old players then selling the 80% off EU discounted cd keys to a few hundred new players.
---
Oh yeah, the fact that in the middle of a fight they can decide to piss off and fly half a mile away, then come back fully healed
---
What sorta places do you farm? I think I’m always going to the wrong places
---
Keep in mind, if they were legendary, they would regen their health
---
syringer rad x ammo, neat.

While I completely understand where your coming from, I think killing them all via an improvised explosive device is going just a Taaaaaaaaaad bit too far. Booing and generally mocking them publicly should suffice.
---
Its about picking the right locations. Before I start building, I always fast travel a few times to see what pops up.
---
they could open them and broadcast the E3 live in that room ... I would have XD. It would have been cool to see 20 players sitting there talking by micro ranting XD.
---
Correct. As a PvP player mainly, this is probably the worst PvP experience I've ever had in a game, second perhaps to BDO.
---
It doesn't make that big of a difference once you go past 200-300. At that point, it will only be making a noticeable difference against stronger enemies. Even then, it will take a while to get much out of it - the jump from 50-100 is much bigger in terms of defense than 300-350
---
Firstly i recommend using only 2 or 3 Unyielding pieces and other pieces Bolstering so you get more dr and pick armors that have more dr naturally like metal or Combat
---
I mean, I just really don’t like the top 3 system in general. But if I had to have something, I’d definitely pick the kill counter over “survival score”.
---
Yes.i mean ,is it that hard? You find something that sells a map in a looter game and you don't grab it?
---
Devs should cater to MY tastes! And my tastes only!!!!!!!!1
---
I have a full set of each uny and bolstering both bos combat. I was thinking about trying to get a chameleon piece for the stealth and 2 of each uny and bolstering
---
Also have 2 sets of assasins sent
---
Thanks for your input!  
---
 I don't think I can share the thought of Perk Loadout Manager or Better Invenory are "better" since they don't really cover the same aspect, because I am looking for exactly what you mention, responding to trade's offers or making mines or joining events people say they are starting haha.  
---
But it's good to know about your experience, I can definately see the issue of two people spamming the text box (I write at a speed of million words per second, so I could be one xD) or getting burned out of text that doesn't interest me.
---
It is honestly worse than Dark Souls PvP and WoW pvp post Burning crusade, which I didn’t think was possible, but Failthesda pulled it off somehow. Lol slot machine to win pretty much, and pay to win indirectly because the armor sets you need to last longer than 2 seconds cost 50k caps +
---
I'd prefer changing them into deformed feral ghouls, super mutants are too cool for that to be a proper penalty.
---
It would be a lot better if they moved it back to kill counter instead of “survival score”
---
Tbh it takes me about 10 556 rounds to kill a level 80 one, same for most bloodied builds or good sneak builds.
---
Trump --wroong-- /trump.
---
Same here
---
Yep, I have almost memorized everything devs said to this regard, from the [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) article on modding, saying they are not supported and game can malfunction, to the message from a community manager saying people could apply for a review if they got banned due to using a mod that gave them no advantage.  
---
So far, after checking on f76 nexus forums, seems that there is no clear case of anybody banned due to using mods. There was a mention of somebody banned due to using reshade, short after beta / release, but it didn't get very confirmed.  
---
Remember I am posting this very linked to their interview with PCGAMER, and their "naive" statement that they have top 10 lists of most used mods, which serve em as indication of what players want blabla.   
---
Which for me is a step further to their previous soft confirmations on the safety of using mods on f76.
---
Okay that sounds like a good set and i forgot to mention that if you dont have scaly skin and grounded mutation you should get them, they provide more resistances
---
I think all legendary effects should be disabled while in survival and any future PvP content. Also you definitely dont need to have complete god gear to beat most of the idiots in survival. Most of them use explosive combat shotguns because a 3 month old yt video told them they were the best thing available. I perch around whitesprings with an Instigating cats crit handmade with a few chameleon bits and pick most people off with ease. One of My favorite things to do is get a good lead in the number one spot then hide in the hotel and let the entire building become a war zone of people hunting me. Also use berry mentats to see people with stealthboys
---
Good to know, do you enjoy using it? Find all the people you expect to find? Too much? Do you also find it an issue to only have cross server global chat, but not a channel for just your server? Or what you think about the safety of its usage?
---
Some of the reasons you listed as them being worthless is why I love them. The xp is very solid, and my toons can down them in a few seconds. That makes farming them a valuable source of xp if I need to  tweek my build or get a new perk card for some experiment. It doesn't take long to get a level or two down in the cranberry bog because these fellas are hard to miss and will actively find you.
---
There are unmarked fissures that I love to farm. My heavy weapons toon can kill SB's before they finish crawling out of the ground and respawn immediately. It's easy and fast xp.
---
Yeah, I've been on the same boat, as for me their soft confirmations that mods were more or less safe weren't enough for me to take the risk.
---
But their latest PCGAMER article and their comments on the top 10 most used mods made me realize it is not something as "dark" or "easily bannable" as I was afraid
---
I run a bunch of stuff including scaley and grounded.
---
I've been in the same place for months.
---
Enemies only started spawning inside my camp radius when vending was added.
---
Yes, please. I should not be happy every time I found one, and sad when he is dead.  
---
If Nuclear Winter was what I hoped, a harder PVE mode instead of what it seems is gonna be a pvp one, they could have done that. a Level 50+ server where are biomes are much harder, and monsters have higher versions, levels, travel in packs etc.
---
Conduits near the light does the trick, for the ones that does not have to be connected.
---
You are 100% guaranteed to get a prime receiver plan from the queen. You'll learn them all eventually.
---
I make ammo by the thousands. If my rifleman has less than 1500-2000 ammo he's running low. If my heavy gunner has less than 10k he's running low.
---
I've heard it has something to do with latency and the engins slow calculations of damage that cause it but in my experience with this bug that doesn't really make sense because sometimes it works just fine
---
Currently, only explosive energy weapons. Nothing else has been removed from the drop pools, but some stuff was added to the purveyor that is not obtainable as regular legendary drops. Don't bother "investing" though, the patch 5 notes clearly said that the explosive energy weapons are only temporarily removed and will be coming back
---
Can we all just wait till E3 and hear what Bethesda say yet before we collectively lose our shit? Has Fortnite really turned people off of Battle Royal games? I seem to remember enjoying Player Unknowns for a while. 
---
I need to hear from Bethesda themselves if there will be a Battle Royal game mode first, and then I'm curious as to how it'll be implemented. If we get one I'm personally hoping it'll take place entirely inside a Vault rather than outside as it'd be a bit more tactical than just sitting hidden in a bush with a sniper rifle.
---
Yah I use to be a real compititive player in shooters like destiny and cod. I was actually top 3% ranked in destiny's trials of osiris when it first came out at one point. I've played a much wider variety of games since then and it just baffles me how they made the pvp so boring and infuriating at the same time compared to almost every other game I own.
---
In those situations I rather try to join team with them... 300 caps is a lot of caps 😉
---
I agree, they already delivered a PvP mode, next should be a PvE one.
---
I would love a high level game mode where the base enemies were all nuke zone difficulty
---
But youre talking SB , not queen...
---
Interupting their path dropping what you want to give asap then use whatever combination of crouching and emotes you can to let them know they can have the bag
---
So when I drop stuff it goes in to a bag? I didn't even know that! Thanks!
---
On some pieces it works on others not
---
Yeah its exactly like the death bag
---
Exactly, when you get to the end game which will eventually lead to queen farming there is 0 reason to kill any normal scorched beast. I feel like its in poor taste to make a unique and iconic enemy of the game more annoying than difficult/rewarding.
---
Demo expert does work but since the explosive damage is physical dmg it doesnt show increased damage just the normal energy guns damage.
---
That's a great suggestion, thought berry mentats were pretty worthless till now. It's just that I play adventure most of the times and there's nothing i can do against these guys decked out in full pvp gear when they come for my workshop and just keep reactivating the workshop attack thing to kill me, leave, come back and do it again. I could get it if they actually wanted the shop but most of the time they dont take the shop.
---
I don't play games 42 hours a week. That would probably mean I could be diagnosed with internet gaming disorder.
---
Equip Fireproof perk and their scream attack does minor damage. 
---
Adrenaline, use scorched to build damage bonus, kill SB. 
---
Shotgun, Enforcer perk in agility, SB lands almost immediately, kill SB.
---
Use any AA heavy weapon, SB pops like a balloon.
---
Stealth builds destroy them in a few seconds. 
---
They have a small chance to drop ultracite mod plans, prime plans. They always drop a modded high caps value item, so at worst you're breaking even.
---
I like to fight them. They die fast, give lots of XP and might give me stuff I don't have yet.
---
I wish they could spawn as legendary, like any other mob.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Yup, just edited my post.
---
I enjoy when quests give me a reason to go places I haven't been. I've spent many many hours just wandering, but that too gets old.
---
My PSN is Coaz29
---
It's a bug with client vs server side detection, the game shows you you're getting a sneak attack critical but in reality you're not
---
This is really nice of you! Whenever someone wants to contest a workshop I have I fast travel away like just have it lmao
---
Hey it was you saying you play 5-6 hours a day, not me. Unless I misread which is entirely possible.
---
Gameplay-wise, it's probably an attempt at balance (despite the "low" Radiation Resistance not being a hindrance in the slightest), plus it's basically the poster child for the Fallout Franchise.
---
Lore wise... I dunno.
---
It's an advanced model, sure. The T-45 was the first mass produced model, and essentially the prototype. The Excavator is essentially another prototype, based somewhat on the T-45. Raider is just garbage cobbled together, so it makes sense that T-51 beats it. T-60 was supposed to be an easier to produce model if I remember correctly; a sort of "Quantity versus Quality" deal.
---
But then we have X-01 and Ultracite. These are both super advanced models that were designed around improving on the T-51. X-01 is military/early Enclave and uses similar engineering to the T-51, but with superior and lightweight ceramic materials and more ballistic resistant designs. And Ultracite is literally T-51 armor MADE OUT OF ULTRACITE! It's like if you took apart a car and replaced all of the shell with Titanium! It doesn't make any sense for it to be inferior to T-51 (Although if things were super realistic, wearing Ultracite armor should attract Scorchbeasts to you, since they love to gobble the stuff up).
---
i started playing almost a month ago already level 60, just gotta run inspirational 3 or have someone share it for that extra 15% exp, well tuned also assists with an xp bonus. just gotta grind and stack those jahcoins
---
I usually just bully them
---
Nope. I like the game as a whole, not any particular element, just being an ex-vault dweller surviving.
---
Watoga Station vendor and BOS vendor next to it have a chance to sell T-60 mods. Also try the vendors in Whitesprings.
---
Ultracite mods are not sold or found anywhere. Only the Queen drops plans for them, so you need someone else to build them for you, if you don't know them yourself.
---
just lock all the doors to the workshop, so when they try to get in they become wanted, so you can begin firing upon them without having to wait.
---
"Kill that guy!  He's a killer" makes more sense than "Kill that guy! He's been hiding in the woods , peacefully picking mutifruit for \*too\* long!"
---
I don't need to worry about people not closing the door, it's locked, vending machine outside on its own foundation, with a ramp for easy access,  but IF you decide to come in any way, ignoring the signs advising you not to do so, you will regret it, for a few seconds anyway, oh and don't come back for your paper bag, it's mine now.
---
Funnily enough, in the same direction, I was looking at the vats full of green stuff in West-Tech earlier and wished I could dunk one of my characters.
---
Pretty much all PA plans (mod wise) can be bought from the whitespring vendors. However, they can be expensive and you will probably only have to craft them wise. So I’d say, buy mods from player vending and only buy the plans for more rare parts (jetpack etc).
---
You could just build a shop and put items in vending machines for free? I haven’t tried this but it might be a solution.
---
I think its a player owned  house made by  bethesda to show in the menu.
---
Close too max caps? And todd the god takes 10% off the top normally
---
What, you doing a high karma playthrough right now or something?
---
The display is bugged, it will sometimes show you either how much you have in your machine or how much the player has in their inventory. It didn't sell all 630 shells
---
The problem is that you risk diseases sleeping in a sleeping bag. Build the big tent and put a normal bed in it and I feel like less people would sleep in your bed
---
Saw the same thing happen the other day, but the kid ended up buying a 20000 cap mutfruit by accident.
---
😂👍
---
Survival has a lot of issues, but I hope that they flesh it out. Good PVP would add a lot of value to the game.  
---
I'm not a huge fan of BR games, but the one thing that all BR games have in common is that players start out with next to nothing every time, and I think that would make for a more enjoyable experience than what Survival currently has to offer. 
---
I don't expect the best, or most balanced PVP out of Fallout, but I think it has potential to be a fun aspect of the game. They definitely need to do some balancing, and hopefully Nuclear Winter has a bunch of it along with the rumored game modes.
---
As long as they spawn outside my CAMP the turrets will eliminate them, otherwise not a concern, assuming the turret decides to wake up and do its damn job that is.
---
Daily Quest: failure lab technician has started
---
Yup, I hit the button and then proceeds to lose the 'press any button to continue' and just loops the same pictures of scenery endlessly.
---
The first and last time I went to the Flooded Trainyard, I got caught in the scenery and then had to stand there and take Mirelurk King attacks from three different directions until I died (encumbered and pre-Nukashine escape).  Death bag nowhere to be found on respawn and ended up losing a bunch of ultracite.  Haven't been back since.
---
It’s on a mountain overlooking trees.
---
Oh thx! Will have a look into!
---
My only concern is that it's not a main part of nuclear winter that took up a significant chunk of their dev team. If it's a small side mode, sure, I'm fine with it even though I'll never play it.
---
I am not about this building but the place
---
bethesda should be somewhere because it uses a location that exists
---

(This is reproduced during the test phase)
---
I just want to build in the same way
---
The problem was that people were cheesing it by being in a team and trading kills to remain off the scoreboard, pushing people with 0 kill to the top and then hunting them down. The score system is to prevent this sort of cheesing.
---
I think maybe just have a legendaries tab. I hate going to a guys camp when it says they got 60 weapons and finding no legendaries
---
With the rank 3 butcher's bounty perk even if there dead theres a high chance you'll get meat
---
Yes and no😛 I like quests a lot but all those extra things give a variety of things to do if I am bored with questing😛
---
How did that work? You only moved up with your kills you can’t grab kills from someone else.
---
Yeah, at times I'm beginning to wonder if playing "Catch the Commie" might be more fun than Fallout 76.
---
I understand that it is a forested area, but there are many mountains and it is very difficult
---
Good for you, sorry I can't join as I'm PlayStation forever.

I usually drop a bag and fire a round at it to shift the players attention to it. Works almost every time.

There is a place that literally prints food that will never expire. It uses the same system as the ammo factory.

That game was in the spotlight for two months and went quiet afterwards
---
&gt; BO4
---
Game's already dead on PC and dying on consoles, the latest two updates have been so awful that the cod WW2 subreddit has experienced a rejuvenation. 
---
I get what you're saying, but this is a different game altogether. It's not really built for pvp, and as such has some pretty interesting mechanics. Apex and its class system is probably the only one that comes close to emulating the mutations, perks, and legendary effects you can use here. If this is a BR, it might at least bring back some of the people who bought the game for pvp but didn't like it
---
Please don't! I want all my unlocked doors to be open for quick access! I'm on the other hand come to my base and don't like that all my doors are shut including garage doors.
---
If they add a battle royale mode, I'm just not going to play it. What difference does it make?
---
Nah. I have plenty of caps and like helping low lvls
---
Hi just not going to play it. what difference does it make?, I'm dad.
---
Or we could just leave it as is.
---
There's the Stimpak Diffuser, but I don't know how it works, haven't even seen one yet.
---
All I know is it heals nearby teammates.
---
Survival = 20% more xp. And i need aid on me, so i can actually survive.
---
They would kill each other after jumping someone, leaving one of them on 1 kill and the other on 0. Everyone else on the server on 0 kills has even odds at being placed on the scoreboard if no one has any kills, so the guy on 1 kill would be top of board, and the guy on 0 kills would be either on the board or off, giving the pair of them 1-2 visible targets to go after.
---
I'm listening. Tell me your arguments to defend that position. This is an open discussion, after all.
---
You can contest workshops from anywhere. You dont need to access the workshop bench
---
Yea this point has been circling around for a while.
---
Also I’m pretty sure someone found game files for one but idk.
---
Yea, I’m on my phone so I’m not gonna bother with correct grammer
---
Hmmmm..... 4k+ agree with me and none with you.....
---
So just do over the whole game for survival?
---
Seems likely
---
If your low level don’t go into survival, if you need to carry aid carry 5 stims
---
They take 10 or 15% of all sells to ‘keep economic balance’
---
By all means I won't either but I'm just saying that my idea for the new mode would be way better and I just want more snowy maps
---
As someone playing through 3 on very hard at the minute, I recently accidentally found that little town where there are literally 10s of death claws and a tiny little trap door where you fall into a sewer system with EVEN MORE death claws that nearly 2 tap you to death.
---
This post gave me PTSD, fuck deathclaws man.
---
Basically yeah.
---
Trying help out a low lvl really.
---
I don't care what a bunch of casuals who want a single player experience think.
---
It will have a huge success since apparently the community is mostly fornite players for some reason
---
Never seen anything booed on E3. 99% there will be woohooes and applause. Let's be realistic.
---
I’m sure you could be more creative than that and find a better place!
---
Just explore the map there are a lot of great building spots
---
I like the occasional ultracite receivers
---
Lmao. Most "casuals" dont care enough to join a sub reddit about the game. You're a troll and nobody agrees with you. Move on loser.
---
A good way to revive an ally is it join the encrypted event - a lot of people will be dying and I’m sure opportunities will arise
---
You realize these changes would only work in Survival mode, right?
---
No one is touching your land of love and flowers, don't worry.
---
Everything in pvp has a counter, bloodied builds, sneak builds, tanks, glass cannons. Everything. You would have to entirely restructure how the game works for pvp to play as a shooter like call of duty. The pvp in the game is designed so it isnt astronomically different than pve. For a fallout game, and their first iteration of an online mmo/ shooter they didnt do half bad. If you take away the elements that make fallout like vats etcetra it ceases to be Fallout anymore and just a clone of pubg or COD.
---
Think it was rigged wrong from the beginning by luring pve players into survival mode. They joined for benefits also available for pve players to enjoy while not wanting to pvp, but it was shoved up their face anyways and people are mad about it although that's what survival mode is all about. People say pvp shouldn't be the focus since it's 'survival' mode but not getting killed by raiders count as survival as well.
---
To fix this, Bethesda should remove players that don't want nothing to do with pvp from survival mode. They should first do something about them broken pvp balance, and make it so all them benefits and rewards be built around pvp. Ditch that meaningless 20% exp bonus, get rid of challenges that require you to craft or build stuff, make it so that you have to kill certain number of players or something like that.
---
I know I'm gonna get a lot of dislikes but a peaceful survival mode session feels like a watered down version of adventure mode and it's shiet. People don't participate in events, nobody wants to fire nukes or start an encrypted event, people always try to avoid each other in fear of getting shot on them faces. Yup that's your private server right there. Just keep to yourselves in a multiplayer game for 10/10 experience
---
Personally I think a battle royal mode could work pretty well. But you’d need to make it so that all perk cards were available at lvl 1 and you start at level 0 on every drop. Do you kill random enemies for loot with slow levelling? Do you risk doing some of the quicker events or take workshops for a quick xp and nice loot hauls from creatures. Do you focus on perks that increase weapon damage, or maybe your resistances. Or do you opt for crafting perks so that you can build yourself better weapons and armour. Do you risk going to vendors to buy some things you may need knowing someone might be keeping watch? So you risk going for a mutation they may help/hinder you. 
---
And if they made it so that upon death they dropped their armour/weapons/ammo and possibly even their perk cards it’d make for a very interesting take on the battle royal genre. Particularly if they increased weapon degradation too so even if you have a strong weapon it’d break quite easily unless you repair it. But if you repair it you become vulnerable. 
---
Camps would need to be off, however they could drop a random assortment of player camp copies around the map whose locations change every time. These camps could contain basic resources, food/water and plans. And as camps would be off, all plans earned/found would be weapon/armour/recipe. 
---
Honestly I think it’d be a nice twist.
---
Someone just kindly helped me so Im good !
---
Oh, good! I kept running away from pubg and fortnite for years now, just to meet fallout 76.
---
I needed that laugh this morning, thank you!
---
Appalachia is not Farm Simulator
---
#bringpvpgreatagain
---
Dont like it, then it's easily avoidable. It might be nice. H
---
This game has no real endgame content. Kinda boring sadly apart from new character building. It would be fun if they had the tdm or battle royal with just vanilla weapons and armor. Letting the builds decide
---
Have a look here and then you’ll know which set you’re looking for.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afcgjc/i_made_a_visual_catalog_of_camp_assets_by_plan/
---
You're thinking too highly of 76. It doesn't have that many players.
---
Right? I'd love to go back to playing survival. 
---
You wanna know how to fix survival without totally doing away with anything that makes it fallout? 
---
(You're suggesting removing vats... a fundamental part of fallout games) 
---
##New Guys on Survival- can't carry over your save from adventure. And removing explosive perks from survival entirely.
---
I guess the whole post can be summarized briefly: *no one-shots*. 
---
It's a fact that very few players have any interest in Survival, and even fewer play it at all. For that to change, the mode has to be rebalanced.
---
So you basically just want 25% EXP bonus in adventure mode.
---
No and even if it was you'd just get banned for accessing it.
---
I think that I was fast traveling to this camp a few days ago - I have ended stuck below the floor on the cliff, with no way out. So I jumped elsewhere and I won't be going there again. Although I agree that view and the CAMP position is nice, it's very "customer unfriendly".
---
Lmao

Uhhh, you know the refrigerated backpack mod exists right?

No one mentioned changing pve. Why does either have to reflect on the other?

Every normal player knows nukes zones are for X-01.

I'm sure the developers get in all the time, but I haven't heard of a player breaking into that layer of reality for a while

Not sure what you mean by that but okay lol
---
You really think you'll wreck dupers? Oh, my sweet summer child ....
---
Thats a nice idea! I can't really see any landmarks or anything recognisable but i will keep my eyes open.
---
Your logic is pretty bad. People used to participate in events until they counted XP as being put on the top 3 leaderboard.
---
Where do you both get your numbers from?
---
I just started it today, happily it was Mole Miners during a rad storm so rare materials and not too tough to beat.
---
That would work, sure... *for a while*. But in a month, when people have everything again, you know what will happen.
---
Dont really know how the backpack works, but I'm sure that you have to carry the stuff with you right? If you do then not everyone wants to lug around all their food and what not
---
I did. you say you want to gain 25% EXP Bonus without being visible so you can avoid pvp in the survival server. Sounds to me like you would prefer to play adventure and get the 25% EXP Bonus. Thanks
---
The way they could fix that is by lowering the damage dealt on crits.
---
Re-read again please. Thanks.
---
Yeah, waited two days for delivery of "game media" and still had to download the game when I could have just downloaded it on the day of release.
---
I think it's a good idea but I don't think Bethesda would want to come up with another stash. They are already very hesitant to increase capacity of already existing stash boxes, think they said something about bigger stashes overloading their servers. Why would they want to make a new one?
---
My opinion is that it’s gonna be sitting in my stash for a long time till I reach lv50 with my melee character and I’m not sure it’s worth it (as I’m not building bloodied). Still nice to get a five star so easily.
---
Sounds like you want a battle royale to me
---
You said inventory, not stash. And if food doesn’t spoil so fast then you just carry what you need because you won’t need a huge surplus for “just incase” situations. If you’re wanting to craft using the items for meds etc then you just hold onto the things until you craft and then stash them with no spoilage.
---
I secretly hope that deathclaws are weak because they plan to add them as companions at some point. But yeah you are right, I'd love it if they were scary. 
---
Or if there was some quest line/terminal entry explaining that deathclaws have the potential to evolve into terrifying beasts.
---
You are resorting to harassment now? Must have hit a weak spot. Also you are wrong about casuals joining a sub or viewing forums. Most people here would claim they are a casual gamer. I don't care if anyone agrees with me. This isn't a popularity contest. I don't care what you think about my opinions. Down vote me to -4000 then . Watch all my fucks.
---
Maybe if they ever make it cross system compatible
---
Apparently, a lot of people love the idea of BR. I don't care about what game modes they add as long as they improve my Adventure/PvE experience. Adding quests, lore, events, content.
---
Yeah, because after 50 you have 2-3 biomes that are mostly useless if not nuked
---
People using locks on door are weird... we can't destroy or steal anything so that only prevents friendly people to come and visit.
---
If nuclear winter is a battle royal mode, I'd put caps down that PvP is 80%+ of the new content. And I'm guessing much much much less than 80% of players give a shit about PvP. 
---
That is why people are worried. If they made a whole new set of content, with many hours of studio time invested, for people who use gatling lasers only, everyone would be pissed. Because most people don't use those, and we would rather they spend the time developing something that matters to them. 
---
Not saying there isn't anyone who enjoys PvP, or focuses on it. Just saying catering to that minority to the exclusion of other things, is bad for the game. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong though, and really they're doing 80% PvE and 20% PvP, which would likely be more proportional.
---
Ok you clearly just want people to agree with you so I’m out, enjoy your EXP grind in survival where you periodically throw yourself off a cliff to ensure you don’t make the top 3. LOL
---
Got to take the "Neitzsche Approach" at low levels.  If you live through it, you gain experience . . . if you don't, you can come back and try a different strategy.
---
40 scrip. I already have a bloodied Swing speed powerfist: has anti armor mod,doesn't weight 785.
---
The inventory thing was just an example because usually me and friends find ourselves with random spoiled items in our inventory just being dead weight. Usually you have leftovers from crafting aswell and dont want to waste them from not being able to get more crafting materials in time.
---
Yup. Bethesda really needs to work on how pets are handled. I can't really fault players.
---
People stopped participating after griefers found out they can just fast travel and reject events to kill everyone there. And that was like day 1 of survival mode. Even popular events like AWOL armaments would sit there for ages. Not what you see in adventure mode
---
The spawn place is between 2 entrances to enclave bunker. Rabbits and squirrels spawn there.
---
I’m a sniper build with leather armor for sneak. If someone is within PvP range at a workshop I’m pretty much doomed.
---
Have the game keep track of how you got all the mutations. If you got them without serums then make you a ghoul and if you used serums then make you into a super mutant. And when you die have the game ask if you'd like to revert back to normal for those of us who would love to play as a ghoul or super mutant. Also make it to where the ghouls and super mutants are no longer hostile to you depending on you you got them. Since this would be a huge game changer though, make it to where you'd have to have 18 mutations to turn.
---
I bet many people can solo SBQ or imposter sheepsquatch if nobody cared to join the fight
---
Lol. Where did I say I was reporting you?
---
The 51b Armor has been around for decades, and the upgrades and improvements that have been made to it are significant.  Ultracite was relatively new when the bombs dropped, and so nothing has been done to improve the stock version.
---
Honestly, the only parts I disagree with you on is about the level and the PA.
---
I've had no major PVE difficulty since around level 30, and I manage with a set of non-legendary Heavy Leather Armour.
---
Running a sneak build though, so that helps.
---
Other players are always a danger though, at least in Survival, which is a different beast to Adventure, if only because of Live PVP.
---
My camp is here too. Just under Arkos Pharma.
---
Ah I know what you mean. They should disable the ability to abandon events like that.
---
They haven't announced any details for it yet, so all we can do is speculate. Believe it or not there are people who play this game who like PvP and are excited for it. 
---
Everyone is acting like the new PvP mode is gonna be the only thing nuclear winter brings. Everyone needs to relax and remember that survival mode was only a fraction of what wild Appalachia brought. There is going to be loads of new pve content, and more end game content is around the corner with the vaults.
---
Who knows, maybe the PvP mode will attract new players, some of which may actually keep playing when the hype is over.
---
Yeah please re-read one more time. Thank you.
---
I found it when I first visited it. Granted I knew beforehand that theres some hidden entry people talked about.
---
First hidden patch I saw, I though, wow that's very visible, and just like few other places. How could you miss that? How can you say that's hidden entrance to anything. Well, it wasn't that, yet.
---
But the later hidden entrance to the actual place, it uses texture I've not seen anywhere else. How can you not go and check it out closer? And then you see there's no collision.
---
So I don't think it's overall that well hidden. 
---
Unlike the secret floor on abandoned bog town, that's surpringly well hidden I think. Maybe related to the fact that when I've been there, I was using armor, so I don't go about and jump down on everything I see. Or go to places with obviously nothing but to fall down. And after you explore the place once, you don't really go to the roof so much except when taking power to your workshop.
---
Buying doesn't work, you need to find it, sorry.
---
I feel you man. It's not just about pvp balance, but it's about the system in general. I mean, having to hit someone back to actually start doing damage? Sheathing your weapon during a fight make you non hostile? Not to mention that really weird grief-proof invurn they implemented near train stations.
---
Same should go for the Military ID photo in Charleston DMV.
---
I live almost 100% of the time with 15DR, and I have no problems.
---
Well, I die a lot, but that's cuz I'm terrible, not because my Mistress of Mysteries getup is ineffective.
---
Shouldn't they be booed for even showing up, acting smug and victorious, about a poor product they released?  
---
The game bombed so hard that I wouldn't be surprised if it is included with cereal boxes right now.
---
No I’m a pvp player, I didn’t buy this game for another pubg I bought this game for a fallout/rust game if I wanted to play a battle Royale I’d play any of the great battle royals that are smothering the market. I’m not whining because I’m not a good player or because I don’t have good gear (I’ve got pretty much every god tier armour set and weapon u can think of, vanguard sentinal powered sets etc) but what I’m saying is that if I wanted a battle Royale I would’ve bought one of the amazing Mattel royales that exist, I bought this for a rust/mmorpg like game but in the world  of fallout and maybe a bit more forgiving then rust and most mmorpgs
---
Yes, more bugfixing and optimization please! Wild Appalachia was great content wise, we need to be able to enjoy the content now xD
---
EXECUTIONER'S.  +30% damage when enemies are at &lt;40% HP.
---
Duh.
---
Yah I could care less about the system in adventure. But the system in it is designed poorly so people can abuse it during events or workshops so that you dont really know what's happening until you die at the same time it says "so and so is attacking you"
---
Have to pick it up in the wild -_-
---
Fucking terrible challenges
---
Itd be a great way to explain away whatever glitch causes them to occasionally spontaneously die.
---
Wow thanks
---
From there South?
---
My camp is placed on a cliff and they only enemies that spawn are mongrels. I didn't place turrets because they would kill the cats that also spawn at the spot.
---
Mongrels don't seem to cause much damage and they are most likely to be killed by someone that visits my camp.
---
Let them drop ammo coupons. These coupons could be turned in for whatever ammo you want from a new ammo vendor.
---
&gt; my idea for the new mode would be way better
---
Hubris.
---
I use molotovs for tagging. That's about it.
---
Lol I get reckt a lot with ghouls and stingwings
---
Whitespring entrance , whitespring golf club , Sons of Dane Compound , Morgantown airport (collision course event) , New Gad , Fissure Site Prime
---
Sorry for the late response also
---
don't believe so..
---
You know what? End the end your claim doesnt make any sense at all, 4,000 people care and little old you don't.
---
Ok, WHO DID THIS?
---
My toons? Ehhh
---
Blow on us. 
---
We're glass cannons. Some of us more than others.
---
It looks and sounds like, with the map datamining especially, that the outer 'ring' of WV just hasn't been hit as hard (yet) by the Scorched plague or beasts the way the core/center we are currently playing has. I'm curious to find out honestly as it will have a strong impact on how I play potential alts from here on.
---
Maybe they could make it like alcohol fermenters we have right now. You put your food in the fridge, it takes up space in your stash box
---
I used to feel this way too. Now that I can literally kill them in 2 or 3 seconds even when they are flying it doesn't bother me so much.
---
Imagine killing a sheepsquatch just to turn around to get killed by the remaining ones of the horde.
---
Is this satire?
---
I believe some of these weren't working previously
---
If you dont care then why did you even bother to comment? You must've expressed your "opinion" for some reason.
---
Nope, look at the comment made by u/c4vetteman94
---
That would probably be the least strenous option for the dev team to implement considering that they could just copy paste the fermenter and put a different multiplier for time.
---
Appreciate it man!
---
Don't you have a better argument? I hate Battle Royales, since I played the original back in ArmA, and I have never touched PUBG, Fortnite, or Apex.
---
Keep trying, troll.
---
Game: “Oh you’re over encumbered?! Let me just spawn you many miles away from where you want so you’ll have to walk with all that weight you can’t carry”
---
Not gonna lie man, but that’s pretty fucking stone headed of you.
---
I can confirm, I did the ISS by myself with a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma and a ton of super stims. One or two other people showed up but they were standing around not doing anything, I had all three pylons and dealt at least 80% of the damage (with enough time remaining to have done all 100%)
---
I have one of the lever action skins since the day it was released (few weeks ago) and it didn't remove anything. I guess that only the responder shotgun skin is bugged.
---
They could start with that and see how it goes, sure.
---
Not at all
---
Its not possible to solo imposter sheepsquatch...
---
Id rather see a faction system you can join and fight other factions. Npcs and players alike, fight over territory control and rescourced
---
The base game is easy. It's designed so that all of the content is possible to a relatively low skill player without any legendary gear. You can do everything with minimum level gear and no perk cards if you really try
---
While they're at it, can they also bring back the Nuka-world Raider outfits?
---
Hi, that is... I’m sorry, quite the mess...
---
[Take a look here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c4256de&amp;d=s92se2ss2p00ek1c72cr0ir2ar2ao0la2l42l71lu2ak2af2al2pb2i12lt2sf2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=) 
---
I’ve included your stranger for you ;) and a good mix of offence and defence for (first weapons, sorry, best I can do and keep it durable) and pistols, your Mistress RP
---
&gt;My Toons? Ehhh
---
Old MMO slang.  Means characters
---
Ah, I love Old Olney.
---
I was afraid of deathclaws until level 47, always avoiding them and running. One day I tried to confront one, and it surprised me that it only took 3 hits with my melee weapon. Yeah, they need a buff
---
The only thing that pisses me off about Survial is the OP legendary Effects. And I wouldn't even be mad trying to farm them on Survival if a few things changed. 
---
If I had a new guy, and everyone else had the same, no duping, no exploits and had to try farm their god tier effects again- I wouldn't be mad getting killed- I'd know that guy has spent more time on Survial than me. 
---
Honestly I'd take away the explosive effect from guns, have only the 3rd perk be one of Assassins/Sentiel/Cavalier And make them only roll on chestplate. 
---
And I'd have a couple of guys making perk cards to drop into the game every 2 weeks- but that's wishful thinking.
---
Because that is what forums are for.
---
Seen a few mirelurk deep king conga lines and they can wreck you pretty quickly. They are far more terrifying than deathclaws currently.
---
A no legendary game mode does make sense for how the perks seem to work - and would make intelligence a worthwhile stat.
---
Now those are good suggestions.
---
But you dont care what people think? If that's true then wjats the purpose of posting? To get other people's opinions right? Which means you care what they think.
---
I think cap loss should be doubled until you reach level 76 (152). That actually gives a payout if you take out a higher level player, but doesn't really punish anyone. By the time you reach level 76 you should have a solid build and decent gear. Not much changes after that.
---
Basically a level 5 guy loses 10 caps. A level 50 guy loses 100 caps. A level 325 loses 152 caps.
---
Right away the cap loss was too high and now its too low.
---
Just my 2 caps on that portion of survival.
---
Much like you I've made my first proper friends in game by being somewhere I shouldn't have been. I think I was level 32 or so, in my first set of mismatched power armor, and I decided to go join in the fight to down the Scorchbeast Queen. I'm proud to say that with a lot of dodging and weaving, I succeeded in doing 0.001% of the health damage, at least enough to get kill xp. But I also got noticed by a group of pals who play together with mic over Discord, and they made me feel welcome in their group and we've been playing together for days now. They've been great and it does seem there are some real good folks in the game. For my first few days I was beginning to think the playerbase was antisocial and actively competitive to the point of shunning newer players, but I think now thats it's more a case of most just not using the in-game communication much along with friendships built over the last year of the games life. I was just lucky enough to get adopted so to speak. It's going to be a while before I can pay back the hospitality they've shown me.
---
Good suggestion, cap loss is too low right now, indeed.
---
Someone said shotgun -&gt; Big guns, but can't confirm.
---
Ski Sword works for both Sword &amp; Improvised.
---
Blunderpuss count's as blackpowder but not as shotgun (wanted to clarify as I tested myself and getting blunderpuss is RNG and someone might wonder if it works in two categories).
---
Ive just done 24 hours in the wasteland. Enjoying it so far but more cuz its not really feels like an online game to me and its the only fallout game i havent played. Could do with a whole lot more than BR. And hopefully one day they willl reuse the map for a couple hundred years in the future for a single player game.
---
White springs golf course. I grind there almost daily and end up with 20 to 30 legendaries, mostly 1 and 2 star with about 5 or so 3 stars dropping each run. When it's nuked I end up with far more.
---
I was there for the same reason. Previously I’ve only ever encountered super mutants and insects. This time I found a family of high level Yao Guai! There was at least 8 of them.  But at least one was legendary.
---
But if you get your final mutation while wearing Power Armour.
---
Semper Fi.
---
Just a thought but what if the scorchbeast are just another victim to scorched plague and are being controlled by something stronger?
---
I have perks that balance most of my weight; portable power, bear arms, pack rat and bandolier.
---
My stash is 99% junk with that 1% being fusion cores.
---
Weight reduction armour?
---
No really, it will. My favorite thing in the world is doing a squad wipe in seconds with a lever gun and people going “bro how’d you do that bro, yer haxing”.
---
Stack your perks, concentrate your build. Pick two specials and max them, get perks that fit those specials. Don’t try to be good at everything, or you won’t do any significant damage late-game. But try telling that to a 14 year old who doesn’t comprehend taxes or consequences 🤷‍♂️
---
I’ve been thinking on this, what if they tie the scorched plague in with the flatwoods monster/zetans?!!?!
---
Ya, similar to the vending machines.  Bethesda talked about fridges on an inside the vault article awhile back.
---
well i run bloodied and i can take any level scorchbeast down in two hits with melee or around 10 headshots with ranged. the most ammo i’ve spent fighting them has been on those dozens of schorched it spawns.
---
I don’t know what this ammo weight reduction armour is, I just use bandolier (and used to use ordinance express)
---
If it's like wild Appalachia dlc it will have a mix of content. I can't imagine they will only cater to the pvp crowd.
---
I just put a turret just inside my front door.
---
 I got tired of coming back to find things inside breaking my crap with my door wide open.
---
Yep, mine arrived a day or 2 late i think
---
Maybe it's just my build with my experience then. I run a full-pistol build, with vats/crit specialty. Honestly, I love being having a big iron on my hip.
---
If you want to listen to large range of Fallout/old music use these.
---
[Vintage Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb0B3auGbtA&amp;ab_channel=OldWorldRadio2) livestream from the people that did the Old World Radio mod for FO4.
---
Or [A-Bomb Radio](https://tunein.com/radio/A-Bomb-Radio-s295023/)
---
Yeah, they don't turn off/down when listening to holos, but there's so many songs!
---
 It's a minor legendary effect, I've only seen it on 2 and 3 star because the primary needs to be in place (unyielding, troubleshooters, ghoul slayers etc.) There's 4 of them as far as I know. 
---
Ammo weight reduction 20% 
---
(5/5 pieces=weightless ammo)
---
Junk weight reduction 20%
---
Weapon weight reduction 20%
---
And the best for pve in my opinion,
---
Chems food and aid reduction 20% 
---
Weightless nuka cola! 
---
I tested what putting on either batteries included or bandolier with the ammo armor did and I didn't drop a single ounce.
---
*creates new character* *takes items*
---
*repeats cycle until fulfilled*
---
*places all items on one character*
---
I realise how much time and effort this would take but I thought I’d jot it down
---
I want to visit there
---
Sounds like OP has a poor build and/or doesn't utilize the stealth bonus.
---
&gt;It will not bring anyone new into the game unless it is utterly original.
---
Well shit why do we even have things line polls and upvotes and downvites ect when this guy clearly speaks for **everyone**  
---
Pull you head out of your ass and realise not everyone shares your opinion, it will certainly bring at least a handful of people into the game, and if you dont like it dont play it
---
Thanks, I appreciate the build. I've tweaked it and wanted to see if it's at least passable, building off your work?
---

Well i feel stupid
---
Keep dying and go back for more like I do. Seriously pick em off one by one, eventually you’ll get them all. Relax. Or you get stronger doing other things and then go back. These aren’t that high-of-a-level opponents, so take a look at the cards you have equipped and make some adjustments if necessary.
---
Throw 2 plasma grenades at your feet and tell me how that works out
---
Laughs in 15 strength max strong back full deep pocketed high capacity backpack
---
Sounds above my lvl. I don’t even know what to ask about ultracite and all . Will investigate though. Thanks
---
That's a rather foolish thing to say.
---
Last time I played I was like level 43 or something and I always get rekt there. Isn't there an easier place?
---
It was for the nuke cola backpack
---
Get better!;)
---
I have not played PvP at all, but here's what I'd start with if I did go for it:  
---
Psychobuffs, for any sort of melee build
---
Psychotats for any vats build
---
vats is really good, i might add. it's the only way you're going to land criticals. also, if you want to sneak, I would try using either a stealthboy or the upgraded one (i can't think of it's name).
---
just have one of each, and use them before you engage. don't care MORE. the battle will be done long before their effects wear off. if you guys think there's a better starting point, let me know. like i said, I haven't played any PVP. :)
---
Nope... You can read through out that Rake damage is a common thing. Tiny left over from Fo4
---
Good post
---
Just a reminder that this subreddit is for fo76...
---
Do you only use melee and heavy guns?
---
I am PC player. I'll online soon.
---
Ign is LordVulpius. Look around :)
---
My camp looks diferent, but the backround is the same.
---
According to the fandom fallout wiki the stimpak diffuser is a plan that can be rewarded from Project Paradise or Unsolved: Best of Intentions.
---
It is crafted by combining 2 aluminium, 2 adhesive, a spring and a super stimpak at a chemistry station that produces 3 stimpaks.
---
Either the wiki is wrong or the developers don’t understand what a diffuser is
---
I like how I did more research for your comment then I did for my own post.
---
So?
---
So, Ironclad is pretty bad actually
---
Especially considering it’s point cost
---
That rejuvenated card adds +50hp &amp; ap if you can manage yourself to keep well fed/hydrated for 2 points only
---
Covert operative is also not worth the 3 points, your base sneak attack damage is x2.00. With that, you’re only moving up to x2.50
---
Class Freak is a must have at max rank, you’ll be wanting to run several mutations for anything you do, and their drawbacks are negligible with Class Freak
---
Yeah... as a heavily mutated character I love and hate this idea...
---
Scout armor: First urban left arm
---
Scout Armor: Fix mod prefixes
---
Scout armor: Fix mod errors
---
Scout armor:......etc.
---
Equip a super sledge and some melee perks. I've been one shotting enemies there since around level 40. Currently lvl 100. :) Make sure you're wearing power armor too.
---
Git gud, I use a legendary prime 50 cal machine gun specifically for these guys
---
Kind of funny. Looks so peaceful... till you get down there.
---
Nice snap!
---
Legacy weapons should also include the mission specific drops like the SMG that had +20% damage and the combat rifle that increased sneak and sneak speed etc.
---
Having 5 Camps haha
---
With a bloodied explosive weapon, it's not even a full clip of ammo!
---
Honestly, I will play it and enjoy it if you start naked and get items! That's all I want. And if you can find and equip perk cards! Would be super unique and fun
---
Mirelurk Kings are just pain in the ass sponges.
---
*Change my mind.*
---
Maybe they counter each other and render both useless?
---
The perks make my inventory so much lighter considering I only have 225 carry weight without strongback perk
---
Hello Kitty Island Adventure
---
Yeah, I think once you get a decent build set up, even at a lower level, and you're familiar with the game/controls, the difficulty does drop extremely fast, even more so with Legendary Equipment.
---
Somebody's been eating their orange mentats.
---
One hit in melee with an optimized build!
---
Yeah. Unless your set up right outside of 76 and are selling weapons to lowbies, there's very little point in non legandarys
---
Check out the houses next to the Seneca Rocks VIsitors Center.
---
No no, you misunderstand, with all 5 pieces bringing me to 100% reduction an additional 90% of 0 is still 0 
---
I carry about 40k rounds without bandolier or batteries included and my weight rarely tips above 220 after hitting a stash.
---
Ass victorium, hehehehe........
---
Walk backwards? They're dead LONG before I have to tactically retreat!
---
I build HUGE silly things at workshops all the time haha. Good times :) mine will mostly kill the new owner and no enemies tho ;)
---
The lookout towers don't reveal every location, but do most.
---
Okay just realised that your asking about the stuff in 76, 
---
The answer is no btw.
---
I do misunderstand. 
---
*sets trap*
---
What’s the point of using the perks then?
---
Their attacks can stagger stun and poison you at the same time, they could never do that in other ganes!
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
Are you:
---
Extracting a popular resource?
---
Squatting at WhiteSprings?
---
Farming water in the Forest Region?
---
Because fallout 76
---
it's like asking Mom to pick up Cap'n Crunch and she comes home with off brand Cheerios
---
First off let me start with saying that I understand the point where from these suggestions come from and I think the underlying issues should be solved. After spending a lot of time researching this game and dominating survival mode, as well as here on Reddit trying to understand people I believe I'm in position to shed some light onto this situation.
---
There's a subsection of players, often quiet and busy playing, which enjoy current survival immensely, as its a perfect playground for gang interactions. Considering where the meta went since the game started, anybody who joins Survival now and is not part of a gang is gonna be screwed. Hence, for lone wanderer survival experience, a new game mode should be added, one catering more to needs of less extreme PvPers and more extreme survivalists. Lets call it Hardcore survival mode and its basic premises should be: no legendary items so that loot drop is possible without making this game unplayable (with RNG vs Crafting where it is an 'impactful looses upon death' would be too impactful). Single hardcore character slot separate from rest of characters, twice the stash, no mules, PvP meta about operating cheaply not about grinding best gear, and the mentioned loot drop. Lets join our voices for this idea because there's a chance we'll get that.
---
Then, related to balancing ideas. People continue to believe that meta is either assassin/sentinel TSE/AAE or BE unyielding/sentinel, end of meta. Thats completely false and the general majority of players has very limited understanding of math in this game - the fact how people consider their AntiArmor energy weapons not trash is a prime example. 
---
Each 'PvE mechanic' that 'doesn't work in PvP' works in PvP and people fail to understand how. The red dot on your compass? Determined by perception vs sneak check, can be negated. Being VATSed? Perception against sneak check again, I play a properly made sneaker and I rarely get VATSed. Being invisible via chameleon? Well if you're not also a sneaker your dot is going to be seen from hundred meters, and there are ways to manage these situations, as your crosshair becomes red when placed upon invisible enemy. Use the compass and the crosshair to locate invisible enemies. I think by now I already proven that besides sentinel and cavalier, harder to detect armor is also godly. Still cheap as fuck.
---
Then, people go for full sets, which is lame. The way layers of effects are applied in this game, best choice is always quantity over quality. As a bloodied sneaky sniper, I only use two unyielding pieces, one assassin, one chameleon, and one regenerating. When people will learn what regenerating does in PvP, we'll have another tier of items that currently costs 2k skyrocket into their fully deserved godhood.
---
Then, one of the best possible tactics is to shoot opponenets that are focused elsewhere. This is why a teammate who can take a lot of shoots and who will be irritating your opponents is between the greatest tactical advantage when it comes to placing a deadly shot. This makes a team who has a member in a blocker set be able to achieve more than people without such ally. Blocker has 6 pieces in set as it drops on weapons, and works 100% of the time you satisfy its conditions. If you thought Assassin Sentinel was tanky, try this.
---
I believe by now I expanded the definition of meta armor to the reader from two armor archetypes to four armor archetypes, but there is so much more people in this game don't appreciate, like tendency to favor handmade over all weapons while its combat that's the best rifle.
---
So much is also attributed to duping and Bethesda is described as actionless in this field. Those who played PvP since before survival still remember being 'invincible' even against pre-nerf TSEs. The reality is that everything became much more deadly and with a proper build and 1* gear you can be pretty efficient killer, but you won't be one if you bought yourself assassin sentinel and cheerfully walk into VATS range from contested battleground.
---
Each thing you specified represents a core gameplay mechanic thats unique to Fallout, and they will not be removed. They shouldn't in fact be removed by the devs, they should be understood by the players.
---
Thanks, I'll tweak it further when I wake it. I appreciate the help. I would also appreciate anyone else with anything to add, too.  Eyeballing it I'll be around lvl 70 before I've fully 'fixed' things, but thats not so bad as I feared.
---
I am constantly low on lead to make bullets, even with a rifleman VATS stealth build that is extremely ammo efficient. It doesn't help that it takes a good bit of server hopping these days to hit up the usual lead sources.
---
Just so you know all of those stats for Power Armor are now 60 dmg 60 energy and 60 Rad Resist less than what you listed. 
---
It’s been about 2 months since this bug or “nerf” came to Power Armor. If you don’t believe me just hop into any set Power Armor and the stats will will 60 damage, 60 energy, and 60 rad resist less than what you have listed. 
---
The 60/60/60 you get from the Power Armor Frame no longer counts towards a Power Armor sets full armor total.
---
As someone who never plays PVP (with the exception of GTAO) can you please describe how a good PvP system works? How is it different in (proper?) PvP games? Genuine question. Thx
---
Just fast travel again and that doesn't happen - it's normally when multiple players are in the camp. Source: I camp up there.
---
Opportunity cost. The time they've spent (and will spend going forward) on a battle royale game mode could have been used for other stuff. Stuff much more relevant to what the current playerbase wants.
---
Yeah, this thread is some serious misinformation. 
---
I've had a deathclaw for a bit as well. From the Mire to the Forest for that spot that can have both a copper and steel extractor at the same time.
---
Had tons of vendor visitors to both, many of which try and shoot it. It does nothing. 
---
I'd imagine OP just doesnt have the extra base defense needed for the location and it died.
---
I rotate between bloodied heavy guns, melee, and cryo during the fight.  Keeping her on the ground with cryo  seems to be a big help especially when things are not going well due to a lack of knowledgeable players.
---
Why lie, show off your camp if you want dude?
---
It's probably random but I swear when I do that event on a regular basis I get more mothman random encounters. When I don't do it I get less.
---
Thanks for shopping :)
---
I agree completely. At the minimum it should give some sort of passive resistance to Scorched &amp; Scorched BeastS. It is Ultracite Power Armor so it should have something unique going for it. 
---
Let’s say a 30% resist damage similar to the 30% bonus to scorched with the Prime Receiver.
---
I’m online now
---
I have been in the same place since November. I have been asked to switch servers only 15 times MAX, but a couple of times I stayed to have look around there was nobody even at the place not even near it.
---
nice set up man im currently trying to get hands on a vanguard chameleon set do you know if something like this exists?
---
I've seen vanguard chameleon piece before, I believe. That would also be a really good combo
---
I use an IE hunting rifle and it seems 1 of 3 hits don’t work haha. EE handmade cleans up nicely tho :) My friend runs a bloodied faster fire rate handmade and that thing is way OP
---
thanks for the info and the quick reply 👍🏼
---
Np
---
Actually i don't think there has been enough PVE, or enough meaningful PVE in WA. Don't get me wrong, the scouts stuff has been great, but besides that it's just been challenges or events, rather than meaningful quests. I'm not the kind of person who will grind away for the sake of grinding away; and without any real narrative underpinning my actions walking about killing everything is boring.
---
This point has been made atleast forty times -_-
---
Not possible, Vanguard and Chameleon are primary perks
---
Oh really? Thanks for the info.
---
Fallout NV was my first fallout, didn’t know much about the gameplay, didn’t super follow the storyline, didn’t know any of the lore. Had played dozens of hours and was fairly comfortably advanced with NV storyline, quests and map etc. then stumbled across the rock quarry or whatever it was, walked all the way in there just having a look around and then...
---
Fuck me - that was my first terrifying experience with “deatchlaws”. Don’t think I ever went back to that quarry 
---
Now I two hit deathclaws
---
I am also a stealth build on ps4. When I notice this happens it's usually because the enemy I'm shooting at is engaged with another enemy, whether it be human or NPC.
---
 My stealth crit hits do a lot of damage but if the enemy is engaged in battle with something else I do about half the damage I normally would because the enemies health regenerates halfway from each hit.
---
 So now if I come across enemies fighting each other I tag them all and wait until one side is dead so I don't waste bullets.
---
interesting idea however i think they wouldnt do it because everyone who has invested time in obtaining all the crafting perks could feel ripped off by the change i guess
---
Funny how you think you know exactly how it's going to be before any details are released.  Classic.
---
I wish there was a way to force them to land like the dragons in Skyrim.  I can’t do very much damage to them with my guns, so they are just a waste of bullets until they randomly land.  
---
Side note - the fireproof perk helps a TON
---
Thanks so much, that would be amazing!
---
we need tactical for scorch beasts as well like being able to cripple the wing to make them land and things like that 
---
that said I personally think we should have a kill 5 scorch beasts and get 50 scrip and a cookie weekly challenges
---
Dude if you set up a store in a really cool looking place your advertising that location to every single person who stops by. 
---
If you are hanging out in a single area for an extended period of time you are also advertising that area. 
---
I kid you not I have had people join my team, Fast Travel to me, set a waypoint directly on top of my camp, and then leave the session and take up my C.A.M.P. Location. 
---
No camp location is safe or sacred for long. Just wait until this game gets a big boost in players.
---
The closer u are to whitesprings the more that happens. If u have an extractor at ur camp or have good water resource (beside a river/lake) its probably the main reason
---
How so? I've been away from the game for a while and I must have missed it. Can't other players destroy our camp or steal our decorations etc anymore?
---
Just roll the total reduction from the reduction card into the two sets of damage perks for a weapon.
---
My run is through the back, pumpkins, plates, golf balls, bowling pins.  Then there's a way through the hallway to the front, I think 2-3 spots with more plastic pumpkins along the way, then I hit up the science lab because you can get microscopes and those have some high end components.  
---
Imo the rest isnt worth it, even the cafeteria.  The scorched are low level.  You can spend a long time in that place if you try to do everything so that's why I just stick to a route.
---
 Nå er det på tide for deg å gå hjem
---
If they got rid of the leader board completely I would actually play survival.
---
I little to much but I like it
---
Old? Jesus I guess it might be. I'm getting old *cries 30 year old tears*
---
With the one idealized build and weapon, which you can’t branch out from, it’s easy!
---
Yup. I've been saying for a while that the way to nerf bloodied melee is by nerfing unyeilding armor. That's where the real jump in damage is coming from.
---
I’d picture about 15 cats in that place and an old lady shuffling about
---
You have to just put them close together and when it turns red move it a fraction until it goes green. It’s a right pain to do but it does fit together.
---
it was literally an ending in the first game.
---
76's Yao Guai are the scariest and deadliest creatures in the game
---
Why's everybody so convinced that there's going to be a BR mode anyway? We already know from the datamines that one was planned - and scrapped before release after the backlash. I think it's more likely to be reworked into a team deathmatch thing.
---
Happens after it's been nuked and the server is transitioning from bloated ones back to regular ghouls.
---
I love it
---
Mini nukes and frags have no affect on my mele toon whilst smacking her in the face
---
i feel your struggle but imo it is a good thing as a staple of the fallout games was always the roleplaying 
---
the fact this game is easy makes room to try different builds
---
i know most players just put on the best gear they find and throw an outfit over it
---
if you want to have a challenge again my suggestion would be to try out a certain character (challenge yourself) its uncomfortable at the begginning but for me it really brought back the fun to this game
---
feel free to check out my account for ideas 👍🏼
---
I am level 150, he’s was a level 31.
---
Found East of Twin Lakes at Random Spawn.
---
Both perks maxed. There are scroched nearby he was engaged with from another area.
---
Saved him from the scorched and walked him back to the base after the tame icon appeared and the send to base option.
---
Oddly this time , pacify did not appear first just tame.....may have been lag due to the amount of fast travel and server hop I was up too.
---
I’m so sick of hearing that if I just gave up and used the one or maybe two builds that are OP the game would be easy. 
---
I want QOL perks! I want to survive more than three hits! I hate being overweight because my carry weight is 160 since all my perks are damaged based, and being sneak I can only afford 3 in strength. 
---
You guys don’t need nerfed, there needs to be other ways to have a “serious” build than bloodied, melee, or  sneak Crit.
---
I really bet there is some sort of trick to get it spawn on random encounter more often - either it's really doing the event or steal Mothman eggs/cook them...
---
I mean most all of the cryptids have static spawns - beside of the Mothman (not counting the wise one here) and Flatwoods Monster. But i really bet a ice cold nuka grape that both got something in common to spawn.
---
It looks awesome! I love how it looks really lived-in.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I first heard it in EverQuest... when EverQuest was popular... *sighs in old age*
---
Mr. Fuzzy tokens
---
Best you could do is have 4 x Vanguard and 1 x Chameleon
---
Legendaries only do that once when they mutate.
---
I have missile turrets, perhaps due to PVP from a workshop being owned?
---
I really so not remember owning a workshop at that moment.
---
The only NPC that spawn where I am are non threatening things like fireflys and opossums.
---
So unless it just up and dies by itself? Glitch?
---
I also look for cheap legendary weapons to scrip, Plans I don't have, 5.56 ammo for 1 cap each, cheap awesome legendaries to resell.
---
I can burn 10k ammo for night, so yeah.
---
That's because it was Outstanding!
---
lol it is far from $60 these days
---
I’ll either drop a bag in their area or put them in a blue or green suitcase at a train station they are near and shoot them an Xbox live message letting them know the loot is there. Some are appreciative and some ignore/miss the message.
---
The game will go free to play and it will have a battle royale feature, no question about it.
---
But if you are at the point of queen farming, then it shouldn't really take any time or effort to kill random scorchbeasts.
---
Really nice, with the camp budget I am guessing that one room os your entire camp...
---
LOL
---
As a melee, I totally agree
---
Yea folks been asking for this for a while and its needs doing
---
Make 3 perk loadouts you can change with a press or two.
---
This the kind of fan engagement I would love to see.
---
Yeah I was shocked when I started spending more time in the Savage Divide.  I remember how in Honest Hearts I would just mow down a pack with my Survivalists Rifle, but in 76 a single Glowing Yao Guai sends me into a circle-strafe fiasco (I dont have any obnoxiously good legendaries).
---
I think this spot in the Mire is the best (Camp 1), flat ground, shear cliff, and no enemies 
---

---
Sorry, but that just means you need to find better gear/get better stats. They're meant to be too tough to kill unless you're endgame. I can one shot lvl 50 scorchbeasts and 3 shot level 80 ones. So they are amazing xp and loot for the effort I put into it. When I hear their wing flap I stop what I'm doing to find it and kill it because it takes that little time to do so.
---
When launching bunker should be left out of the nuke zone so she can be pulled out of the storm and can be fought without having to manage rads.
---
Teach me
---
Power Fist or Deathclaw Gauntlet which are functionally identical, except the power fist has more Armor Penetration, and the Deathclaw Gauntlet has a faster attack animation!
---
Lol. Dont want it to spread
---
Well. That sucks.
---
It’s great, never change :)
---
I'll keep this noted for the Nuclear Winter follow up, was hoping to get some good constructive feedback so thank you.
---
I'm the same boat as you with building. Wherever I go there always has to be something preexisting that I can incorporate like the monorail inbetween the Savage Divide and the Bog or the waterfall in the Mire, as I find it really helps to structure the build and make it fit in. I've been eyeing up the spot in Morgantown by the monorail track at the end of the bridge, you got any cool spots to recommend?
---
If you cripple the wings they will be forced to land.
---
thanks mate
---
Oh yes and a few of those two headed possums and I am ready
---
Well, when the black friday pricing hit few weeks after launch, a lot of players mentioned they paid the full price for the game, even those expensive versions with mainly ingame extras. 
---
I don't think the atoms are that great sale. Over and over on this sub you see players complaining about the tediousness of the small daily and weekly challenges for little atoms. They sure aren't buying atoms.
---
Well, that's what I think. Don't want to claim better knowleadge.
---
I mean yeah, that’s always a possibility, but like you said, that’s a lot of time and effort, especially for some low level items.
---
Surprisingly not, I have a three layer decking into the river outside (also full of stuff), two medium water purifiers and two turrets somehow haha
---
Yeah the amount of time they take, plus stimpacks plus ammo plus whatever is a joke for what you get.
---
In retrospect I should of done really but I'm pretty confident we'll see them in the future. Many people did put NPCs in the 'Other' option.
---
....I don't. Those 2 points of strength and 3 of int I get to use lvl 2 bullet shield and lvl 3 first aid or stabilized depending. 
---
I'm saying I don't use the reduction perks, I use reduction armor but have tested using both, and the reduction perks do nothing on top of the armor. 190% weight reduction only drops to zero, otherwise it could theoretically be broken into an infinite carry bug, but it doesn't. Just a flat 100% 
---
Odd bit, my armor doesn't affect missiles or mini nukes. They're under the ammo tab in inventory but are likely item id tagged as explosive only.
---
I'm not sure about the cause of your fluctuation but +25 RR armor with the proper values displayed in the tooltip has always worked. Armor with the legendary effect but no 25 RR are actually providing you with +25 disease resistance as this effect is mislabeled in the game files.
---
Same, I think Bethesda is gonna present them during E3.
---
Interesting. Been trying to figure out what items cost alot in camps.
---
I use alot of mood lighting, and besides turrets I think lights cost the most.
---
Plans and recipes are really all I buy from player vendors, but when they have ones I don’t I buy a TON.
---
Dusting’s going to be a bitch :)
---
I'll be on this evening and make an offer
---
(Xbox One) Having the same issue trying to do the Fire Breathers quest. Game crashes every time I walk in to Belching Betty. 
---
Last time this happened, I stopped playing for about a week.
---
Same here, we need a sub with those informations
---
I want a rogue like/light mode....
---
wild costumes and building bases.... I wonder why some of them like it? I've met very few tho, most seem to be bro's
---
Yup, i just shoot em out the sky an move on unless i need a snack
---
It’s harder for them to balance because of all the different builds use.
---
Yeah. That’s it. I like to have a teammate keeping the critters off of us in stealth using VATS as well. Helps the heavies like me just keep blasting her. Nothing worse than having a tick or ant gnawing on your feet as you aim at her.
---
they should all drop legendaries.
---
Yea I can now solo everything except SBQ. I only get in trouble if I do to many fights in a row , ignore my stimpack levels, or forget to eat or drink, which actually happens alot to me.
---
For some reason, the encounters I have the most issues with are still Yao Gaui.....those guys hit a ton.
---
Interesting just realized that one COULD pronounce those similar to YOGI......that famous bear who steals pickanik baskets...
---
This post distilled (for your convenience):
---
There is a small part of a game I play that I don’t like so I won’t play that part of the game anymore.
---
Heavy weapons and melee are the only realistic way to bring her down.
---
This is true in every mmo. Once you know a game a decent player could level using a ham sandwich instead
---
I came across your thread looking for how to find a key. Here's a screenshot of the door it opens.
---
http://imgur.com/iBfWTFj
---
They wont do it. So many players had survival already. My guess is it would drop the player base in half.
---
Everything here seems about right with one possible exception. There was a recent post saying that SBQ runaways are the result of AI pathing issues due to players standing on the fence. I have no idea how true this is but it makes sense to me based on how other mob AI acts so I keep off the fence. I haven't had a runaway in a while so it's also possible this has nothing to do with it and that the AI was fixed....
---
And food as well, I dont have a lot of crops, but decorations seem to cost next to nothing

---
downvotes are bots, they bomb all the new posts in the sub
---
yes, you should report bugs/exploits
---
I’ve seen a vid of someone doing it with a quad explosive double barrel. Look it up.
---
The difference is that OP wants to cotrol our choices and the content we get.
---
Maaate I'd be so hyped! I'm dissapointed there's no Starfield but regardless I'm over the moon we have Fallout at E3 for 2 years in row.
---
You’ll see, the crowd is gonna go crazy :)
---
It might happen, might, we will have to wait and see.
---
Downvote for clickbait.  Share or GTFO
---
Stealth builds are OP against scorchbeasts, they drop so fast lmao
---
It also doesn't help that (from what people have said) literally all of the pve enemies are immune to rad damage
---
Yeah it’s a little easy apart from some of the high end events. 
---
I want places on the map to be afraid of. Something akin to Quarry Junction in NV.
---
Lmao. It's not clickbait. Sharing would actually be against the sub rules you little troll. Look at my karma and the hotposts page and tell me if I give one single solitary fuck about your downvote.
---
These are sad times for fallout fans I miss the days of story driven games that were good, but I mean I think everyone should just be open minded it might be better then we think
---
Kids and teenagers don’t even know what Fallout is, most of them are mobile only.
---
You asked why.  Trollololololololol
---
K
---
^^ this is 100% correct
---
Is it really any different now though? Anyone can suicide to set their points back to zero, and now that one schmuck who did one quest is on top of the board instead
---
Unfortunately doing that makes the Deathclaw so docile that it will not attack anything ever (even enemies that are actively hitting it), turning it into a glorified decoration.
---
&gt; basic crowned loot and a tiny chance at a prime plan. The ultracite they give you is nothing special because of how easy it is to get - they
---
I love being locked into an endless stagger while they maw me to death!
---
To OP, yes they are annoying AF and could use some love.  Not legendaries necessarily since 1 star items are worthless now but something unique for the time spent
---
**I would take a chance at any of the following items:**
---
Corpse Stamen
---
Strangler Bloom
---
Nuclear Keycard
---
Assualtron Recall Keycard
---
A chance for plans to mod Urban Scout Armor
---
Basically anything in the game that is difficult to find.  Hell I would take some tick blood!
---
For real, people said the same when 76 was first announced yet here we all are
---
Good point.  I never saw runaways that often in the old days.
---
That's what happened to me few hours ago
---
It can be done so easily.  I just tired of flipping thru them
---
Lol, same here
---
Reduced weight fully modded still weights like 16-18 compared to 24-26 non reduced weight fully modded
---
iTunes link?
---
Bethesda has lost its way.  To do some bullshit like this would sadly be typical at this point.
---
Can we filter out superfluous cards too? I don’t want to have to scroll through Weapons Artisan (for example) 1 and 2 to get to and equip 3. Its an absolute mess in my deck of cards.
---
Nope. Can't destroy camps anymore. Not even turrets other people place
---
Yep, same issue. I sucked it up and did the tour just to get rid of her
---
They cap at 90% so if you use 3 FDC armor (6O%) and 1 tru hiker card you’ll hit 90% and any other FDC armor you add is useless in reducing weight
---
True, but I'll take every extra pound I can get
---
It's an issue because vast majority of the fanbase isn't into BR. And, typically, you want to keep the majority of your fanbase happy. This is Fallout, Fallout is historically single player. Co-Op, and even some PvP, still fits. Full-on BR does not.
---
BR is also quite a risk, seeing how many much better, fully dedicated BR games spike and then fizzle out. FO76 isn't a dedicated PvP game, it's not a dedicated BR game. It doesn't have the chops, technically or mechanically, to support BR well. And when dedicated BR games die easy when the winds change, FO76 likely has no hope in hell of making it big. This is just Bethesda trying to  get a piece of that hot, moist BR money pie they've been eyeing Fortnite stuffing its face with. 
---
I could be wrong though, maybe there's enough interest. But based on what I saw in the game so far, it'll be niche at best. And while it's free, free content for a niche fraction of the population isn't good policy, which is why it's an issue.
---
As an example, I give you the failure that is EVE Online. Something like 70% of the game's population live in high security space, and never leave it. Something like 20% are in null security. And the rest are split between low sec and wormhole space. You'd think developers would look at their own data, and say "Hey, vast majority of our fanbase never leave hi-sec, maybe we should focus more on them?" Nope, instead they catered to the psychotic 20% of the population. End result? Despite being a monumental technological achievement in MMOs so far, doing things like allowing battles of 3,000+ players, the game never peaked over 500k subscribers, and has been slowly dying, and recently got sold to the Chinese (the guys who did Black Desert). And that's with almost zero competition in sci-fi genre. It could have been amazing, but they decided to be edgy, rather than go for the sure thing. Meanwhile WoW, which is less than a year younger than EVE, still has millions of subscribers, and peaked at what, 12 mil? Why? They cater to the vast majority of the player base, not the niche.
---
Ap you have your camp at a lead deposit?
---
That's great news! Thanks so much!
---
Its always max
---
Invisible ghoul attacks suck, but I have to say having a horde of ghouls stuck in the laying down pose just slithering across the ground towards me is probably one of the more hilarious bugs I’ve seen.
---
Reduced weight armor brings it down to like 3.5, but I’d prefer perk cards for a rifle so I can run with my FDC armor, I could free 4-6 perk slots
---
What perks do you currently have??
---
I like this idea in principal but after the bad behaviour of the hate-trainers I imagine Bethesda would be exposing themselves to ridicule if they state anything. Really, one post saying 'we are looking at X' will result in 'Beth is incompetent' screeching after one solitary item they state is pushed back. Best to maintain radio silence with only professionally marketed reveals, imho
---
I wish this thread got more upvotes so it could get their attention.
---
Ye that could be real good with full auto rifle perks and the prime auto reciever. Well for last 40% of SBQs Hp.
---
Definitely my favorite weapon in the game. Would also help if plasma carts dropped a little more than they do now. I feel like I find more mini nukes than plasma carts when I'm looting
---
You know it.
---
I mostly live on spoiled stuff, so there’s that.
---
Yes. This. We need packs of Deathclaws, or Sheepsquash. Or, even a duo of Scorchbeasts. At least, in some more exclusively high-level areas. :)
---
Then just don’t play the mode? It hardly a forced thing and won’t impact you at all. It’s not a game directed to just your preference. You still have the same game you enjoy, but it also has an off-shoot that others may enjoy.
---
There was nobody at that moment and I supposed that I will end at the same spot. It's not a case of all camps there, of course, but I think this particular camp is the problematic one. I hope Bethesda will do something with the problematic spawning finally.
---
I was enjoying it right til I backed up into the trap door and had 2 death claws inches from my face :( 
---
So many stimpaks gone.
---
Just added the links to the post. :) It's here: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chad-a-fallout-76-story/id1466244990](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chad-a-fallout-76-story/id1466244990)

A lot of us who see the event don't even bother with the amount of times it's crashed on us
---
You’re absolutely right
---
“A Jack of all trades is a master at none”
---
Add me... Dookiestorm.. I got a video club on there already so I got on atleast every other day.. so def shoot me a invite..
---
Make them all Legendary, done and done, take it an go
---
I've got an AA The dragon I carry around with me mostly just for them and in case I run into a legendary sheepsquatch.  One stealth crit with my combat perks on and it deals a solid chunk of their health. Makes them real easy to kill but I rarely engage them unless I have to because they're so annoying and just wreck my armor.
---
What’s an assaultron recall keycard
---
They are also annoying for their annoying omni-directional attack spam, following you while stealthed and rarely landing.
---
It would still suck to get one to half health then bam its back at full

All the possible op builds ruin balance, players that want a challenge need to change perks, drop PA, etc.
---
I stopped playing two weeks after launch. there were posts about this then. How have they still not fixed this? Plenty of posts about this skyrocketed to the top of the sub months ago. Christ.
---
This is amazing! Keep it up. I wanna hear more
---
You can’t even kill a Yao gui with melee can you lol? I just get tossed around
---
That was bound to happen, sadly. People will always play the meta in online games + some areas offer better loot/mobs when nuked, so the players are kinda forced to use it at those places.
---
I get where you're coming from tho, and I agree. I used to want to build my home there, because of how amazing it is, but i don't want to risk my shit getting destroyed.
---
I usually only see this on Tuesdays (after midnight) . Middle of the week, server updates in a few hours; people just go to bed.

Wow sounds like a great game that. X

Fml you ruined everything for me. As soon as I got home from work I logged on and ft'd there to look... I didn't believe you but wow my mind is shattered lololol😂😂
---
Flamers can be used as medic weapons with the friendly fire perk, but yeah, sort of forces you to go heavy weapons for a medic build, a good fix might just be to add more flame weapons in different weapon categories.
---
Same. I'm not even specced into explosives or heavy weapons, but who can say no to a fat man that weighs 4 pounds?
---
I say give em 250 DR and 10k HP and all have incisor.
---
1. Bloodied / Explose Laser Rifle (with beam splitter mod)
---
2. TSE Laser Rifle (With beam splitter)
---
3. 4 and 5 Any Bloodied firerate gun
---
I've had my camp in the SAME spot since BETA... I've always had things spawn near by... only mongals, mole rats, and sometime Mothman/ Flatwoods.. I'm around multi locations that has Mutants, Scortch, ghouls and they never come to my place
---
Keep em coming.
---
I don't think they are that much trouble...
---
This really is a struggle...my viewfinder said a long name with vertibot at the end and it didn't count... I'll try taking the munitions workshop next, I thought this would be easy
---
Will do! We have a whole season planned with summer specials. :)
---
Thanks stud! lol
---
This game desperately needs a version of Skyrim's Dragonrend
---
The effect is listed as "Weapon weights reduced by 20%" however this only effects ranged weapons. With 5 pieces instead of getting 100% weight reduction, you get 90%. So my 20 pound Handmade Rifle now weights 1.8 pounds. My already weight reduced harpoon gun weighs 0.03 pounds. Some weapons have a listed weight of 0.00 pounds.
---
I go through there often and kill everything that tries to move. It's the best way to get exp and a bunch of chems for the time I'm actually on.
---
Yea sure I could go farm for 3 hours to get enough chems for about an hours worth of events. Or I could go do two laps of whitesprings and get enough chems for 4 hours worth of events. If they didn't make this area so rich in loot that i wanted I'm sure I would never go there.
---
They still haven't fixed this???? Free ammo I guess.
---
I've been getting a random plan drop from regular SBs, not very often maybe one in ten.
---
In 4 the first one you meet it literally gives you a T-45 power Armor suit and a mini gun. Making the fight easy. Honestly Death claws don't bother me anymore and it makes me sad.
---
His list is awesome, but he did leave out one repeating quest hub that I consider a must for all toons: in Morgantown, there is a frat house that open up Vault-tec University booze quests. Each day I go to see my Robobrain pal Biv who sends me on a booze adventure which rewards alcohol recipes that you can only get from him! I love collecting recipes and Biv is easily one of the greatest robot NPCs across all fallout titles :)
---
Just great! :-)
---
I had a camp on the north peak for a while. Got tired of fighting for the spot, but it's a great view. Basketball court on the roof.
---
OMG why don't we already?
---
Thank you!
---
I agree that SB should have better rewards.  Wendigos drop the most loot.  Sheepsquatch is always a guarantee legendary.  But a SB is meh on exp and meh on rewards usually.  Not totally useless, but yes, pretty meh.  But asking people to upvote your post for whatever reason is also pretty meh.
---
Lucky Hole Mine slightly south of the Monorail Elevator. Equip Excavator for extra yield when looting ore. That mine can get you around 350 and after smelting it with super duper it's 2500+ lead scrap. It's insane. With how often I don't have to make ammo after getting such a large yield, I always forget how much I actually get at the end because I go for a week or 2 without doing it.
---
Toxic Larry's Meat N' Go will always have 3 Snallygasters, and each of them gives you 3 to 9 acid. You spawn immediately next to them (within 10 ft), wait 10 or so seconds for everything to load in, kill them, and repeat. They can hit hard, but they also die pretty damn fast. 
---
Steel is more difficult to get than lead once you're running the mine, and I've noticed that you can't server hop ore anymore (or it's doing that for me anyway...). Hornwright Testing Sight #3 has the most iron nodes I know of at around 20+, and nets you around 210 ore, and smelting it is about 1k steel scrap, but that won't be enough with how much lead you have, and most ammo requires more steel than lead, so you have to pair it with another method, and the easiest is scrapping weapons. Pick a location with a lot of enemies like Supermutants and Mole Miners (Scorched are okay, but not everything they drop gives you quite as much steel as the other 2, so it's not worthwhile). With the Scrapper perk equipped, if you run through Welch and kill and loot all the Mole Miners, you can get around 500 steel in a few minutes, or Grafton Steel has dozens of Supermutants and definitely will get you a lot of steel, but the layout does make it annoying to do (for me anyway). Other locations are West Tek, Harper's Ferry, the Penitentiary in the Toxic Valley, Uranium Fever is pretty good with the number of spawns you get, and etc.
---
The pure stable flux is yes located in the junk tab
---
ok, but still ultracite is no go for rad resistance
---
Just when you think you saw it all. Nice work!
---
Ty

I say that every time I fight one of the annoying fuckers. I don't understand why Bethesda gave them like 70-90% damage mitigation while their airborne its fucking INFURIATING having to shoot them with enough ammo to put down like 4 lvl 100 Alpha Sheepsquatch WHILE using One Gun Army and THEY NEVER FUCKING LAND. Then as OP said they don't even drop anything worth a damn. Woo hoo 2 Ultracite Scrap, I can clear out that mine in the Cranberry Bog and walk out with like 70 without having to deal with any but 1 Scorch Beast which can just be ignored if you so choose. I kind of feel like every Scorch Beast should be Legendary (at least we might get something decent out of killing them, and make it so they just don't mutate) or their stupid DR should be removed (come on now Bethesda you already nerfed our potential damage output with ranged by 2-3x when you gimped the fuck out of Demolition Expert(why the hell is a 5 rank perk only 60% damage, reduce that shit to 3 ranks FFS), nerfed Two Shot into the ground AND nerfed the Explosive effect).
---
I wish we could get some kind of like Microwave emitter gun or some jazz that forces Scorch Beasts (minus the Queen maybe) to land after hitting it a single time, would make all of our lives a lot easier.
---
At this point Scorch Beasts just piss me off completely, I always try to avoid them and I hate fighting them as its a waste of resources and time. Even experience wise they only give you like 2 and half lvl 68 Super Mutants worth of XP.
---
That batch was 200 adhesive, 120 circuitry, 100 nuclear waste, 300 screws, 260 springs, 480 steel, and 240 wood. 
---
So far on my quest for a suppressor and a powerful auto receiver I have used well over 600 screws.
---
Ita used to summon the imposter sheepsquatch. At this time it can only be bought with caps.
---
Wasn't this an X-Men movie?
---
So, those people playing the game their way are keeping you from playing the game your way?
---
Thank you! I'm really happy with how out it turned out.
---
I still run melee only, with a splash of rifleman perks. I just run away now, lol.
---
Energy reisistance and radiation resistance are both weak stats.
---
There is only one enemy in the game that relies on energy damage over ballistic, and that is the laser turret.
---
Every other enemy deals more ballistic damage than energy, or circumvents that with poison/explosive damage.
---
The difference between ultracite and t-51 is 1 dr, which means nothing, and the difference between them in energy resistance is not significant because there are no huge damage bursts of energy damage, the difference 60 er makes when you are already over 200 is dramatically reduced by the nature of the armor system. Radiation resistance on power armor is four times more significant than rr on normal armor, a difference of 80 rad resist is more akin to gaining 320 radiation resistance on normal armor. Still not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but still worth noting.
---
Really, the difference in power armor is negligible, the armor system values increasing amounts of resistance less and less, and even a new power armor with twice the resistance in all catagories would not feel significantly more powerful than current, as the threshold for achieving the lion's share of damage protection is very low.
---
\~100 for energy, and \~250 for ballistic will cover most of your damage reduction needs, after that diminishing returns set in and getting more damage protection takes exponentially more damage resistance.
---
If you can afford a fully upgraded suit of ultracite it is theoretically the best overall suit in general, but the cost is disproportionate, so it's not really worth it.
---
Dude I would 100% play a new PvP mode for Fallout 76. If its balanced and the rewards justify playing it then I don't care
---
Quick update : ran across a vendor last night selling the mods for 200 caps each.  It made my night. Now to find new paint schemes for the T60
---
Do the Sheepsquatch quest line. Ends in a boss event against a legendary. Shits nuts.
---
Can def agree to that as well.. or heck. Have like a storage something to place triplicates etc.  it is quite the hot mess.
---
I’ve been in the same place since beta, and am just now looking for a new place to live, by choice not necessity. It is what it is. If you find a good spot then others probably will too.
---
I found some bacon flux the other day which i was able to sell for 40 a piece. $$$
---
As a PvP focused player who adapted to games conditions I find the gameplay extremely skill based, knowledge based and cooperation based. I don't find it surprising that people who come where teamplay is crucial alone find themselves a lootbag for someone else. If you are on PC I'll gladly show how you can rock in PvP without stealthboys, assassin sentinel armor or explosive guns. The fact is that this games combat effects is very vaguely described and most people ain't aware whats good and whats bad and when exactly its good/bad, causing a wide gap between the majority and the minority. But this gap is mostly knowledge and skill based.
---
Link to a document I'm working on, containing entry level tips for PvP beginners, as well as some build examples, including my main. Because I stock not only myself, but also an organisation that surrounds me, I kept some of the juciest stuff out of this document, but it will be updated with time. Sparse as it is, some information there is enough to influence the markets, especially the 'in combat' mechanics under regenerating armor. Sneak is also worth analysing, but for now I'll leave the related research to the readers.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IisQXItV_gWsBvBW4PEebQG7mtxr10Q90GydiP6JeU/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Shit...by those numbers T-51 is better than X-01.
---
I'll have to go find some.
---
The problem with adding a BR mode is that it is ONLY for PVP, everything else added is in both PVE and PVP servers. So if the split is 50/50 you’re giving content to only 50% of the players and if that’s all I get for this part of the road map you’re gonna lose a lot of PVE players going to other games instead of sticking by the same stuff for months on end.
---
Fixed refill per hit, it’s why VE Heavy Guns are really good
---
I feel that, my best gun is a .50 cal marksman rifle that I built
---
Wow, that is really cool. I’d never have thought to do that.
---
Same with the queen
---
I mean, it's really simple.  Whitesprings is part of the Savage Divide.  Therefore, the enemies can spawn well above Lv. 60.  You are Lv. 26.  Do the math.  Unless you get lucky and are the first person to visit Whitesprings in a long while, you're going to be out of your league, nukes or not.  A lot of players set up trading posts there before it's a de facto hub, so good luck with that.
---
I also find that players don't nuke Whitesprings as frequently as before.  Silos are a bit more tedious to run now and player vending provides alternatives for flux collection.
---
Yeah, I wasn't into everquest, but I did play an equally old (if not slightly older) Ultima Online... ahh 1998, the real golden age of mmo's.
---
Bethesda needs to make other areas worth nuking. This would change things up a bit and alleviate some of the problems you discussed.  Unfortunately there are lots of ghouls there that mutate with a nuke drop. It's a great farming spor.
---
That's pretty neat! Well done!
---
I also have this same error, but haven't seen anyone else report this issue. Any luck with removing the  **$GraphicSettingChangedDlgTitle**  and changing  your settings?
---
I have an i7 6700K and an EVGA GTX 970 SSC. No mods installed.
---
Tell me you scrapped the minigun for more steel
---
I was furious yesterday trying to find this camera spot, my neighbors must think I'm a sailor now. I had given up after two dozen pics failing, but Google showed me the way; whomever months ago wrote 'I felt the cold statue against my butt', thank you!!
---
+50 percent damage at 40 percent health
---
Neither did I. The idea came spontaneously when I removed a flooring and realized it looked like a swimming pool.
---
Well it's interesting. Sort of comfy. But interesting.
---
This is so toxic smh. PvP was said to be in the game since before release and whilst I do believe a majority of people prefer PvE there are still many who enjoy fighting other players. It offers the highest challenge available and is something this franchise has never offered before. 
---
It's obvious this whole update won't be focused on PvP and wishing negativity on the game/developers just because it's going to feature something *you* personally don't like is no different than all the anti-Bethesda sentiment featured on No Mutants Allowed.
---
I just pretend duping doesn't exist and ignore the "hardcore" metagame crap. There are other people out there who are doing the same, who sell legendaries for reasonable prices, who group up with other casual players to run events or hold workshops together. I've had a LOT more positive player interaction in Adventure mode because there is no risk of accidentally setting off a blood feud to the death.
---
Does the SBQ count?
---
Hot diggity dog that is.  Good find!
---
Survival Mode is what made the 100% PvE Adventure Mode possible, dude. JFC I swear you trolls have the same goddamn talking points. "wasted developer time" my ass
---
No just a regular one
---
Heres a little seceret. I have always wondered why I have never seen people at the event in the ash heap breach and clear. If you have a hornwright senior executive card you can grab so much of all types of ore except ultracite. 
---
The machine that was made by hornwright was made to rival the excavator suits made by garahan minining. So needless to say it pulls a grip of ore out of the earth. You'll need a ton of acid though. This can be easily acquired from the bloodbug probosis from campfire tales and the workshop hemlock holes.
---
Two lead ore plus one acid equals five lead scrap. If your using super duper you could grab ten lead scrap.  I have been doing this for awhile. It has allowed me to sell lead at a ridcoules cheap price. I have people on my friends list who only join my game to cash out on the lead I'm selling. With a few breach an clears done and a little bit of acid you should have a minimum of five hundred lead. I hope this helps!
---
Much appreciated.
---
Also keep in mind pre-nerfed Scorched Beasts existed in a time where a Two Shot Explosive The Dragon did like 10K damage a shot and could 1 shot a lvl 80 Scorch Beast, and most explosive weapons dealt about 3-4 times as much damage as they do now, not only that Scorch Beasts also received a buff as they now have more damage mitigation while airborne than they use to.
---
In my opinion the things should be dropping 2/3 Stars, Ultracite plans, or Serum Recipes non-stop for how freaking annoying and resource intensive they are to kill now. While the Queen should get her tables buffed, and should always drop 2 or 3 3 star Legendary items and even have a chance at producing Legacy weapons (Explosive Energy Guns).
---
Currently Scorch Beasts including the Queen are annoying and nearly pointless to fight (at least the Queen gives Ultracite plans, and yes I know Star Scorch Beasts can drop Ultracite Plans too, but its a like 1% chance or something like that)
---
please tell me you're on xbox, i need to visit
---
My experience with buglists is that they're always growing and the last thing you want to do is give someone a stick to hit you with. Sorry to sound negative. :)
---
I don’t think that there is one yet, I’ve never seen one
---
Yeah.
---
It's all about moderation though.  Truth be told, it turns into a "Toxic Rad Hole" because we get Reddit drama queens pouring from out of the woodwork, who *never* contribute anything else to this sub and basically roam Reddit looking for opportunities to create drama.  Eventually, they get bored and you'll never see them again.
---
I think the way you try to work around that is to create a Megathread and deny them the glory of their personal soapbox.  All their barking gets lost in a thread with thousands of posts.  No one is the wiser.
---
Its totally not dmg because ill smack something for a metric shit ton and regain 10 hp. Melee vamp shits not the best.
---
Wow, I'm lvl 120 and never had more than 4k caps, nicely done
---
It's only natural for OP to dislike a br mode.
---
After all, the weak should fear the [strong](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/219/664/ae1.jpg).
---
Huh?
---
Oh ok was just curious
---
These posters don't know. What happens is they get their ass handed to them and then repeat this dogma.
---
I've been playing Survival only since it came out and I think it's super fun. Sure there are about a dozen folks who have insane weapons and one shot everyone. But they are a small part of the game and can be blocked.
---
It does seem amazing that I can modify a Gatling laser how to use ultracite ammo but I can't fix a damn fridge
---
Maybe vanguard with improved sneak?
---
Full (nearly) list of mod plans for excavator through x-01 can be bought in stores.  not sure what you are referencing with the "hard to obtain"/ "easy to obtain" list on those. Not trying to start an argument, just curious.
---
Well I have my Hazmat suit and Radaway to survive this assumed mess that'll come, but I'm sure they'll also be some positive posts for things like the vault dungeons!
---
there's also the new stimpak diffuser, it's like a stimpak but heals you and your team
---
There is a link to original post with this data, although it is quite old, it's still clear that Ultracite RAD resist is low
---
If I had my way, just have Ultracite have the "zealots" passive and it would give it a purpose. Otherwise, you're correct; it's a pointless PA variant.
---
Tbh the majority of the "fanbase" railed against Fallout 3... and Fallout 4... and they both sold more than nine million copies.
---
System?
---
Yeah, lots of players run through Whitesprings for exp but it seems like it’s eased up lately. I’ve noticed players spreading out more ever since player vending. Having more level 62 ghoul spawns I think is more a function of the game being out 6mos. There are just more higher level players. I don’t excessively farm exp but just playing the quests/exploring, my level has gone up.
---
That is a cool idea. No need of a new vendor, you could just use the already existing ammo vending machines :-)
---
Ps4
---
I'm not against, but this is written from PvP perspective. 
---
TL;DR I proposed something casual PvErs, casual PvPers and hardcore PvPers will all probably enjoy.
---
One thing good about survival score is that if you're dominating the server and using map marker to lead your opponents into battleground more fun than stations, and they get one lucky shot on you, you might still get lots of it back if you get your revenge.
---
At the same time, there is a need from people who aren't after pure PvP, but rather after thrilling exploration with added sense of  organic thinking danger lurking out there, get their asses handed to them because suddenly they become a global invitation to dance.
---
A solution that I believe would satisfy all concerned parties would be implementing two sets of 'survival scores'. Maybe adventure-score and survival score. Both of them should give certain rewards for achieving given thresholds, adventure score giving out useful items, survival score giving out bragging rights items.
---
You should get 100 points of survival score per player kill, and receive 75% of downed player survival score as a bonus. Only survival score leaderboards would make you map marker, so if you are after hard PvE, then you'll do your best to avoid killing people and sneak your way around them to prevent gaining any survival score and the risk of becoming map marker.
---
You should get adventure score for the XP you obtain. Upon dying, you loose 25% of your adventure score, so that stings. Rewards tied to high adventure score make it so that each death puts you further from your goal, so that kinda stings. At the same time, players who kill you won't get any adventure points out of you, so that there's no incentive to go after PvErs. Adventure score would not show anybody on maps.
---
This I believe would solve the two problems we currently have - no good way to display 'come at me bro' at the map, and people whose immersion is spoiled because they have to perform controlled suicide to prevent becoming a map-wide 'come at me bro'.
---
4x life giver
---
1x chameleon
---
Connor MacLeod build
---
Well assuming its a battle royal its not like their will be any OP bullshit like full Assassin/Cav/Sent or perma cloak building running around.
---
This is assuming while you will be on your leveled character, this will be a completely separate event where all your gear is stashed and you have nothing but the shirt on your back, like 2 Stimpacks, and a Pipe or 10mm Pistol with enough ammo for 2 reloads. (I would assume we'll start this event with some kind of gear due to the PvEvP nature of the game, but who knows we might all just spawn in naked or something)
---
Well nicely done. Looks great!
---
you arent wrong about lucky hole mine being the best source, but to get 2500 lead you'd have to server hop 2 times. it takes 2 lead ore to 1 acid to produce 5 lead scrap. 350/2 = 175.    175\*5 = 875.   875+30% is 1137.5 ore rounded
---
was your brother on your team? i think teammates can't damage them
---
Thank you for your kind words!
---
Thanks so much!! Ill give it a try an tell you if it works!
---
yeah gotten a few that way. with a bloody gatling build, i goto surface to air and can pop 6 SB before the event is over since they respawn when one gets downed.
---
Did you grab the medic power armour from in there?
---
Is there any conformation for this?
---
Lmao if its anything like the r/LowSodiumAnthem subreddit, its an even more toxic shithole than the regular sub. (I mean how the community acts towards people who don't drink the koolaid from their echo chamber safe space)
---
There is no plans that let you mod Scout Armour, you can only buy Mods from one of the MODUS vendor (in the Armoury) and they are broken as they don't tell you if they are for Arms, Legs or Chest.
---
Stay flithy 07
---
If it is any help it has been driving me nuts for over half a year. Welcome to hell.
---
yeah that would be sweet. I only need 47 more plans total (out of a list of over 1000)  it's extremely unlikely that anyone has any of the plans I don't know so a lot of money is spent on fast-travel for nothing.
---
how about medics?  does medics scale?
---
Upvote because QoL
---
It's because you actually have a ghost of your character standing somewhere.
---
I agree 100%
---
I sucked at PvP when I started. Seriously. I had a group of guys raid my camp in the beginning. I had my OP melee char who could melt mobs in PvE. I tried killing these guys but I was destroyed. It fucking hurt. I was really pissed off. My amazing PvE char was always destroyed in PvP.
---
Then I made a new char and began to learn to stay hidden. Now I have learned how to kill people hunting me. And I'm working on getting better at active combat.
---
It takes time and patience. And a notebook to keep track of what works and what doesn't. 
---
And you have to go back and keep fighting or playing to get good.
---
When I see posts like OPs the phrase Get Good flashes in my mind. I don't post that though because it doesn't help. But that's what people need to do to survive in a wasteland. Pay attention and learn.
---
If you have vampire's on a ripper blade or Mr handy buzzsaw you can get crazy regen with it.
---
I agree that Scorchbeast loot is a bit underwhelming. I’ve killed quite a few and I dont think I’ve ever got anything notable from them. Maybe plans?
---
The main strength of Fallout has always been the retro-futuristic wasteland aesthetic and immersive atmospheric sandbox. Bethesda does sandbox games with some quests layered on top to give the unimaginative masses some simple breadcrumbs to follow, but that's not the focus.
---
Use a gamma gun to kill them with rads, preferably with the executioners effect on it as it does 50% more damage when they're under 40% health, and most bloodied builds gate themselves at 20% Health with rads to have the full effect of Bloodied.
---
weapons with high rate of fire with the executioners effect can also just shred through people. I use a Executioner Exploding 50. Cal. Most of the exploding effect can be negated with dense and fireproof, but hell it still packs a punch!
---
I scrap everything that isn’t my TSE Lever Action
---
*The hero we all need but don't deserve.'*
---
Hahaha you play like me!
---
I have a one star AA Handmade and I am usually on the leaderboards . I do whitespings and pleasant valley. Bog town is fun to hide in. I'm working on learning watoga.
---
I don't hide in interiors much because people seem to not want to look for me in there. Well unless it's one of the guys with those laser rifles. Then I go interior and set up traps with my team mate.
---
One guy had a kill streak of over 90 and I killed him by hiding and shooting.
---
The assaultron recall keycard completely skipped my mind - that would be a great idea for rare loot from scorchbeasts, it would really give you a reason to fight them
---
You're welcome!
---
Foolish because I didnt think you could have all three pylons activated by yourself?
---
PA is probably a requirement, maybe stonewall/adamantium skeleton makes it *bear*able but idk
---
This is a cool and good idea.
---
enemies can open doors
---
I spend a lot less ammo on the queen since I got a good shotgun and the enforcer perk plus the targeting perk. Hit her wings, she comes down, knock her to hell with my best melee weapon.
---
But yeah the rewards stink. The repair kits are handy as hell, I use those for making all my broken armor fixed to the same degree after a sbq fight. I like the ultracite PA plans because those are the biggest seller I have. But still not great. I kill the sbq because I want to help out whoever launched plus I like killing ads
---
oh. understood. not your list.  and not even the linked posters list.
---
yep ive done this one a few times and it's spawned a group of them of various types.
---
In the interview with PC gamer a few days back they said they are monitoring what mods are most popular to see what features players most want added to the game, and the Perk Cards Manager mod is the second most downloaded one (better inventory management is number one). So hopefully we will see something like this soon.
---
Seriously, I get her to land. It's not immediate but it's helpful as hell. Shotgun plus enforcer plus the targeting perk, she lands and usually stays for a good while
---
I wish Bethesda had named that place The Whitesprings, because that's all people want to call it and it's giving me a nervous tick to see it all the time.
---
It's The Whitespring.  Singular.  No *s* at the end.
---
Only scenario that scares me is 3 of those things at once. Get staggered, you're so vulnerable
---
Make sure you follow the Responders quest line. You get a lot of beneficial Plans and Recipes.
---
Yeah, it should be a three star card.  Rank 1 increases basic junk yield.  Rank 2 gives chance for rare junk like screws.  Rank 3 increases chance to learn mods via scrapping or something
---
I found them annoying because I get blinded and deafened by their perma-screech.
---
The recall keycard, what a great idea. A chance to win one by killing the queen? Yes. I like it
---
2000 to be exact
---
There are groups now that do something interesting. There is a leader and he sends out his bitches to gather points wither by questing or killing PvP. Then they bring their points to this leader and the leader kills them to get their points. 
---
Shits silly how important it is to some folks to be on the top.
---
If yo still need this, send me a pm with your PSN, I just recently acquired one.  I would like it back afterwards though so I can help others
---
Every time I get attacked by a Scorch Beast their is always enough foliage around that the SoB just refuses to land. (I run One Gun Army 2 and use a TSE Gatling Plasma which is Prime AND has a Splitter, and a Fletchette FE Harpoon Gun) I should be crippling the fuck out of everything on them and they almost never land, it usually takes like 200+ shots from my Gatling Plasma and or about a dozen shots from my Harpoon Gun to force one to land.
---
I can melee a yg in 4 swipes of my DC gauntlet, 3 if I power attack it
---
I honestly like a bit of everything with the queen. The guaranteed 2* armor (ez 9 scrip) and 5x flux for completing the event, the random legendary from the queen (usually crap but hey, yesterday I got a decent 3* ammo weight reduction armor piece), the ammo sink to help keep my weight down, and any bonuses from killing adds. I guess it's also a cool place to show off my gear and see what others have
---
Here is what I honestly think will happen. They announce a battle royale type mode but I don't think they call it a battle royale. Fans at the conference cheer but the fans at home and on social media flip. Then they announce wastelanders and everyone complaining stops.
---
Get them as they crawl out of their fissure and you can take them out with a knife before they take off.
---
They don't always die fast. Not every player has a crew on hand all the time to help them nor does every player have excellent armor or guns. So for some people the sbq does not die fast
---
Definitely. I have a toon with a vampire gatlin plasma that rarely drops below full health.
---
Really? I get a ton of Prime plans of them... That I then sell in my vending machines for a few K caps a piece.....
---
For the pvp mode? Some datamined audio files talking about being in danger and needing to get into the storm. Sounds pretty convincing about being a BR but it could definitely be something else.
---
Shotgun with Enforcer Perk.
---
I believe there should be a negative multiplier added. Say like 5 mutations, then 2.5 times negative effects. And there should be combo bonuses like say combine marsupial and eagle eye you get an added bonus of something. Or maybe you combine mutations and get an added negative bonus of some kind. Something to both help tone down as well as add reason
---
It was a few days ago so not sure, if I had the space I did if not I may have left it.
---
Currently about 40 hours in and haven't even done the bit where you go to the Jefferson monument to find your dad, keep getting distracted.
---
Seems so :(
---
If you look at the floorboards, one of them is not in line with the others. It aggravates me.
---
You can just put the excavator arms on to get the mining bonus. Thank goodness because my excavator armor is permanently bugged and I always lose the 100 extra carry weight when I exit it
---
I’m not a pvp’er but I ducked into the server just long enough to get it since I’m melee. I will say it’s interesting that some of you value anything at 10,000 caps. Only twice have I  spent more than 500 on equipment. An hammer and a serum. I definitely agree to hold it back for a few weeks before you unload it. But you may want to load up your vender in advance, then move to white springs for a weekend and raise prices to mirror the local economy. On sunday have a fire sale and cut prices in half to you can dump it all and relocate camp back out.
---
I’d recommend heading back there at some point to grab it, it’s an interesting g variant!
---
&gt;and being sneak I can only afford 3 in strength
---
I'm mainly stealth and have a steady 39 strength maxing at 50.
---
You must have an odd build.
---
The irony of a fallout 76 player telling other people how to feel about something is astounding
---
oh no
---
I left a like! Thanks for the advice! Can i get a personal tour? Lol
---
I will, thank you!
---
Obviously SBs are end game enemies... They're there to be tough when you're not prepared or not high enough level. 
---
You don't need godtier items to kill them. You just need to be smart. You can kill them without too much trouble without a single legendary item. 
---
The most reliable way is to have lvl3 enforcer perk and any shotgun. Any. It's not there to do damage. Pop a few shells into the SB and it will always land. Always. Then finish it off with whatever you're spec'd into.
---
When your weapons get better, you won't even bother trying to make them land and just blow them out of the sky.
---
Ad victorium mate
---
I’ve gone from level 15 to level 51 in four days, just by staying in and around WS area. Yes at level 15 I died a lot when fighting level 62 ghouls, but it gets better very quickly. Ghouls drop weapons and armors for you, always switch to the highest level you can use. If you get lucky and pick up a low level bloodied weapon, you’ll level up very fast. The security bots are on your side, shoot every ghoul you encounter and lead them to the sentry bots. Bots will fight for you. Nuked WS is pretty tough, I just server hopped when I get caught in one. Glowing ghouls are bullet sponges to low level weapons. 
---
Yes it’s a high traffic area you can’t keep it for yourself, but those players can be helpful too if you play it right. Find a shotgun and shoot at the ghoul crowds to tag them, then when they’re killed you can get the xp and loot. But if you’re melee person it’s not easy, you can’t easily ‘tag’ everything before they are killed by others.
---
Bloodied DeathClaw Gauntlet and their corpse launches into the air so I have to run after it.
---
Dude I'm level 360plus, I know I can't kill a sbq myself, few can. It takes a village or one player who really knows his stuff but with a shotgun and a melee weapon I ain't killing that thing alone
---
The post is about SBs, not the SBQ...
---
Yep!  I don’t PVP but am glad for them 😁👍
---
Because it doesn't need fixing, the OP needs to adapt like the rest of us have and move on.
---
Welcome back by the way :)
---
Yeah I love it too. I love throwing orbital strike grenades at her, I love bringing her down while saying 'GET DOWN HERE AND FIGHT LIKE A QUEEN' and I love keeping an eye on my battle buddy who is pretty good at meleeing the sbq. I love it all.
---
Wait.. There's actually rad storms? I'm only lvl 35 still, but I haven't seen or heard about one till now.
---
Im soo sad ... I've been wanting a coop fallout for YEARS.. we finally get one but its just horrible and just too pvp heavy.. I know you don't have to pvp but having ppl nonstop troll you so you hit them is annoying cause "pvp" and ppl destroying your base just sucks..
---
Get enforcer perk, use shotgun to land it. I been testing it out. I can get any SB to land.
---
Is this satire? Because what you want is literally in game. Like the other poster said, do the sheepsquatch quest line.
---
Nukes, missiles and grenade are under explosives thus the perk ordinance express comes into play for those pieces of ammunition
---
Never had that issue myself,they usually just die in front of me or shatter into gibs!
---
Oh I know, sorry I'm saying introduce them as a very rare drop from the beasts
---
I get your point. But it isn't like you can give a low level fully modified x-01 power armor and a level 50 weapon. Well you can but they can't use it.bthe gear is cheap not free. The biggest bonus is carry weight. I'm sticking deep pockets on the armor.
---
Doesn't matter if it's two shot or not the amount is still pretty random. I made about 100 harpoons when I started using mine. Think I have about 2000 now lol.
---
Don't get me wrong they land, it just takes for ever. FYI One Gun Armor is basically Enforcer but for Heavy Weapons and both the guns I named that I use fire 7-8 Projectiles a shot.
---
I use to run shotguns all the time and ran Enforcer 3, Skeet Shooter 3, and all 9 ranks of Shotgunner and I always had the same issues. Shoot the absolute fuck out of Scorch Beasts and they continue to fly around like nothing, then decide finally after like 5 minutes they finally want to land, at which point I finish them off easy.
---
My back hurts just looking at your “bed!”
---
lol, looks very immersive, OP! Well done.
---
You mod it at a tinkers bench I believe.
---
Gatling Guns have a brutal glitch where the projectile will fly at weird angles when leaving the barrels.  It’s more noticeable if the gun is explosive as you can see the bullet make contact with a wall or floor, no where near your reticle.  This could be the cause
---
I just bagged a Glowing Yao Guai so you're making me feel cocky
---
Well yeah it takes a few minutes. They gotta fly around and shit. But they always land soon enough. I shoot her in the wing a few times, clear the ads, then she's got another shot to the wing and she's down
---
when they are in packs, they are as deadly as NV deathclaws
---
You're correct my bad. I can kill a regular SB solo easy. I apologize
---
out does damage, the grey replacing the red proves it. it's just once I stop, all grey goes back to red
---
Just remove the leaderboard
---
They'd better buff them first or it'll just be like killing 3 Yao Guai. Slightly worrying but easy enough and no big deal
---
Its actully really good 👍
---
It's not the same.
---
Thank you! The wiki didn't help at all. 
---
Only thing it says about the Tinker's Workbench is "Crafted at a weapons workbench or tinker's workbench." 
---
Which I think is a lie as well as I could only craft the first one at the Tinker's Workbench.
---
A new pvp mode? You talking about a vault opening?
---
mods that can be learned from scrapping is affected by intelligence. gather up 30-40 mole miner gauntlets, take a berry mentat and intelligence food, then scrap them all.
---
Did you say something?
---
 I’m too busy looking for things to complain about.
---
A comment on not shooting the queen in the air.  A vats critical shot to specifically the wing, brings her down, crippling a wing.
---
Which is why Todd said it's not suppose to be fallout 5. This is a spin-off just like eso.
---
I second this motion. Motion passed!
---
Robot armor or assault rifles tend to give plenty of rubber. Yellowcake flux is everywhere, probably the most common sort. One run around a nuked Whitespring would do it.
---
You can collect it from the vats as well
---
Enforcer for whatever reason just works better against SB than One Gun Army, I don't know why it just does that. It believed that they work based on each time you pull the trigger, and because all shotguns except the combat shotgun with an auto receiver force you to pull the trigger each time, Enforcer just works better than One Gun Army
---
Good call!
---
Aside from speculation on datamines nothing official has yet been stated.
---
Eh, as long it's not the ONLY content we get (like survival wasn't the focus of wild apalachia) i don't really care, good for people who enjoy that stuff though.
---
The sound they made is annoying too, this is not a fun fight against them
---
I mean it'd be nice, but it's not necessary now that we have backpacks. My stealth sniper character has 1 strength and no weight reduction perks or armor pieces, but thanks to a level 50 Backpack (just the base one, I don't even have a high capacity one yet) and a couple pieces of deep pocketed gear, I've got like 300 carry weight, and my gear is only taking up about 100.
---
The last two times I’ve done Breach &amp; Clear, all the boxes have been empty. I still get a successful event notice &amp; XP + rewards - but zip from all those boxes.
---
Nope, I'd assume that they have the no legendary tag in the files. I think I remember a dataminer confirming this, let me see if I can find the post
---
yes, but shower is usually closer to the main exit
---
I rarely get spotted by enemies so I don't really take damage :)
---
I use 4 pieces of Unyielding BoS Combat Armor, and 1 Chameleon, and use the following Mutations: Speed Demon, Chameleon, Scaly Skin, Marsupial, Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, Grounded, and Healing Factor with R3 Class Freak.
---
Yeah all they did for survival mode was to make a few tweaks to some servers
---
if you have the carrying capacity, or are willing to huff it encumbered, westek and the 2 areas east are guaranteed super mutants zones. you can come away with a few dozen assault rifles, missile lauchers, mini-guns, laser guns that will vendor for 25-40 caps each.
---
How do you share pictures of your camp on here ? I tried to and it told me this community doesn’t allow image posts
---
if i have to sit with nothing but WA content for 3 month, i'll leave
---
First thing I do on a new server is check players killed and then studiously avoid anyone who has more than 3. Additionally I avoid any players who run around with low health. Works out fine 90% of the time.
---
I dont think a new mode should be made, BR or not. Survival is so dead and I always see the same players. A new mode would split the playerbase more, but this is my opinion. We haven't seen it work.
---
You're really missing OP's intentions.
---
The vast majority of the player base wanted a fallout 4 multiplayer.
---
TIL, thanks
---
I’m torn by this suggestion.  I kinda agree, but I thought part of the fun was just starting out with almost nothing and learning as I go.  Welcome to the wastelands, newbie, ya know?  I usually watch the map for very low levels and at least drop some Stimpaks, water, etc though.
---
I'm sure that new mode select menu just took a billion manhours to code.
---
I love it....more realistic than most, most of us have a ton of crap IRL. Ha!  I bet placing it all was a bi#*h.
---
This is a pretty cool idea. Even for those that run starched genes, it'd be nice to be able to remove specific mutations
---
I have a full 15 in strength and run full sneak (11 in agility) - I think you might be managing your perks inefficiently IF you want sneakiness. It’s do-able.
---
I've see bloatflys open doors
---
Thanks for the tips! I should just world hop until i find a nuked area namely white springs?
---
What kills me most consistently is accidentally clicking on the sleeping bags in whitesprings golf club while surrounded by 8 62-level ghouls.  The 30 second sleep and get up animation is sufficient for them to kill me.  Yao Guai are a distant second.
---
I thought it already existed as survival ;)
---
Possibly. Blackberries, which are everywhere, turn in to radberries which give yellowcake.
---
Yeah it seems to be 0-3 for me (with the occasionnal 4 and 5). On average it's around get harpoons 6 back for 4 shots.
---
I spawned into a locked one the other day.  The owner was there.  I pursued the machines, waved to him/her.  They waved back.  When I got ready to leave, I noticed the door was locked.   I went to it, turned around, and waved.   They unlocked the door, and waved, lol.  I went on about my merry way 😁
---
It must be a day ending in Y if this idea is getting posted. But seriously, remember whatever solution you're suggesting has to work on all platforms.
---
Interesting, Are you saying if there’s a high level player in the train station, a level 2 can get a level 50 drop? Is there a proximity limit?
---
Same except for scorchbeasts which give loads but I assume it's because they take loads.
---
I like this answer...👍
---
I've experienced a weird glitch on PC where none of my ballistic weapons were doing permanent damage.   Saw exactly what you did - I could take a enemy down to a sliver of health and it would all come back like it does with legendary enemies.
---
Experimented a bit with melee and explosives and they worked fine.  Had to exit and restart the game before it started working again.   
---
Wouldn't even register as tagging the enemies as it first started happening during a nuke event in WS and I couldn't figure out why I wasn't able to pick up loot or get XP from the kills the group I was running with was making.
---
How will it hurt the current player base,  its not like it would replace adventure mode. And its not like they won't continue to add more quests and stories to the base game,  there just adding more diverse content to kill time on,  I'm hoping they add team death match and a conquest mode ontop of it. If there regulate the type of gear available it would be amuch more fun and balanced outcome then survival mode.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yeah last night after posting this I got locked into another.  So I ran up to the door and started mashing the open button while yelling "Let me out" into the mic.  The owner was right outside and they enjoyed the spectacle
---
Wow just level up smh
---
I put my camp on an acid extractor near a power plant so I can feed my minigun and Gatling Laser.
---
Other players cannot kill your tames unlike what you are implying; base protection is now also active on anything in your camp including your tames. They can never damage your pet and camp unless you are in combat with the person to begin with. It is more than likely a death bug instantly killed your pet or attacking AI did the deed. I lost my bear to the death bug which instantly killed him on load in. With the way the game is right now and how taming functions it is not worth your time to tame anything until you know they will remain safe from instant death and until they scale to your level so they are useful and able to survive even level 5 supermutant attacks.
---
Lol
---
May I introduce you to Tenderizer in the Luck tree, and Enforcer in Agility? Slot one of these in, cripple the wings, it lands, it dies in 14-15 rounds from a no star Hardened Suppressed Pipe Revolver-rifle with Stealth bonuses from perks. Easy!
---
With the enforcer perk they can be invaluable for some of the bigger baddies.
---
Yep. D-pad up then up again. Choose your perk build.  Done.   PC... pick a key. Press to switch.  It’s about as easy as one can do here.
---
You can add me @Eingeborenen 
---
I play most days
---
What is bugged from one week to the next? ... from one update to the next? ... from being fixed to being bugged again after a fix for another bug is made?
---
Really, your faith in this game is remarkable.
---
While specific legendarys are great. I can say that a double barrel shotgun with +50% limb damage was alright. Not the best but it deffently stops things from walking or running if you shot both there legs. I was really expecting more from it but it does the job if you are fighting a small amount of enemies or solo targets.
---
While sneaking it deals a nice amount of damage but out of stealth it takes a few too many shots to take something out.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/mark-error-404/video/75740945
---
Why. It's an additional mode like survival. Don't like it just don't play it. Stay in adventure. That easy.
---
At the very least vaults should open and those do look like PvE content.
---
Personally i am waiting for level resets.
---
You're more likely to get something good going for weapons. The three star armor is most likely gonna be low level or wood
---
Except for the very obvious fact that they aren't acting hostile, they have a ownership tag and they are slowly walking around the camp ignoring everything; look first, click later but it doesn't matter since you can't deal damage to them unless in PvP anyhow.
---
Yeah, lvl 2 can get lvl 50 legendary that way. I don't know the max range.
---
It's not a battle Royal mode. Think fortnight and the shrinking area to play in forcing people closer together and forcing them into battle for a single survivor.
---
I mean I bought Fallout 4 then thought it wasn't that good so I wouldn't say sales are the best representative of what the fan base wants.
---
1750 with Hard Bargain and a Grape Mentat or Sweet Roll :)
---
Last night for the first time I used my tse laser in a boss fight, it broke before I could say ‘hi Alpha nice to meet you’. Yeah I was unstoppable.., until it stopped. Lasers belong in the bottom of the stash, as always.
---
They just need a durability buff
---
Read that as well. Hoping their event tomorrow makes a big announcement towards your mention of top mods... I’m also hoping they read the Fallout76 feed more frequently today so they see this request.  It’s a “must do” IMO
---
Level 2 can get level 50 weapon from Purveyor.
---
Thanks I’ll give it a try 👍🏻
---
Hey, bad news. I don't know why but my source data doesn't seem to have these containers currently. So I'm afraid it's not something I can do for you. Honestly, I don't even know which containers do work for that perk.
---
Until the update that lets us ride them... then you'll love em!
---
Hey dude, thanks for the fix. I've update the map on the post - the new version of that map is [here](https://i.imgur.com/kbxxqbQ.jpg)
---
yes, definetly want prestige system
---
I’ve played for 500+ hours and haven’t had anyone troll me since beta. Even then it only happened once. I believe most of the worst went into Survival mode. As long as you stay in Adventure mode and keep pacifist turned on the issues you list no longer exist. Players can no longer damage your camp if they aren’t hostile to you and if you have pacifist turned on it’s impossible to accidentally make them hostile to you.
---
You get lucky sometimes on both, it is a gamble. I do armor because I can sell it if it is good enough or just throw it back into the machine. Weapons will add weight up real quick. Your choice though.
---
"but oftentimes, better than a master of one."
---
This here. What they lack in oneshotting ability they more than make up for with crippling. Handy if you're low on ammo, just kneecap then sledge everything.
---
With a good melee build it's surprisingly easy.
---
That's why they invented melee weapons
---
Time to put all 15 in luck
---
No bashing is part of the its rules - that includes bashing other subs or bashing people who don’t like fo76.
---
Let us know if it works out!
---
I hear you friend! I refuse to go lower than 10k rounds of .45 ( and when other players sell it, I buy it! )
---
I totally agree. Used to run away from them until I got a better gun, now I wait til they land and then chop chop!!!  I stopped killing them when i completed kill 76 scorchbeasts for like 40 atoms. Should of been 400 atoms!!!
---
You forgot them bugging out and falling through the map once you kill them.  Or they dissolve into an ash pile you cant loot.
---
No offense on the logic here but if you crafted it at a Tinkers bench, why didnt you try that first?
---
Sounds like someone has a bad case of Wiki-pendecy.
---
With 15 \*\*\* armour, you will likely get 5 wood (that you will need to scrip immediately or lose 2 of their 3 stars when you exit the game), 4 robot, 4 leather/raider, and one piece that is sellable for under 1000 caps in your vending machine.
---
With 10 \*\*\* ranged  .... you will get at least one assaultron head, a number of pipe weapons, about 3 useless 20 lb  unstashable (unscribable because of the 150 scrip limit) hunks of junk and one weapon you can sell for about 1000 caps in your vending machine.
---
Up because mega thread prevention!
---
Yea they said they did in the past but maybe they misplaced the decimal point again.
---
This topic amazes me, like I must fundamentally be playing these games differently than a segment of the population. You see a machine and it sells something new cheap, you check it out.
---
Thought I might be overreacting but comments like "How would anyone know to buy it? Again, not looking it up at all... "
---
Gaming culture sure has changed over the years.
---
You get stimpacks!?
---
Tormentor Perk for Rifles
---
Sure will!
---
How could it get much worse at this point? Literally any change would be good as far as ive seen. 
---
Currently it's like this:  walking around doing something interesting, or cooking dog burgers... then suddenly "POP,POP,POP!"... before you can even look around, you're dead in three seconds. Hit "ignore" and respawn. That's pretty much it. Oh, and you can't even hide bcuz we all have that stupid floating name tag announcing our presence if the other guy scrolls over us accidentally, not to mention the ridiculous radar blip showing exactly where we are. Yay... so fun.
---
Probably bloodied heavy. Bloodied melee is great for massive damage but I can tell you from experience it's a struggle to keep smashing while spamming diluted radaway as SBQ throws off a lot of rads. Easier to keep your distance.
---
The hoarder's paradise
---
It’s fairly easy with a stealth build.  You can usually get 2-3 stealth attack hits in before you go from caution to danger, and that usually enough.
---
Just what everyone wants....a radioactive swimming pool! 😉
---
There is some amount of variation between the builds, but generally you want to focus on perks that increase damage for your weapons of choice and your VATS perks above all else. No carry weight reduction or other quality of life perks. Only damage and survivability. If you are going bloodied you need nerd rage, serendipity, and the accompanying mutations.
---
Highly recommended automatic rifles for PvP. Keep in mind VATS cannot target a crouched player. Just know the game mechanics, and be sneaky. Have fun out there
---
I can still see about 4 square feet of unused wall space, so I’ll give it a 9/10.
---
IMO everything is closely balanced end game depending on how you like to play and how you set up your perk cards now. I’m only talking about PVE here because PVP is entirely different animal, but for endgame play I have seen a lot of heavy weapon builds, rifle builds (both automatic and non), melee builds (unarmed and two handed), shotgun builds and a few laser builds. I have never seen a pistol build because the perks won’t get it strong enough, I rarely see any single handed melee builds or the use of automatic melee weapons (mr handy buzzblade, ripper, etc...) I just don’t think there’s enough perks to really make the uses of these weapons damage viable for end game so that’s why you typically see those other 7 main builds. 
---
Secondly it’s about your weapon. If you want massive damage out of your shotgun, go Bloodied Explosive and run around with minimal health. I know these shotguns are roughly 15-20k right now on XB1. TSE is always a safe bet for continuous max damage output with no worries about health. I wouldn’t recommend wasting money on any weapon that doesn’t have an explosive effect, there’s no better 2nd legendary effect than explosive in my opinion. Double barrels do massive amounts of damage with only two rounds before reloading while combat have slightly less damage but large magazines in them. I have seen a guy play like The Doom Guy with a quad explosive double barrel while wearing powered armor and he cleared Wes Tek in mere seconds. 
---
So yes I would say shotguns are absolutely fine for endgame. Just have the perks to support your weapon (that is hopefully legendary) along with your play style, but don’t forget to have a spare shotgun or a different weapon. Don’t want to running at the queen with only one weapon.
---
Im about to stop selling them. Everyone pretty much has them all now i suspect.
---
Exactly. Shoot a corpse you'll see.
---
It is our moral duty to eliminate the nuisance that is the scorchbeast from our wasteland.
---
Can't find it, sorry. I remember some post months back (that I can't find anymore) where somebody saw from the game files that the watoga robots have been given a flag to never spawn as a legendary, and I thought the OP mentioned that this flag was shared with scorchbeasts and a few other creatures
---
Nice
---
No one is buying Plans in my opinion - I dumped all of mine in a suitcase at WS the other day!!!
---
I dont know about the pre-built ones.. but I know regular stairs you can have them go up or down
---
Maybe you're not the fanbase anymore, bud. Life comes at you fast.
---
The trick is to pick up all kinds of aid. But never a lot of the good stuff. Raw meats, spoiled veggies, old potato crisps ect.. Then you pool of what could be dropped gets bigger and you lose less actual good stuff.
---
It was hilarious for the first week.
---
Ridiculous the second week.
---
2 months later .... its just plain bad.  This game is so far beyond the normal, character bugs, of other Bethesda titles .... why the player base for this game lumps them together with the tiny chucklers of past games is  hilarious.
---
I shot someone's cat the other day... his name was "murgle".
---
I won't do it again, just wanted to see what would happen... would his turrets turn on me? Nope. Then i shot his fertilizer brahmin... And left, feeling horrible about myself. Poor Murgle. R.I.P..
---
Or maybe even a chance for a serum or something we can use for debuff or sell. Not just a broadsider and some cannonballs
---
Yeah ... but this game is so sooooooooo much worse when it comes to bugs.  Putting the two together is an insult to the GOOD game Fallout 3 was.
---
ROFL, that full suit includes the helmet and it was 3d printed. So the fact they were able to get the whole suit done for a few hundred just the helmet alone is only about 20$ worth of the suit.
---
I just double checked the helmet weighs only about 3lbs without the electronics. So with cheap filament it would cost about 10$ in filament, you can buy a voice changer on amazon for 99 cents, a flashlight for a couple bucks.  The paint would be maybe 5$, if I didn't already have a bunch of modeling paint from back when I did warhammer miniatures. 
---
So lets do the math, I'll even double all the prices so you can't whine, 20$ for filament, 2bucks for the voice changer, 4 bucks for the flashlight, and 10$ for paint. So that is 36$ and lets say I put 2 hours into it, the average pay for painting is about 12$ an hour so another 24$ there. 
---
So that puts the TOTAL even after doubling the price on everything it ends up being 60$, still HALF the price.
---
I love you pitch.. but I believe there is a subreddit Fo76shops may be the name... but still nice way to advertise
---
Why not? I'm never having kids so being sterile is NBD ;)
---
Man you can’t read at all. I’m only saying Battle Royale would be fucking stupid. This game needs real PVP and not a dumb gimmick
---
Pvp mode yes, it’s what the game needs 
---
BR mode that caters to a gimmick genre, fuck no.
---
I just like to advertise here! Not everyone looks at the market, and since I'm selling through my vending machine, I just thought I'd advertise it here instead. That's all :) but thank you! I'll try advertising there as well
---
I don’t understand what people like you expect when you make posts like this. It’s as if you’re trying to completely invalidate the experience of others.
---
People’s bases are still getting constantly destroyed in adventure mode because of the “team invite trolling tactic”. Are you just unaware of this, or do you just completely ignore and attempt to totally invalidate anyone else’s experience but yours?
---
Yeah still
---
The leaked voice lines for Nuclear Winter have a ZAX that says “players should move into the safe zone” and also talks about “supplied weapons” 
---
If that isn’t battle royale then idk what is.
---
There are also Glowing Flasks of florescent yellow gold scattered about. :)
---
Nah, Battle Royale is a one pump chump gimmick genre.
---
Ye Scorchbeast suck loot wise. But honestly I don't find them too bad to kill. I have a Rapid Furious Gatling gun, Full Stabilized and One gun army, and 1st card of all 3 hvy gun dmg cards. Sometimes they're shy about landing, but then I just shred them outta the sky, usually about 50-75 bullets. But definitly wouldn't mind some better loot, like it's been said, atleast make them 1* legendary.
---
Oh you just got your ass handed to you?
---
Ok. Try again. Then again. Then again. Eventually you will be killing them.
---
While I'm not sure there's a true method to their madness, there was a reason why they built perks the way they did.  They have to build in an "inconvenience" factor of switching out perks so that we don't all run around with OP characters that can do everything at anytime.
---
Why do lockpick and hacker have 3 separate level 1 cards as opposed to 1 card that can be leveled up to 3?  Why don't they combine more of the perks together?  Why don't they give us perk "templates" I can save like "Heavy Weapons" "Camp Builder" and "Melee" that I can hotkey?   Why for gods sake can't I "uncombine" perks cards that I've grouped?
---
While not everything can be answered correctly with "inconvenience", it is the only way they have outside of the stat groups to create at least a bit of difference between our characters.  Otherwise all of us would run with the same perks or switch effortlessly between builds.  At least it takes a few minutes to do that now.   Just my thoughts.
---
I put an x-01 jetpack torso on my ultracite power armor.
---
He isn't wrong. 
---
This game has maxed out at 5.5/10 and Bethesda is happy about it because they are still selling games, largely because their "incredible fans" are working so hard to make this game an enjoyable experience for players who are starting it just now.
---
The game is what it is now. .... Bring on the DLCs with price tags.
---
I was mostly joking. Honestly, a way I could see them implementing it is a PvP event. Last one standing gets a three star legendary drop. It motivates people, is optional, and fits with the current theme. 
---
I would be okay with that, as it isn't the main focus.
---
AGREED!!!!
---
Enjoy your HOA visit? :)
---
Thats fucking ace, where did you build this? My girlfriend tried to make something similar on deathclaw island but the build area wouldnt go too far on to the water
---
I ran in to the Chameleon one fighting some top tier supermutants. Tagged it and let thr mutants (3 of em) finish it off. Then finished the supermutants off. Lol. Just up from West-Tec.
---
etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
---
thumbs up.
---
Hard work on something no one in the community asked for. We have been feeding them suggestions for months.
---
Ahh I see.. then yea if you dont have a store this would be the place to post haha
---
That is approximately where free range event starts. Could be connected to that.
---
It seems like a lot of Caps until the mechanics  to earn them become clearer. I highly recommend seeking out Caps Stashes. I am able to collect 3-4k from Stashes whenever I make that farming run.
---
That wasn't my point.
---
lmao who said that DR is applied per pellet? if that were the case, shotguns would be doing absolutely no damage to anything. A non-legendary double barrel with max shotgun/damage perks would deal what, 30 damage per pellet? Maybe even less. 30 would do absolutely fuck all against a super mutant. 8x absolutely fuck all would still be absolutely fuck all
---
Also, I'd say shotguns spike up in how useful they are in higher levels. Specifically, the instant you unlock enforcer, most enemies become trivial regardless of level. Mirelurk queens will just run away and cower in the corner. Deathclaws will crawl towards you slower than a power armor without a core. Scorchbeasts are grounded, although not consistently. The game becomes a cakewalk the instant you get enforcer
---
Add us: Papertattoo and frizzyliz316
---
I'm still buying them, I also manage to sell quite a bit. Having said that I do make them quite cheap. How much were you charging for yours?
---
If you were going to just throw them away you could've just made them really cheap on a their own vendor, it doesn't cost a lot of resources
---
helps to mention which platform
---
Its not like Bethesda is struggling for money.   They are still selling thousands of copies of 15 year old titles that have ZERO cost associated with them.
---
And proud about how small their staff is compared to their competitors (a few 100 in comparison with over a 1000 for other AAA developers).
---
Hire some more people .... but why? Modders will do it for free if you wait long enough.
---
your first sentence is comparing bugs for each game in its franchise.
---
your second sentence then switches to the satisfaction of its content, which doesn't dictate it solely by whether there were bugs in the game or not.
---
Ultimately the point is, some bugs never got fixed, instead we had to rely on mods to fix them.
---
i.e.: How some bugs in fallout 4 were present in fallout 76.
---
No worries! It's trashcans, lunch boxes, some variant of the cooler, and fridges that don't open.  Would have been cool though! Thanks so much for checking!
---
Plans are the only thing I sell consistently. But I only sell ones that drop from quests like pioneer scouts and free range.
---
What platform are you playing?
---
And how much for that gatling?
---
Shit, you're right, knew I forgot something. On xbox!
---
I’m going to attempt to stay up (Japanese time zone) and control the crazy. A megathread is a good idea though.
---
I'm level 360 plus, I know this. But it's good info to share, yes. I have too many caps all the time and running out of things to buy so... I buy those things to keep a few on hand.  They can't come out with enough new cap sinks fast enough IMHO
---
They came the same time as the orange cases...  so I dont think so
---
Xbox, my apologies! And I have it priced at 10.5k. Researched through the market and saw someone said they still go for 6k-12k
---
I've seen these little lights in a few different spots. Not sure if they're just a model used during development as a marker of some sort or if they have any actual relevance whatsoever.
---
I slot in Tenderizer specifically to aid in this and I have found that my level 250 ass draws loads of aggro from her. When I clip her wings she lands and then tries to eat my face!
---
I dunno, seems like the Assaultron recall card could be place elsewhere, like on high lvl sentry bots. Like the Nuclear key card idea tho.
---
You don't think it would take at least a month to fix the bugs of this game?  Have you fallen through the surface of the map just walking through the wilderness yet?   ... I don't  think i can count on one hand the times I've had that happens in other developers games .... whereas with this game, I lost count of how many times it has happened.
---
Yeah had them all multiple times, sell them in the vendor. Stings and tings is repeatable too, it's not a daily like the one in toxic.
---
We should be able to Pay Caps to fight Legendary Enemies :)
---
I've been doing this farming caps til I can buy signs and letters lol
---
Aye thats a good price. Too bad I am a PC player :)
---
Orange cases???
---
want to disable someone's mutations? blend up a full dose of Rad X and load it into a syringe.
---
Agreed. The only Plans that sell other than that are the Nuka Cola and Quantum PA paint plans.
---
I’m unfortunately in the same boat. It’s a good week for me I learn at least one plan from breaking weapons or armor down or just stumbling onto one I don’t know from a player
---
Whew okay haha that's good to hear! And awh that sucks haha
---
This is a great idea, I might give this a try. I am skint, I spend all my caps on fast travel and 5mm ammo.
---
Thanks man, it's amazing that people can't even see that I've *overtly* stated that I'm not against this playstyle and that they think it's necessary to explain the way that the game works to me even though I've *acknowledged* the mechanics and the benefits of playing like that.
---
Apparently if I don't enjoy the game the way everyone else does then that means I don't understand it. This is why I can't stand meta-gamers, they suck all the fun out of online experiences for me. I can state that their playstyle is perfectly acceptable and that they can play that way if they want, but because I'm not having fun the same way they do they assume I'm trying to attack them for playing the way they do.  
---
I just like having a bit of self-roleplay in my Fallout 76. All I was trying to say was that the meta-gamers make playing the game less fun for me. Can't everybody's preferred playstyle be valid regardless of contradiction?
---
5 Caps each 
---
*sad seller noises*
---
It’s not going to be a “new pvp mode”, it’s almost guaranteed to be a BR.
---
I would not mind watching that youtube video, if we’re being honest. Like a 15 luck 15 strength build. Then putting whatever you want in the remaining specials. 10 INT being pretty desirable for any sort of explosive guns possibly (5 gunsmith, 5 Explosives expert). With all the luck perks you could be a mutated tank!
---
Holy crap this is so fancy! Awesome build!
---
Plans are so often over priced at vendors. Pretty much decided that no plan I get will be over 200caps. Most are 11 or 22 caps in my store.
---
Still selling very few of em but hopefully new players will keep coming. Lol.
---
It’s cost more caps if more of the budget is already used up from another player with a max up to 100 caps.
---
Only if... I've never messed with the synger.. or whatever it is.. so if there is a rad away round I feel foolish
---
Due to datamined audio files within the game that vaguely hint on it.
---
Do you play on PC?  
---
Are you aware that the item changes AFTER you select the item you want to sell?
---
This is not me choosing the wrong item to sell, this is the item changing after it is selected.
---
If I select the proper item the first time, in what world is it acceptable to allow that item to change AFTER it is selected?
---
Dataminers who saw audio lines and scripts that strongly suggested a BR mode. But it only suggests it, there's no concrete proof yet. It's the drama queens on here that are pretending it's confirmed
---
I felt the same way exactly one year ago when they revealed that Fallout 76 was going to be an always online mmorprger instead of an interstitial New Vegas-style single player title and now I fucking love it.
---
So yeah if they announce a 24-people-locked-on-a-server-until-one-guy-lives-or-the-clock-runs-out that's kinda sorta battle-royale-y but not really then yeah some folks won't care, some will like it, some will hate it. But I'm gonna keep an open mind until I see it for myself. 
---
But if what they do is announce a battle royale mode AND it's going free to play and supported with microtransactions and everyone who paid $60 day one gets a free emote and 1,000 atoms, then I will lose my shit, cuz fuck that.
---
Same way bloodied damage buff isnt shown on the weapon until you equip one.
---
Your -20% food is calculated already even in your stash because you are wearing the armor.
---
Same with the gun, it only calculates the damage buff/nerf when you have equipped it
---
Love that organized-clutter look. It reminds me of some of the general provision stores and trinket shops I have wandered into IRL while in the Carolinas and West Virginia.
---
i think you should have a luck perk (2 or 3 specials required) and it allows you to equip 1 (or 2 at rank 3) bobble heads to last until the card is removed. you cannot use two of the same bobble head though. so no stacking damage related ones like the big gunner bobble head
---
This week on Fallout Horders....lol
---
The one near super duper mart in Morgantown and the other near a tower south of 76.. also the overseer body is near by... belive those have to do with vault 51.. which is north of arronholt (or however its spelled) farm.. bum bum baaaa
---
Too big of a space.
---
I have noticed this bug on xbox
---
Well, I guess you can't get disappointed if you properly set expectations!
---
“I used to be with it. Then they changed what it was. Now what I'm with isn't it, and what's it seems weird and scary to me. It'll happen to you!”
---
If your on pc and have Nvidia GeForce then you could do that easy. Can't remember what it's called though but when you're in game there's an option.
---
You can even green screen layers out.
---
Thats my hope. Really really really hoping this is the case. A new structured PvP system would be great along side more content.
---
You don't kill scorchbeasts for the loot. You don't even kill scorchbeasts for the experience. You kill them for every time they made your low-level ass flee in terror or hide in a shack, hoping they would get bored and fly away.  
---
*That's* why you kill scorchbeasts...
---
Awesome!
---
Really crazy that you can't change the world on a massive scale in an online game.
---
Congratulations
---
Vault 51?? Are we playing the same game?? Lol
---
Poorly
---
I noticed that until your camp fully loads the pet doesn’t have a camp tag and can be damaged and targeted with vats.
---
Not sure if it will die from that though, mobs killed mine
---
You forgot that it's a pain to down them for shotgun / melee build.
---
I’m fairly low level, like 39 I think. Been trying to sell my excess plans too. Not much luck so far though. Most of my stuff is geared towards lower levels. I price my plans (and most stuff) around 50-75% of what the value shows. Perhaps that’s still too much. Got Ripper plans sitting there for like 800 I think—thought I’d move that but not yet anyway.  That’s my ‘big ticket item’, if you can call it that. I enjoy the player vendor system overall, first thing I do when I log in is visit any nearby people selling stuff.
---
Wow I feel like an idiot. I had no idea there was a 3rd vault in the game.
---
This, I hate how annoyingly aware they are. Like I'll fast travel to a station (Watoga and the Sunnytop ones have this happen all the time) and bam there's just a scorchbeast flying around trying to fight me. No, I don't want to fight this thing, I want to fucking scrip my legendaries and sell all my bullshit from my stash.
---
[Already exists in the game files, just be patient](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blsib1/datamined_legendary_sell_curve_tables/)
---
Thank you both.  I will wait so that way if I get any I don't want I can trade them to another player for a legendary I do want or if nothing else do the purveyor who kind of has changed how people use legendaries.
---
Rec room battle royale is only 16 players and people enjoy that. 
---
Stand out normally has maybe ten players in a game, and they fill it up with bots.
---
I'll send you the invite as soon as I get home since at work at the moment.
---
nah, it does not exist. would be a bit too strong in PVP since everyone has mutations these days
---
Thought this too until recently... but with the perfect B2525 or BE25 handmade using prime automatic receiver, and a full on crit / stealth vats build, You can reach 20K+ dps with an auto rifle build. That said, having run both it and my heavy weapons build... my bloody heavy weapons build is so damn reliable. B25 .50 cal with ultracite ammo shreds her and never fails, and I can sit directly on top of her, face tanking all of her hits with no issue even when sitting at 19% Hp for that sweet bloodied / adrenal buff. I'm finally making a dedicated unyielding / bloodied melee character with that new godly survival melee weapon though. Should be fun to change it up!
---
Well hey. That was crazy! I think I died about 6 times. Great turnout if a bit of a disorganized bunch.
---
Yeah so for what i am proposing maybe up THST to 250/300?
---
I dunno.. Maybe it's just me and they way I olay/build but at lvl 35 I'm getting my ass handed to me a lot and go through stimpacks like it's water/food.
---
Yeah for sure. Send me a request
---
Don't reload your gun or fire u mark yourself as open PvP.  4 10-15 sec after spawn u can Sprint 4 cover they can't hurt u for period of time. I've been playing survival alot have a deathclaw pit shop I bait peeps I now spawn works. Doesn't work for camp pets..
---
i always just spam 2* ranged legendary. the 3rd perk is never as useful as the first two and it's cheaper.
---
I love being in the middle of a bunch of high lvl players and getting the aggro, let's me know my build is working.
---
Also the Civil War Top Hat and Civil War Suit give a very good return on resources invested. If I remember correctly:
---
- Top Hat: 3 cloth; 1 leather. Sells for 11 caps 
---
- suit: 5 cloth, 1 gold. Sells for 19 caps
---
(Depending on Charisma and Hard Bargain levels)
---
Having all three plans does not put as much of a strain on a single resource
---
Good
---
Br mode just doesnt make any sense in this game, i really dont see them adding a mode where you dont have any of your gear and none of your perks or levels.
---
Because if you had, br would be quite unfair
---
I just use glowing steaks as currency I get like 50+ every day I play for a few hours especially if Nukes dropping. Between that and uranium fever event I cap 1400 in a couple hours.
---
sent or gtfo for pvp.
---
Congrats, you’ve just noticed something that’s been there since B.E.T.A. They’re not gonna do anything about it
---
Eh... this sub already is toxic rad hole, but yeah. I can prove it. Look how they'll downvote my normal comment that has no reason to get downvoted whatsoever:
---
Havent played those, how large are the maps? 
---
Because running in fo76 map with 24 players is going to be alot of lonelines
---
would be cool if the railway rifle and harpoon guns had a tether line mod, shoot a scorch beast and it increases the chances of them landing
---
Stand out is large, but not quite as large as Fortnite.
---
Rec room is pretty small.
---
I don't think they go down from a foundation. Only upper floor pieces. I can only go below my foundation if I go up then down from an upper floor. I'm hanging over the edge of a cliff too and my base is 2 below foundation and 2 1/2 above.
---
The best part I think is created a positive impact in both his gaming life and real life by showing him kindness, hopefully he learns to pay it forward.
---
Nah dude, that’s like the only thing I sell! Maybe it’s because my prices are super low...but hey! If it works
---
It's gonna totally kill off farming and people will concentrate more on trading rather than co-oping with other players. And believe me, people WILL dupe mods and modded weapons
---
Doesn’t tell us what kind of BR it could be.  May end up being a 20 man pve survival BR for all we know.
---
Maybe you are ugly...but are you also proud about it? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N0yXGVWS1Y)
---
Dude... the day before yesterday I was face-tanking her in one of the fights - she was chasing me all over between V9 and the metal shack with the elevator...
---
(Whispers) Fancy name for a cabinet desk.
---
As soon as I saw the leaderboard I said, oh look deathmatch not survival mode. Great. I too just wanted increased risk while playing the game. Instead there's no point in there even being a game in deathmatch, just chase a few dudes around the map. Yay.
---
Well if you feel bad about it not being expensive enough when you take it over the next time just walk to your nearest camp that’s selling and buy enough junk from their vending machine to make you feel like you earned that workshop by paying into it.
---
Point "some bugs" in FO4 or FO3 (like every game)  vs what could only be described as a torrent of unacceptable game breakers (which is only true of the worst games ever released) .... Excusing this as some how acceptable, or making it seem what FO76 is, is normal/similar?  No .... that is just false.
---
With the size of the map and limited player count they need something to draw players together. If they removed the top three players being shown you just wouldn't see anyone.
---
They’re dollar store Skyrim dragons. At least in Skyrim you had an incentive to kill a Dragon (Getting a soul, Bones and Scales for crafting, and a decent sum of gold) But scorchbeasts, there’s literally no incentive except possibly getting plans for a power armor set **I don’t even use.**
---
Diehard
---
good idea!
---
Could work too! Not a bad idea. 
---
I just like to see them getting used really. I’ve collected one of every kind. Both bobble heads and magazines. 
---
And the ability to show them on magazine racks and stands would not be bad improvement. But for what I know there’s already talk of that
---
I don't know why you'd argue against dropping a legendary.  Legendary items are garbage and 95% of them I find I turn into caps or tokens.  I can't tell you how many times I've gotten wood armor with chameleon or something on it.
---
Yea but still, coming into a sub that’s very shaky on opinions and you say “BOO THE FUCK OUT OF BETHESDA IF THEY ANNOUCE BR” isn’t a smart thing to do.
---
You can, but the concrete stairs are more restrictive than the wooden or metal stairs.
---
What level are you? I wonder if it's because that in general, servers I'm assigned to have higher level players? I was selling plans at first but now I just think everyone on my server has them already?  I'm 250.
---
They drop prime receivers.
---
Exactly. It's necessary. And easily avoided as well.
---
Ouch.  Still not sure what you're really going for with your tweaks.   Nerd Rage is a perk usually reserved for low health builds (bloodied/unyielding/etc.) and not as a fail safe against attacks.
---
You're missing same major damage reduction perks like Blocker (Str) that can reduce 45% of incoming melee damage.   I find it hard to play without Aquaboy/Aquagirl since it lets me move through water without thinking about it.  
---
Gunslinger gives you 10% bonus instead on increasing Expert or Master gunslinger by 1 level which only gives you 5%.  Move 1 point to add that perk.   Action Boy/Girl (pretty useful) and Dodgy (haven't played it but know it can be popular) are better for avoiding damage although I'm not sure how it combines with Serendipity.  Also consider Born Survivor instead of Nerd Rage to keep you alive.  This can be mitigated by legendary armor (Auto-Stim, Life Saving) if you have them.   Also you should consider covert operative - I disagree a bit as it only looks like a small increase.  Everyone scrambles to add perks that give you 5% damage, but 2x to 2.15x is actually saying increase from 200% to 215% bonus damage.  If you're building a sneak build you shouldn't lightly give it up.  Especially with Pistols.    
---
And lastly, Mysterious Stranger can kind of fun but is essentially useless from what I've seen.   There are known VATS bugs in melee against flying creatures so it's only somewhat practical.  Use those points somewhere else until you've got great gear.
---
Yeah uh how the fuck? I’m level 87 and I barely make a scratch on the things
---
Can’t agree more your 100% spot on as it is a waste of time ....
---
That would be perfect! Why do you need to see anyone? Explore and you may see someone or not. Then you can talk , trade and see if the other person is friendly or not. As an example Rust comes to mind, not every encounter leads to aggression.
---
As a temporary debuff, yes.
---
I have a signs and letters plan for sale....
---
I would like some defend missions at workshops to be hordes of Deathclaws, Yao Guai, or Sheepsquatch. It would be terrifying and amazing.
---
Xbox?
---
It's a PvP mode. It wouldn't be PvP if you never saw another player.
---
My guess is that they will announce NPC's, that's just me
---
if you want to help i know people love cryolater users because they make damn good support characters furthermore if you are speced into heavy weapons you can use the flamer with the healing perk that benefits flaming weapons  a must have would be a high charisma stat 
---
also if you go the heavy weapons rout id suggest throwing unarmed into the mix for ammo efficiency
---
TSF-_-Dethgod is my PSN
---
We can take you human-hunting sometime if you'd like.
---
LOL I'd pay caps to have a good fight that I could say who joined. There are some people at the SBQ fights I'd rather not fight alongside. Not talking about noobs either lol
---
I have been pleasantly surprised by so many things they have done to this game, personally, that I welcome the opportunity to try whatever they have come up with.  I realize that comment is probably not salty enough for the internet these days, but that’s just me.
---
Ill add that to the list!
---
The unstoppable monster is a beast. I ran Whitesprings last night in stealth and it shredded everything. The Wendigo even. The sneak attack was probably 3500 damage at that point.  Lol
---
Very well said. It is essentially a deathmatch. And most people are playing it like that. I see some camps being built at train stations and they snipe anyone logging in. Bethesda has put the focus too much on that instead of creating a real survival world.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I really need a Perk Card Build for a Commando Rifle Build
---
I’m only level 70 at the moment. But I find that people of all levels are buying them. Like a lvl 170 guy bought three at once one day, and a lvl ~25 bought similar ones. I feel it’s kind of chance as to whether I have something someone needs so I figure I might as well sell it if I already know the plans
---
Did you steal this from the other post or vice versa?
---
Considering the wealth of knowledge Data Miners have .... i tend to trust their instinct and analysis of the Data they mine, more than I trust the wishes and instinct of fans of a franchise.   FO76 was never intended to be the type of experience FO players of the past were enthralled by.  It is a test for what Bethesda wants Starfield and ES6 to be, using their loyal FO fans to test and develop, and de-bug.
---
It says Survival mode right? PvP is implied but doesn't have to be.
---
I doubt it will be your traditional BR.
---
I'm personally expecting it to be some hybrid
---
Modded fatman that sends out a burst of noise to bring them down?
---
Ok, so you’re just going to be a dick because it works better for you personally?
---
...I'm not being a dick??? I just like to advertise here??? The hell is wrong with you?
---
Make that 99% sure.
---
Well their instinct and analysis has been mentioned as a non-traditional BR, possibly a hybrid, so it could even end up not being labeled a BR.
---
I think it could work, separate characters from the main game.  Perks and gear found in match only.  
---
Select maps - not all of Appalachia.  Maybe, a whitesprings map, or a westtech, or a vault interior map.  I don't know, but the concept sounds cool if those restrictions are in place.  
---
Grindable and rng rewards for the other game mode.    The concept sounds appealing to me, I hate PvP on 76, but done right it could be fun.  Would be unplayable it you could take your existing build into the mode though.
---
Badgekun had solid advice in the post above mine,  but the only way to get better is to actually do it and see what works with how you want to play.
---
It's Fallout post apocalypse. You should barely see anyone.
---
TIL
---
Yeah, give her space to land. All the typical fight locations have spots to get above the mobs but unless you're a berserker you really shouldn't need to. 
---
Clear the mobs while she's in the air.
---
Alien event at the spaceship would be brilliant.
---
Not enough. A lot of empty spaces.
---
Lol I only have like 5k right now
---
I will do it for 5k and some 5.56 ammo
---
Kind of over all the nay-sayers. So much complaining over stuff that we don't even know if it will be in the game, and if it is, how it will be executed. Seems mighty stressful. Meanwhile, I'm over here digging through poo piles looking for deathclaw hide and loving it.
---
can you send me a link to that post
---
Well i could use some purified water from tge salty rad tears
---
These things are really only a problem when you’re between level 20 and 50 (maybe 80 if you’re a real casual player). Beyond that they’re just a nuisance. You just need to find your groove and what works for you to take them down and get to it. I’m a sniper but I never seem to do much damage sniping them, so I break out my handmade and go to town. I can usually take them down in 3-4 magazines. And they do almost no damage to me, especially in power armor. At this point, I don’t kill them for the reward. I kill them so others that have problems with them can travel in peace. Consider it public service. Honestly, I’d rather fight 3 of them than 3 high level Yao Guai. Those things steamroll me.
---
They’re not just his experiences. Neither I nor any of my friends have ever had trouble from other players. The only time I’ve ever even been in pvp is when I’ve had one beer too many and decide it’s a good idea to shoot a wanted player. And even those are hard to find. I’m not sure what game you’re playing if you’ve had bases being constantly destroyed. It hardy ever happens. Stop being so scared. Scaredy cat 🙀
---
I actually do 15 strength 15 luck and then use the rest in charisma and endurance, and I would argue that luck has either the best or second best cards. It only has a few trashy ones like wood chucker and the one that makes food rot slower.
---
I usually just pacify scorched beasts nowadays.
---
Same thread as this.
---
Yeah can't wait to step into my full unyielding set and use the thing. I was doing some math... looks like the max base damage you can get on it before power attacks / sneak attacks and nukashine is ~1600. So I'm pretty sure that power attacks are x2, sneak attacks are x3 with perks, and nukashine is x2. Those should all be multiplicative, so you end up with x12 damage. 1600 x12 is almost 20K...
---
Solid.
---
I love the idea of bringing Deathclaw broods or packs back. I actually miss feeling of knowing that I needed to strategically retreat whenever I came across one bc I they traveled in packs.
---
Same. How much are you selling those for? I set them around 200-300 caps.
---
Kudos for making sense! I'm over the complaining.
---
:&gt; yes im ugly and im proud.
---
PS sorry
---
They’re pretty easy for a heavy gunner build with gatling guns or .50 cal, especially with the One Gun Army perk since you can cripple their wings and force a landing. Also easy for a VATS commando spamming crit headshots. Honestly most builds by end game can take them out in a reasonable amount of time/resources. Unless you’re strictly melee, then you have my condolences.
---
I want to go camping with this guy! I’ll bring the wood and gears.
---
the combat is so crisp and fluid in this game, and hit detection is probably the best ive ever seen. add to that the nearly infinite combos you can do with melee?? man who wouldnt want a battle royale??
---
Dump a bunch of players into a separate space ... call it a vault, or a basement of building, or a sewer system of town, or an enclosed ecosystem .... give them a minimal VaultTec story line of Sociology Experiment ... and have at 'er.
---
Pretty simple really.   But not nearly as good as games that actually focus on it as the ONLY thing they are trying to be.  But it does maximize the Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) RNG drivers of a game, and keeps people plugging quarters hoping to get just the right "drop" that will help them win ... maybe not this but but next time.
---
Bethesda should add a new Brotherhood of Steel quest where you can get a plan for the harpoon gun that gives it a unique effect: when shot, it forces Scorchbeasts to be grounded (like the traps) and prevent them from flying away. Not useful in every situation, no, but it could be good for scorchbeasts and queens.
---
Anthem was the best thing to ever happen to this sub because of people just like that lol. There was a poll over there and something like 20% said they never even played it
---
Just do a text post and put your image link in the body text.
---
No its those mf cave crickets!
---
It’s possible, I think their trying to do something like that with Wastelanders, which is good.
---
Once you get some good gear they drop like flies
---
Is there a link to a video or post showing these files?
---
Would now be a bad time to admit that lately I just 'arrange it' so that the player under my wing can 'find it' for themselves? I feel guilty if I don't share...
---
I came across another player's floating home on a lake about a week ago. His had an underwater entrance with a rad shower, that you could turn on and off. 
---
Good work and now it's making me want to do this.
---
The burrows should have been filled with deathclaws instead of ghouls with references to Deathclaw sanctuary in FO3
---
Fixing things that are broke, bugged or not working would be a better announcement...
---
Grr
---
They definitely are gonna add stuff like this, I think though they will release things slowly over time to keep the game fresh
---
Very nice👍
---
People who love BR will label it as NOT BR because it won't be as good as what they are used to from games that do BR as their only thing .... Players that hate BR will recognize it immediately as what they hate and label it as BR.
---
And the arguments here will go on about it for months while Bethesda sells another couple 100 thousand copies of a game that still hasn't fixed its primary content.  Brilliant Marketing really ....Zero respect for customers though.
---
I wish it weren't true but yeah I'm afraid this sub will have a meltdown regardless of what Nuclear Winter is.
---
I'm glad I always have my filthys to enjoy the game with.
---
Fantastic information!  Thanks
---
they have similar lights inside arktos, maybe a connection there?
---
I am currently playing my 'support' character. Its a high charisma build with one of each of the heavy cards. I can solo alright, things take a few more hits to kill, but supressor perk/weapons make it so I take very little damage unless swarmed, and flamer clears a swarm beautifully.
---
It just takes a while to load.
---
Multiplayer != BR
---
....Or the syringer, that is an underused gun for sure
---
I REALLY like the idea of dropping a few stable flux's. I feel that's a fair price for the time and effort.
---
The point is that those games did BR better than 76 ever could... And they still fizzled out. The devs can't get a grip on balance for PVE let alone PVP
---
yeah..."knowing" them doesn't stop RNGjesus to bath you in tons of copies of those plans over and over.....Good lord if RNG would depend on what you have or what you don't.... "oh you already have "a" legendary....nope no more legendary for you" &gt;\_\_&gt;
---
It's highly speculated that it is going to be a BR mode. The audio files in the game point to it and the fact that they are going to make the combat more fluid plus the descriptions of that inside the vault heavily point to PVP encounters
---
I figured its not fair to expect people to git gud without giving them info how, hope this helps!
---
Well for starters it's really not nearly as bad of a weapon as everyone makes it out to be. I have a bloodied one that's 800+ dmg and also has +10% dmg when ads. One shot will kill almost anything, and the two other shots are just bonus.
---
I knew I wouldn't be able to rely on it alone so I heavily invested in strength so I could use melee as a backup and also be able to swap to heavy weapon cards for SBQ. The idea is use the cannon to hit enemies out of melee range until they enter it, then swap to melee to not blow myself up. So far I've had absolutely no issues and it's been quite a blast (no pun intended)
---
Naw that's cool too. I've left it unlocked too. But I've seen people charging over 1k so I set it for cheap.
---
Yep, medlilove xx
---
Less is more hehehe
---
Yep medlilove xx
---
I went heavy gunner PA on my main and never looked back. Fun build without needing legendary meta build gear. Bear Arms means I can carry a large, diverse amount of weapons which makes killing stuff less monotonous and also increases efficiency in terms of using lots of different ammo types you’ll pick up while adventuring. You don’t even need to be PA to do it, I just started using it to take advantage of the armor piercing from the Stabilized perk.
---
Here’s my current build, as you can see it’s not fully optimized and has plenty of QOL perks.
---

---
Nice, thank you. I've had interest in a high charisma "healer"-esque build, but I've been worried it doesn't quite have a place if I'm not constantly in a party.
---
You gotta think about what the other player's weakness is and attack that. 
---
A lot of bloodied builds out there now, but you can VATS them. They're probably using Serendipity so I hit 'em with a Furious Faster Fire Rate LMG. One second kills lol
---
Don't fret if you get killed a couple times on logging in until you get set in the game. Never panic.
---
Oh damn
---
Dang. Hadn't thought of that.
---
Please, and thank you.
---
I’ve had the same issue doing this challenge, just swim around in water until you catch a disease (forgot it’s name) that gives you the food loss condition.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I stand still and it will eventually land in front of me.  About three times the amount of strikes needed to kill a deathclaw.  Much harder to kill a mirelurk king.
---
Water sells for 5 and costs nothing to make.
---
I created a medic as an with high Luck, agility, and Perception. I use Vats Perks, Unyeilding Sentinel armor, Medics Doulbe barrel with 2 additional vats effects, Herd mentality, and Empath. I wear the Responders medical apparel.
---
I hope they dont announce bug fixes in e3... that would be a pr disaster.
---
They are expected and mandatory, not something you need to glorify.
---
Looks great. Fantastic job mate 👍
---
Can't sell stuff in this forum. One of the rules. 🤷
---
Again, just trying to advertise lol
---
there was datamined audio and notes of a contest where people  battle each other in a competition for the right to become overseer of vault 51. Zax runs this contest to study the limits of human ability, and if you remember Zax was tied in with the whole dead overseer body thing and two crates that recently appeared in the game. There is also a no weapon rule to the contest which means you begin empty handed, then Zax begins to drop certain people weapons one by one. Its a "battle to the death" where the winner is the one that outlasts the others through several rounds.
---
Also like in Fallout 1 and 2. Deathclaws have always traveled in packs since their introduction.  Loners were exceptionally rare.
---
Not I.. muhaha.. I'm a human trying to better the human race.. NO XMEN haha
---
You're post is in the wrong sub. This is the fallout 76 sub.
---
What??
---
I mean, to be fair, more PvP is the LAST thing this game needs. It needs to 1) be fixed and 2) get more PvE content.
---
Parasites lol. Also you only have to wait till you're in the red. Not till the bar is empty (if anybody else but me thought that until I completed the challenge and got the weapon lol)
---
It makes sense to me, people were bitching so much about PVP being broken due to duped weapons and gear, why wouldnt they start a mode where everyone begins empty handed and those duped weapons cant be used.
---
It won't solo as well as almost any other build, but its still quite possible. Do lots of events. Flamer is great for tagging the swarm, and you can watch the xp roll in. Also, with supressor on and the glorious flamer going I have noticed fewer event deaths from the big bosses even when solo. Friendly fire works well when in a group, was able to keep my bloodied melee buddy topped off through the arktos alpha. As the top comment says though, you will want a melee because fuel and cyro ammo are not easy to craft like others in large quantities.
---
People still play this?
---
But when you hit a crouched player you can Vats him. Thats what other players doesnt know
---
I first heard it from JuiceHead
---
I have a Vampire’s, 25% Fire Rate, and 90% reduced rate Prime 50 cal Machine Gun with 2200 rounds of ultracite ammo that I can’t wait to use. I tried to sell it but I didn’t get a great offer which blows my mind.
---
I tested it out with my main and it was great but I built around rifles not heavy weapons so I’m going to start a new character
---
.... um..... yeah i know, and i was talking about fallout 76.... are you ok??
---
&gt; the devs just might not realise this is even a problem?
---
That's probably why he's frustrated.  If they are ignoring bug reports for 8 months it's going to make a few people upset.
---
BR in an environment that makes more use of the RNG drivers (VLTs with manipulation software) to generate success/failure.
---
This game is all about the RNG drivers.  I can totally see how a limited BR would keep players playing for hope of that next drop, just gotta plug enough quarters/time ...
---
It isn't anything about being afraid or it not even happening. If it didn't happen then bethesda wouldn't have patched out CAMP damage due to all the people griefing others by destroying their camps, or have to change how workshops work because people were trolling people who took workshops just to go kill them without trying to take the workshop.
---
It obviously was happening otherwise bethesda wouldn't have made those changes to deal with it.
---
I was on yesterday, spent a total of 6k or so as i hopped around the map, and the poor bastard on my final CAMP visit of the day logged out just as I accessed his machine. I love shopping and if he didn't want my caps, so be it!
---
If your CAMP is around the Savage Divide / Mire line, E by NE from West Tek a short jog, then I am the tuition payer and you my friend are a few caps poorer lol
---
I was in the area completing some MODUS garbage and quite unhappy about it, so I spent like a bastard to salve my pain :)
---
Just any sentinel?
---
Something like this was brought up before, someone wanted the prefix legendary bonus damage to mutants to apply to players with mutagens as well. I do use them, like most people, and I think it would be really cool if this was the case even though insta gibing is common in pvp :/
---
This syringe idea is cool too. If you could just load it with any Aid items then in affect you could disable mutations.
---
Bloodied or instigating dragon, swap to bloodied hunting rifle. Most times they die before they even know what's attacking them. If I'm not running bloodied I just build adrenaline and crit on whatever is around them swap to my instigating dragon
---
Everyone gets his gag, and it was a pretty good top comment at that. You, on the other hand, with your 'kids' and explanation of downvoting, not so much :P
---
There is no way they can make a battle royale game work in this engine, it's too buggy.
---
Pets are protected if you're in pacifist mode. They're part of the camp. Other players can't hurt them unless you engage in PvP.
---
ah, good to know
---
And they dropped the mobile app integration that they'd already had working in Fallout 4 so we know those gamers aren't a demographic Bethesda is looking for.
---
Let people keep their gear/perks except for healing supplies which must be found while playing and keep matches limited to players within a similar range. Use the whole map and have it shrink with time. Removing PVE should make it a bit more smooth if they try to up the amount of players in game.
---
This give you a chance to beat stronger players if you catch them off guard or wounded. Gives people a reason to grind and find better loot in regular play and keeps level 175’s from straight up shitting on lower level players. Let’s people explore more regions of the map they might not of normally encountered. If they want to add PVE back in another game mode that can add a different challenge as well.
---
Your suggestion wouldn't be fun for the players that have levelled up to the point of being God Like in the PvP.   For them its too much fun shooting fish in a barrel, and they are the ones Bethesda wants to keep happy.
---
you can join the RFN discord (link is on the right) and ask in the #76_spoilers section. it's a common topic we discuss there. i dont have the info saved up and such, but heres a link for all the ripped audio files/holotapes.
---
https://soundcloud.com/user-702648364
---
theres loads of snips from that datamine that HINTS at a BR type mode, but nothing that flat out confirms it'll only be a BR mode.
---
What we know sofar is:
---
Team deathmatch/(faction?) based PVP
---
Quick play from start menu
---
FFA based mode?
---
team based mode with some type of team elimination involved, advancement to a final round, etc.
---
hints at a shrinking combat area.
---
nothing supports a BR, but the audio snips and such hints towards something looking like it.
---
Check out juicehead on youtube he has a few recent videos discussing the topic
---
Which means you’ll never find Jose Canseco or Mark McGuire in that sub.
---
Which is going to be a new pvp mode for this game.
---
Get yourself some serum recipes and sell the serums to vendor for 500 caps each
---
Now with the pooled vendor cap. I sell serums to them. Rather cheap to make considering how much you can sell them for.
---
[Around 5 minute mark here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB1GtBHI8kE&amp;t=290)
---
Not sure if this was the first person to find/show it, but it's where I first heard about it
---
Top 3 should be according kill count like it was before Bethesda fucked that up like they do with everything in the game
---
Just curious, what is your endgame with caps?
---
It's simply RAD!
---
Should become a tRADition.
---
Lol. Indeed. You got a point there.
---
Died doing SBQ and the same happened to me.. really sucked
---
I'll have to save up then. I dont know the materials needed but since there were 2 comments about it so quickly it seems to be a good idea.
---
Sounds good 👍🏼
---
Sorry to say but no. Free Range starts south/west of Aaronholt.
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
Man Jafar! Lol
---
Better late then never mate!
---
They are very strong and if your not armored up they hit you once your dead.
---
If by endgame you mean: why do I need a ton of caps? I would say it is to help myself buy random vendor legendaries i see for myself and my pals. To try out different weapon types and builds besides my bloodied heavy weapons down the line. Also plans any of us are missing. For instance one buddy is missing the powered door plans and if i find it while he is offline i would like to buy it for him. Those are just off the top of my head.
---
Im pretty sure vaults are also coming within the time frame of nuclear winter isnt it?
---
If its like wild appalachia then there will probably be numerous new stuff coming in the span og a couple of months.
---
From the data mined stuff that ive seen this br stuff actually sounds intriguing. And i absolutely despise br. So i dunno, i have an open mind.
---
The closer you are to Vault 76/Overseer's C.A.M.P. - I find the enemies are low level scorched, the odd molerat, eye-bots and level 5 protectrons, nothing that packs a wallop. 
---
The worst that ever happened was I FT'd but my door bell rang so I ran downstairs - took a few minutes - came back and a single molerat ate all my mutfruit trees, damn thing was hungry. 
---
For the most part my level 4 turrets (the base ones) usually just kill the odd enemies that show up. But yeah another user commented on FTing to it multiple times to get an idea of what you'll see.
---
That's interesting if there are more - it's the first time i saw one myself!
---
Yeah. I think my sarcasm detector is broken though.
---
Idk but the same thing happens to me every single time. Always gotta turn the chat volume back up.
---
Another way is to sell marine tactical helmets. They require rather easy to find mats, and you can sell them for around 100 caps depending on your charisma. I keep a cheap set of unyeilding armor around for my vendor run. Go irradiate myself till im at 20% health. Then sell everything. Usually gets my charisma to 25, also drink some alcohol and take grape mentats. Or if you have the formula p recipe. It boosts your charisma by 5.
---
Pistols are the worst btw, no aa perk. You try getting the stimpack diffuser in Arktos?
---
Gotta have a look around at Arktos then next time! Thx!
---
Anywhere with scorched is a good place for shotguns, lower levels only have dbs and pumps tho
---
One might suggest that "most people ain't aware of what's good and whats bad" etc. because the level gap between them and those that know is HUGE ... and the total Perk versatility and choices is limited to some and not others.  PvP should be level specific, or perk specific, or gear specific .... or it really isn't PvP, its  Professional vs. Amateur. ... not sure where the joy comes from in beating up people with a massive disadvantage.
---
Lol. But there’s no map marker and I never read anybody discussing it.
---
I might get downvoted for this. But I seriously think fallout 76 would be awesome with battle royale
---
That's when I just close the app and relaunch 76. Seems much quicker that way than to let it find and load server, lol.
---
Serums....     
---
I saved up and bought some serum recipes.  Each serum, with full Charisma (SPECIAL + Grape Mentats + Beer + Armor effects), nets 500 caps from the robot vendors.
---
If you don't have the serum recipes and aren't into Flux farming yet, then you can also check out the player vendors.  I sell my Serums for 275 caps at my vending machines \[PS4\].  For example, you could buy from me and re-sell to the Vendors making at least 200 caps for each Serum.  If you grab 7 serums you are all set for the day.
---
Why do I sell them for less when I can get more from the Vendors?  Because I hit the limit each day and it's nice to get the added income.  I also limit the number of serums that I sell each session so I don't have to be constantly farming flux.  Plus, it helps other players out, so win-win...
---
I've seen Serums priced between 200 caps and 700 caps.  But if you are in a hurry and just want to max out your caps for the day, anything between 200 caps and 300 caps will do the job.
---
https://youtu.be/gVZIeg9u72U
---
Not the most bizarre scenario I've seen suggested here tbh, I can see it happening
---
Judging from the brief glimpse into your comment history you sir/ma’am are just a rude sourpuss. It’s okay though, your dickish comments won’t keep me from having a good day or time. Sorry you’ve had a rough life
---
I don't see the point in having every mutation. Especially if you normally play on your own. Mutations like empath or herd mentality are especially useless in that case. Just my opinion though.
---
Try putting a doorway down first. It might force the stairs downwards.
---
I am generalizing the numbers, but I know I've gotten as much as 3k lead scrap out of there once. How much you get looting an ore nod varies considerably, but's the past few times its been around 350.
---
I've been just using spoiled food but it causes disease. Does the goo cause any diseases?
---
Binge shopping always fills that empty void :)
---
You'll never get the Brahmin hair out of that carpet.
---
And sorry, just before I FTd to you, I was in the Mire. I'm sure the footprints will come out. Yes I know you said no PA in the house. I forgot.
---
(Nice camp ;))
---
I just want a pet wolf but I never get the tame option, have level 3, random spawns... heck if i know how it works. or a pet fox...
---
Think you can make voice of set again as you can craft as you level. The sword needs the base weapon though.
---
Only mutations i run are speed demon and marsupial, no reason for me to use any others since i play solo 99% of the time
---
Although hours played and just general experience should have a large effect in pvp it should be in a thinking type of way. You learn how to beat you opponent through strategy and countering what they do. Say if someone's playing aggressive in a fighting game you see their natural pattern and proceed to pull an iron man vs cap from civil war. Usually you arent able to be good without a good amount of experience in a pvp system. Fallouts system is so heavily based on gear though that it feels like borderlands high level pvp. Everyone one shotting eachother. Atleast, except for those people without 50k+ godroll guns that have no damage falloff. Meaning that even if they are good they are locked behind a loot wall effectively handicapping the players with less luck or time to grind. At least in cod time to kill is common across the board (as much as I dislike cod they take their balancing seriously). I could go on about balance in different types of games but their is too many too talk about. Also destiny was pretty well balanced after like maybe a few months in (cant really remember) when the best gun in the game was nerfed and they had different archetypes of weapons like faster less damage hand cannons or slower hand cannons that could two shot people to the head offering people more reward for headshot but less risk with faster firing weapons.
---
I would die, lmao.
---
Me too. Pretty much given up on it and just make PSN chats
---
I would much rather the suspected purveyor idea from pre-release which allowed you to reroll the stars on your legendary gear. Its still fighting the rng, but rather than hoping for good rolls on a random ranged weapons, and getting a stalkers pipe pistol, I could reroll my flamer.
---
I have an extra blade of bastet.   Bought it for this exact reason, figured someone would need one.  I can hop on in 15 min or so, 5 stimpacks obo.
---
That's a lot of good advice. That sounds like the basic idea behind why I sell my water. I dont farm flux yet but I know it's basically the next thing for me to do since I have my bloodied .50 cal and I run in power armor. Not needing to farm legendaries is nice. And any I find can always help a buddy if we are lucky.
---
Only way it would work if it was a fatman
---
Actually, I remember a post, and if I'm remembering correctly, you actually only have to have the torso equipped. With how the game checks wether or not you have excavator armor to apply the bonus, it only checks if you have the torso, and doesn't bother checking if you have the arms at all (or maybe you just have to at least a single piece equipped of any part of it). That post is a good month or so old though, and I have no idea how to search for it, especially as you can't search comments...
---
I'll give it a check really fast but last I saw the recipes I think they required the weapons
---
At level 200+ there's no much fun left besides running around in a nuked zone, clad in a PA and holding a one hit kill sledgehammer or guitar sword. WS is the preferred ground zero as it spawns hordes of glowing ones, even if the legendaries have been almost nerfed out.
---
Oh yiiiiiiiiisssss
---
Hire OP for Bethesda marketing, lmao
---
Are these helmet plans a random spawn in certain locales? Or is there a set place for them?
---
I just heal and either yell at them to land or politely ask then wail on em when they eventually do. If we could vats them I could just marsupial if they get too close
---
Do you think being a team-healer type would be okay with rifles? They're usually my favorite weapons, but I see a lot of people going for shotgun, melee, or the flamer (because of the flamer perk).  Tried playing with the perk builder, but I'm not terribly good at them. My focus was "trying to make sure I don't die so I can help others, and use a rifle" or something to that effect.

---
Have the Flamer perk on a swap basis depending on event/situation, I guess? I honestly haven't used it before. Also was not sure if Suppressor is good or not.
---
Once stairs are placed, you can use them to go up or down as you please.
---
For the more serious answer, for going down use the concrete stairs.
---
The thing about the weapons is what I expected, someone coming after me with a big lumbering minigun should do more damage than someone agile but using a pistol..
---
That's true. I'm the last of my friends to still play so I don't collect as much as I used to by far. Now the only thing I farm caps for is for plans, since workshops can only take me so far. I think having a set group of friends really changes the game.
---
pet system is not good, broken in my point of view. Bethesda needs to step up and make some changes to it but nothing since launch. After the 2nt time my pet cat "disappeared" I gave up. Took 12 hours of searching gone in a blink of an eye.
---
I feel for ya, but pets have a red bar and they load first before anything else in your camp, including its owner tag so a fast draw player will kill it without even knowing. I Almost killed someones pet deathclaw this way but experience with pets saved it for the moment.
---
Do you know if this is also true with trapper armor? I was thinking of getting a full set for the RR, though I wish it was more
---
This is one of the main reasons I stopped playing, everything about SBs screams awful game design in every way.
---
Now slow your roll here. Bethesda's should make a better game before they worry about people happy. Making the game better equates to happiness for all. Also these higher level pvprs arent the main demographic of the game I'm sure. I mean, I'm pretty sure 90% of people got the game with co OP pve adventures in mind.
---
Yeah, several of the mods have  great quality of life improvements, so lets hope.
---
Ah, yes. The infamous rad-x dart. A beautiful concept.
---
That's why I use the keypad door. But I post the code right next to the keypad so people can get in use my Vending. And then a pressure plate on the other side so they can leave. My only wish is that the concrete keypad door would face the right freaking way when you try and put it down in your camp. The keypad faces the interior of the structure and I've never been able to face the outer.
---
5 stimpacks sounds good!
---
Oh damn, that’s so smart to model the cannon after a Fatman lol
---
I typically only take mutations that specifically cater to my build. Maybe not just a single mutation but I agree there is no need to have so many at a time.
---
You dont even need speed demon if you have a gunslinger build. Hell i took the perk at low lvl and just keep a 10mm on my hotbar for quick travels with out messing up food perks.
---
Random spawns. Your best bet is the train cars at watoga, theres 2 spawns there. One right by the train station, and one further west up the tracks. Then there is also substation ??? North east of watoga. Its waist deep in water, so bring a rad suit. Its on the shelving along the left wall when you open the security door inside the building. Id server hop till you find them,

---
What, you mean it could be something OTHER than what the reactionary outrage says?
---
got mine yesterday at the repair yard just west of watoga. nice place for bos plans too.
---
Lololol or he comes out and says anyone who purchased the game at all now gets a damn canvas bag. Email proof of purchase and six years later you’ll have a bag!
---
What a shame, I didn't realise that. Indeed kill count would solve this problem to a great extend. Those playing it as deathmatch get the most attention out of it. And others that want to play plain survival can just go their own way.
---
Same here. I despise battle royal to he honest, but, if done correctly, could add a new dimension to the game and even entice adventure mode players to join battle or two.
---
I'd rather have a deathmatch mode
---
How would it even work?
---
Fallout 76 has a breathtaking world that would be an absolute blast to play traditional BR format in. 
---
Fallout games have a great inventory system, aka the pip boy. One of the largest criticism of br games is the janky loot/inventory mechanics (looking at you bf5 firestorm). Fallout has a great looting system, you won't spend as much time messing around in your inventory during the action. Most other games have you clumsily dragging and dropping items around. In 76, you should be able to fully loot a body in seconds flat then sort through it somewhere safe.
---
There are incoming improvements to gun play with will make the game feel more smooth in general for both pve and PvP. 
---
For any new br game to be successful, it has to bring something new to the table. A fallout BR game mode might bring loads of interesting things to the br genre. The mechanics of the game are alot more in depth than pubg.
---
We have to remember that we don't know much about the details of it until tomorrow's e3, but even if the new PvP mode isn't your thing nuclear winter will almost certainly have some great pve content as well.
---
I agree. I just came back 2 weeks ago. And so I have many plans to acquire still. But having 3 or 4 people really increases the amount needed. Especially if everyone has different amounts of time they can play the game.
---
As far as I've heard those are the same lights that are next to the turrets in the Arktos Pharma event, maybe some misplaced object?
---
Ya, I deleted. Was just trying to he helpful. It's against the rules to advertise sales or trades here which is why your post got deleted.
---
Market place or the store forums is where you wanna post these.
---
Nope, it just gives you a ton of rads
---
Do I exist?
---
In 32-ish hours we will know for sure... hopefully.
---
Who cares if it is a battle royal, or a team deathmatch, or a free for all or capture the flag or whatever.
---
What if there is a game mode added like happened in Wild Appalachia that is entirely optional to play and the rest of the DLC was Vault raids and mini quests and events.
---
Should we care or complain?
---
They're also not scary anymore because they are utterly helpless when kneecapped (shotgun + enforcer utility combo). Even bringing a pack of them will not change the effect of the game's design.
---
Interestingly, gulpers are exempt from immobility when kneecapped, and the combination of that, their health/limb regen, and their pack groupings makes them scarier than deathclaws.
---
Maybe it will be faction pvp?
---
Only problem, knowing marketing.
---
He would walk out load the first round , fire it. Then the fatman would break
---
I dont see why it wouldnt work. Main 'healer' perk is the shared stims as long as you are close by. You can also find a medics rifle if you vats for the little extra healing.
---
Suppressor is nice because it reduces how often you have to heal.
---
I noticed the same
---
My camp is in the forest region near Arktos Pharma and before enemies would mostly only attack from the railway or bridge on the river but after the vending patch also started attacking from the forest coming from Arktos Pharma
---
Thank you! I'll check it out.
---
Or hit someone in the face with a spring loaded bundle
---
I think a big part of it is just getting to know how enemy AI works and getting better at game mechanics. Crippling limbs, finding places where enemies can’t reach you, learning when to save/use crits, it’s part of the overall game experience to master the tools you need to make the game easy. Now when I level an alt, things like wendigo cave (no PA, minimal armor, a lvl 15 hunting rifle) seems far easier than when I did it on my main with better gear
---
Alrighty. Sounds like its farming time! At least until I get the caps for serums it seems lol.
---
Thank you!  Friendly Fire sounds pretty fun, though I'm not entirely sure how often I will use it.
---
No, but you know people will be on here parroting their favorite YouTubers
---
Or are you just in my imagination?
---
Please please fix your game,. Have integrity in your product and your business , take away unreasonable deadlines from your employees and let them catch up before you add new content
---
Yeah could  be a "bit" misplaced, almost half the map away lmao
---
Should we care? I mean, I think so? I’ll be a little disappointed if the next wave of content is a mode I’ll never do anything with.
---
Have seen the mod lying around watogga area a few time this week on PC.
---
As to plans, not sure but I know a few that say they can craft it from a recipe. Not sure if I can tho.would have to check my crafter
---
Tbh I had been wondering about the same thing. I scrapped both fairly early on due to stash weight concerns and now I’m regretting it. I wish there was a way to redo the quest or something to get them back now that there’s a bit more leeway stash weight wise.
---
Yeah I'm getting deathmatch vibes but nothing close to a BR so I don't know.
---
From what I have noticed that's not the case for me at all. I use a lot of low level character for scripping.
---
 From what I have gathered (using lvl 2 characters) I will get a low level weapon closer to my level IF that weapon can be low level. Examples: hunting rifle, pipe guns...
---
 I will get a Max level weapon if that weapon cannot be a low level weapon. Examples: Handmade, plasma weapons...
---
 I have done a lot and that is what I have noticed when getting weapons. It will never give me a level 1 or 5 handmade and it will never give me a level 50 pipe rifle.
---
no, just 124 rads
---
well its situational but could be a lot of fun i guess let me know once you decided wich build you gonna go with im interested how things turn out 👍🏼
---
Lol thanks
---
I keeping think to this time last year when all the hype was building about 76 and trying to be excited but watching E3 thinking “this isn’t fallout...” and being pretty bummed. I ended up absolutely loving the game and did a 180 in my initial opinion so that may be the case again. Just fun to think about over the weekend as the anticipation builds lol
---
I'm on xbox, but thank you. I was starting to think I was crazy looking for something that wasn't there lol.
---
Have fun. Lol. Id save for a serum recipe though. I see them for sale in the market for 3-5k. Then just nuke a place for the mats.
---
The only reason I hope it's NOT a BR announced is because if it is, yongyea and juicy boy are gonna be getting new lambos with all the revenue from the following videos
---
Haha awesome picture
---
Lol yup
---
The game mode survival was not the big part of Wild Appalachia.
---
I don't play survival and don't feel disappointed by it.
---
Maximizing player choice is a good thing. Besides they can take that tech and have clans/guilds and make faction battles.
---
Basically you are short sighted to oppose the addition of new content.
---
this is probably going to be similar to the already implemented items in the camp like the fermenter or the vending machines, you simply assign items from your stash to the machine while the items itself still resides in your stash space
---
Didn't know that about suppressor!  BF also suggested it could be my shared CHA perk and then "everyone debuffs everything" more or less.   I also keep forgetting medic stats are a thing on legendaries.
---
Thank you for your reply!
---
Unfortunately voice of set requires one to craft
---
I max ranked all my looting cards only to find out I've been using them all wrong. :(
---
\&gt; speculation
---
It's considerably more than that. It's way more concrete than mere speculation. There are 400+ voice lines that have been datamined that pretty much confirm that pvp is going to be a significant focus for Nuclear Winter. A battle royal mode is beyond likely, or at least a mode that will contain many battle royal elements. There's stuff like obtaining brief cases to launch nukes, the playing area being reduced via fire, directly competing with players to become overseer (basically winner winner chicken dinner, or victory), solo and group mode for battle royal, there will be rankings for overseer (extending into  at least 125), which is possibly a seasonal ranking system (or just a basic ranking system that doesn't reset), a rewards system, amongst those 400 voice lines are announcements like "x number of players left", etc. There's way too much information to be just speculation. There still isn't much that's terribly specific, but a battle royal mode and a few other modes is undoubtedly likely.
---
 At least we will be getting 4 player pvp raid content in the form of Vaults at least... and are hopefully have not made as a complete afterthought.
---
Really not looking forward to a battle royal implementation...
---
Really not...
---
It's beyond clear that pvp focused content will be the primary focus of Nuclear Winter with how much information was obtained from those voice lines.
---
Tell me have you been in any high level pvp for any other game? I'll  Give you my rap sheet for all the games I'm above average to high tier pvp player formerly and currently: destiny, NBA 2k, COD, paragon ( the only moba I played cause it was beautiful), gta online, for honor, battlfront 1 and 2. So as you can see I've played and been good at a wide variety of games. Obviously balance is tossed out the window when you begin letting a small percentage of players be better than everyone else in pvp when it comes to gear.
---
Why though? I think it might be kinda fun. Atleast hold judgement until it is released.
---
Yeah this is a goddamn weekly thread here. I've seen it hit /r/all more than I've seen any other kind of thread from this sub. 
---
It's really fucking tiresome. 
---
How does this have over a thousand upvotes?  It's nearly ten times as much as the next highest post.
---
I’m still going to keep playing the game. Being disappointed isn’t opposing. If they release t and other people love the new option that’s great! I suggested a discussion about what else it could be.
---
A little transparency would go a long way into showing the Dev team actually gives two shits
---
No it means I want to put my opinion out there
---
The cycle of gaming life 
---
YouTube's reads reddit post written by person that watches YouTuber
---
I remember when you could get a real review
---
To bad they needed the tophat value 2 patches ago
---
3 rubber, 1 glass, 1 plastic.
---
I save up rubber just to make a bunch to clear out the vendors. I just wish they stacked, so I didnt have to sell 50 individually.
---
Do you need one in your stash to craft the others then. That would make sense as mine was stashed.
---
It's awful to see them get so many upvotes from stolen "ideas"
---
Psst by the way canned meat stew doesn’t spoil either now so can if you are in the area go do feed the people public event for this amazing super food (food, water and exp boost).
---
Ooof. They make THCheerios now?
---
Whenever this happens I just assume that my character has stubbed his toe on a rock.
---
Yeah I think so, as long as you have it you can make it.
---
I was kinda close on the materials; not.
---
check out the ash heap should be appropriate for your level and scorched as well as mole miners drop tons of shotguns
---
Give it time to load. If it doesn't, server hop.
---
It doesn't look bad. You're definitely gonna get more damage out of your melee weapons than your rifles but all in all I don't think it's a terrible attempt at a hybrid.
---
 I hunt them for food. YMMV. ;)
---
Explains why I couldn't remake the blade as I had scrapped mine as well.
---
I run that with 1H weapons and fireproof in endurance. It's a solid build for pve
---
It's the logical first step to dedicated player created faction PvP imho
---
This made me smile.  It may be the wasteland, but it doesn’t have to be a dystopia ; )
---
In my opinion, there is a different between a "I screwed up and I'm going to die" moment and a "These things are so powerful that they are going to kill me if I can't get out of here" moment.
---
Anyone can die by making a mistake.  And yes, despite the annoyance, clicking on the sleeping bag is a player mistake.  I could go on about how sleeping and sitting should never happen when sneaking, but that would be off topic...
---
With Yao Guai you can die, and die quickly, even if you are doing everything right.  Especially when there are multiple glowing Yao Guais attacking you.  Each hit staggers you and before you can recover, you get another hit again, and again, and again, then you die...   
---
I equate the sleeping bag thing with jumping off of a cliff before looking down to see how high it is.  Being killed by a Yao Guai mauling is similar to the Encryptid event.  Where the enemy is so powerful that you really need to deal with them from a distance.
---
It could be fun I'd give it a chance before I rip it
---
They mentioned them in a Inside the Vault a few months ago in the same paragraph with the repair kits for the Atomshop when talking about exploring new ways of bringing more community-driven items to the game
---

---
Dont forget about the one and only [fallout radio!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_J16Olu_HA)
---
I hope they pull a gearbox and outright say “no this game will not be battle royale”
---
It would be great for them to at least post on known issues and at least a ballpark idea of when we could expect a fix. 
---
Challenges not working... maybe turn the challenge off until they get it to work. Then add it to another challenge later....
---
Killing a 3* legendary drops you a 1 or 2 star? Haven’t seen anything on this and it’s been widely discussed for a long time now. 
---
Killing enemy/creatures and they vanish... poof... some say it falls back to original location...  so a SB would be a fisher? Either way it’s broke. 
---
Also killing things that drop nothing at all... this happens all the time... nothing on them at all. 
---
Communication isn’t great at all with Bethesda, just wish it was better.
---
Ok thanks. Any specific place in ash heap?
---
Nice. I will offer -200 caps for the shotgun.
---
Rejuvenated
---
well....wouldn't be surprising for 76,would it?
---
100caps? ive never seen them sell anything close to that to vendors. 31caps tops for me
---
This game isn't close to ESO at all, this is a game on the traditional creation/gamebryo engine that has had some netcode spliced in. 
---
The game is narrative driven and always has been, the whole plot was a mystery to figure out what happened to the population of WV. What the game doesn't need is to add in a gimmick that's been repeated 30 times by other games. This game needs the vault raids, it needs new boss monsters, new 4 hour quest lines.
---
if i had the budget left i would do the exact same.
---
Share tenderizer. Then everything takes more damage.
---
So, if I'm understanding this correcectly you sugerdaddied the workshop from a low-level? Totally raider.
---
Under the game's current balancing, these are the things you'll need to understand...
---
* If you use a gun, you must max all three weapon-specific damage perks for its weapon type
---
* If you use a melee weapon, 15 strength is highly recommended (but you can get by with rank 1 of each of the three weapon-specific damage perks)
---
* You must get armor penetration (from a weapon-specific perk, and/or from Perforating Magazine mod, and/or from "Anti-armor" legendary effect)
---
* Bloody Mess 3 is highly recommended
---
* Percentage-based damage reduction (Lone Wanderer, Blocker, Fireproof, Dodgy) is much more effective than DR/ER, due to the math behind DR/ER (you're also correct in your suspicion regarding power armor; power armor has hidden percentage-based damage reduction of 7% per piece; regular armor requires at least 4 pieces with "Sentinel's" legendary effect to compete with the defenses of power armor)
---
* Rely on DR/ER from material mods for your armor, not from perks (refer to "[New Research: Complete Guide To The Best Armor Sets!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2vh4g/new_research_complete_guide_to_the_best_armor_sets/)")
---
* Non-combat perks should be swapped in only when needed
---
* Pistols are poorly balanced, so using sneak attacks and/or VATS criticals is highly recommended
---
Without changing your current SPECIAL allocation, I recommend prioritizing these perks as a first step...
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4662f5&amp;d=s52se2ss2c72ic1a72ad2l40l71lt1ak2al2cu0a00sg2eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4662f5&amp;d=s52se2ss2c72ic1a72ad2l40l71lt1ak2al2cu0a00sg2eh2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)
---
(rely on melee with power armor if having difficulty leveling)
---
Ultimately, I recommend dropping melee entirely, and moving points from strength to luck, to focus on VATS criticals instead...
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=34655ff&amp;d=c72ic4a72ad2l40l71lt2ak2al2cu0a00p00sg2eh2lu2lk2l12a30pb2eo2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=cf95](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=34655ff&amp;d=c72ic4a72ad2l40l71lt2ak2al2cu0a00p00sg2eh2lu2lk2l12a30pb2eo2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=cf95)
---
(there are a few points left over, for you to use as you wish)
---
They weigh .5 each though. I keep 10 - 20 in my stash
---
yeah...they increased the chance for them in the recent patch I think
---
I don’t understand locks on doors either, but I think perhaps it is because these players are switching back and forth between survival mode.  I could be mistaken, but it would be easier for them to come in and destroy things without first having to go through the walls if that was the case.
---
&gt; But why is this a huge issue?
---
Because they spent development time working on something stupid like a BR mode while there are still many things that need fixing and improving in the base game.
---
A BR mode in 76 will be a ghost town after the first week or two, and so all those development manhours will have been for nothing.
---
nice!
---
You buy them from the MODUS military terminal at white spring.
---
The reward is knowing you’re saving American and, by extension, allowing future fallout games to happen
---
Its not my joy at all and I'm purely after the hunters. But saying that thing is badly balanced because amateours get beaten by professionals is kinda strange.
---
I only dislike the sleeping bag
---
Are you maximizing your charisma? I wear unyeilding armor, drink alcohol, and take formula p, and have herd mentality, with hard bargain maxed. If i do all that, my charisma is in the upper 20's and i sell mine for around that. Might have exaggerated the 100 a little bit, but im pretty sure im at least getting 80-90 caps per.
---
Dont feel guilty, Murgal is the only NPC character that does nothing....
---
Shes cant be someones pet.
---
Why rejuvenated?
---
No sorry, I have a limited selection, but you can eat as many as you like!
---
Yes, but what mods are all available, and what exactly do they make the stats?
---
Well, I do not know what happened.....
---
Logged on today, and guess who is back at my base?
---
Bob......
---
Missing in Action for over 24 hours.....
---
Noice
---
Polymer for armor mods, good luck figuring out which one goes where. I think the torso mod is more expensive than the limb mods. I'm at work or I'd look up how much it adds.
---
Yea i hope Bethesda will finally fix that stuff and remove explosive effect from energy weapons.
---
And i dont have much of a charisma stat. I think i might have a 4 or 5 charisma
---
I imagine it will have pve and pvp stuff. Wild Appalachia was a decent mix of content.
---
I use the marine helmet plan. Only costs 1 plastic, 1 glass, and 3 rubber to craft a helmet that sells for 33 caps each at the vendor. Also, super duper can double the amount you make consistently. 
---
You can buy glass rubber and plastic at people camp for like 1 cap each. Or find it all over the world.
---
Low level? It scales to your level daawg.
---
XD
---
Welch is a good place to start
---
pretending a problem doesn't exist isn't a solution, it is like pretending you don't need retirement
---
it works until it doesn't
---
There are quite a few mods you can get from MODUS however the mods do not let you know what armor location (chest, arms, legs) it can be attached to. 
---
Polymer will bump up the resistance overall much like the BOS mod for combat. 
---
There is also pocketed, deep pocketed, bio mesh, dense, and a few others... again, some mods won’t accept the mod. 
---
I had one piece that wouldn’t accept a deep pocket mod however the other arm would... 
---
Each piece also can have 2 mods attached which is pretty nice!
---
Oh it's the torso? My bad.
---
I was wary at first when shop owners were around, but now that I've shopped a lot, Im starting to enjoy it, spices things up!
---
I try to remember to always emote-wave after buying something, in case a hidden shop keeper is in the shadows :)
---
It does, ive sold like 2 plans and have it unlocked
---
It takes me all of 5 seconds to kill one. I'm not so fucked about it personally.
---
As long as it is in a separate mode and has some fun rewards, like the weekly legendary in Survival can be, it could be fun. I don't mind PvP as long as it is separate and you know what you are getting into it can be fine.
---
You guys are hilarious :)
---
I know polymer is the one that actually increases the dmg resistance on the pieces. I can't remember the others though lol
---
If the team actually does reveal a BR mode and then hypes it up on that stage like this is the next big thing then yeah they deserve to catch some serious flak. 
---
The game still suffers from horrible bugs and a broken economy thanks to dupers.
---
Cool!
---
I see an immediate need for a variety of swimsuits.....
---
You missed out on Aisha Taylor then.
---
The best Vampiric weapon I’ve seen yet is the Tesla.  The limitations are the 15 round magazine , but the arc will not only tag everything but Vampiric leech all hit.  With power armor on, it will make you rather hard to kill.  
---
Shotguns are also a fine leech but are also limited by the ammunition capacity.  
---
For those SBQ/Pharma/Sheepsquatch moments; that .38 LMG or .50 Vampiric will always hold precedence.
---
THAT'S what they are? Ffffffff.... Definitely not going to pass that drug screen now...  
---
I thought the box said [Orange *Ment****os***](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZyw1MDAsMjcxLHQoc1rkqpLlLYHoWqrCQUvdmUovA5u%2FfOTAJiJW7EJ6) :S
---
^(/s of course lol)
---
r/fo76: we want fixes, no new content! 
---
Bethesda: *does that*
---
r/fo76 WTF Bethesda, WHY AREN'T YOU RELEASING NEW CONTENT!!!!?
---
More than half the time its T pose and texture flicker city.
---
Pls NO bluegrass!
---
Brilliant suggestion. Hopefully licensing would permit this. But a lot of bluegrass I’m sure remains in public domain.
---
Animal planet is wild
---
To the best of my knowledge chameleon does not benefit from multiple pieces.  I would second the single chameleon piece with 4x Vanguard.  For secondary and tertiary attributes I would seek sentinel, 1x water breather, 2x water/food/chem redux, and 2x weapon weight.
---
The balancing between the PA versions is not really well thought out...
---
Ultracite PA needs more HP because the material is much more durable than the ceramic plating on the t51b and maybe a bit more physical armor, also reduce the radiation resistance because that stuff is depleted radioactive material. Maybe even give it its own fuel based on Ultracite, this has been mentioned ingame and im not sure why Bethesda didnt go with it. 
---
All in all both X-01 and the Ultracite PA need to be more unique, like the excavator armor is unique to all other armors. There needs to be a reason to NOT use the t51b over other armors.
---
Well In most games the minigun is actually kinda trash, its assault rifles and smgs that are usually the best because of versatility. The minigun is usually ditched because of mobility. (Making you easier to headshot because of decreased mobility isn't a worthwile pay off for most people)
---
Fair assessment and I agree
---
I would imagine that's the case. A lot of it's traditional music that anybody could do a cover of.
---
Isn't it just so inconvenient though? You can't put your imaginary life on hold just so Bethesda can try to figure it's shit out! You have things to do in our little imaginary wasteland...milk the imaginary Brahmin...pick the imaginary carrots....kill the imaginary ghouls...
---
The price he mentioned selling then at is the nerfed vaule
---
Problem solved. Make it so, dev. :)
---
A handful of people who play for a day then realize that Apex Legends season 2 is about to launch. 
---
A BR game mode won't last unless they 100 percent commit to updating it with some frequency.
---
There's 4, I think. 51 just doesn't have a marker yet.
---
Adamant skeleton if you dont have it. Otherwise gonna be permacrippled in PvP.
---
Most people know.
---
Tomorrow? Doesn't E3 start on the 11th? Am I just bad at time?
---
Where is the 4th?
---
Yeah and look how many there are and look at how people react when they don't update the content every other week (Apex Legends, Black Ops 4) 
---
This will be a stagnate gimmick gamemode if released and I assure you of that.
---
Lament that our imaginary bodies have the same lack of genitalia as a ken or a Barbie doll, so we are denied even that distraction.
---
Lmao fix your build, I one shot them with a lever
---
How is this game too PvP heavy? PvP has besically been removed from adventure mode. With pacifist mode on, the removal of slap damage, and with camp damage removed, there aren't many ways to actually get into a fight unless you want one or are careless.
---
When was the last time you saw a wanted player on adventure with more than a bounty of 5 caps?
---
Killing them takes seconds during end game. I would want them to be more difficult on top of better loot.
---
 No one needs more than 5 points in Intelligence. That's for Demolition Expert, the only fighting perk in Intelligence. Being able to repair to 200% is really all you need for weapon durability.
---
 No Sneak at all in Agility is laughable. As well QOL perks get tossed later when you realize you need em' all for power and suitability in serious situations.
---
 You need 3 Fireproof in Endurance that with appropriate armour will make you practically immune to explosions.
---
 I run Melee/Rifleman which I'm changing to Melee/Automatic and its not much like that.
---
Foggy Mountain or we riot.
---
Still going on if anyone is interested
---
Yes, this has been posted countless times and is already on their to-do list
---
That’s cool. Literally two days ago I moved my camp. I had built a Roman bathhouse. Looking much like the one here
---
Possibly for E3 in general but Bethesda’s conference is tomorrow evening
---
Oops didn't catch that. Sorry. I parsed it @190 not 19. My bad
---
Hopefully for wastelanders as the description is "A story with true choice and consequence"
---
YES
---
There would be a bug, cannon explodes, yay Bloody Mess 3!
---
Or if you *finally* find one you don’t already know… it’s fucking marked up to a stupid price.
---
Shiiit. I can’t find one
---
Such a sad....sad life our imaginary selves have to endure.
---
The strong should fear the playerbase being split into three game modes.
---
Weird. I suggest you test it out. It works for me and my friend. I have gotten max level weapons that have minimum requirement below 45 or 50 on my level 2 alt.
---
Yep. I don't lock the front door of my CAMP, but I also put my vending machine outside so people don't need to search for it.
---
I agree. I dont have a good scorch killing weapon. I waste plasma cores and TSE Handmade just for some trash ass brain or lung ofthe scorchbeast.
---
Welch is awesome for mole miners.  Plus sheepsquach will spawn every once in a while now.
---

Vault 51 is a location in game , the battle royale is the quest , so technically doesn't have its own mode. We will be able to BR in either adventure or survival.  I think this is what this poster was meaning
---
I feel like whether you want BR or not (I think it might be kinda neat), they really shouldn't lead with that at E3 because you *know* the headlines will immediately be "Fallout 76 Announces Battle Royale". 
---
I just hope if they're going to add BR, they add a quite a bit of PVE content and game improvements, but thats just my thought.
---
 Yes. I have found 2 in my 660 hours and I have been looking. I have never seen the rumored ones in Watoga although I look a lot.
---
Ya, but the quest itself is gone totally
---
I'm still an avid player and love this game but if they think they can pull off a BR it better be super original and they better have intentions to update it every so often.

---
This juicehead video explains it pretty well
---
 You will need those 2 Agility later on. Trust me on this. ;)
---
Great read. Good work!
---
I use Marsupial, Speed Demon, Grounded, and Carnivore.  Dont judge me.  Shits badass....100% solo
---
Very nice! Loving it.
---
Ok thanks for trying
---
Thank you mate!
---
This game still sucks stopped playing in January and its the same bullshit.  Game hasnt improved one bit and bugs are more rampant  then ever. And guess what duplication glitch is still a problem and no more ban waves....if you polish a piece of shit its still a piece of shit and this piece of shit just keeps getting shinny.
---
It's a basic enemy. What do you expect? It's not a legendary one it's just a scorch beast just like how a dragon drops dragon scales and bones in Skyrim.
---
as a banjo player in real life I support this down to my very soul
---
I want some PVE content where I feel absolutely overwhelmed with incredibly difficult enemies.... or some enriching storyline
---
PVP is terrible as it’s so unbalanced - and will more than likely always stay that way.
---
Go to west ten research facility. A single run there could get you a quarter of a level or maybe even half a level if you’re lucky, just kill the mutants, server hop and repeat. Hope this helps.
---
Nice, great job. You are truly a hero of the Wasteland!
---
Some of the Scout badge grindfest is still broken and if they don't fully get fixed next patch then credibility is poo because then it sounds like they just string it all out to keep you in the game hoping you'll buy more fucking PA paint.
---
I just hope they add more PVE stuff in addition to whatever PVP stuff they've got planned. 
---
I can already see the headlines and YouTube videos if they go all in on Battle Royale though lol.
---
You have to have high charisma and you have to be 2x their level along with the perk cards active
---
... It's not even the devs that people are hating (anyone with half a brain). It's the higher ups making the decision to spend time and resources on something that nobody wanted is what's pissing people off, and the devs are ordered to work on it. Devs don't make major decisions, and devs are part of your workforce. Devs don't get to decide if microtransactions will be implemented either, and are only told to "make it happen". A BR mode in this game is a delusional dream. What else could we have if resources and time wasn't spent on this? The game's engine and servers are going to have major issues upon releasing this new mode. It will. Period. We have constant hitching and performance drops with just 24 players, let alone 50 people (I can only imagine the server room catching fire if the limit was 100 players). The game already has a horrible reputation amongst those who've never played it, and I greatly doubt a non-free-to-play br game will haul in a major audience. It's a complete cash grab and people know it. The reason that it's idiotic is that the current player base is mostly uninterested in pvp content, and it's unlikely to be a great experience for those looking for a battle royal anyway. It will not be a polished experience like other battle royal games, and it will show within hours of it being out. There's a good chance this can end with how BF5's Firestorm is simply not being played at all, and it's impossible to find full servers, and matches take forever to find. This has nothing to do with devs. Battle royal has been on a decline, and Bethesda is showing up extremely late to the game...
---
This br mode is going to be an awful or a very mixed experience, and I greatly doubt it will be able to compete with other br games. I'm not exactly wishing for it to fail, but I severely doubt it will be a worthwhile success for what was spent on it for the company... and depending on how bad it could turn out, god knows what resources and time will be spent trying to fix or mitigate it and how much that could detract from other projects... like pve content. If it turns out just "okay", then it may not draw from other projects all that much, but if it turns out bad, that could severely effect everything else, unless they hire on a TON of people to work on it specifically, but that seems doubtful considering how much Bethesda suffers from a inadequate workforce in the first place.
---
This just isn't going to work out well...
---
Solid stuff. Thank you, OP. I worried this would be too easy on the game or full of nothing but positive feedback for the most basic of things. It was great, reassuring to know people are responding the most to player vending and they want more quests, not just these glorified radiant missions with random mediocre rewards.
---
Westek then burrows, 
---
Should net you some good xp and legendaries.
---
Well I'm trying to figure out what perk I need for a megasloth and my charisma is like 8
---
No but it's fully encompassed by multiplayer in the Venn diagram.
---
Lol, I still haven't found the purveyor yet. I just started playing again a week ago. Either way, there's bound to be a lot of wood items.
---
Like just outside the building or clear the building too?
---
I wish everyone would calm down about it. At least wait and see before getting mad.
---
 I have 4 and may go to 5 but that's all I can use. 
---
 They are Marsupial, extra carry as well as jump. 
---
 Twisted Muscles is 25% Melee damage, essential. 
---
Healing Factor heals as fast as a Stim Pack out of combat. I now have over 30 Stim Packs and am starting to sell them.
---
 Speed Demon replaces my 2 Gun Runner and I like to be quick. Fast reload is nice too.
---
 That's my 4 and I will probably take Grounded as I don't use energy weapons.
---
Agreed, I don't mind fighting them tbh, its some of the better looking and more fun fights in the game.  Its like oh cool a SB, I guess I can't just one shot it and be on my way.  You see some cool visuals as well.  Just wish the loot was a bit better.  I would be fine with junk 1 stars for the vendor, and or maybe a slight chance of a 2-3 star.
---
That didnt answer his question. That plus the animal has to be a random spawn. So you cant go to deathclaw island and tame the deathclaw . They have to be random spawn events
---
I'd say either nerf their health or make then all legendaries.
---
51, unmarked, far north west of the map
---
63, ash heap, Abandoned Mineshaft near Garrahan estate.
---
94, Savage Divide, near Abbie's Bunker
---
96, Savage Divide, far south, near Federal Disposal HZ-21.
---
No offense, but if you haven't found it yet or even used it at all.. Maybe you're not the best person to give advice on the matter?
---
:) camp is between overseers camp and the lighthouse.
---
It WON'T be a battle Royale, this game barely supports PvP as it is. It is going to be like Wild Appalachia, series of events and quests that will have a couple that are raid/dungeon like and we get new stuff to collect. The end...enjoi...
---
I just ignore them since they do 0 damage to me. Sometimes they just fly away and ignore me as well.
---
Or just make them unscrapable like halucigen gas containers. I don't think it should take that long to do, they just need to do it
---
Yeah disagree with you here. Its SURVIVAL. Something that should promote organic engagements that COULD get you killed if you run into the wrong person at the wrong time. Not force people into some stupid ring around the rosie for leaderboard rank.
---
They said why that wasn't working. Something about them doing that would make it not auto scrap when trying to craft with it. Still,  they could add a warning message like I said and it would solve that issue fairly easily.
---
That's fair, but I at least watch the Reddit, which the OP apparently doesn't do much since there's lots of complaint about the wood legendaries
---
Phoenix is Watoga seems to have it sometimes. Bought the plan there a few weeks ago, was surprised I had not seen it before, have only seen it once again on him since. Seems all plans are not on the vendors 24/7 yet.
---
I scrapped all my bug parts the other day, was a bad day.
---
Still confused is there multiple types of unyielding effects? I've only seen +3 to all but endurance
---
Honestly, I want to intern at Bethesda so I can see how convoluted their code must be since it's so hard to fix.
---
Thought this was a bug that fixes itself when you get in and out hmph
---
So why would anyone still play the game if they can just make whatever they want? Oh and the dupers won’t ever dupe those mods right?
---
They'll most likely delete dude's account. I read about people right after the release going around gay-bashing other players, and Bethesda said that those accounts would be deleted; I would assume the same would *(and should)* apply here.
---
Both. The main XP is in the building however.
---
I'm level 270 on one character and level 199 on another. Both level in West-Tek exclusively. I don't have any issue with either character with the level 3 times in one day challenge.
---
I’m 52 and decided to fibally take on the scorch beast that’s always in the settlement west side of the swamplands. I fought it for 15 mins, used nearly everything I had. Went and made more ammo mid fight to finish it off. Completely useless loot. I was disappointed to say the least.
---
I'm not suggesting that the current method is the best, but simply removing it would mean you just never see another player. I haven't seen any ideas here of how to do it better.
---
TBH I don't think Bethesda care that much about survival mode, it's just a way to get the people who really want PvP to not ruin adventure mode for people who don't.
---
Well here’s to the future, right?!
---
All of those would make it 100% more worth it to kill the scorched beast. Especially the strangler bloom for me since I'm a melee mutant who needs his rad shield :(
---
True, but what does it look like? Because to me, it's a giant circle (all multiplayer) and a tiny dot in the middle (BR). Just because people want MP, doesn't mean people want BR. 
---
In the end, it's all about numbers. I don't know why, but developers have this tendency to try and push players to do what they don't want to do, and focus too much development time on niche activities that nobody does.
---
For example, currently I'm playing The Division 2. Last big update was the addition of the raid to the game. Yay, right? Well, no, because they didn't bother to add matchmaking, and the raid itself is mechanically the complete antithesis of what the rest of the game is like. And the end result? A fraction of 1% did the raid so far. And player population dropped considerably.
---
Now, don't get me wrong, if the game was full-fledged, bug-free, QoL-solid, and THEN they decided to throw BR on top? Yeah, sure, go nuts! But when the game is in such a sad state as FO76, to throw so much effort into BR, with so many documented cases of dedicated BR games dying miserably fairly quickly, and I absolutely have to question the wisdom of it.
---
But hey, maybe it's not BR after all. Maybe we're freaking out over nothing.
---
U on PS4?
---
Yep. West Tek and Harper's ferry are my two grinding locations for vendor bot caps.
---
Tormentor works on semi-auto rifle, but it works best with automatic rifles simply because they eject more bullets per time.
---
Smart use of the camera mode and I like the simple transitions.  Cool house, first time seeing someone using a body of water for a swimming pool.  Well done, thanks for taken the time to share and making the video.
---
The reasoning about gamemodes works, but then maybe they don't know it would take just 10 seconds to bash through their door.
---
He means that it scales based on how low your health is, but that there are breakpoints. All Unyielding items will state "Up to +3", as follows:
---
60% health - you get +1
---
40% health - you get +2
---
20% health - you get +3
---
Hope this clarifies.
---
Have you tried it out in pvp?
---
Oh please not Sheepsquatch, I can barely take one out without using 10 stimpaks. I can't do a horde.
---
For proper spec’d builds scorched beasts are a walk in the park but also the only real challenge in game. If you find them hard or annoying or a ammo sink, you’re not there yet.
---
I hope that they add this to the game, it might actually make power Armour more viable. I hope they add unique legendary effects on them that cannot roll on regular Armour too.
---
I think someone over there at the dev studio had the mistaken idea that ultracite was going to be more important than it is to the game, and I think they still think that including ultracite in their loot somehow makes them more valuable than they are.
---
You should have a lot, Adrenal reaction is just like a Bloodied weapon except you don't have to have the low health, carnivore or herbivore is great for not having to cook food and risk disease. Scaly Skin is good for extra resistances, bird bones plus Marsupial is amazing. Empathy plus strange in numbers perk card gives you almost unyielding armor stats without the low health. Many serums are good but some are just not at all.
---
Damn did not know that. Makes sense though because they hit so damn much at small dmg.
---
You need a middle man
---
Killing almost everything at endgame takes seconds.
---
If your on PC I will be happy to help 👍
---
Weapon upgrades get me horny af too, I’ve been there.
---
No, not a big pvp guy. It's more of a pve build
---
0.75
---
Yep, all of this for a minimal of 2 perk points or 5 if you want to remove nearly all the downsides. Exactly why I think stacking shouldn't be a thing. Perks/gear should make the build.
---
I have a Stimpak Diffuser that I'm too afraid to use.
---
Yeah its is, good to know though for when you desperately in need of the extra carry weight
---
I think that, at least in my experience-and this is including my own outlook on FO76, most FO76 fans are fair in their defenses of the game. Let me explain. 
---
Anytime somebody asks "is FO76 worth playing?" and goes on about how terrible of a start the game had and is asking if it's worth buying now...my answer is always, in some form, the following : "Yes, it had a terrible start. It was and remains buggy as hell (although not as bad as it was in the beginning). And Bethesda drops the ball all the time with fixing things and responding to backlash...but despite all this...the game is fun as hell and I'm on it everyday at least for a little bit. It does get boring and a bit grindy after a while, but I keep coming back. I never thought I'd like a multiplayer fallout game and yet, here I am loving this game." 
---
So in terms of expecting all positive feedback and no constructive criticism, I really do think that FO76 fans are aware of the games issues and are fair in it's judgement. I haven't met a single person out in the wastes who didn't love the game wanted to simultaneously throw their controller or mouse through the screen all in the same breath lol.
---
Jesus man what’s the damage you are generating  on that thing?
---
Nah man, if you aren't a PvP kid like me and high level, makes the game more fun and easier.
---
Didn’t stop to look but I have a picture of it over 4K
---
Yeah people on this subreddit seem to post about things in clusters. Cynical me just wants to take every new post, slightly reword it, and repost 2 hours later for the karma until the mods ban me.
---
They will let you down, they will make you huuurrt
---
Omg lol - am i the only one that sees a strange gnomish face in this pic?!
---
&gt;Demolition Expert, the only fighting perk in Intelligence
---
[Nerd Rage](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nerd_Rage!) isn't a fighting perk in the Intelligence tree?
---
The question isn't if battle royal will be popular or profitable for fallout 76, but if this will be able to compete with other more polished battle royal games. I am not optimistic about that at all...
---
On top of fallout 76 having an already terribly reputation (for people that have never played it), people are going to be extremely sceptical about this new mode, and likely never give a chance in the first place. Plus, there are a handful of free-to-play br games out there already, so unless fallout 76 gets a major price cut on digital versions of the game (especially on console stores), I don't see people going out of their way to obtain copies of the game. It's not crazy to say that this mode could be dead in the water upon release, or it could take a very substantial amount of time to gain steam. Also, other battle royal games are far better optimized and perform better, while fallout 76 still suffers from poor performance (I still have ever constant hitching on ps4 for a good month now), and I can imagine how bad the performance could be in this new mode when trying to accommodate more players on a server. Bad performance is what kills a competitive game, and kills it fast. Unless they hired on a engineering genie for game and server stability, the outlook is extremely bleak from an objective standpoint.
---
She has a weird face for sure.
---
Just an additional tip: Some early fo76 videos by FinalRender goes over some tricks and tips for building. The system is really frustrating and not very clear on what you can attach where and in what order.
---
I don't see a fact anywhere.
---
Luckily this was recently patched!
---
I've done the same.  With as much fun as that was this idea of roaming deathclaw packs would be very entertaining.
---
&gt; I find the gameplay extremely skill based, knowledge based and cooperation based. I don't find it surprising that people who come where teamplay is crucial alone find themselves a lootbag for someone else.
---
You're describing overwatch, fo76 is gear based PvP and everything else is a distant second.  It's very disingenuous to not mention 3* legendary gear as a prerequisite for PvP.   A game whose combat system features an aimbot is not "extremely skill based".  
---
Put another way, you're seriously telling me a couple people who play a balanced, skill based, PvP game(CoD/overwatch/Apex) at a professional tournament level would completely wreck in survival with no legendary gear?
---
Might still come down to play styles but the monster is indeed unstoppable.  I’m going to stop searching for a BSS power fist though now that I’ve gotten the monster.
---
Cheers bud.
---
Yes better/more quests are deff at the top of my list, I do the dailies if they're the only source of a particular plan like 'Stings and Things' but a game so chock-a-block with fetch quests in 2019 baffles me. They serve an important purpose as time fillers but I'm not down with so much at the forefront.
---
Thing is, I am properly spec'd. A lot of people seem to have thought that I can't 2-4 shot a scorched beast. I can, I'm just melee so I have to wait for them to land or shoot 40-60 bullets from one of my bloodied guns to shoot the annoying thing outta the air. Meanwhile they blind my screen with their annoying attacks or fart on me. Its more of a chore to kill them than it is difficult/rewarding. Especially if 3 of them spawn in my camp.
---
I would say that, given their relative difficulty, the rewards are far too *inconsistent*.
---
You rarely kill 'just' a Scorchbeast. Typically their presence causes Scorched to appear which you also have to deal with, while you're dealing with the Beast's attacks, attacking it when it gets into range, rushing it when it finally lands, etc, etc.
---
Hahahah thank you
---
That would be amazing. I would be immune to diseases and radioactivity!
---
I know when I'm sneaking I generate about 1800 dmg with mine. If I'm pwr attacking, then it's probably around...2500. And that's in a bloodied unyeilding rifleman build. I don't have my strength maxed out like OP probably does. Nor is my nerd rage or iron fist maxed out. If either of those were maxed and I had all unyeilding instead of just three pieces...I bet the opportunity to do upwards of 5k dmg isn't out of the question. And that's before chems and food and drink buffs.
---
I started to use a few and I plan to get a last one. After that I stop.
---
I use healing factor. It saves a hell lot of stims and food.
---
Marsup for carry and jump.
---
Speed demon for my devastating Dragon.
---
Scally skins for extra defense (and I do not use mutch vats, so its okay)
---
And I plan one of the eating mutation. I plan herbio, but nobody sell it so I reconcider the carnio...
---
Yeah I only pull it out for big game. I have bloodied SS knuckles that are my work horse and tons of fun too.
---
I can run West Tek in a few minutes with my quad explosive double barrel shotgun. I play mixed commando/shotgunner perk set so I’m not playing a full shotgun build. It can still do damage to big enemies if you know where to aim.
---
Sheepsquatch smash times!
---
God job!
---
I'm a bit surprised being with the majority in almost all points lol
---
Their screams are the most annoying part, sound like a bad singer making last ditch attempt to impress.
---
I was so surprised when I first saw how intrusive the UI is when other players are near. The lvl 1 perception marks them from so far!
---
Awww :(
---
Moles gone Wild vol. 1
---
I'm dying because I can hear the mole rat screeching noises in my head from playing the game so much XD
---
I hate PvP unless it is based on some semblance of equally matched opponents (picture how much fun watching any pro sport would be if the final was played between a team/individual multiple levels beyond the other ... ).  I don't see the point in taking on an unmatched opponent in anything (fly weight against heavy weight ... it's just stupid).  I can see why a child wants to take on an adult, I just don't see what really is in it for the  adult, its a lose/lose unless you enjoy the feeling of superiority. ... I don't.
---
I have never played Battle Royale. What does the term "storm" even mean?
---
I'm a melee build, if you take radshield the SBQ rads don't effect you. Typically if I'm doing a SBQ run I'm nuking mostly south of prime so I'm not fighting in the nukezone. Being melee means I have to wait for them to land or shoot 40-60 bullets to kill the thing. I don't mind shooting the SBQ cause rewards are worth it. The normal SBs aren't.
---
I’ve been farming lead towards the bottom right of the map for about 3 days now. I really wish I’d seen this a bit earlier. Thanks for the tips!
---
Why do people play the game after they finish "I am become death?" It just means people can equip more armor. They could also release an area where the enemies level cap is 150, which is where more specialized armor/weapons comes into play. 
---
And the dupers will always dupe. It just makes it a little less advantageous for them since getting "that combo" (like the TSE) less special since anyone could potentially farm those mods and equip it onto their desired gun. 
---
That said, ig it makes sense for legendary farming being a reason why some people keep playing
---
Certain people get shot in the face with a canvas bag too.
---
I found it on Wallace at Harper’s ferry. I think it cost around 250 caps? It’s very worth it though. Probably one of the best underarmors in the game.
---
Equip perks strength: traveling pharm, pack rat martial artist. Agility: thru hiker. Power armor helps with carry weight. Dont worry about dropped junk and keep repsawn/grinding. Alternate from  easier: sunnytop's, sons of dane, harder: white springs, west tek
---
Nuclear winter is not battle royal as wild appalachia wasn't survival.
---
But vault 51 will be sort of deathmatch/battle royal as far as you've see/heard/read spoilers so far.
---
My theory for why weapons isn't what people are caring for is because of the disappointment around them not being legendary. The sheepsquatch club or bear claw are cool and all, but they simply don't compete against even a bloodied boxing glove. I personally would love more weapons, I just also wish they (and some of the ones we already have) get more love. 
---
Anyways, amazing work with this survey and data! Here's to hoping for a great E3 announcement
---
I’ve never quite understood why other robots get hostile if you kill one. If you kill a wolf and it was part of a pack, sure, that *makes sense*. How is a robot programmed to feel the loss of a brethren? Is it just that they realize that they are ‘under attack’? If you kill a robot and no one sees it, does the dead robot send out a signal that it was destroyed? I’m so confused now and am working myself into a thought-loop! I need answers!
---
I am happy to see how much of my own playstyle is reflected in the playerbase in general. I am an explorer who loves player vending and I consider Fasnacht to be the pinacle of cooperation events so far. Glad to see I am not alone. Far from it even.
---
Anthem actually is one of the worst AAA games in the last decade though.
---
Never change Papa Shekels. Never change.
---
We should get rid of the leaderboard stuff and just have like 2 or 3 points of interest around the map that are like 10x as valuable as in adventure. This would bring players together a bit more organically
---
I JUST WANT TO VATS KILL FLYING CRITTERS WITH MY MELEE WEAPONS!!! Seriously, how has that not been fixed?!?
---
Lol mutants have already been nerfed. At launch a level 40 mutant gave like 200 xp. You could go 20 levels in a day easy just farming the school
---
This. Got my level 1 bloodied hunting rifle and legendary armors from eyebots. Low level Legendaries enable you to build toons very fast.
---
I've already went from 10 caps to 800 so I suppose!
---
Literally made a post yesterday about how Deathclaws and bunch of enemies gotta be revamped so their not jokes called Bring back Danger to the Wasteland Bethesda, lets just say some casuals were triggered and thought the game wouldnt be fun because they might actually die xD
---
Huh, turns out I'm full of shit. Thanks for the numbers, I was not aware.
---
It would allow you to change mutation loadouts sort of, at a cost
---
Like that Far Harbah quest
---
If it's tower defence with people banding together + the camp capabilities, I'm good with that.
---
All of the camp budget in a single tile
---
Sounds like he was trying to steal your stuff and got mad because you backed out.
---
Nothing I'm aware of, but I have my camp nearby and can attest that the people in that neighborhood are just plain crazy.
---
Additional my prediction - vault 51 might be the kick off of the vault raids which should be added during the nuclear winter season.
---
Also i'm pretty sure that it opens the executive suite in the enclave bunker by adding sort of presidential election quest/event (at least if i point out the roadmap right)
---
*Here you have read first*
---
Even in packs they are a joke. There is a census event that will spawn deathclaws sometimes. Over the course if the event you fight around 20 deathclaws. It is still a joke.
---
i agree with most of this.  But the truth is that the MOST people got the game because of the "Fallout" brand that they are loyal to because of what it has been and their previous enjoyment within its universe.
---
The players that keep playing keep the game selling, as if you were to enter into an Online world that had no one in it, you would quickly get the message that it isn't much worth it.  The PvE high level players are very very different than the PvP high levels as well ... Todd Howard has acknowledged if it wasn't for the higher level players commitment in Adventure mode to helping newer players out, the game probably wouldn't be doing very well.  The Loyal fans of the franchise, have a vested interest in ensuring the franchise survives through success.
---
Me, personally, I hope Bethesda sells the Fallout brand/franchise to someone who cares about it more than Bethesda does.
---
There is a census event that will sometimes spawn deathclaws.
---
This is actually only half my camp, ihave a three layer river deck, 2 water purifiers, all the workbenches and a lil farm :)
---
I used to feel the same way.
---
Now, I have 3/3 Fireproof so they barely make a dent from the air, and a specific weapon I carry around to take em out, a Furious VATS crit automatic Railway Rifle. You just wait until it’s close enough, enter VATS and unload on that bitch. Sometimes it takes two clips of 10 spikes, but if they are close enough one will do. The other day I did Surface to Air and killed seven of em’ in the time allotted.
---
Is the loot kinda bad? Yes. Is it still satisfying? Hell yes.
---
This is why I don't do it. I just look for the top tier hunters and go after them. Don't criticise me for something I dont do.
---
Yes! Would love an enemy that actively stalks and hunts the player. Been suggesting that Deathclaws should be apex predators that should make people watch their backs
---
The camp was right next to the quary x3. The whole thing just seemed off.
---
 Not for me. I can see a Bloodied build using it though.
---
I think you're missing the point. You of course are going to have trouble, you're not set for ranged fights. You're melee, ranged fights are supposed to be hard for you. Wouldn't it be pretty damn lame for the biggest **flying** creatures in the game to sit on the floor? 
---
Your arguement is kind of null and void since you're basically complaining its tougher for a melee to handle a ranged enemy.
---
I don't know of any glitches regarding player trading, but iv never had anyone do that. Judging from the stuff he had I'd say he knows something that I don't lol
---
That must be why we keep failing the event. Watched her fly off three times yesterday, once without even bothering to heal. Something has definitely changed regarding the damage output in that fight.
---
Yup, I think little things like this would give the game more substance.
---
He's melee lmao. Gee, I wonder why you have a bad time fighting something flying.
---
Never trade with randoms - just don’t!
---
This is awesome especially when there’s no picking up + dropping items
---
I think you are on the wrong subreddit.
---
duuuuuuude right!
---
Für welche PA?
---
\^\^ what they said.  I crippled a level 92 glowing deathclaw that snuck up on me in some mine or something.. at level 45... and took it out easily after that.
---
I mean all br's at the core are the same right with some leaks we see enemies that have weapons ammo types and mods in their names. Maybe if you kill a scorchbeast you get a Fatman it could be fun, if it's not I won't play it but I could see it being pretty cool.
---
*"Heeeelloooo maaaaa dear! Wanna haveeee some guuuanooouuuu? Thihihiiiii"*
---
 Why not just wail on her? I don't use VATS and my knives work great. 
---
 I really don't understand VATS and Melee, seems pointless.
---
Undeniable.
---
That's an overstatement
---
Because they're just trying to stir up shit.  
---
They're not even complaining about having their thirst bar go red, they're whining about JUST losing the Well Hydrated buff you get for being over 80%.  I've been trying to explain to these idiots that the buff is supposed to be a short term benefit for topping yourself off but the entitled fucks just keep demanding they get the absolute best buffs with 100% uptime with zero effort required.
---
Does anti-armor gamma gun work better? Since it ignores half of the armors. In pvp it’s all about who has the unkillable armors right?
---
You get better return from killing bloodbugs in the swamp then killing scorched beasts.
---
Others have given you the answer but I still like doing a Whitesprings run first just to get legendaries to scrip.  The go hog crazy at West Tek if you want to power level.  If someone drops the nuke for Scorched Earth so it isn’t the cake walk slaughter then the event is always good for XP too.  AWOL Armaments is a good choice as well for events.
---
Never trade with anyone you don’t know... it’s literally never worth it...
---
Its simple. 
---
Make who ever has the most kills on the server or the largest kill streak be on the leaderboard. That way Joe minding his buiness killing mutants at West Tek doesnt get a big target on his back for minding his own buisness where pvpers tend not to flock. Its stupid. 
---
Then people who want pvp will go to the people who are actively killing people. Then JOE can even try to kill the top dogs of the server. 
---
Its not hard to figure out how to salvage survival.
---
Not at all, like I said I could kill the thing in the air with a bloodied weapon in 40-60 shots. A beginner with a non-legendary weapon or an non-optimized item set would end up taking so much more time even if they were properly spec'd. Yes they have 1% chance to get a prime receiver plan or an PA plan but is that 1% chance worth the effort? Are they going to use the plan? Why is the consistent loot such a stinker? What reasons do high leveled players have for killing them? Even if I was ranged and I do have ranged alts. I'm not going to waste my time looting the body cause I know the stuff it drops isn't really worth my time.
---
It’s fairly easy to change your mutations now. I have purchased all the mutations I currently use for 300 caps each. If I want to try a new one, I take off starched genes and run through my decontamination shower. Then take any serums I want. If I don’t like it, repeat as necessary....
---
Yeah the survival mode is chalked full of assbags. I only bear it to get the weekly legendary. Every time i play it have shitty interactions .... everyone is an ass bag in survival.
---
yup and with less congestion, servers glitch less too
---
Its an old meme sir but it checks out.
---
It'd be nice to get some guns as well, melee have a plethora of options but pistols and rifles got shafted a little going from 4 to 76. But no legendaries of the new weapons is a massive issue as they just can't compete endgame.
---
Thanks for the complements.
---
very cozy☺️
---
That would be an interesting thing to watch. I agree this game seems to have many coding issues.
---
The Golf Course run, The Burrows and Wes Tek are my main leveling places.
---
Being skilled at every other FPS game doesn't mean being skilled at Fallout76. Besides having access to the gear you must know how to use it -hence the vast majority of players who obtain assassin sentinel still get shredded. I suppose that if you put top tier FPS players and gave them all the gear they wanted I'd still shred them easy, for a short period of two to three weeks tops. Afterwards they would git gud and would probably shred me.
---
A game where you must move smartly because enemies have an aim bot is skill based. Its different skill than typical FPS and if you approach this game like a typical FPS you are doomed to fail.
---
The fact that you can't adapt to this games PvP condition does not mean its not skill based.
---
I have the exact same roll.  The best way to play it is low health, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, and in power armor to take advantage of the stabilized perk card.
---
If that's ALL they announce as upcoming content, it'd be deserved.  Most of the player base doesn't want a Deathmatch system.  See the radio channel for hunter/hunted, no one uses it.  Now if it's content that's an addition to some good PVE content, that's another thing.  The majority of stuff needs to be PVE oriented, and they can add some PVP content for 'those' people.
---
And three men in it.
---
Good lord
---
This is where this gets confusing, there's TWO "Nuclear Winter"'s her for some reason.
---
The upcoming season, like Wild Appalachia, is called "Nuclear Winter" and like Wild Appalachia it will be the months long slow drip of mixed content we're used to.  But within that there's the titular "Nuclear Winter" game mode, which like Survival MODE and Adventure MODE will likely be some sort of separate game with its own rules.
---
I thought there was a known glitch with Melee and flying creatures in VATS.   Don't play melee so can't confirm but have seen other threads where this came up - but mostly with insects.
---
Bethesda does not have designers that understand the idea of asymmetric design.
---
It will be exciting to see what kind of lies Todd tells this time to the audience. People still remember his talks of FO76 from last year and what kind of disaster game actually was. Is he going to promise again something big and similar?  Maybe Starman with exciting video teaser? Game would still use same 10+ year old engine like FO76 and include shitload of ridiculous bugs that will be never fixed.
---
I found that Morgantown train yard is good for that.
---
It's quite Fabulous
---
 Will farm him. Thanks.
---
I see what you're saying but honestly it'd be easier for them to just change it back to being based on player kills and you'd basically have the same result. Murderhobos can do their thing and go after each other since they're far more likely to be on the top kills leaderboards and people who enjoy the risk of PvP but don't want to play deathmatch can do their best to avoid getting marked on the map. Plus those who are actively seeking PvP to murder everything they see are more likely to be using top-tier gear so there's more competition there for them as well.
---
For the PvPers who only want to kill people who have no chance of fighting back, I couldn't care less about catering anything to them.
---
The problem with this reasoning is that it doesn't recognize that there's actually TWO "Nuclear Winter".  Yes, the upcoming season is called "Nuclear Winter" just like the first was called Wild Appalachia but within that season just like how Wild Appalacia introduced Survival Mode the roadmap lists a separate "Nuclear Winter" mode that is also coming.
---
You can't always get what you want and you can't always please everyone.  What you CAN do is actually wait for the fucking thing to come out before you decide it's dead to you.
---
If your a sneak build + 40% Power Attack DMG can be super effective especially with bloodied or instigating melee weapons.
---
Swing speed is great if your a non sneak melee character or in those situations where your surrounded by enemies.
---
I'm just waiting for them to release a canvas bag skin for 500 atoms and then state that was their plan all along.
---
Wish they weighed less but they are useful for dropping health on command when needed
---
You can steal people’s items in trade by requesting them
---
Yes! A canvas bag backpack skin!
---
Still fun though, and if I got that opportunity I'd probably brag about it.
---
Just wanted a discussion dude. Take it easy.
---
Oh okay I thought he was saying it gives you 60% health so I was like what?
---
This is great thanks!
---
That sounds like a nice practice
---
I should start doing it too
---
I didn't take my first mutation (intentionally) until I was like lvl 100. At end-game, you need to find things to keep busy, so finding serums, crafting mats and/or recipes to make them keep me busy.
---
I wouldn't have been willing to invest the Charisma points early on to try and keep mutations.
---
LOL  Nice, I would have confused it for a furry pile or something.
---
Unpopular Opinion: scrap PvP from this game entirely. It’s not very good, or interesting. I wish I didn’t feel that way about it, but it just isn’t very good. I love having a PvP element in games, but it’s just bad here, like indie game bad.
---
Insects, yes absolutely. But it works with other creatures.
---
I haven't done it in awhile but I've wasted so much plastic since launch because of it.
---
If Joe doesn't want to be bothered why don't they just play adventure mode?
---
A good friend.....
---
10 steel is too much steel.
---
You guys really hate group content. I have no doubt this sub is going to be seething when raids get announced.
---
So why do people here often say the Tesla rifle is way too powerful in PVP. Since everyone pvping is dressed in the best armors on the market, all energy guns should be useless right?
---
"Uranium Fever"
---
How RAD-I-COOL
---
I like the one that the Houston Rockets mascot uses in that commercial. The mini-gun lol.
---
I would brag and be overly excited. I love Bethesda still. They made a few mistakes but look at other publishers. Ea was forably taught a lesson. Activision just made BO4 pay to win and locked new guns in crates only. 
---
Bethesda really isn't so bad. People just wanted this to be Fallout 5.
---
Well, fair enough if that's your style of play. But. This is a replicatable issue that's causing the event to fail continually. And one of my fire team was going to town w/o VATS and getting nowhere either.
---
Yup, you gotta carry both. I have SS knuckles and a vampires Moleminer with SS for those destined battle times.
---
The scorchbeasts guano piles have better rewards.
---
It's actually not a very good explanation thread tbh. I didn't upvote. (I didn't downvote either, guy is trying, which is something).
---
I think you just summed up why FO76 is an underated game and why the community is so loyal
---
They're definitely worth it. Not for a melee build who does ranged on the side, but literally every other properly built ranged build. Recently switched to a heavy gun build, I can take 3 down give or take without even burning a full plasma core. That's free ultracite for serum crafting.
---
You're at endgame, there isn't much left to the game man, aside from new events. No enemy is "worth" it anymore. Not Behemoths, not Mirelurk Queens, not even the Sheepsquatch.
---
Yeah my excavator armor went up by 100 carrying weight.
---
&gt; If you are on PC I'll gladly show how you can rock in PvP without stealthboys, assassin sentinel armor 
---
Hey man, I think I might like to take you up on that. I'll read through your link first. 👍
---
IGN=The_zimmers
---
Ohhhh cool. Thanks.
---
I have it unlocked... it's there
---
Coffee fortune teller shop?
---
It's happened to me on a handful of occasions. Usually after I'm killed and respawn lol
---
Omg, it is now!
---
I still kill them for the slight chance of an ultracite plan of somekind.
---
The exploration is awesome in 76. That's why I like it. I get lost for an hour at a time rebuilding my house to look better. It's an easy game to get lost in.  Best part is it keeps getting better. People are really missing out for no reason.
---
I don’t personally use them but I know people like to chain criticals with them. Each pellet counts as a separate bullet so if you land all 8 on your target you’ll instantly fill your critical meter. Rinse and repeat
---
50 caps maybe? I know some people would be willing to pay a lot just to get the possum challenge done, but realistically it's not in very high demand
---
He’s in caution as well so he’s getting sneak multipliers of up to 350%
---
The only mod I'm running on PC is the 'holo HUD no-glass'. It removes the vignette around the edges of the screen. It removes the shit around the borders of the screen. It's still apparent you're in PA, but it's not nearly as annoying.
---
I thought it was hilarious that in the last weekly stream the devs did a give away of a NYLON BAG
---
Yeah, something's up. And then any other creature showing up gets blown tfu, and the Queen is thumbing her nose. I'm over it in a big way.
---
Sometimes if you FT inside the radiation bubble rads won't trigger. It happened to me when my camp loaded into a nuke zone, I thought it was awesome until I happened to walk out of the red ring and almost immediately died(was lvl7 at the time). I think for the most part as long as you stay in the zone, the game "forgets" to add rad damage to you.
---
i have edit the post according to the comment, hope it is much better
---
Are you on now and do you use discord?
---
Your description of player response is accurate.
---
Those loyal to the franchise see the tremendous creativity, and like the different way of playing what is largely still familiar as a Fallout game.
---
But the complete and utter disregard for attention to detail diminishes a loved universe that used to be seen as having been made by people who love that universe as much as we do.  Now .... it looks like a hastily scrapped together product, by people who are far more focussed on other things, even if a few of them still do love the universe a little bit.
---
People want to pvp and have organic encounters in survival mode. Not be targeted and hunted by DUPER"X" becauae he killed a bunch of NPC's. Dont you get it?
---
Joe wants to hear in the distance someone fighting a scortchbeast and possibly assist or kill that person. He wants to say in area chat something like "hey are you a friend or a foe?" and get some cool interaction if they replied like a stand off. 
---
Joe wants to linger around keeping low while he does his normal adventure mode arrands with the possibility that another player and him meet. 
---
Nobody wants BE laser rifle Tools woth pre-popped stealth boys that can run straight to your position and take you out just because you have high survival score. Its just a bad system to encourage nothing but griefing anyone with survival score.
---
Yeah there either making changes or something is going haywire
---
People want to pvp and have organic encounters in survival mode? Not be targeted and hunted by DUPER"X" becauae he killed a bunch of NPC's. Dont you get it?
---
Its gonna get NUKED
---
Wait... how is anyone going to learn? Sure, I may not be a PvP maven, but if i want to get to be one i have to learn from those that are...and yeah, they may mean getting my ass handed to me some. That's called experience
---
 A question. I can melt a ghoul horde with my knives. I can sit there, crouched with Chameleon in the corner, doorway, etc I do pick a good place, and just stab away at whatever my 40% speed knives do, maybe 3 a sec. They melt on that and I can just destroy very many of them. Pile em' up at my feet and loot em' when its over.
---
 How would that work in VATS?
---
Wasn't this how it launched? I could swear that the bulk junk scrapping was a bug introduced with some update in early 2019. May have even gotten fixed and broken again. I can't remember for sure, too many bugs have followed that path to be certain at this point
---
Live in and around whitespring. Less than one full run will level you up. Use the weapons you picked up as you go. Don’t be stingy with ammo, pick up materials and craft when needed. From 5-15 is the hardest, after that it gets better and easier quickly.
---
I’ve seen people selling them for 1k - one of my friends bought them for that price for the possum challenges
---
(helped) killed my first one yesterday at a random camp. Got a prime railway receiver... No clue if that's good or not. I'm new to the game obviously and just having fun experiencing the content casually
---
apparently yes, there are some new missions to be an overseer of some vault in the audio files. you need to defeat people in deathmatch with a team and solo something like that.
---
tl;dr "I don't want a thing, so nobody wants a thing, and i am totally under the impression that i'm being forced to play a mode (that hasn't even been confirmed) i don't want to play and i'm so mad about it."
---
I'm not criticising you .... I haven't said a thing about how you play the game.  I don't know how you play the game ... only how the vast majority of level 300-4?? players  on survival seem to play it.
---
Yeah they fixed an issue with auto scrapping causing your mods to be scrapped. With that fix is introduced this issue.
---
I would think something in that area too. I totally forgot to factor in adrenaline haha.
---
Very frustrating. An obvious bug. I only have four left and it tells me I have maximum number allowed (10?).
---
I'll be on in about an hour and I've got discord installed, but I've never used it. From looking at your document, I'd lean towards "interceptor", I already have the weapons and mutations and some of the armor...it would seem to suit my natural play style. 👍😁
---
I bought about 150 Stimpak Diffusers from one player vendor (can't remember who), still going through them (have about 50 or so left?). See if you can find one from another player vendor.
---
Well I can give you 1k caps for it.
---
Rule #1 In Fallout 76, NEVER EVER EVER open trade with random people, EVER, there have been countless glitches and exploits that allow people to just steal your inventory, a lot of these exploits are still in game today.
---
 Don't you get one from the one on Deathclaw Island? He's pretty easy.
---
I like QuestIon
---
That was a bug....Thanks Bethesda
---
I was finally able to get in, I have 2 sausage plans
---
In groups i can see it,  mainly because it chains between enemies for multiple hits. But I have never used one in PvP
---
I would love to have a portable Scorchbeast lure. They‘re already in the game, so why not give us plans (maybe a BOS questline?) to craft them?
---
That's so different to what survival mode actually is. As if anyone would actually ask "friend or foe" and expect to survive.
---
Clearly I don't get it, but neither do you and neither does OP.
---
IMO survival mode is for the griefers you describe, so they don't ruin adventure mode.
---
Best healing food in the game that I have found, and the exp-to-effort ratio is great as well. You can start taking them down in your 30's with good equipment.
---
Its useless if not played in a team tho. It needs external set of eyes to shine.
---
Sentinel armor. If they have a full set and aren’t moving they get tons of damage resistance
---
The game has it. Shotgun and enforcer. SBQ is a lot less responsive to it, but the rest of them drop after a couple of wing shots.
---
Name 5 AAA games that are worse then Anthem. Not just worse at release mind you.
---
I don’t need to do this much math to tell you the purveyor sucks, only gives out garbage, and is yet another lame addition that does nothing but keep players in the same bullshit repetitive grind that now defines this game. This was the last straw for me. I’m done with this unfinished piece of shit that makes up for it’s lack of development, and broken economy by handicapping anything useful, overpowering enemies ,and recycling parts of it’s empty as fuck world map with (cannot stress this enough) the same generic as fuck grind over, and over again. This is a game for people with nothing else to fucking do but walk around collecting garbage, and wasting ammo on bullet sponges. Unless you’re to devote your life to coming up with a half decent build that will get nerfed as soon as you rub a couple of bitch noobs the wrong way.
---
unpopular opinion: don't ask to remove a game mode that you don't like, let people enjoy that and more new modes
---
Haha
---
Not worth the cost
---
Any chance you're on ps4?
---
Are you sure everyone on your team had pacifist on? It only takes one to have it off and puts the whole team into PvP.
---
And the only use of Unyielding + high radiations is to have fine prices at the vendors right?
---
Still looking? I know where it is
---
I’ve never seen them drop from actual deathclaws. Unless it’s RNG... I’ve killed a lot of them at all levels... still haven’t seen one except in a green footlocker...lol
---
Which ones are that? Also how much would you charge/do you need anything ingame?
---
Can always do without speed demon. Gonna try no mutations with the faster movement perk in charisma, I think it’s capped at 20% anyways
---
I’ve never seen that plan and I’ve completed the event many many times
---
If somebody is aggro to you, then they can destroy your camp in adventure mode.
---
I've managed to play that event once and it was crazy fun, I used to be a Grognak the Barbarian build so it was like a comic book come to life, me fighting at least a total of 20 DC' s about 5 at a single time, so awsome and so much exp, I wish there were more moments like that.
---
What's the cheat?
---
Using duped legacy laser weapons? Or being able to kill someone using duped legacy laser weapons?
---
Im glad I'm at a point where I can just run away till I loose aggro. If i get them at a workshop defense I just leave the workshop now lol
---
I think I have like 600+ screws now. Scrounging for them for the excavator armor was awful.
---
Sure but 2x 24 shots by 2 persons of which 2 normally are enough to kill someone in X01 seem pretty much too hard to believe
---
I forgot to mention, he was in PA so no Sentinel
---
Nuclear winter isn't battle royale. Nuclear winter is the name for the SEASON of content. Battle royale is one part of nuclear winter.
---
Did you guys not even read the roadmap?
---
Makes sense...which probably explains my current mediocre success.  I'm open to changing that up. I've got 25+ levels banked to rearrange what I may need. The only one that doesn't really appeal to me is a bloody build, I just don't have the temperament to be a glass cannon! 
---
I've mainly played solo up until now, but with what looks like  TDM and/or BR coming, I may need to expand my horizons. I don't care to ignore a large portion of the game...and the hunt feels like it would be satisfying.
---
i totally agree survival would be awesome without the leaderboard and reveal location i had some real adrenaline kicks when i encountered another player in the big tunnel the map is big enough too encounter no one for a long time hopefully nuclear winter ads this too the game.
---
oh an if a nuke is fired you shouldnt be able too see were it hits
---
Accusing someone to cheat is pretty poor, go cry somewhere else loser
---
Have the people actually received their canvas bags yet? Last I looked they hadn’t.
---
Hmm. I don’t know dude. If not sentinel then I have no clue
---
They don’t drop from deathclaws , you can get them from gulpers, containers, blood bags, scorchbeast guano piles  and junk piles
---
Sentinel does not work while crouched
---
Just because survival mode is what it is now doesnt mean it cant change. Your like stating a recipe cant change because its always been. 
---
Also area chat interactions like that could happen. They happen in games like Rust, Ark Survivial and many other games with kill on sight PVP. People make the experience. Obviously your not gonna run up to the guy and emote like a dumbass. your gonna see his red dot and call him out and see if he replies. If not you kill him and move on. If he does reply you can have some fun raider-esk roleplay before you kill him. 
---
You must have a limited experience with pvp genres to understand where im coming from.
---
What's your weapon/armour/mutations setup?
---
No they do not drop from deathclaws
---
I think they are more viable now they are more widespread thanks to player vendors.
---
better ;)
---
You don't have to scrap all PVP. Just scrap Adventure Mode PVP.
---
Very nice.  What is that between the stuffed rabbit and the succulent on the ammo crate?
---
Or he could give it the Oprah treatment..
---
You get a bag! YOU get at bag!
---
EVERYONE GETS A BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGG!!!!!!
---
Never seen that before too, some people are pretty hard to fight but they move and I don't use vats and I pvp alot
---
wat
---
A+++ for you!
---
It's one fucking gamemode in the next season of content. Calm down.
---
Yeah...blocker perk 75% reduced damage from melee gose miles, actually I farmed them to level up my cammando toon combat knife stagger them back
---
Gotta buy them from MODUS in the military wing
---
It is an alarm clock that was temporarily available for free in the atom shop
---
What?
---
You must have your luck stat maxed out, because you'll never stumble upon this random encounter again. 🤣
---
It's really sad the majority of people in game can't use their brain for half a second to use logic like you just did. Like... just stop and wait for 5 seconds to see if it starts attacking anything?
---
LOL....you started a thread about a new cheat because someone somehow survived your attack with 2 extremely rare (duped) weapons........and you get mad at me because I accused someone of cheating?
---
You can't make this shit up.
---
you can even eat some Cranberry relish for extra 10% exp - think this will stack with the well rested bonus
---
**-f76:** there are people nuking regions, herd Brahmin, collecting candy with a mask
---
**-player:** IDC, im doing my own business out there
---
**-f76:** you can also play a br event/mode now!
---
**-player:** HOW DARE THEY!
---
Auto canvas bag launcher 
---
*thunk thunk thunk thunk*
---
I get ya. I just wish concrete walls were a thing. People that want to glitch will always have a way to create an impenetrable fortress, so why not make it easier and look better for the players who don't want to take all that time?
---
Plus I really like the look of concrete.
---
With food weight reduction legendary effects and a fridge mod backpack, carrying them on you so you can actually eat them when needed is more ideal. You don’t need a surplus of stashed food in this game. It’s just not necessary
---
Reactionary outraged people who want to complain.
---
Even if it has a BR. Nuclear winter is not a BR. Nuclear winter is the name for the next season of content. Just like wild appalachia.
---
There is not a plan
---
Because beeing invicible is pretty much a cheat, having a rare weapon not
---
One merely has to look at the sheer number of atoms challenges dailys/weeklies that require pvp modes. Workshop claiming, survival goals and hunter hunted wins. The product managers are clear in their desire to get the player base more pvp oriented.
---
They yammy
---
Amazing idea.
---
I like to take the good with the bad. No point hiding from the truth, good or bad.
---
I'm not saying it can't change, but what would be the point? The people who play survival currently do so because it's PvP focused. What you're describing isn't what they want. What you're describing would be best as a new game mode, but very few people seem to want that. Most people either want to concentrate on pve or PvP, not the hybrid you're describing, and a hybrid is just going to alienate most people just like PvP in adventure did.
---
Anyway, there's no point arguing about it since I can't change anything. Good luck getting the mode you want.
---
Maybe he just has better fallout 76 PvP skills (duped gear) than you.
---
There’s an opportunity cost to continuing to support it, as someone who wishes they enjoyed it but does not, it’s perfectly reasonable to suggest what I did.
---
No for Brutal melee damage. 20% health will give you +15 strength (if you have 5 unyielding pieces equipped) And Radicool give another 6 (?) Strength if you have high radiation. You can easily reach 36 strength with full unyielding and radicool boosts.
---
I also wish they would at least pick up and smash us and smack us around if in power armor, I'd love to laugh at others or save the unlucky people who got grabbed by a DC, I wonder why they took that out of the DCs kit.
---
That's why you can listen to your classical station all you want. Are you just trying to lose Karma?
---
Once you find a good spot start grinding it and scraping everything. You will have all the mods and tons of ammo in no time. Try helivita....
---
10/10 would take rads again
---
Dude can you be jealous somewhere else? It's childish and you're embarassing yourself, gotta report you, read the rules please.
---
So like, if somebody attacks you and you attack them back then their little icon turns red, that means their aggro or aggressive-this means you are currently engaged in PvP with them and their entire team if they have a team. Or if they kill you and you pick revenge then they're also aggro to you. To my knowledge, the only way for somebody to be able to tear your camp up in adventure mode is if you're currently engaged in PvP with that person or their players. 
---
Also, if he was attempting to take the workshop from you, then there's a good chance that will activate PvP as well.
---
I put all of mine between 25 and 50 caps. I'm only level 31 but during earlier levels i was thrilled to find someone selling cheap plans i didn't have yet. I'd rather sell 10 at 25 than none at 100
---
__If somebody is aggro to you, then they can destroy your camp in adventure mode.__
---
I have read about inventory stealing thru trade window, that's why I backed out as soon as I realized what was going on. I messaged the guy and asked him Wtf and all he said was "joke".

Operation health

It's a common raider tactic, start pvp in a public workshop, keep the owner alive while another raider takes out their camp
---
I normally sell off water and chems/stimpacks one day and bulked junk the next.
---
i don't like trump and that doesn't mean i would take my bois and kick his ass from the white house, (also you can't lol) but that's life, dealing with things you don't like, nothing can fit you 100%
---
I think it likely is and we shouldn't set ourselves up for disappointment, but honestly if they include Adventure Mode stuff as well I'll be fine with it and may even try out a Battle Royale mode if it's done well. I hope we see some stuff to look forward to in Wastelanders, if they were to show human NPCs I think everyone would collectively forget about Battle Royale...
---
Marsupial, bird bones, speed demon, and healing factor. With strange in numbers shared on a team, shit is pretty crazy......
---
It's not a normal thing to be honest, I guess curiosity had me for a second lol
---
Balanced.
---
I find SBQ worth it, I find killing the sheepsquatch and imposter worth it, I find killing super mutants at west tek worth it, I find doing arktos worth it. Most of the things I just listed are challenging, fun, and rewarding. Fighting a SB is not any of those. Heck even killing a tick is more rewarding for the bloodpack. Also I personally use a heavy gun as well, specifically a bloodied Gatling gun because its ammo effecient and I don't have to spend time farming lead and steel. Even without perks since I run with mutations and nerd rage I can get up to 300 damage a shot (not that running heavy gun perks is impossible since the damage ones are in strength). Fighting a SB isn't challenging its annoying. Also if "No enemy is "worth" it anymore" how are the regular SB "definitely worth it"?
---
I actually do play survival. The difference is, if you destroy someones base in survival, there is no bounty, no consequences. I miss the days of being able to acquire bounties. But they have done away with that. The only bounty is a 5 caps for picking locks. Its pointless. Also, if I am not mistaken if you were in passive mode, your base was safe.
---
Right. And I should report you for accusing someone of cheating?
---
Maybe he has a full set of leather sentinel armor with pneumatic mods and the grounded mutation to counter the extremely rare explosive energy weapons that everyone is using nowadays.
---
Do both perk cards need to be level  3? I have Animal Friend at 3 and whisperer at lvl 1. I tamed one but didn't get an option to send to my camp
---
They are a joke and Just repeats. Today I launched a nuke at the Queen and got screwed. I fast travel there and the server stopped me from moving or fighting. I lost all my junk. I waited to see if it would have corrected it self, but it didn’t. Bethesda just fix the this game. I think it’s time move on from this game.
---
I hate PVP in this game. Might be ok with my squad, or I might just skip it entirely.
---
Armor : full unyielding with weight reduc and ap refresh and one piece sneak detection
---
Weapon used was the unstoppable monster.
---
Mutations: twisted muscles, talons, herd mentality ( I was solo in this video so I could do more damage) , adrenal reaction, and all the QOL ones. Pretty standard.
---
__And the only use of Unyielding + high radiations is to have fine prices at the vendors right?__
---
RIP. And I'm pretty sure a dataminer showed that all it would take would be to add one flag to all of the bulk junk items, could have easily been hotfixed in one day
---
Also because they randomly appear and seem to know where I am at all times. I'm a level 35 solo player and I'm not equipped to deal with that by myself, I just want some steel.
---
All that makes sense up until you mentioned taking it to your camp. I thought all the pvp aggression was confined just to the workshop area, where it turns all red around the borders.
---
Well do so, we'll be laughing about it, if you would read the comments you could possibly see that he was in PA and no bloodied weapons.
---
It’s free to everyone, that’s pretty fair.
---
That would be great. 
---
A huge 4 player side scrolling beat em up would be great too.
---
Didnt realize there was a buff for that honestly... lol is it worth it?
---
What are you on about? Sounds like you're arguing with yourself.
---
I have a zillion issues with PvP, but here’s the big three, to same time:
---
To play optimally, it requires a bunch of weird perks like Serendipity and Fireproof.
---
Gear isn’t balanced well, and requires an entirely different gear set(the WoW resilience problem of 2006).
---
It’s just kinda clunky. Game wasn’t designed with PvP in mind.
---
I want it to work, I love PvP as an end game, and good PvP can build communities. This PvP isn’t good though. Just make a good PvE game, and maybe do PvP next time.
---
The multiple posts on this sub today about how "bethesda are fucking scum for making battle royale"
---
well, the good thing is that outside of a workshop you almost don't pvp anywhere if you don't want to.
---
Nope. If they're icon is red, they can take you out, take your camp out, take your team out, smack your kids around, steal your girl...all unabated.
---
But I'm really mad they are adding an optional game mode that I don't even have to play....
---
I'm not just talking about eating the food, some items require materials you have to go hunting for and usually you dont want them to go to waste.
---
Just fix the bugs 4head
---
The point of forums like this is to express opinion, that’s mine. And your comparison doesn’t apply because I’m not asking to ignore the rule of law, I’m asking for a video game to go in a direction I prefer.
---
What use are they?
---
Maybe he found a glitch to exploit.
---
I don't think that you have a right to call him a cheater if he did find a way to counter the OP duped weapons that Bethesda removed from the game.
---
did you make a rage post about people raging?? seems illogical.
---
Horrigan's Heroes
---
yeah he's like that raider that didn't want to kill people, what's the point? you know how that group ended jeff
---
Minigun + One Gun Army perk lets you stun lock and cripple the hell out of most enemies. I'll pepper SB's with one til it lands and then melee/unarmed the bat to death.
---
So what’s the best way to avoid this, not seek revenge?
---
Scorched beasts are too easy to kill and there are a ton of them in cranberry. If they made their loot better then people would just camp at fissure zones collecting tons a high value shit.
---
Thanks everyone! It worked.
---
I have 2 fasnacht sausage plans and I'll take an offer, but I'd say somewhere around 300 or more, considering how much time has passed and the limited amount dropped
---
weapons without legendary are usually hardly usable endgame
---
Try player vendors for diffuser. I came across one guy who had diffusers like 50 and priced for sth. like 10 caps, bought 5 of them to leave others buy chance..
---
Lol, yeah super mutants are good about this too. They will just blindly fire in the direction the shot came from. I always take my shots then move to a different location.
---
He wrote, in the very first sentece, that he's not asking about legendaries.
---
but you can't give hug to deathclaws with the bullshit of steal
---
I start by selling tatos from my garden. With green thump each tato harvests two, plus they sell for two caps. Then I sell excess water from my 5 industrial water purifiers. Next bulk any extra junk, after a while you will know what levels to maintain. Plus this helps with weight in stash. If that hasn’t maxed out vendor, I craft and sell marsupial serum, with super duper one often ends up being two.
---
His spirit animal is a barbarian. Rage is all he knows how to do.
---
It will be a mode, you don't have to play it.
---
I remember the first time I fast travelled into a camp where the owner had a pet. I said "oh crap" or something close to that. I didn't know it was a pet until I sighted it in VATS and the name was not in red. I backed down, and he left me alone. Some people are just trigger happy.
---
I learned what you experienced a few times... one player requested the only 2 weapons I had... in like... are they just stupid?? lol
---
For the most part yeah. Or don't take workshops without a team of people to help ya. Or both. Gotta keep then kiddos safe from the smackin's
---
That'd be fucking hilarious
---
Is this on PC or console?
---
Gives MOLEsting a whole new meaning eh?
---
Fuuuuucking hell. I keep telling myself it's OK I don't run a bloodied build but this video isn't helping lol.
---
Serendipity might've procced pretty consistently for them, when I use it, sometimes I'm pretty much invincible and sometimes it never works
---
If you hate the game so much why are you here?
---
That's why my title had a ? and /glitch in it, but you're obviously not really smart and just here to rage because you could'nt get one yourself
---
Pacifist mode on I had to turn mine off to engage in PVP on survival mode
---
Radicool gives 5 max
---
Fair enough, but that’s not the point I was suggesting.
---
Nope we did damage it just never took him below 1hp
---
I saw that T-51b has more physical damage resistance than T-60, but the 60's rad resistance was way higher. I don't know if this is true all the time or not.
---
Xbox
---
Ah yeah. Do we know roughly how much extra %damage is given for each STR point?
---
Lol. Of course there’s really no way to know where your camp is unless you have vending.
---
*laughs in still playing Fallout 4 because Fo76 makes me want to weep*
---
Holy shit....
---
so because you paid 60 bucks or more, is your divine right to ask a company and hundreds of people to stop everything they are doing to please you in particular? because you don't like the direction they are going?
---
This guy was requesting everything, aid (which I have tons of), junk, ammo, he had just started requesting apparel when I backed out.
---
Tell that to the whining masses complaining that they're going to _____ if tomorrow's E3 announcement is a battle royale
---
I just keep a ton of boiled water in my favorites. Makes it easy to top off while I'm traveling.
---
I've got an AAE 25% VATS reduction railway that I could easily trade 5:1 for an explosive laser because dupers would kill to get their hands on it. I'd rather keep my gear though because knowing that nobody else has one is more special.
---
I'm pretty sure it said you had zero because you had them for sale
---
I just want to clarify, they don't have "special" dr while flying, just wonky hitboxes, and the natural distance causes massive ranged weapon fall off, no different from any other enemy at equal distance, just that they engage from over twice the normal distance of other ranged enemies.
---
Ok thanks I’m having a problem with my shotgun it’s breaking so fast any tips?
---
I have one myself lol
---
I thought those were not in the game yet
---
If you can pacify an animal with a perk card, you can tame the random spawn versions with that card. So a megasloth would I believe be under the Wasteland Whisperer.
---
I miss bobbleheads being permanent, but even more i miss having somewhere to display them. I was so happy when i got them all in fo4
---
lul
---
Not a 25% VATS reduction.
---
Enjoy your faster while moving AAE. I already have speed demon so that one is a 2*.
---
What are you, my grandma? Holy Radrats.
---
Yes.
---
Do you still
---
That was happening to me last night left and right. It ended up costing me like 100 caps (I don’t have much in the way of excess caps) in fast travel expenses because I was doing quests up in the Mire.
---
Sure because you know what I got lol, why should I want vats? I can fire all of my 10 shots in automatic mode while in vats without any problems
---
Also pick up all the assault rifles and break them down with scrapper, 600+ steel ever run
---
One of those new features is remaking our character after level 50 with stronger perk cards. That's pretty cool.
---
It's happened to me a few times. I also have the unfortunate luck of spawning under someone's camp as well. I posted and asked that they at least build a stairway to the roof so we can jump.
---
Did you ever think that these death claws should be a joke? These are 25 years old. The deathclaws in New Vegas, Fallout 4 and 3 are 200 years old. 
---
They are much more lethal than the early deathclaws.
---
ok that's everything i wanted to know. G'day
---
But can you do it with a recon scope for improved accuracy like me?
---
Accuracy is a game changer on the railway. That reflex sight of yours is subpar for me.
---
I'm guessing this is what happened. Now I'm not gonna team up to try and get the free FT to the nuke zone.
---
Pointless when in vats, they still hit their target pretty well.
---
I hope that they'll add a quest or something to get more Special points, maybe another 7.
---
Inspect it while it's in your inventory to rename it
---
You need to have the PA Chassis in your inventory  then click whatever button you need to inspect it.
---
Then at the bottom there will be an option to rename the chassis.
---
2 serums, 40 stimpacks or bufftats
---
Plans, rare scrappable weapons and armor also drop. It's part of the farm, getting bad drops.
---
I know!!! How dare they make stuff that's completely optional and won't change my experience?? I'm writing a letter to my congressman!
---
Am i correct in thinking a bloodied build works best when you're low heath?
---
Is anyone here willing to help me kill the scorchbeast queen on playstation? It's the last trophy I need for platinum
---
Yeah, still do not know where they get plans. Maybe archos farma event?
---
Well that is factually incorrect....but feel free to believe it if it makes you feel better.
---
Dump that 2* and get the speed demon mutation so you can get a faster reload along with the movement speed.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that there are aspects of this game that are incredibly annoying.
---
Hey I will be adding you today thanks again man
---
This is a good point. I don't think they can locate it unless you're a vendor. BUT....if you've taken the ammo shop and I'm a blood thirsty raider-esk player...the first place imma look if I wanna wreck your camp is probably up around that cave to the northeast a bit. Or just in the general area around thar particular workshop. Seems like a good guess.
---
Can only agree! 
---
But ofc I see how the permanent buff with all the bobble heads would be harder to implement in an online world. 
---
But the ability to display them again would be nice for the collector, such as myself XD
---
Is all the bugs out of this game yet
---
Have found six of seven dense plans in the last several weeks at different vendors on xbox. Just need raider. Does anyone know if only raider vendors will spawn the raider dense plan?
---
Well I do have that one, dude why are you so ignorant? Mama didn't like ylu huh? And if you think it is incorrect do so, idc about a noobs toughts, your irrelevant
---
People need to calm down.
---
It's Fallout 76. This whole game isn't what many people expected, or wanted. But here we all are playing and enjoying it. 
---
You'd think that people here would be open to something different from what they expect out of Fallout. 
---
People here *should* be open to something different from what they expect out of Fallout.
---
Oh god i can't even describe. Or when you're fighting two, kill one, and another appears. Really?🙄
---
I think the wait-and-see approach is best. Lunchboxes were datamined back in BETA and still haven't turned out to be anything. Campfire Tales turned out to have a very different structure compared to what was datamined before Pioneer Scouts dropped. We will find out what it truly turns out to be soon!
---
still here!
---
[Still waiting on mine lol](https://i.imgur.com/LL4FaLF.png)

#WAT
---
I found marine dense at the watoga train station (not phoenix). Have never found dense on Phoenix.
---
Sh!t. I may never take a workshop again. Lol
---
I'll have to double check..I know for 100% 3 if the 4 did..have to verify the last.  Thanks for the tip!
---
Bunch of stimpacks + first aid piece to his back power armor piece I don't have it but will keep using stimpacks automatically  on him at a certain health
---
Yup. Me and my super sledge are besties. My rifles can drop a vertibot out of the air and that's about it.
---
True but they can't keep up with that huge damage
---
They all should eventually
---
The white springs golf course is a good one, but popular enough you'll have to server hop just to find available space. I'm currently on the border between savage divide and cranberry bog. The cliff areas are pretty flat but there's still the option for building a basement if I want
---
Will pay for them. Dont want plan will buy the 3 needed to just finsh quest. I play on xbox1. Name BADCO1968...
---
Exactly man. You get it! This is exactly how I envisioned survival. Watch videos of Rust.  Where people speak in area chat together to check if the other is friendly or not and might go together against others. Fallout Survival needs to become more organic.
---
Gonna try that probably today. Sick of this garbage and i've got a decent shotgun
---
You've seen camps outside Seneca Rock, you may have even seen them ON Seneca Rock?
---
...but have you seen them INSIDE SENECA ROCK?!
---
True story. Someone had a pretty nice shop inside the crag that you had to access with a sleeping bag. Had plenty of musical instruments for sale. :D
---
A guy just posted a list of bugs as of the latest patch and in it he explained why the Scout armor mods cannot be learned, something about a data type thing wrong or something. I don't remember the technical details but you could scrap a thousand of them and you literally can't learn any of it.
---
I helped someone by getting into knee deep water where there were ghouls and let them go to town on me while my partner was waiting nearby.
---
Hunting people in Survival is the most joy I've had in the entire game. You're out of your mind.
---
So I went into the Bethesda E3 discord last night. Soon as it opened everyone bitching about the game and Todd so much! They have to stop people from posting every now and then there's so much complaining lol. Love it.
---
If only it were PC, I could help. 
---
And I don't understand why people don't run aquaboy/girl. There's so much water around.
---
What we need is someone to design and AI the game code could be run through and mistakes can be corrected. There are a lot of intelligent people that are very knowledgeable when it comes to computer programming that play this game.
---
Just saw your post about the subject and wanted to clarify. I’m not crying that they will add a new game mode. I was only trying to say we don’t know for sure what it even is and there are other possibilities. If it’s a new game mode like we are all suspecting that you can opt out of that’s totally cool with me. Just thought we should accept the possibility that it’s completely different than what everyone is assuming.
---
you probably shouldnt place your camp if you are going to be taking workshops...
---
Yeah well the Toxic Rad Hole store called, they're running out of you!
---
Good for you. I wish I shared your joy.
---
Not unless they choose to do a re- release during next years fasnacht festival, but that'd be almost a year from now and my money would be on them releasing new masks.
---
No sir I am not.  Thank you though.
---
At least you got a stimpack, I don't even waste the ammo on them anymore
---
I have to correct myself, there is one SB I think that is scipted to NOT LAND for like 10 minutes (the one at Mosstown) but all the others so far, land pretty quickly
---
Hahaha. That's just a really popular one is all. That one, posiden, and thunder mountain (these two make fusion cores). You just took a popular one and happened to be in a server with a couple of raiders is all. 
---
What lvl are you?
---
Damn it
---
Ma'am but ok. 🙂
---
Had to be found at one of the random event locations, there are guides on Youtube that show where they are. I have server hopped them like a hundred times and never seen a wolf once though. It's not worth the time it takes honestly.
---
Whatever it is it better include irradiated snow, else I’m throwing my internet toys out of the web pram.
---
How does one enter into this contest?
---
Ohh thats the answer I was wsiting fir, thank you mate, then... I should stop of buying them for scrap, I already have spend l8le 3k on pieces of 20 caps, thank you bethesda lol
---
and thats how you just killed maude flanders, good job todd!
---
It’s been posted here a few times about pacifist mode turning off, read it twice yesterday. 
---
I’d also see if any owned a workshop. All it takes is one player to be off and accidentally hits someone....
---
Yeh it's a strange mechanic consider you could just buy pet wolf's in fallout 4 it should be so much easier....
---
Yea this happens to me a lot. It sucks because dying messes with my unyielding buffs, so I become over encumbered in death which I wasn’t before I died. Then when I respawn (assuming I can), I’m not over encumbered anymore but I’m half way across the map.
---
I don't understand the desire to wreck someone's camp, outside of battle.
---
Serums and marine helmets
---
How is it that some are able to put so much in a camp?  I always seem to run out of budget.
---
Oh, the recipes. Not that interested in the recipes, so 200 is the maximum I'd spend on that.
---
i think its new content.
---
Yeah 200 sounds good
---
Risky click of the day, I'm going to go ahead and avert this time instead of letting my curiosity get the better of me.
---
and then after the show the announce they cant ship people their bags because of a shortage in canvas.
---
Monster mash..
---
Ohh your right its propably just content that was not ready at the start.
---
How is this a rage post? He's making good points. 
---
Is it the fact that he's calling out whining? Or that he calls the outrage stupid? Because there is a lot of whining going on, and the outrage is stupid when you consider that the playerbase is made up of people that put outrage aside to enjoy a fun game. 
---
This post is far from the typical posts and comments that we've been seeing lately, where people are acting like the sky is falling.
---
Looks like somewhere around 1/8 to 1/10 of her health per swing, and she has a little under 33,000 HP. So about 3-4k actual damage after armor
---
Agreed but the issue with making them have good drops is they are easily farmable. Multiple spawn points, dense and fireproof negates their screech dmg, enforcer shotgun their wings and they land and only take afew melee hits to kill only wasting afew shotgun shells
---
I can tell you now that I have more experience that you are incorrect about the purveyor.  After further research I've learned you can weight the drop tables to make the odds of getting a specific item vastly better.
---
But that said it seems you hate the game regardless so I wish you good fortune in the games to come ;)
---
Absolutely!! I think you just said what I was trying to say in a better way. Thanks!
---
I know none of us had workshops and I'm aware of this..but the workshops were changed to flagged only in the immediate area of it.  Had to have been the 4th with no pacifist mode....I really appreciate your input.
---
Care to explain why you are confident about that?
---
Scaly Skin gives 25% energy damage reduction. So def no must with his weapon!
---
Standard reddit. People will get salty even before they have read everything mentioned in the post, which is super childish.
---
Your post is fine tho, and it's clear that you don't want people to change their playstyle. Don't mind the salty bois, let them have their fun.
---
I meant at least moves against humans could be used on scorched and ghouls.
---
No no. The Arms do specifically state that they give you more yield when you have them both equipped, I'm just saying that how the game apparently checks for giving you that additional yield bonus is that it only checks if you have the Excavator torso equipped, and not actually the arms, so the bonus is not even tied to the arms for some reason. It's quite strange that they did it that way in the first place, yet still put that description on the arms.
---
Sounds like the medic pump mod maybe paired with Serendipity, Fireproof, Mysterious Savior. 
---
Unless they’ve changed it—and I don’t think they have—the medic pump will automatically inject a stimpak when you fall below 50% health with no reset timer. It’ll keep going until you’re out of stimpaks. 
---
On top of that, power armor does provide pretty good energy resistance, something many in PvP lack in most cases. Maxed out Fireproof will dramatically reduce explosive damage taken, Serendipity will avoid damage and if all else fails Mysterious Savior could revive them before death. The perks that make stims faster/more effective along with those could help too. 
---
If they combined some or all of those things it would look like what you’re describing—you’re getting them to zero but then your seeing their perks/mods proc. It’s a pretty good counter to explosive energy weapons. Seems a bit extreme in this case, but the medic pump alone basically makes you invincible in PvE as long as you have a pile of stims. Can’t see PvP being dramatically different.
---
Thanks for stopping by and approving my CAMP! Glad to be a member of the HOA!

My camp:

---
Yep, that's that the Bloodied effect does.
---
I CaN tElL nOW... i’ve been playing since launch bitch. Find another way to rationalize forcing yourself to love overpriced shit
---
Bethesda did some shady stuff at the launch of 76, from the canvas bags to the relatively poor state of the game at launch. BUT can’t we just give them credit?
---
Why can’t they just add new stuff without someone complaining. If it’s content that was intended for launch (which is almost definitely isn’t) then who gives a shit. It’s new content. New stuff to do. End of
---
ok maybe rage isnt the best wording but its a post complaining about complaining....
---
At your level you need to carry a few different weapons that use different ammos and alternate between them based on your ammo supply. Once you get to a certain point you'll be crafting all your ammo.
---
Does it matter? Nope.
---
Unyeilding is also useful for rifle an for the luck boost/ crit recharge.
---
If you play a lot of games, you can recognize the markings of content that is early game tutorial/instructional/teaching you where to go.
---
Every game has it .... this game had virtually none once you got to the Overseer's first CAMP .... was that an innovation of "wide open sandbox" play or just content not ready to go?  For me, its pretty clear.
---
Don't be dissing that classical station. I know a lot of those songs. 😂
---
I never quite understood them, they seemed random. It would make sense if creatures like deathclaws could keep their finishers though
---
Honestly some rare plants like stranger bloom (Cause what the heck is there left to eat besides vault dwellers) or some stable flux or even raw fluorescence flux to craft orbital strikes without having to nuke would make it far more worth it. Also buffing the exp rewards from killing them would be a massive bonus. 500 for killing a flying boss like creature that spawns in enemies and carpet bombs you is too pitiful, doubling that would be reasonable.
---
It’s not my post, but I’m level 109. I’ve taken all those you mentioned and have had them taken from me, but never had my camp destroyed at the same time. And never destroyed at all since Bethesda stopped it after player vending started. That’s why I was so incredulous about the poster’s camp being wrecked.
---
Cranberry bog is really flat but some parts are dangerous, there are some flat spots in the east and south of the mire, far south savage divide actually has some surprising flat areas too
---
Hey, I love the classical too. So calming when you're harvesting scrap out of a building that you don't even realize how many ghouls you've slain. 
---
I just figured if he didn't like bluegrass, he wouldn't like classical.
---
Yeah, me too, if you want to remove a specific one it's a crapshoot though. It works ok the way it is now, I'm just putting the idea out though, as this would be a better method.
---
Yeah, but I don't even think this is complaining about complaining. It's explaining that the complaining is kind of ridiculous by using the information that is available.
---
Oh I'm sorry. Ma'am.
---
The only thing I'm forcing myself to love is you, you cuddly lovable /r/user, you :)
---
I’ve had a guy request ALL of my fusion cores while I’m standing there in full power armor. Umm... no.
---
I put a couple up for 1k each. Supply and demand my friend
---
Oh, right lol. 
---
Well, idk. Those are the only things I can think of. It may just be that in those instances, nobody had targeted your camp?
---
19% health for ultimate damage because bloodied, adrenal reaction and nerd rage
---
Craft it at a Tinkers bench
---
That’s probably it. I haven’t come close to finishing that one. Not enough players
---
I always sneak past them if i dont want to engage
---
Wait, he lied last year? When did that happen?
---
Actually ... Yes it does.
---
With the revelation earlier this week, seven months late, that Todd Howard knew the game wasn't ready for launch, when he swore backwards and forwards at launch that the product was ready.
---
Yeah ... Integrity does matter.  When consumers stop demanding it of companies, the freedom of the free market begins to break.
---
Being that low would make me nervous!
---
I think its because a large portion of the player base at this point plays alone. Whenever I play I only see 1-3 groups on the map while the rest are loners. I don't think people hate group content, they just don't have the means to experience it with other people.

They’ve said all dlc will be free
---
They did, energy weapons can't have explosive effects anymore, the weapon I have is a legacy weapon.
---
Kill scorched
---
The product was ready, alot of content was all there. So I ask again, does it matter? Nope. We got plenty of content on launch and some mini stuff like this wouldn't have made a huge difference
---
This just points out how retardedly overpowered and unbalanced melee builds can be. Will never see any gun build do that kind of damage without the old bobblehead glitch
---
Not gonna be able to do it today though unfortunately. I'll prob be on tomorrow though
---
Make them 5000 caps a piece...lol
---
Yeah you get the plans for the stimpack difusser Along with the bear claw weapon or plans from the arktos pharma event pretty much no one is doing
---
Yea but you usually don't get that much damage in PVE, it's like 500-600 dps. I have perks for stims too but they will still need a moment to heal you and those guns are faster, I've seen many good builds and I would believe that if only I shot him but that seems pretty hilarious
---
Phew! :)
---
It’s like hardcore. They can one shot me, I can one shot them. Fair.
---
10k damage barely scratches the SBQ queen sometimes, I wonder how many people were there
---
Solveig's Song from Peer Gynt came on while I was slaughtering Scorched the other day with a pole hook. It can be kinda comical, too. A buddy of mine was doing Rose's "Befriend a Deathclaw" quest objective when Infernal Gallop kicked into full gear with the "Can-Can" part.
---
I’d say just him or just a couple people. She’s always tanky af when a bunch of us fight her
---
No worries
---
They did shady stuff.
---
That matters.  It is an indication of what they are as a business.
---
If this content, which is tutorial in nature, not expansionary by any measure of comparison, is being sold as somehow an indication of sincerity, and a means to cover the shady?
---
No ... they shouldn't get "credit" for something they should have done to begin with.  Not sure why you believe they are "entitled" to get credit, if it is something that was completed late, and buggy at that.
---
I don't have every mutation....who needs herbivore?
---
So people are seriously downvoting me because I refuse someone to call me a cheater for having a weapon almost anyone has? People need to learn how to read, I made this post to figure out how this is possible/if that guy was cheating, that's why I set a question mark, I didn't accuse anyone but godmode is something that is pretty much impossible in any game and in 99% of all cases only possible due to cheats or glitches. Please don't react to posts if you lack the ability to get that point
---
I can't believe that this bullshit is on the front page of this subreddit.
---
You want them to get booed? Wtf is wrong with you?
---
Is it possible to take carnivore serum to replace and vice versa? I got the meat one but I ant to eat plants instead
---
Let us not forget survival mode is still in “beta”
---
Maybe we could be getting an announcement of permanent survival servers as well
---
Canvas is actually a very heavy material, and can be fatal if launched at high speeds (not really)
---
Yeah this just takes a ton more work and effort to get to this damage number. No compromises were made in defense.  That’s where the fairness kinda comes in.  The old tse gauss got close to this with no effort at all really.
---
it wasn’t in the game at all since beta. 
---
now it is.  
---
thats how new works.
---
Nothing different here from most online games. The first few months are rocky in any game especially if its a popular one. Its also common for companies to withhold stuff that isnt ready at launch and throw it into the first dlc. Thankfully unlike some companies Bethesda isn't charging us for it. Anyways, the camera, backpack, anything they add that wasn't included in launch is "New content"
---
coercion and collusion have broken the free market.  
---
stop being a shill.
---
I don’t understand how people could even *want* a PVP mode in a game with this much latency. If I want to pvp, I’ll play a game that does it well.
---
Thanks for doing this, great reading.
---
I'm surprised free range is so unpopular given it's a new high level enemy with guaranteed legendary drops.
---
The content at launch was unilaterally criticized by everyone, as empty and insufficient.  So your statement of "plenty" is revisionist at best, out and out fabrication at worst ...
---
Bethesda (Todd Howard) has acknowledged that criticism at launch was "well deserved".
---
And the mini stuff like "Backpacks" that have been described as "game changing" did make a HUGE difference, as did adding content to an empty game.  ....
---
have you ever played an online multiplayer game before?
---
They also said "canvas" bags and that the game was ready at launch ... both of which they have both acknowledged were false statements.
---
Todd is clearly speaking of the bugs, and regardless that just sounds better so that's amazing he knows how good the future is
---
A lot of games do this because they create content for all levels not just end game.
---
Keep checking vendors I've seen quite a few different types of masks being sold.
---
The PvP is fuckin trash and I avoid it like the plague. I haven't even gotten 20 kills yet.
---
For comparison I love the PvP in Dark Souls games and I play all manner of PvP there in from invading, ganking, covenants, arenas, fight clubs, trolling, etc. I honestly have a couple thousand kills at least, which doesn't come easy for that kind of game.
---
To get over 2k you’d need to mine more like 700 ore. The number of ore spots and how much you get per fluctuates, but it doesn’t double.
---
I feel like there should be a high level quest to obtain a lightweight gun to make scorched beasts (queen excluded) stay on the ground (similar to the dragon rend shout in skyrim) rewards aside it is utterly obnoxious when they spend 6 minutes in the air screaming their sonic attack making me go through stimpacks and breaking my armor, just so that when it finally lands it gets killed within 30 seconds. even if it's not a firearm but a single-use syringer or something (quest could be repeatable) it would make the fights more casual
---
I can imagine it now.  He'd probably shoot out a piece of canvas sheet or a just a picture of a canvas bag. DuE tO MaTeRiAl CoSts
---
This game came out with End Game content but nothing tutorial.  Tutorial content, by definition is intended at game start.  No one adds tutorial content after players have been playing for six months. ... unless it is for a NEW area that needs new tutorials.
---
Plus we have the next update which will be combat focused
---
Your entire argument is based around the fact that the new stuff is “tutorialy”. So every single piece of new content must be aimed for players lvl 100+??
---
This whole post is useless as you have no proof that this content is delayed. 
---
As for Bethesda doing shady stuff and not deserving forgiveness, that’s a really narrow minded way of thinking. Once star field comes out, or elder scrolls, or Fallout 5, are you gonna sit there and say “No, I refuse to buy this game because of that thing they did a few years ago with the canvas bags”
---
It’s extremely clear that Bethesda are trying their hardest to clean up the (let’s face it) mess of a launch of 76, and they’re doing a great job. Let them be. Not everything they do is shady lmao
---
Campfire tales spawns when someone goes to camp Adams at night, just stop by every time it gets dark. I've been grinding that one out to get ant meat myself. I've done it atleast 20 times now and got 3 badges from it so expect a good amount of grind.
---
Wait until you learn about the Engineer costume.....
---
I have no idea who is downvoting you, this is actually a pretty clever use for unyielding armor lol. 
---
But the main purpose is for combat effectiveness on bloody builds.
---
All content released so far was already finished before the game was released.  There has been no evidence of active development on Fallout 76 since launch.  Bethesda has pulled their programmers to work on other games.
---
Changing perks to fight a non legendary monster is not a solution.
---
Radiation is the hot new trend nowadays
---
 Yeah I saw that. Never the Combat Dense though.
---
If they add battle royal they need to make it balanced by not letting us used the weapons we already have, maybe have a display board of normal weapons, they we can choose from, because if current weapons are allowed we all know who is going to win most of the time
---
Omg, thanks for taking me back to when that happened.
---
I don't know what to do with all the extra crap after I max out in the first 30-45 minutes of every 20 hrs.
---
The product was clearly not ready.  Did you play the same Fallout 76 on launch like the rest of us?
---
Sounds like that future is focussed on Science Fiction and a new project.  One small studio of four focussed partially on FO76, while splitting time on  the bigger future title that 75% of the company is working on, and even then, that small studio may be tasked 100% to that bigger project at any point.  Yeah the future is good for Todd Howard.
---
And the worst part about it all... they made dlc for free. It just sickens me
---
Even if the launch was only hampered by "bugs", that means the game wasn't ready... so...
---
Yes - many items have come back - such as the black bird paints, .44 gold paints, the bomber jacket etc
---
It did but on Thursday I was able to use them
---
Why bother?  At Charisma 25 vendor prices adjustments are capped. 
---
Grape Mentats is +5
---
Hard Bargain 3 is +9
---
Mothman Omelets is +2
---
Just run with a base of Charisma 9, or even less if you have Lined Military Fatigues or other Charisma boosting gear. 
---
I run Charisma 9 so I can share up to a rank 3 card.
---
Only explanation I can think of, outside of a bug.
---
That was Todd Howard's argument ... that this is somehow common or industry practice for ALL online games.  I'm not sure how true that is ... somehow I doubt that it is as common as Howard claimed or there wouldn't be as many articles online criticizing him for having made that claim.
---
Bugs don't mean anything, as long as the content is there for it to be a complete product
---
“Is Todd Howard’s hair really brown, OR ARE THEY LYING ABOUT THAT, TOO?!”
---
What don't you understand by survival rules before joining, the whole point of survival mode is passive mode doesn't work and any person you see you kill on site
---
I wouldn't really call it fairness, still. Many people including myself do min/max with ballistic builds and you don't see this type of damage done. However, I haven't faced the SBQ with a small group of people recently so I don't know how well I could damage her. 
---
Did you test your build on a sheepsquatch? I'm curious. It seems like you could kill one in just a few swings
---
It was, did you not see the content on launch?
---
Northeast of the Mire region, right below Thunder Mountain Power Plant!
---
Yes they do because everything scales up to end game save the photos. But even then the photo quest isn't needed to be finished to use camera. 
---
They all allow players regardless of level to participate in it with higher level players able to do more and get more reward.
---
A level 10 backpack doesn't have the same carry capacity as a level 50 one.
---
One of the atomic challenges for tadpole badge is literally launch a nuke something you won't be doing till near end game unless you got a lot of high level friends to help you out.
---
It doesn't all feel introductory to me, but it absolutely seems like stuff that should have been in the game from day one. Whether or not it was retrofitted to be DLC we can't know, but based on some shitty business practices like pricing atom shop items as "marked down" when they'd never even been released before, releasing the game as an unfinished mess but charging full price... It wouldn't surprise me. The outdated engine and sheer amount of asset flipping is proof enough this was done as cheap and quick as possible.
---
Fingers crossed there's only 2 items I want atm.
---
That mask
---
And the monster mask
---
And I can't have either QQ
---
For those that do not know, Bethesda is a for-profit company.  There is no executive in the world that will spend a lot of money to fix a badly launched game.  Why?  Because if they fix the game, that will not generate new revenue.
---
That's even worse because you can't drop them but those are easily accessible with real money. $$$
---
I am sure they’ll recirculate
---
That's not how balancing works. :P
---
Well idk then, I always only sell junk that I'm not going to need, so the junk I will need is in my stash and usable
---
NSFW tag. Hahaha
---
The Free Market is precisely "Free" because the Consumer is the one with the power ... until that consumer either gives that power away, or has it taken from them.
---
Not questioning companies for questionable things is just irresponsible.  A free market needs responsible to ensure quality.
---
Hm he repeated it several times, his weapons must be either bugged or JE with all addctions or something else I guess, never died that fast except on bloodied builds
---
Yea? But I didn't buy it with real money nor will I sell it for real money. To me it's a collectors item that I will never get rid of. Explosive energy weapons aren't that bad, they don't make everyone god tier, you can make anyone god tier. It's all in the cards and the build. I don't think explosives should be removed from energy weapons that already exist
---
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but Bethesda will not spend money to fix Fallout 76, nor create new content not already planned in the road-map.  Fixing Fallout 76 would be expensive and fixing it will not generate new income.
---
Hopefully it's not a BR mode but if it is then it seems like a waste of time and effort. I doubt someone is going to hear about Fallout76's new battle royal mode and go buy the game just for that. They are more likely to get new players if they fix the game they have instead of adding a new mode that other games do way better.
---
Bethesda needs to stop following trends and do their own thing again.
---
I play survival a lot. It isn't as good, you actually make more caps in adventure mode than in survival. They nerfed the caps, the amount od aid and loot you drop, you can't set bounties anymore. So no, there isn't much consequences anywhere in the game. You want to play as a Raider, you can't. They say that we are supposed to be the "NPCs" and create our own style of play, but then a bunch of snowflakes complain and there goes the bad guy role. What, we are just supposed to hold hands and trot through Appalachia being bffs?
---
By that logic most of the deathclaws in 76 should be able to talk
---
No... I understood that in survival people who see me kill me on site. What I'm saying is, I put pacifist on in Adventure mode. When I tried attacking someone in Survival mode, I received the message about "cannot do damage because pacifist mode enabled". My gripe is pacifist mode (even if I have it on in adventure) should be ignored in Survival, and it wasn't (or didn't appear to be).
---
Don't run at the highest resolution.
---
There was a group arguing that Heavy Guns were the highest DPS in the entire game the other day.....
---
You could get kind of close if you burned up a few thousand rounds of .50/5mm while in PA and never missing a shot.
---
Because creating new content costs money, and they will produce no new content other than what is planned in the road-map.
---
I've played many games over the last few years.   None of the highly rated titles added content by way of DLC that wasn't entirely NEW.  Most add patches for unforeseeable glitches .... but not DLC additions that aren't additional but foundational.  The content here, in question, is foundational.
---
Yup my go to for lead, i just farm west tek for steel.. one run through toss on scrapper scrap all weapons pull about 5-600 steel/xp/bunch of caps/gunpowder.. 2 runs westtek and one lucky hole mine run a week and im set of 556 and 45.. currently sitting on like 6k of each.
---
New Vegas was the best for them. In that quarry area. Such fun to snipe then then be like oh shit here they come!
---
The camera mode was the only way to remove HUD for a cleaner shot. Definately fun to use sometimes. Thanks for checking out the home!
---
Correcting people != raging
---
The wing pieces should scrap down into ballistic fiber like the mothman wings.
---
Most ive pulled in one trip has been 450 ore.  Usully average about 300 ore.
---
Would be fun to be able to trade with one. 
---
Here him talk like "I'll cut you like butter if you try anything!"
---
but free market isnt truly free.  laws impact it.   youre talking about a just market, which is a fantasy this day in age.
---
Hi i had this problem are you in power armor? Sounds daft but take it off then go down lift into silo should work, then bang ya power armor back on👍👍👍👍👍 let me know if works as it did for me
---
We need a dummy that shows DPS when they add the damage numbers.
---
There are so many videos of SBQ and it's wildly inconsistent to "prove" a build on her.
---
I think that is a perfect level of decoration for a homely lived in feeling
---
The way game companies work is they produce all the content at once.  Then they shovel out part of it over time as "new content".  This way they can take the development team and work on the next game.  Other than bug fixed, absolutely no more Fallout 76 development will be completed.
---
He can hear you. They’re bats, they use sonar to hear where things are, including you crouched in cover
---
Slam as many drugs as possble and fight till you bleed out
---
Unless it wasn't NEW.  Imagine buying an automobile as a whole, and the one that arrived on order at the dealership arrived without seats or any hoses in the engine ... if the dealership added those things six months later, would you still be as happy with them?
---
HAHAHAHA
---
i played WOW through three various expansions.  
---
each one spoon fed me info as if i was a day one player.   
---
you know what else they had, bag quests.  and expanded bank(stash) quests.   quests that took me back to where i started to fight higher level enemies.  
---
you know, exactly like this.
---
I assume you tryin to get in silo? if not my bad friend misread
---
Many of the bug fixes should’ve been there at launch, but the game was always planned as an ongoing thing, so having content largely ready to roll out over time should be expected. Saying it wasn’t “Ready” for launch is disingenuous. 
---
The Fallout 3, 4 and New Vegas DLC were all most certainly planned and in development when the core games released. Were they “Content that wasn’t ready?” 
---
It’s an online game that they said would evolve over time with new content and changes based on player feedback. What did you expect, that they would create new content from scratch every two weeks?
---
god just let it go with the canvas bags, sure that was a mess up but they fixed it and it was a issolated event
---
I go for the three star...there is no way I could store all the stuff I would have if I only went two star...I always have max daily scrip already as soon as the timer allows...
---
Except that is NOT what happened. He aggro me at the public workshop, which is normal, you are PvP if you are in that red zone. He attack, I died, I rezz'ed OUTSIDE the red circle, fast traveled to my CAMP to find him destroying my CAMP... and he was not wanted.
---
So I should not have been PvP with him still, AND if he is attacking my CAMP he should have been wanted.
---
Here's hoping for Explosive T51B Wood Left Leg.
---
Whitesprings, the burrows and westek daily.. along with daily quests, events.. you'll level up fast. 
---
They need another double XP weekend. That was a blast to level up..
---
 The game runs well. What's a cyberpower?
---
I didn't see any comments anywhere about it "evolving" over time until the last 4 or so months.  Nothing before launch about "evolution".  I think this is a false claim.
---
Thanks for the thoughts, I'll keep them in mind going forwards.
---
Stop beying a fanboi.  The reason it had an awful launch were the game-breaking bugs, not the "content".  
---
Of course we all want Fallout 76 to prosper, but it won't happen.  I say this with having a background in software development.  Bethesda is a for-profit company, and all AAA game companies make all the content before launch.  That includes the DLC content added later.  It makes no sense, business wise, to keep a development team working on a released game.  It doesn't happen.  The development team moves on to other projects upon launch.
---
You left out the rolling pins I keep getting.
---
Thanks man, absolute legend you've made her day, im trying to explain that at level 12 she wont last long there but shes going still
---
That's the part I'm not understanding.
---
" Also, if he was attempting to take the workshop from you, then there's a good chance that will activate PvP as well. "
---
That's what I thought was correct ONLY in that public workshop area.
---
If that IS the case, then there no point anymore to take a public workshop if that triggers PvP outside of that public workshop.
---
You can not use things in your machines.
---
I mean, no one is forcing you to have mutations. You do you. But to say no one else should be able to play with them is pretty entitled. 
---
I use mutations because I'm here to have fun. You can be super serious, that's great. But after level 100 things get a little stale, and being able to hop around like a weirdo is really fun.
---
Except .. a level 35 Sloth isn't higher level.  Nor were any of the other level 10 - 20 max cannon fodder of the Forest for other NEW content.
---
Was he aggro to you when he was destroying your camp?
---
Then, why did Fallout 76 have an awful launch to the point where most fans quit playing Fallout 76 within the first few weeks?
---
"Game-Breaking Bugs" don't change anything, as long as the content is there. I don't count bugs against any company
---
Also because they never land.
---
I used to do this a long time ago. They work well with Ghoulish, too.
---
Now I mostly shoot myself in the toes with a gamma gun.
---
There is a perk card that gives you extra durability, and you could craft a backup shotgun. Then switch it out.
---
Oh he killed me, one shot... I do click IGNORE when I rez, I just don't like this PvP.
---
Which fanboi down-voted my post?  Reality sucks, huh?
---
I'd add an endangerol syringer to the list. Super helpful.
---
If a person tries to claim a workshop from you it will probably trigger PvP with you regardless of if you are in the circle or not because it is your workshop.
---
If they dont show devotion to those who play this game, those same people may choose not to spend their money on future bethesda content. It would behoove them to spend a little.
---
 Hmm, mine don't miss and I have a supposed handicap with Twisted Muscles.
---
 Now to really understand TS weapons you need a TS Auto Grenade launcher, like me. One goes where you shoot it, the other ... somewhere else, usually less range with the AGL, so I shoot a bit above them. For an actual gun TS is useless.
---
 My new Auto 2*  Handmade is hitting where I point, it very well. 
---
 Now I never ever use VATS so YMMV.
---
Maybe.  But I still think it gets worse when consumers accept that as the best it can be.  Kind of like when voters decide it isn't their fault when bad politicians get elected.  Democracy needs participation to have have semblance of working order.  A Free Market is a pillar of a Democracy.
---
The development team was pulled from Fallout 76 on launch.   All the DLC content was finished before launch.
---
The ONLY development after launch is bug fixes.
---
You want to get to the end game without playing the game?
---
Yeah, that's the part of this that sucks... if I was in survival... I'm all for it. But in Adventure mode, I should be safe outside of that public workshop.
---
Well, again, I give this game a try, and AGAIN I may just leave it behind.
---
Announcing NBA76
---
Clearly.
---
Yeah I just dedcided to put it all up on Thursday hoping to free up some stash space.  I was able to craft things after that.  Logged back in today and it said I had zero screws.  Took them off sale and they were there
---
Make it an option like the Hunter/Hunted radio channel.
---
No I want to know the fastest way on how to get to endgame
---
I think the scoring method is fine as is, just stop highlighting the top 3 players.
---
hell yeah, like in that shattered dreams video. make deathclaws great again!
---
A friend of mine loves fallout and both of us had no interest in the game initially. I decided to try it on a whim in may after I realized it was just fallout but with occasional other people. And that's pretty much how I describe it to others. Its not perfect but I doubt we will ever get another new Vegas so I'll take it.
---
I would love this when we get display racks. We get to display all of them but we also select a main showpeice that we get the effects from.
---
The fastest way is by doing the main story/main quests.
---
I’ve been having the same issue for a while. It’s especially annoying dealing with high level supermutants.
---
And I suspect that was with bugs, not "bugs" like Bethesda's been getting on here.
---
It isn't.  All development, including DLC, was completed before launch.  This is how AAA games are made.  Bethesda then pulled the team to work on other projects.
---
How can Bethesda profit by putting the development team back on a launched game?
---
I agree with this.  Even the part about liking (not love for me) the game.  
---
The Fallout Universe is one I enjoy.
---
Yeah, I’m saying these features weren’t INTENDED for launch, and OP is saying it was. 
---
I’m not disagreeing with the fact that they developed this stuff before launch, I’m saying it wasn’t their intention to add it at launch
---
SMGs are not pistols, they are rifles. You must use perception perks to increase its damage.
---
Guerilla is for automatic pistols.
---
I recommend a pipe revolver with a rifle stock.
---
We all are, dear.
---
Has the battle royale been confirmed? Can anyone link me to something that proves as much?
---
Find someone on your platform that is higher level than you.
---
Team up with them. 
---
Find higher level enemies. 
---
Hit enemy once. 
---
Let your high level friend kill the enemy. 
---
Be sure to use the Inspirational card and keep Well Rested buff on and use exp buff food if you can.
---
While that's true to a point, it's also true that developing something that you don't play takes resources away from developing something that you will play.
---
Endgame with a lot of sneak, a good weapon, and some luck, and I can kill them sometimes without dying lol
---
about 50 voice lines in the files that heavily imply battle royale.
---
Apparently it isn't clear to some.
---
For low-level players, scorchbeasts are very tough.
---
You can easily get the backpack without launching a Nuke, I never have and have the backpack and 3 separate mods for it (Tadpole tasks) and the Backpack easily levels with you as it costs nothing to make.  
---
It is foundational .. not additional .... and is intended to be acquired with foundational experiences at level 10.
---
If you’re on PS4 I have some I’m not using. You can have it. user mothra04
---
It’s a pc brand they make pcs and stuff
---
Seriously? 😔 I could swear I do more damage with it on 😣
---
There's a raider camp and collapsed monorail car in the cranberry bog. South of Robco.
---
It's a nice set up. Except for the scorchbeasts.
---
I'd recon you'd at least get 3k, maybe up to 12k if you get the right buyer.
---
 Ok. I cannot help you if you have no idea what it is.
---
I don't know.... I don't think this argument adds any real value to whether or not a company has integrity.  Even Howard acknowledged that the faulty launch negatively impacted the reputation of Bethesda and Fallout .. he just believes it will be easily recoverable.
---
Ha ha, I'm glad she's happy! If she manages to build on the middle of the lake (rather than on the shores) then enemies won't spawn and bother her. She can build safely and in peace :)
---
It was absolutely not ready.  
---
1. All of the content was finished before release. 
---
2. Once a game is released, there is NO MORE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT other than fixing bugs.
---
The issue isn't "content".  The issue has been far too many game-breaking bugs mixed with awful game balancing.
---
1833.......just saying my american friends.
---
With my heavy gunner build and two-shot prime gatling gun, I can take them down with only 20 or so ultracite 5mm rounds -- not much ammo IMO.
---
Battle royals are mostly about starting off like a peasant and finding stuff on the ground to become a super ultimate badass peasant, and use your squeaky voice to show dominance.
---
Yes  .. Howard acknowledged as much in his IGN interview.
---
 I have run it for a long time and I do have a full suit of BoS Heavy Combat over it, but I never seen it clip into my T Shirt and Slacks, I have worn for maybe 100 levels.
---
Even sweeter! Thanks man!
---
Found YongYea alternate account.
---
I don’t put the effort, ie foods and chems in when fighting anything else big I just roll with it or else I would one shot everything except for the queen.  Call me crazy but that isn’t too much fun, and also isn’t fair for others trying to get loot too.  They over nerfed the tse’s for sure!  I don’t think I can get over 1000 on any of my bloodied rifles (I’m only lightly speced for rifles for QOL) I would love to see the two shot modifier get brought back up for you guys.  I was a straight rifle build before that tse nerf.  So I totally get where you are coming from. That’s why I went the whole unarmed melee build.  Maybe with this new perks gossip going around there will be something to buff you guys.  Maybe bring vats crit up to compensate. I’ve heard the whole vats crit build is really viable too.
---
I think you can get them from drops. I had one in my inventory a few weeks ago -- don't know how I got it, but it definitely wasn't a purchase.
---
If your playing solo and want to level up before doing the main story the fastest way is to head to Charleston junk yard and capture it. Then follow up with the Poseidon energy plant and wade airport. After capturing the workshop you will want to defend them. This is where all the exp comes from.  If those three workshops don’t keep you busy with defense missions. You can venture further up and clear out new gad and claim the workshop near it. There is also a junk yard east of vault 76 that you can claim. The whole goal is to always have a defense mission to do. I recommend going melee as it’s the easiest because you don’t need to craft ammo.  Also there is an event in Morgantown called feed the people. It rewards cans of stew that grant a bonus 5% exp for one hour. All events are worth doing as they give exp and caps for completing them.
---
Idk man, even when using Single projectile weapons it feels like they have some kind of built in damage mitigation (which the Queen Does, but its only 30%)
---
They should give serum plans now that they are common in vending machines.
---
Are you reading the same thread I am?
---
I use grape mentats and my build has 2 CHR. I think that's would justify bothering with a unyielding set.
---
This is one of the best shotguns in the game, don’t scrip it lol.
---
The battle is much easier if you hit them first with a power attack.
---
I have a cyberpower (one of the higher end models [dont trust myself to build lol]) but can play on max everything with no lag. My opinion would be to lower everything by a little till you get a satisfied result. Itll suck having to restart the game so much but itll be worth it imo.
---
How much should I sell it for
---
It is that kind of reasoning that allows game companies to push out unfinished products.
---
You know...this is crazy...but get this...you don't have to play the battle royale mode.
---
OK, I tested this whole theory out. I had my son join my server. I took a public workshop (not the ammo factory, some crappy one). I had him come in a kill me and start the take over process. I selected Ignore, like I normally do, and I rezzed outside the red circle. I had him stay in the red circle area and I was outside, and he could NOT damage me anymore...
---
SO... I had him fast travel to my CAMP and when he attacked it, he was then WANTED... just the way I thought it would work.
---
SO... my guess on this is based on some of the comments. Dude aggro'ed me in the public workshop and he was in a team with others. While he started that with me... they started destroying my CAMP, he fast travels (quick load since I'm so close) and no one ends up WANTED.
---
Kind of crappy that something like that can work in Adventure mode. I get the whole Raider thing, but if it's based around the public workshop, it should only be there. Especially if you do NOT attack back ever, and select Ignore when rezz'ing AND... I have passive mode turned on.
---
Bethesda, just fix PvP, or have PvP only servers and keep any PvP within the public workshops. Or better yet, give us factories we can build ourselves like in Fallout 4 and make it expensive or temporary so we can collect mats or ammo, without running all over hell... eh, maybe that just too easy... \*shruggs\*
---
&gt;unfinished
---
&gt;has all the content it needs for a AAA game
---
Yeah ok lol
---
&gt;  and our data set is now a skinny 2.7MB 
---
Can you share that JSON file with us?
---
And if you ever need help developing a web based interactive map, I would be happy to help if I can. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and C# (I've been working with Js for about 2-3 years and I'm quite new to C#).
---
If you can't even play the game, then what does it matter the content?
---
The silencers aren't silent. Your enemy can tell the general area you're firing from. Escape Artist helps a lot, as moving while stealthed doesn't create any extra noise, so you can move and fire and stay hidden.
---
I know what a cyber power pc is I have one I just need to know what settings are good for fo76
---
this is happening to me but only with explosive weapons. still happens even if i remove all the Rifleman perks. and if i restart it goes away but then come back after an hour or so.
---
because it's still there to play just buggy
---
Yup.  They get to a sliver and are immune to damage and heal to half.
---
If by countless you mean zero, because there's never been an exploit that lets someone steal from your inventory.
---
Tutorial includes content that points you where to go next  ... to explore areas that are within your level and capability.   Have you not noticed that ALL games help you play by directing you around?  The content added here does exactly that .... but does not direct you to the Mire ... the hardest area of the game.
---
I dispute your claim that "it is clear"  the Bethesda is "trying their hardest" ... I don't see evidence of "clarity" to intense effort ... 
---
Fallout 5 isn't even in development ... Starfield is years away (if not a decade) .... this is it for Fallout for the next 15-20 years (Howard said that he expects Fallout players to play this title for the next decade at least).
---
 I need to know if its an AMD or Intel processor. I need to know what your GPU is before I can offer useful advice.
---
WV Lumber Co., far northwest corner of the forest region. .308 city
---
Maybe he can just shit one out slowly instead
---
Tdm and DM sound awesome they just need balancing on weapons. Loved the division but wasn't fun unless you ran meta. I like something I can hop right in and enjoy! If they announce br  fuck it could be cool in the fallout universe.
---
This is my favorite gun in the entire game.  Don’t settle for less than 7-10k if you sell it.
---
 Go to the Northwest corner and farm the Lumber Yard. Just what you need, and some starter shotguns too.
---
Most likely 5 star Weapons too
---
What does the first part of my previous sentence mean?  Are you even trying to comprehend what we are saying? 
---
This feels like a political argument where one side ignores what the other side is saying and just repeats their one point of view with now reasoning behind it.
---
Think they call them trolls. The surf the internet for arguments and other angry people.
---
Na.. Im not a min maxer. Still can wipe ppl out in pvp... And that is the only reason to min max.
---
L.o.L.  I kicked open a hornets nest .... wasn't really expecting the vitriolic responses.
---
Got a link?  I would love to show absolute proof to the fanbois.
---
What do you think they mean when they use the word content?
---
I bought 3 stimpack diffusers from a player vendor, the plan is a drop from the arktos pharma event. I wish they would fix the musician bug as well.
---
jeez 5k cuz they are elusive af omg i hate deathclaw hide objective
---
I don't see what's so complicated? 
---
Content is there, just because I die due to falling through the map doesn't make it not exist anymore
---
Death claws can talk. Every animal can talk. 
---
Vocalization is talking
---
I haven't used scrip for melee yet .... luckily, melee is the only weapon I have that I have gotten decent in game drops for. 
---
Fantastic for a guy that plays "rifle" ... and didn't get a single lever or handmade drop until level 190.  But I have scrapped far more rolling pins than I care to ever see again.
---
It cannot be displayed - if you place it down it will be recalled to your inventory and if you drop it then someone will take it
---
Yeah ig they brought the damage bug back in the last patch
---
Y'all keep saying that, but I know for a *fact* that it's not true because I've watched five of my pets be blown to smithereens by assholes with TSEs since vending (and no, I wasn't PVPing - at least until after they killed my babies and my character suddenly felt hungry). The bullets might not affect them, but the explosion AOE still does.
---
Welp guess I got to work around that. (Good backpacks now exist.)
---
WoW is not a comparable model.  WoW is a subscription based game that generates profit per month per active account.
---
I wish they had a way to upload pictures you have taken on console.  I have a few cool screenshots but have no idea how to share them.
---
No I mean like speaking English. When the enclave genetically engineered the first deathclaws many of them were intelligent and could speak. 
---
Disclaimer: Not a more expert just what I remember from a video I watched a few months ago
---
I felt like I had to include that because I was being so critical, but if anything I'm going easy on the game because I'm still so invested in it. Since the Imposter Sheepsquatch stuff I've been wondering what more real content there was to come. The way we've been doled out anemic FO4 radiant quests makes me think they're not be interested in much aside from looking like they're supporting the game by slowly releasing stuff that's been in the can. Next, anemic PvP/battle royale content requiring very little quest work... When the fuck is a vault dungeon going to happen again?
---
when you place the frame from your inventory no one else can take it but it’ll have a one minute timer and after it runs out it’ll automatically go back to your inventory. if you drop it, it’ll stay as long as you stay on that server but anyone can take it (anything that has atom shop skins will be destroyed, can’t be dropped) so there really isnt a way to display power armor
---
I was selling for 12k but for some reason someone got it for 4k from my machine???? Wtf kind of glitch
---
How the hell one can stay sneaking while beating SBQ in the face?
---
Hate me all you want but I have to disagree... with heavy guns, it takes but a few seconds to take one down. Then again, many people must not run around with their entire arsenal on them. Their rewards don’t seem any more or less useful than any other tanky creatures.
---
I meant one for each cryptid. It isnt NOT in the game if you read post and not just the title.
---
Also the pvp batle royal would clear up survival to be more.. playable w/o terrible people messing w/ you.. damn explosive shotgunz..
---
If you read fully then you would see that the sheepsqautch event isnt at all what I'm talking about.
---
High agility and unyielding. The right perks nothing can see you.
---
Oh i reached my max, cool so that's 8k caps lost forever
---
1. Please stop down-voting everything because you don't have a valid argument.
---
2. There is more to a game than just content.
---
3. Game-breaking bugs are far worse than falling through the map.  Game-breaking bugs are bugs that cause the game to be unplayable, and should have been fixed before launch.
---
Perhaps if you had as much experience in the game industry, you'd understand that being a fanboi helps no one.
---
The conferences are always the weekend before the floor opens.
---
Whoa what?  Are you sure it wasn’t something else they bought?  That seems super weird.
---
Yeah exactly!
---
No I iust reached my caps max. So the game took 8k for themselves
---
 Oh. To be honest the only reason I play video games like this is to fool with my character. I ran Gun Runner for 130 levels on 2 chars before deciding it was in the way.
---
 I started with Doom long ago and my actual skills, although atrophied by my vast age, are still good enough to hit what I'm shooting at. later learning has made me pretty good at melee.
---
 Now I never use VATS, so that makes quite a difference in this game for actual builds I might use.
---
That makes me so mad
---
It's funny, I agree completely and my name is Joe :)
---
I can absorb your hits using my armor and perks. I do it all day. You need to learn the game more. Relying on duped sparkle guns is not enough.
---
Uh huh, except the content in there so I really don't care if I'm "hurting" the game industry or not
---
All these ppl fucking with you. Dont go to ash heap at your lvl.. You'll get rolled. Clear that mine near the overseer camp then head towards Morgantown. You can clear the railyard and then the airport. 
---
All 3 places have scorched that carry pump shotty.
---
Nope not yet anyways. Hopefully in the future we can get the displays like we had in FO4
---
Bugs.
---
Dude you never list something for that much when you’re close to the limit.  ALWAYS transfer caps before selling an item for that much.  Unfortunately that’s your fault 😬
---
Ooo, good idea!
---
I'm hunting bugs, I'm hunting bugs, out here in Appalachia, there are spiders, ants, and slugs!
---
Today, I'm going to complete my collection.  Only 9 more hymenoptera to go.
---
I'm hunting bugs, bugs of all kinds.  Some come out at night, but they're cool at all times!
---
I didn't even know there was a limit 😭😭😭
---
I go to camps and buy the ones i already know, but only if theyre sold at a low price (low relative to how much you can normally buy them for or how rare they are) and then i sell them for a little bit higher price so i can profit.  Im amazed at how many people sell some of the rare plans that normally cost 500+ caps at a station vendor at only 50 caps at their camp vendor.  I wont sell my plans at the same price as a station vendor, but i still sell them pretty high.  If i spend 50 on a plan thats normally worth 500 ill sell it for 250
---
Can you be on XBOX cause I NEED ONE MORE.
---
If I may make a suggestion in how the data is presented?
---
Organize them by descending order of occurrence. It's a little confusing to read a list and have it jump from 30% to 5% to 15% to 2% to 40%
---
Thanks anyway tho
---
When I said it helps no one, that includes everyone outside of the game industry as well.
---
you are talking about the same people that think Elvis, Hitler and Jim Morison are still alive living in a secret base under the flat earth
---
Put on green thumb and harvest the crops at silva farm and billings homestead.
---
I've halfway turned adventure mode into a tower (camp) defense game by building right next to Safe n Clean Disposal. Nonstop level 60 super mutants being rained down on by 5 missile turrets lol. It's a great time
---
Battle royales have saturated the market and if fallout turns into one it’ll ruin the entire experience for me
---
Ah, the year the British passed the Slavery Abolition Act, correct?
---
Any word on when we'll have this sweet feature?
---
I've been running the blade of bastet, 1h melee build. Been thinking of switching to 2h.
---
NThis also happened in 2235. 
---
Which is still 160 years after the bombs fell and 140 after 76. 
---
Ignoring the fact that they are "Genetically" modified. Only 2 survived and that is an insanely small number to even reach the east coast by the events of fallout 3&amp;4.
---
Lol thanks. And yeah  I went to ash heap and I got fucked hahah.
---
I tried to start a rational post explaining some of the failings of Fallout 76, I lost over 70 Karma and went negative for a couple weeks.
---
Fanbois WILL NOT tolerate anything but glowing praise for a lemon of a product.  This thread is proof.
---
Or mingas....
---
Once i figured out they cant auto aim if you sneak and keep weapon holsterd... It was on😁. Now I can enjoy my survival time knowing i will profit caps if you hunt me just cause im on the map.
---
Man i hope they remove that stupid scoreboard.
---
The game mode had a dayz feel too it. Not nearly as punishing but i enjoy the tension... Is this guy a raider or worse, a botherhood of steel!
---
Dude even looks crazy.
---
I live in Kansas and he is an icon here 
---
As a kid we had a mock trial of him wether to convict him or not
---
So, bugs do matter.
---
Mmmm...idk because the few times I've done that, I always feel incredibly pressured for time. 30 min sounds like way too long. I can't remember exactly how much time it was, but I do remember feeling very pressured lol.
---
Good idea. Might need someone to vet the photos, though.
---
IGN ... 95 minute interview.  Use search term "Todd Howard" .... most of the arguments here by supporters have clearly not listened to the entire interview.  I suppose they are too busy playing the game to listen to a 95 minute interview for information ....
---
Maybe you could pay someone to level up your character?
---
To the losers that don't just enjoy games sure
---
Being worse is a relative thing, but I'd say quite a few of EA's releases in the past 5 years would qualify as being controversial, at the very least.
---
Agree, as a mostly melee user with the ranged weapons  I do use doing jack shit for damage comparatively,  its damn neat impossible for me to go toe to toe with a scorchbeast and I'm level 68 . I was trying to wean myself off the power armor in most instances but these annoying little bastards made me rethink that stance.
---
Just got there and managed to find a boat out in the water to pop her camp on, thanks again x
---
There is a perk in endurance called rejuvenated. It doubles the bonuses given from being well fed/ hydrated. Ends up being +50 AP regen 100% disease resistance and +50 health I think.
---
Other energy weapons it's just gigs and giggles but Gatling plasma with flame thrower mod is broken as it's working as shotgun and each pallet have full dmg instead of portion and does not loose dmg with distance like other shotguns what make this weapon an ultimate auto firing shotgun what's totally broken and must be removed, if not explosive effect then at least dmg per pellet reduced by 90%
---
 Really does sound like fun. I have been sorta avoiding it as I don't use VATS and it seemed to be essential to compete.
---
 I used to play Q3 quite a bit so getting killed is not a problem. ;)
---
Good idea, though you should have the option to avoid being hunted if you're busy doing something else...
---
That's sounds like it indeed lol
---
A "neighbour" of mine had the same issue - saw him once after a attack build up his camp again and a few days later, the same "neighbour" raised up a whole new defense tower camp lol - think he was fed up to repair it every hour
---
Your opinion is not true for everyone else.
---
If a bug prevents you from even playing, how can you enjoy the game?
---
What platform? What level character would it take to help with this?
---
I think the +3 charisma gives you better prices at the vendors
---
Later on in your late teens or lvl20 move north to the toxic area. More supermutants but eventually they can have combat shotty and some of the scorched do to.
---
Oh i see, thanks.
---
Cool, thanks. Not exactly stoked for that, still excited for the update though. Hope they go over it all tomorrow at BE3.
---
People need to relax about BR.  If FO76 can implement a fun BR it would be huge for the game.  It would introduce a whole new revenue stream to fund future development of the game.  But honestly I don’t see Bethesda pulling it off.  Prove me wrong guys.  I’ll play.  But if it sucks I’m just going back to Apex.
---
Does unyielding effect work with power armor?
---
You continue? Try another quest? Do literally anything?
---
The point is that a BR mode wouldn't be the main focus of the game. Nobody cares if you're going back to Apex. The main game is about exploration and loot etc.
---
I've dropped quite a few since opening this thread ... I actually find it a bit amusing.  I wasn't expecting such anger ... just a bit of feedback.  Maybe some good arguments both ways.  
---
I'm on the verge of walking away from FO76 as I finally got a good rifle and I've done everything and BR has no appeal for me ... just wondering about the teaser about starting the game again with some type of Legendary effect (to my mind a way of rewarding the players that have participated in the 7 month BETA trial that they have just concluded).
---
Thank you.  Is there a transcript?  I don't care for watching videos.
---
What? The quest reward is 5 and they don’t spoil already...
---
Same issue here 🙋‍♂️ I keep having to pay people caps to mod my X-01... even though I have the plans myself.
---
[](/ajbook)Instigating is a legendary effect, it cannot be crafted. You also cannot upgrade it to your level. To get a higher level one you would have to either have one drop from an enemy, get one from the legendary trader, or trade for one with another player.
---
I don't know what sort of build you have but I have a bloodied SS combat knife that, for me, currently does 252 dmg per swing. Maybe something like that?
---
Summersville, New gad, morgantown (and airport) are good farming spots at your level.
---
I think nobody would like to have to sort through millions of images as their job, so they would have to buy an AI that does the searching for offensive images then report it to a human. That sounds boring.
---
This is what i have.
---
Im trying to get better 2 3* perks
---
Tru7h. No nuke launching for you if you don't do the main.
---
Thanks ! I will look for a legendary vendor ahah
---
He clearly said pistol
---
I built my very first camp here. Was a great site aside from the lone scorched in the upper level of the pharma building that would plink at my stuff from long range non-stop. It got old, so I moved.
---
I literally have no clue... lol, anything as it takes me 8 swings in nuke zones, and out to kill enemy
---
How can you continue, try other quests, when the game won't even load?
---
To me, it looks like Bethesda is using their most loyal Fallout fans to generate operating revenue for their Starfield mega project.
---
FO76 wasn't even a rumour 2 years ago ... a teaser came out 8 months before launch ... then it was.  Now they need to generate steady and predictable sales .... dribbling out small amounts of content steadily.
---
Try again, it's that easy
---
Also, these fanbois would never do research.  They are absolutely sure of their opinions, because they've played games.
---
As TechnoTrouble mentioned in this thread, "\[Bugs matter\] to the losers that don't just enjoy games sure"
---
Awsome! Do you guys play on PC? I would like to visit by and check out what she's building
---
The AI in this game is really a make-believe system. Obviously the systems always knows where you are. But at times because of your perks and legendaries the system is like ‘ok ok I’ll tell that ghoul to walk by you and pretend he doesn’t see you’. The ‘sneak build’ is popular because the system can successfully pretend you’re not there most of the time. However there’s no such thing as perfect AI, at times whatever triggered it, it would fall apart and stop pretending, that’s when it all go south.
---
I seem to have decent luck selling uncommon apparel for a fair price (250-500), I've sold some "daily" outfits for 76 each. I sell ammo at 1 or 2 if it's energy. Fusion cores can be sold on the % it has. Bulk junk sells at 25 for uncommon, 50 for "rare" (this accounts for plastic usage), plastic sells at 3-4 each, single stack junk sells at 2-3 each. Flux sells at 75-100. Unradiated food sells at 10, dog food sells at 5-10. I sold nuka shine at 76c. Bug parts sell sometimes from 50-100c each. 
---
Legendary prices vary quite a bit so no advice there, but be reasonable - especially if you aren't going to use the thing.
---
I started seeing it a couple weeks ago, and I'm in that area fairly often.
---
If you arrive when the event just spawns you have a lot more time, at the beginning of the night. if you start later it is much less time. Also, easier if you are more people in a group, then everyone can loot every corpse and get much more bio fluid.
---
To me playing in a group is a hassle for the most part. When a good majority of the builds are as much damage as possible in one shot combined with the dumb mechanics where you have to do damage to an enemy to get loot and experience from it, it end ends up being a pain in the ass to make sure everyone tags the enemy before killing.
---
My build right now even though I started play only a while ago is entirely melee and can one shot most things. But in groups I either make it so my friends don't get shit cause I'm killing everything without them hitting it or I'm running around with a gun that I barely do any damage with and then I'm basically just there wasting space.
---
They game is obviously made with playing with friends in mind but the mechanics are entirely counter intuitive to actually playing in a group.
---
Its coming with Nuclear Winter. The legendary player system thatll allow you to start at 1 for more powerful perk cards.
---
[](/didyouevenreadthebook)The only legendary vendor is at Berkeley Springs station in the Mire. She only takes legendary scrip as currency which can be gained by selling legendary items to either her, or the legendary exchange machines available at any train station.
---
Anthem arrived at the perfect time to be a case study in how two different companies handled botched releases.  For all the flak Bethesda gets, some of it deserved, one can't argue that they gave up on 76 like EA did Anthem.  It's like I've said before - sometimes, the way you react to failure defines your character more than success.
---
The excavator gives you 100 bonus. 
---
You can mod it with shocks for another 100. 
---
But there’s a bug where, if you’re wearing it when you log out, when you log back in you’ll have another 100. 
---
If you take it off or die you’ll lose that extra bugged 100. 
---
This has been a bug since launch. It was fixed for one patch (early on, maybe patch 3?) but the fix was worse than the bug because it kinda destroyed carry weight bonuses across the board if you were wearing items when you logged in. So it was fairly quickly reversed.
---
It would be neat if the big water purifier removed rads from the water source in a radius around it.
---
[Danse disliked that.]
---
Doesn’t jive well with “dodgy” perk
---
Just curious, she’s as large as a jumbo jet, why do people still use vats with that size and at that range? 🤔
---
There wasn't a transcript on Thursday when I looked.  I prefer transcripts as well ... easier to verify what was said, from what you just seemed to hear.   But I haven't looked since then.   IGN is usually pretty good at adding transcripts at some point though.
---
I said there should be a limit and proper downsides to having mutations, not that they shouldn't exist. " I " find it silly you can have all these mutations with no hindrance to your character that isn't noticeable enough to be considered a " yes or no " option when selecting them.
---
Not entitled, simply saying my view of them.
---
You can certainly carry more out of Xcavator than you can in it with a full set of weapon weight reducing armor. I can carry roughly 60-75 weapons at a time, and still have room in my inventory for junk, and such.
---
It's safe and displayable for 30 sec.
---
Rinse and repeat. Wouldn't recommend.
---
It's a creepy account. It's a month old and literally every single post is him complaining about FO76. He's a troll or, hell, maybe even a Russian stirring disharmony.
---
I imagine Putin like a Bond villian, trying to bring down the US by destroying our video game industry while he slowly pets a white cat named Snowie.
---
Now I want a white cat named Snowie :-/.
---
I'd check around at different player vendors.  Chances are, you're more likely to find something of quality there than the pure randomness of the Purveyor.  There are a *lot* of joke weapons in the melee pool, but many wasteland merchants filter them out before putting things up for sale.
---
Yea never expected it too be that effective, I do have a large backpack too
---
In its current state it is simply inferior to the handmade. I found myself a junkie's explosive assault rifle with reduced weight, but as awesome as the stats are it's a pretty sub-par weapon; I end up switching to my 1* anti-armor combat rifle when things go bad
---
My cpu is an i7 5820k 3.3ghz ive installed game 3x repaired a dozen times played other games just fine.
---
Just throwing this out there are the items in your stash or on your person? Also might be worth experimenting with the PA crafting perk i forget the name but it could be bugged where you may need it but it isnt showing you do.
---
I’m vaguely OOTL but just to clarify...
---
Do people actually care about the canvas bag or does it just represent a way to make them pay for being disappointed in the game and a tangible symbol of undelivered promises?
---
Somehow I just imagine everyone receiving their canvas bag, letting out a collective “neat!”, and tossing it in the closet to collect dust and be thrown out in the next move.
---
Yeah true that made them easier to collect as well as finding the specific ones players use
---
3 random need to server hop for them. Not as good as combat armor.
---
I think this is a known issue, though.  Things like the Gatling Gun can't hit the broad side of a barn at point-blank range.  The bullets are *way* off if you look at their tracers - like, more than 60º from the way you're facing.
---
My view is I like having fun when I play video games. If I wanted downsides, I wouldn't use the Class Freak perk. If you want downsides, just don't use that perk. 
---
Your view is that I shouldn't be able to have more than 1 mutation. Even though some mutations kind of work with each other. What would the point of Birdbones even be, without Marsupial? Ok you fall slightly slower the 3 feet you can jump without Marsupial, whooo. 
---
Everyone has views on things. You don't always have to express those views. And when you do decide to express them, expect other people to express theirs back.
---
It was the rifle I used almost exclusively in FO4. What happened?
---
I apologize. I read through it once and it appeared to be the same question most people ask about using guerilla perk, if auto pistol perks work on it.
---
Disable adrenal reaction stacking with bloodied effect, reduce melee damage from unyielding armor set.
---
Then reduce hps of all bosses, SBQ reduce dramaticaly. Also super mutants are stupidly bulletsponging for no reason.
---
Then it could be good.
---
Juicehead on YouTube had a lengthy video on it a week or two ago.
---
Thats whiy i use the unstoppebel monster maxed out melee build 5k damage be quick tomorrow is the last day in survival mode  
---
Jou need only to hits.!!!!
---
Agreed. It was great in FO4.
---
I have 5 chars each with different builds and can hit pervayor and vendor on each... takes about 4-5 hours.. uranium fever, westek, player vending, harbors ferry all have great legendary spawns.
---
We need a paper bag that has Xmas print on it.  (Bag would also be easier to see in long grass) Drop some stuff in it, do a gift emote. Leaving the vault a reminder should pop up reminding players that they CANNOT be killed by other players till level 5.
---
HELL!! XD open the post scared the shit out of me - got hit in the face by good ol' Johnny there.
---
But looking at him, the madness is written on his forehead...nah wait his beard... No - got it! It's the crossed eyes. No doubt.
---
Thx for the informative post!
---
Me too. Huge magazine and almost no recoil.
---
Wait, where is the Overseer's body? I hadn't heard it had been found.
---
But why? Why is it so bad that someone worked to hit really hard and can really only do that? I’m really curious.
---
&gt;I suppose they are too busy playing the game to listen to a 95 minute interview for information ....
---
"Oh yes, how dare people enjoy the game rather than delve into the drama."
---
I've also been losing interest in Fallout 76.  It doesn't help that BattleTech had another DLC release.
---
Are you talking about the cinematic feature in FO4?
---
Dont forget the returned glitch where you can light someone up and their health will go down to nothing and then return to full because you are "too strong".
---
It usually gives me around 12 mins.
---
I can’t speak for anyone. I know that originally many people wanted that canvas bag and it was part of their decision to purchase the expensive power armor edition. At this point....7 months later, I would bet some are still demanding it based on the fact that they paid for it and actually still want to use it and some just want it out of principle for being lied to. 
---
Personally, I know that if I had to wait 7 months for a canvas bag, I’d be so disgusted with Bethesda and this bag by the time I got it,  that I’d probably chuck the damn thing into the darkest corner of the deepest closet that I have and never lay eyes on it again. Still that’s my right to do so and I’m entitled to get my property even if it’s just going collect dust in a corner somewhere.
---
Thx sorry my game been crashing alot i went to bed thx a yway
---
[](/celcrazy)It's pretty crazy paired with a backpack, and weight reduction perks. [This is my main flamer at a whopping 0.31lbs](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/461221526629384192/587022870333620224/Weight.png?width=830&amp;height=467), and [this is my heaviest weapon at 1.68lbs](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/461221526629384192/587022885407686676/Weight2.png?width=830&amp;height=467). You can easily fit every weapon in the game on your back if you want to.
---
hopefully nowhere never
---
Just got the email confirmation, “the appropriate action has been taken for the racial and homophobic slurs “
---
Compensation...? lolwut??
---
I have to imagine that syncing paired animations over a network is a pretty significant challenge on top of just working with their current animation system.
---
thats a bullshit analogy.  i wouldnt buy a car that didnt work.   fallout had issues galore, but it did “work” for all intents and purposes.  
---
maybe youre right.  who knows.  doesnt change my opinion on not paying anything else and still getting new stuff to do.
---
I see you are just a fanboi troll.  Enjoy being a douche.
---
Power Smith. I just noticed that I have one card animated at level 1 that talks about advanced PA mods and a level 3 no animated Power Smith that says something about crafted durability. I’ll try them both.
---
Yep. Bases are also indestructible in survival. I don’t believe that was an intended carry over when they introduced invincible camps in pve.
---
Hopefully we see it addressed/fixed talked about in the next update, or at least at E3 tomorrow.
---
thanks for that behind the scenes insight.
---
Thank you.
---
Also needs an increase to magazine size
---
Before you make these posts:
---
Understand how game development works and that they can't just put content on hold for fixes, because games like this literally die without content.
---
Yeah I would block new posts and host a megathread then re-enable posting the following day.
---
so we get it for free? dope!
---
Posted almost the same elsewhere... 
---
Best thing would be just wait till it drops and then discuss it and not debate about unearthed eggs. 
---
0.02$
---
5%
---
Yea I feel ya. Is the game in a good state now or still lots bugs and issues to sort?
---
did you say sloth in the forest!??!?    thats new!
---
that is amazing, if the walls were a little different if feels like a small pool house for one of the cabins at whitesprings.
---
It is almost certainly a BR mode, and I completely agree with you. Hopefully they make it a little more complicated than a BR mode in the Fallout universe.
---
As much as I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities.. I doubt they are going to deviate much from their roadmap..
---
best you can probably hope for is alongside...
---
"Fallout did "work" for all intents and purposes"
---
It changed how players felt about server hopping ..... from negative to mandatory.  You couldn't help it because you couldn't play for more than 20 minutes b4 the server crashed or something froze.
---
That is not what anyone would define as "work"ing ....
---
Do you have perks equipped that reduce heavy weapon weight
---
8-10k minimum
---
So, that means there is no more revenue generated for producing new content.  So, no new content is being produced for Fallout 76.  So, WoW is not a comparable model.
---
Hmmm ... sounds interesting ... gotta go look.
---
I was surprised too, especially as it essentially brought the Sheepsquatch but maybe people didn't look at it that way. Pretty straight forward event but the whole guiding the Brahmin with the crook was a nice touch.

Or clipping through the ground at death, and lost forever
---
LPT. If you're looking for a specific plan post in market places about that specific plan. Don't spend caps plan hunting at player vendors.
---
It is important to know.  I would love for Fallout 76 to be the game it should have been, but its just not gonna happen.
---
I just pray that the Nuclear Winter content is not mostly PvP orientated.  They should fine tune Survival and the current PvP mechanics before adding new PvP modes, assuming the rumors turn true tomorrow.
---
Still trying to stay positive for the Fallout 76 E3 showcase tomorrow.
---
Tried Power Smith and made sure everything was in my stash. No dice. Must be bugged.
---
yeah bud.  its all nice on paper.   
---
but its all fucky once people get involved.  
---
just enjoy video games instead of dragging them through this polarizing slop.   youve gone from “ do you think the new content is new”, to “this isnt how a free market works”, now we’re at “democracy and its pillars”.  
---
im going to get my new backpack mod.
---
Xbox sorry I always forget that, any level really
---
It may have worked "enough", at least in the eyes of the Execs and fanboies, but it wasn't ready to be released.
---
The major issue for me was the terrible server stability. At its worst I was being kicked every half hour. Even while playing there was constant freezing and lagging. That’s all been resolved and now it operates general on the level of a single player fallout game, but that’s not saying much as the fallout games are some of the buggiest. So it’s still buggy and glitchy and still experiencing terrible framerate drops and stuttering, but nothing game breaking like before where the server would boot you off constantly in the middle of events. Basically the sever issues and disconnects have been resolved but the bugs are all stil there and new ones are still introduced with new patches as it was before
---
Which plans do you have?
---
🤷
---
"NUCLEAR WINTER" is the name of the new game mode. So you are incorrect. Its also the name of the next stage, and they will be adding new content along with the Nuclear Winter gamemode. Soo you arent wrong, but neither are the people that you say are wrong.
---
Not my drama ... Todd Howard interview, that has tag line that indicates he will give information about future content (which he doesn't) ...
---
I never criticized anyone for playing the game .... just that they shouldn't comment on what Todd Howard did or did not say when they haven't taken the time to inform themselves.
---
again, play some more online games at launch.   welcome to massive network asset tracking.
---
That's one of some reasons why i don't trade.
---
Good idea for a location, the bar area is really nice.  Great job!
---
i respect your right to have that opinion.
---
Perhaps they forgot to include the base 105 in the total they are showing you?
---
They didn't call it Wild Appalachia for nothing.
---
Ah, good ok' FilCas. Mods insist they don't allow recruiting for their sub but here we are.
---
Also massive hypocrites. So the posts making fun of this sub for all the "is it ok to come back" posts isn't toxic?
---
Bitch please...
---
except, it would appear....there is!
---
one of the scary things I have seen in game  was  when i got lost going south but headed towards fort defiance and ended up at the cliff overlooking the giant tram tower in the bog at that one end I looked down and 3 deathclaws were fighting a large pack of super mutants  with a scourchbeat  not far away looking to come closer. at roughly around level 40 who plays solo  i said nope used my stealthboy and got the f out of there.
---
Rename it.  When you rename something and you try to scrap or sell it, it'll give you a warning first.
---
I actually see stimpack diffusers in vendor machines frequently! How I got my 3
---
What do I think?
---
Even if what you said were completely true, it is completely irrelevant.  They are giving it away for free.
---
It doesn't matter when it was made.  What matters is that it gets done and contributes to a fuller game experience.  Frankly, given its rocky start, the theory that you and x\_lincoln\_x are trying to push - that they had this entirely finished "other game" all ready to go back at launch - is asinine.  You argue "No developer would pour more money into a failed product."  It seems equally valid to say "No developer would deliberately sabotage their own launch so they can make money later."
---
I've never tried, carnivore4life yo :P
---
I was so excited to build the drum mag and....wow.
---
Running scarley  skin? That’ll eat into your AP.
---
Also when you log in so you get a sad vault boy icon as things start to load in?  That’d be an addiction and could explain the other missing aP
---
Yeah, but I'm a hoarder. Without bear arms that flamer still only weighs 3.11lbs.
---
Well, technically, someone is doing it for the "Around Appalachia" feature they do every week.  And I'm sure it's quite finite, because it relies on users tweeting their photos with the proper hashtag, which requires more effort than taking a screenshot in the game.
---
still remember my first play through in new vegas when the npc warns you not to go straight to vegas but around by these certain towns, I was like what could be so bad...deathclaws many many deathclaws that is what .
---
Birdbones is a replacement for the Goat Legs perk, reduced fall damage Legendary effects, particular drinks, and Power-armor when falling from great heights. Cliffs and high-up locations often have these, and removes the effort to actually climb down from a location. You do not need to jump into the air to make use of the Birdbones mutation.
---
Oh do you know the cool down? Or how to trigger it? I thought Stings and things was a daily. 
---
Anyways replying to say for anyone I my situation - keep grinding. I just got one of the other plans(firefly) today. It’s just luck of the draw.
---
Yes you can but part of the set up was to allow players of all levels to participate in it with higher level players able to access more.
---
Unfortunately were on ps4 :( ill upload some pictures once she's done though
---
Scorchbeasts have always been a little cheatsy.  It was more obvious in the early days, how they'd circle around pretending you weren't there, but inexorably tracked toward your location at the same time, only to be "OH HEY, EAT MY GREEN CHEERIOS."
---
Thanks for the info! I might try to get back into it. I think the game could see new life if they introduce modded servers....which would let the players fix the game for them, per Bethesda tradition :/
---
You could sue Bethesda in small claims court.
---
Clips hard with the Hunters Longcoat.
---
Fas-naught-mo
---
If your on PC you’ll find me at the Morgantown cat house
---
lol at telling me about gravity, I didn't know that existed. -rolls eyes-
---
Birdbones isn't nearly a replacement for Goatlegs. I can toss myself off practically anything and live with Goatlegs. With just Birdbones I fall slightly slower and then splat when I hit. If you have BOTH, you don't die even if you throw yourself off Seneca Rocks. And yes, I know because I lived up there for a while and one of my favorite things to do is run and jump as far as possible, cause it's fun. Which is what I like doing in games. Having...fun. 
---
You should try it sometime, then maybe you wont be all butthurt that people have, GASP, more than one mutation "sprinting" ourselves about.
---
I'll have to look tomorrow to see for sure which ones, but if I'm not mistaken I've got Kinetic Survos, Rusty Knuckles, Motion Assist Survos, Medic Pump, and Internal Database - likely forgot one or two, and may have mixed some up with others.
---
Come to think of it, I'm not sure I've ever seen a Raider Dense *Mod*, let alone a plan.
---
I understand the argument that it doesn't matter when they added the content, so long as it was free for whomever originally paid for it. .. you ultimately get the whole product that you originally paid for.
---
But it is not entirely free for those who have to wait 6 months while paying a subscription or monthly charge while they wait for something they already paid for that was advertised to be complete.  Also, money in Bethesda's accounts makes money for them, while money that is absent from your own account does not make money for you.
---
I know these things are trifles ... but businesses rise and fall on attention to these details ..... monetarily, details clearly matter to Bethesda ... quality, clearly not.
---
This is so cringe. 
---
I'm embarrassed for you.
---
Marine Dense is oddly common in comparison to the others.
---
So you are saying don't complain at all and just accept garbage products.  Instead of telling us to stop complaining, how about you don't participate in threads that are about talking about critical issues people have with the product?  What, honestly, have you added to the conversation?
---
People have their opinions, treating your opinion as fact gets us no where.
---
It works though, but I'm on PC so have hot key perk decks.
---
It is named, no warning.
---
I get that. I guess what I’m saying is it seems a little more reasonable that enemies would blind fire into your general direction, not aim bot your exact location while the game keeps up appearances that you’re undetected.
---
Maybe it depends on how you earned it?  There was that weird thing where you'd "Know" the plan just by receiving it.
---
Vats is amazing and this definitely needs attention. I noticed it some time ago.
---
Don't argue facts with fanbois.  It just doesn't matter to them.
---
Selling drugs and guns. And if I don't hit the max everyday, it doesn't really matter. Sell some of the most commonly used ammo at your camp, and you'll have more money than you know what to do with. I've had to turn my vending machines off cause I'm at max caps and can't find anything else I want to buy.
---
I think it’s about time FO76 showed some love to the cat community and made some cans of Fancy Feast for the dwellers to digest!
---
Perhaps.
---
However, I would say there is a difference between a game that adds an Online extension that is a bit glitchy and in need of patches to an existing Offline game that works fine, AND a game that starts 100% OnLine with no ability to play it any other way.
---
I earned my plan legit. In fact, I still have the plan from that.
---
No don't apologize he posted this in response to the thread and mentioned prime plans and etc. Definitely insinuated in my mind the SBQ. I'm level 120 and the SBQ is a bullet sponge Everytime I've gone. The surrounding things are way more valuable. There's usually a few legendary enemies so I focus on that and Flux. Whatever that weird forest is just seems to be a good spot.
---
Nice work bud.
---
This pretty much played out ask expected. I hope Bethesda takes note that we want more of what we asked for i.e. Player vendors, ways to recycle legendaries, single player exploration content, bug/QoL fixes, and less of what we didn't ask for i.e. PvP &amp; survival mode.
---
I see, thank you for that
---
I can see the VATS comment is taking some flack. I'll tell you why I mentioned it -- because it's replicatable, and it's supposed to work 'a certain way.' I used it so that I could establish that there is, in fact, an issue.
---
CLICK *Your weapon has broken*
---
If any one is curious, this was version 1 of the build  [https://imgur.com/a/XNOGhcM](https://imgur.com/a/XNOGhcM)
---
You definitely made it seem like you're talking about the SBQ. You just gave instructions in response to this thread. It's almost like you were hoping someone was like, wait, what? Just so you could be like "I meant normal SBQ dude stop being stupid".
---
Is there anything on it or attached to it?
---
The vertibot was the latest, but there were a couple of right after release.
---
Hopping servers usually does it
---
I have a background in game development, and I've watched the game industry go from text adventures to what we have now.  I would like to think my views are based on experience.  I have just been trying to dispel some myths many end users have.
---
1. Bethesda is for profit.
---
2. Fixing major bugs will not generate new revenue.
---
3. All of the road-map content was created before release.
---
4. The development team has moved on to other projects.
---
5. Bethesda will ONLY fix the critical bugs that could cause a breach in contract with Sony and Microsoft.
---
With that in mind, how can Fallout 76 become a non-lemon product?
---
Again, I would love to see Fallout 76 be the game it should have been, but all signs point to it won't happen.
---
Dude, no one buys prime plans like that. Prime plans are soooo inconsequential.
---
I'm on now if you want the blade, sorry, had to run around IRL.
---
Level 80’s can drop ultracite plans and queen stuff I believe
---
I don’t know why you’re having so much, a bloodied explosive 50 cal is all you really need. I know they aren’t exactly common but you don’t even need a two shot variant because I don’t even run those perks and I shred through scorchbeasts with about 50 or less shots from my lvl 35 50 cal.. I just run all heavy perks with nerd rage and stabilized if I see a scorchbeast and they get melted pretty fast.
---
Grindfest is exactly how I feel about the scout badges. Thank you for finding the right word to describe it.
---
I just really want a hardcore mode.
---
BUT, based on the leaked audio records, it seems almost certain that the BR everyone is talking about is specific to a Vault (likely 55), not a full-blown mode. 
---
Kind of like a more interesting Hunter/Hunted, you can join up as a Candidate for Overseer in Vault and are tasked with killing all other candidates. You go out of the Vault, hunting the other players in order to advance through the Vault. This is all from the audio records. It seems OTT to make this an entire mode as opposed to something you opt into by going to said vault in any of the modes.
---
Problem is that excludes resellers who want undervalued plans to sell at their own vendor for a higher price.
---
I'm all for a better way to improve knowing what vendors have but I'm not sure this is it. 
---
Maybe if this option is toggleable? Could see that as working.
---
Not sure how holding industry accountable to certain standards (like the video game industry to the standard of quality and integrity) is counter productive to the goal of "enjoying video games" .... that connection doesn't compute for me.  
---
Perhaps your enjoyment of video games (or any product really) comes precisely from the efforts of others to demand quality standards?  No .. that can't be right.
---
Build a drum for the handmade! It has to be a mix up
---
Fasnacht.
---
I couldn't rename my packs. Don't know why it allows me to select it but can't actually change the text.
---
I’ve had bullets actually go vertically up on the gatling gun. Even a few times on a non two-shot one
---
If it was in the road-map, then it was created and finished before launch.  
---
Let us not split hairs.
---
There is upcoming DLC, but its not "New" in the sense that it was developed after launch.
---
Bethesda is not working on Fallout 76 except to fix critical bugs that may violate whatever contracts they have with Sony and Microsoft.
---
Do you have the plan for it? If so its under, Underarmor
---
If you've learned the plan to, it should be under the Under Armor tab of the armor workbench.
---
No.  When in power armor,  your regular armor is non existent
---
The issue at hand is Bethesda is not going to fix most of the bugs.  There is no active development on Fallout 76 anymore.  They will ONLY fix critical bugs that could cause issue with their contracts with Sony and Microsoft.
---
Okay that’d actually be amazing
---
I like the risk/reward of the current system. Means if you don't have or not high enough level for starched genes or the funds to pay for serums, you have to roll the dice and hope for the best. Both ways, getting desired mutations &amp; getting rid of undesirables.
---
Otherwise you pay for certainty with caps, levels and perk cards choices.
---
And you need 80 screws to fix it
---
They could just put a total and then in parenthesis an 'unknown plans' number right beside it.  I get what you're saying, I traveled to a camp that had 156 plans on sale today and they were 20 caps each and I bought a ton of them and took them back to my camp and listed them for 100.
---
You got to reset your camp, sucks happened to me
---
Yeah, it was the purpose of the damn game, to do something different
---
With that mix then it sounds like they are all bugged then.
---
That's what I thought thx
---
My "theories" come from a lifetime of watching the game developer world.  Also, I have a background (including college) on software development with the intent to create games.  I would like to think my views are relevant.  So far, besides insults, no one has tried to argue my points.
---
Your attempt to re-word what I said to something preposterous is not helping.  
---
How can Bethesda PROFIT from pulling the development team off their current project back to Fallout 76?   All the fans have already purchased the game and there is no monthly fee.  All the DLC was planned as free.  So, how could Bethesda profit from fixing Fallout 76?
---
I found this issue when building at the bottom of the bridge near Harper's Ferry on the edge of the pylons near the water - had to build add a block back to something the game fully recognized as solid ground before it would allow me to remove the attached blocks back to that block. Panicked for a moment cause I thought I might have to tear the whole camp down
---
They should be Three stars with guaranteed three star drops IMO.
---
i thought you had to spend the caps to contest the workshop?
---
You do. And you can do that from anywhere inside of the build zone.
---
Thank you!! And it doesn’t sound like forced battle royal. Seperate from pve, i dont get the fuss. I mean if they forced you to abandon all pve and only did br, then yeah, fuss. This along with wild appalacia was likely developed before the release last year, i would suspect most of what is going to be released this year has already been coded
---
I rocked that blade for a long time, but then I got All Rise from Watoga and never looked back!
---
No mods. The size of the magazine is actually dependent on the condition of the plasma core. 
---
Higher intelligence can craft higher condition on the cores. Max is 500 Condition is what I understand. Still testing it though, but that's what I got with 46 intelligence
---
Yeah except Bethesda could add tens or hundreds of thousands of paying customers if they can implement a successful BR.  The main game won’t last unless they pull in more from their online store.  The game (which I’ve played extensively) is a bore-fest at high levels.  PvP is trash compared to other games.  It’s not 10% the game the FO4 was for a single player experience.  It’s a mediocre game with great bones that could be molded into something good.  But if you think that you’re getting updates for single player gamers 18 months from now if they don’t add a serious revenue stream... you’re just incorrect.
---
David Attenborough narrates: Natural Appalachia
---
what "other game"?
---
How do i get the mod for a rifle stock?
---
I'm still not coming back.
---
I’m indifferent. I’m content with my own screenshots.
---
I haven't gotten it yet.
---
Which is exactly why my first post is a fact.
---
That is very interesting. Thanks for setting this up!
---
You will care once all the fortnite kiddies get into it and Bethesda focuses on the BR mode instead of the main game.
---
Xboxdvr.com
---
Those should've counted as formal wear. Glitch maybe?
---
I imagine the cannon would probably be buggy and need a patch
---
You're okay, I had some errands too. I sent you a message on here earlier with my gamertag.
---
I got the backpack without participating with anyone.   ... the only contact I needed with anyone was reviving them (once), which i did by simply running into a downed low level player trying to farm a Nuked WhiteSprings while I was already there.  I revive about 10 players in a playing session here and there and everywhere .... it involves zero interaction, just an extra stimpack and having some empathy.
---
The argument of "Everyone is doing it, makes it OK", doesn't work.
---
Developers have found, over the years, that they can release games with bugs by promising to fix them in upcoming patches.  
---
What happens is every new game is buggier than the last, because less and less time is spent in development than before.
---
And every item in Sugar Grove has decided to not respawn
---
I'm 99% certain the explosive damage bug is back, and since a gatling laser can also do a lot of damage in a short span it wouldn't surprise me if that could trigger it too.
---
...And all DLC is promised before launch.
---
I doubt they’ll really talk bug fixes too much at E3 lmao
---
That one worked for me, but the photographer vertibot pic wont. Even when it registers in the camera frame. Some of these photo challenges are crap.
---
DAE bethesda greedy with 4 bucks wood laminate?????? xddd
---
Additional content free.
---
You can earn atoms. 
---
Whatever.
---
Dude totally my thought process. Not the game and not the time. Majority of players want new thing to explorer and stability. Peppered with mechanic tweaks that are needed.
---
It took me doing the event 20+ times to even get one of the outfits pieces.  There’s no plan for it.
---
Second this.  I’ve had the game tell me something is the foundation, do some more building and the. Suddenly it isn’t anymore.  The game has become so fickle on this point now.
---
Your stats cap in effectiveness at 30 from what I understand.
---
This sub doesn't make up the "vast majority" of the fanbase lol
---
But I paid $60 and it's not the game I WANT!!!
---
The whole point of mutations is that they arent easily managed. If Bethesda implemented this theyd probably spike the cost of serums as well.
---
PVP area is already in the game; that's what Survival mode is.
---
Do they give xp bonus?
---
&gt; Also, if I am not mistaken if you were in passive mode, your base was safe.
---
You're very very mistaken. Passive mode didn't change anything except you dealing damage to other players. Others could still hurt you and damage your things.
---
I always hope for so much, and except for the Fallout 4 announcement I've mostly been disappointed. I'm sure this E3 is just going to be more of what we have already seen, DOOM, maybe hype for ESO, junk about Blades and the card crap, then if the stars align at best we might get a hype trailer for Starfield.
---
isn't a powerfist with puncturing (20%arp)+(str+40%dmg) more damage ?
---
Yeah seems so
---
Yeah I got the plan and I read it.
---
They r leaking a battle royal mode or something like that
---
It’s honestly ridiculous it isn’t a “defensive mode” because it should OBVIOUSLY let me defend myself. Survival mode or otherwise.
---
Oh no flack intended at all. I just didn’t understand the need to use it, as I use a fire axe all the time. A player told me in the past that vats melee is very useful for small enemies like ticks etc, and also flying bugs, which made perfect sense to me. But for something as large as the sbq is there any advantage for using it?
---
And yes auto disable in survival. Ffs bgs
---
I did read it but it still wasn't under it.
---
That was a false rumour. He was just messing with you.
---
Sentinel/Assassin Armor Set from the looks of it not a bug
---
Well that’s just factually untrue
---
I'm 160 and I die to Yao guais more than I do to scorchbeasts.

It's all fun and games till someone fast travels to your camp and gets parasites while loading in underwater. 😔
---
WTB Travel mats.
---
But fear not, you can purchase repair kits from the atom shop!
---
I've crafted with a 35 intelligence and got about 350 core charge. I'll be able to test that out soon.
---
Assault rifles sell for more and doesn’t cost anything. Just do a WesTek run and sell all the weapons you pick up.
---
&gt;  got the backpack without participating with anyone. 
---
Had no relevance to what I said.
---
Again. Factually untrue.
---
Scrapping pipe revolvers. They’re a common find on scorched. You might be able to find the mod at a vendor as well. I tried looking for a list of which vendors carry it but I’m not finding anything.
---
I consider it far more likely that the BR we hear about in the audio logs (which I spent way too much time listening to) is in relation to the vault mentioned in said logs. That is, you go to that vault, become a candidate for overseer, participate in the bloodbath, rank up (however long this takes), become (an) overseer, and get the rewards; **this is what the audio logs say.** It makes no sense to have ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SERVERS just for this one vault.
---
I'll eat my words in \~24 hours if I need to; simultaneously, it strikes me as too OTT to make an entire mode just for this ONE questline.
---
Sorry ... I thought it did.
---
While I too think that is coming, it's still speculation. 
---
Regardless, your level, after 50, won't matter as much as you may think. It's going to come down to your character perk card build, the weapons you use and the armor, if any, you wear. If you're accepting of advice, search out on the sub various build questions people have asked. You'll probably find the answers to help you out.
---
Best of luck.
---
No, but you can have branches for gathering wood within your camp, just make sure not to put anything near it and make it despawn.
---
Oh ok so you didn’t do any research whatsoever gotcha
---
Hm... there's a semi-empty blue house in between the Nuka-Cola plant and Camden Park... monorail cars are always fun... I like floating houses where the foundation starts underwater in a lake or etc and then is invisible
---
Grandma?
---
Still not fixed.
---
Thanks I’m only lev 4 I have a long way to go
---
Really wish there were male version for them, as well as the Asylum outfits. It's weird having to crossdress for challenges that require them.
---
I'll be on in a few hours I'm game for anything.
---
GT: ShiningAnimus
---
Yeah they’re a major part of the reason I still refuse to spend money on this game.
---
I have a tiny different issue.
---
I use my plasma flamer, the enemy HP will goes down to 1%, then become immortal.
---
Sometimes my gatling gun does the same...
---
To be fair there's still alot of issues that we thought they were working on and the BR thing is questionable when the game still isn't running smoothly.
---
Were they started legendaries or just say legendary sometimes it only registers ones with an actual star
---
Yeah, [my minigun](https://imgur.com/36S6edA) is hungry. At least I can't use too much ammo with it, nothing lives long enough to really open her up to any serious fire time except the SBQ.
---
How you can think game companies rollout new content years after a games initial release with zero work done is beyond me. Was it pre planned before launch? Yes. They’d be stupid to not have a plan post launch. Is it a shady thing to do? No. At some point the thing has to launch and if the expectation is that new content will be added then if waiting until everything is done to release the game would end up in the game literally never coming out. You do not know what you’re talking about.
---
I didn't actually make the presentation featured in the screenshots, that's lifted straight from Survey Monkey (the site I hosted the survey on). I'll remember that though for if I do end up making another one post-Nuclear Winter.
---
I share your sentiment about the circle graph/pie chart, fucking hate them! So hard to read, especially when you've got to constantly refer to the colour coding guide. Honestly I should've dug deeper to see if there was another setting for that part.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Like speed deamon. I love being able to move faster, but I hate having to stop every five minutes to eat/drink.
---
Please link video clip of Todd saying the game was a polished masterpiece. These things happen in the industry. You need to let it go.
---
Id rather scope out another build than hear about 3* wood armor and assaultron heads again..
---
looks pretty good.. what mutations are you gonna run with it? there are none listed in that link..
---
I checked mine to be sure and I have the option to build it. It doesn't seem to be tired to perk cards, as I disabled all armor related perks and could still craft it.
---
What is your intelligence level at? Mine is at 11 but I don't know if that matters or not.
---
or perhaps the age old “best laid plans go to waste” happens a lot in the digital age.
---
IF YOU’VE BEEN INJURED BY BETHESDA YOU COULD BE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION.  CALL 1-800-TODDHOWARD.
---
why jc
---
I may not be using the exact words, but at the E3 launch, it was made clear by Todd Howard on stage. This would be an ongoing game, with regular content updates that would take player feedback into account. Something along the lines of wanting to build it together with the players. Those were platitudes for sure, but the message was crystal clear. 
---
Besides all that, it’s common sense. It’s an online game with promised free content updates. Of course it’s going to evolve over time. That shouldn’t need to be spelled out.
---
Yeah, that’d piss a ton of people off right away , and rightly so.
---
Because multiplayer.
---
No but it’ll always be there for you to take a few pieces every now and then or when you log on
---
they knew they had problems at beta and patched as much as they could.  they likely knew when they hooked up more than their local testing network.  
---
its pretty stable now.  
---
thats new too.
---
Writing SB everywhere and responding to a post about SB somehow made you think SBQ? OK...
---
Also, was I impolite or something? I just responded to a reply, telling the person the thread is about SB and not SBQ. Who said anything about calling others names or being condescending?
---
The fact you supposedly worked in software development and still have no clue what you’re discussing is shocking and disturbing. Who hired you? How did this happen?
---
Dude the launch was shaky and the bugs are still abundant. They promised to fix it. Then comes PVE. Then comes BR. Why not stick to your promise instead of dragging everyone along. I get why people are upset. Of course they're doing BR to bring in more customers. 
---
The last two times I've played it was so laggy I couldn't even enjoy myself.
---
Bit of a stretch to reach your conclusion.  Can you link an article that proves that the game was originally advertised for purchasers to expect it to "evolve over time"?
---
I don't buy a game without fully researching it .... E3 last year was when it was announced, and then it came  out.  The BETA responses criticized it as not ready, but Bethesda responded to that criticism with a pre launch patch, and post launch patch that was bigger than the original game file.
---
Unless you have any evidence of my lack of research, you really shouldn't make assumptions.
---
Dont write to blackwell the traitorous bastard
---
Legendary Armor with good effects will go a long way. Plenty of weight reducing effects and if you’re a bloodied build you can get all unyielding to give you +3 to every attribute per piece. Mix that in with a high capacity backpack and that’s another 120 carry weight. Also on the armor you can put deep pocketed to give you +10 carry weight per piece. Operative lining when upgraded and strength option chosen gives you a good amount as well. My guy started off as a agility/luck sneak sniper build so I have no strength naturally, but still pulls over 400 carry weight with everything I’ve mentioned. Oh almost forgot, you can also pick up mutations to up strength and specifically get marsupial to give you +25 carry weight as well. Slap on Class Freak max and Starched Genes and it’s almost better to have every mutations except empath and herd mentality if solo.
---
youre arent holding the industry to account here.  
---
youre soliciting opinions and then arguing.
---
You can build by a chopped wood pile. If you want to see an example of that, there is a big pile of split wood in the shed of a building in the town of Helvetia right at the crossroads at the outskirts (It's attached the Baker's shop). I think some of them refresh every server hop. My CAMP is on an island in the Cranberry Bog with a beaver dam nearby. I can harvest the logs every day for a large amount of wood, enough to build an entire new CAMP if I slap on the Wood Chucker perk card before I gather it.
---
Lucky!
---
im not.  i just voiced it.  
---
i suggested you try enjoying it without the media lens.  
---
do what you will.
---
I only had to see the title. Yes please. Deathclaws are p***ies in 4 and 76. It's really annoying how they went from being a serious threat to being a bunch of pushovers because if there was only one you could deal with it easily even if they move fast. With a group you have to think about how you're going to deal with them.
---
Actually laughing so hard that you believe this impossibility so hard as to repeat it this much and with so much confidence. Truly hit the jackpot today didn’t I?
---
I googled it for anyone who's curious.  FO76 sold 1.4 Million digital copies prior to last Christmas, no record of physical sales that I could find.  No data for additional sales over the past 6 months (or preowned sales).  And this sub has 187k subscribers at the moment.
---
How do you keep this stabilized. It recoils like an upset horse.
---
cool beans.
---
I would actually find Fallout 76 Battle Royale interesting if they had it set *during* the nuclear war and areas becoming inaccessible by nuclear bombs going off. The entire west Virginia map pristine pre-war that is slowly turned to hell with bombs
---
Wow. This. Is just a strange concept. Just play the game. Lol.
---
Came here to say this
---
For some at least - I've paid a few different people caps and mats to mod my X01, so it's definitely not a widespread issue.
---
Dude I'm loosing my mind. The comments in this post are all about the SBQ but you're totally right he's talking about SB. In that case I totally agree with you they are fine the way they are. It's intimidating early game but after level 50 you can take it down pretty easily with your build. I guess I couldn't compute in my mind he meant a run of the mill SB. Ugh I'm sorry dude I think a lot of other people are confused like me and don't even realize it.
---
I refuse to think you worked on any gaming related software. The janitor somewhere maybe but certainly not in on the projects lmao
---
I'm pretty sure Scorch Beasts have a ridiculous amount of ER, and Anti-Armor only applies to DR making Energy weapons sub-par for dealing with Scorch Beasts/Queen even with a Prime receiver and splitter on my Gatling Plasma (I can melt Sheepsquatch in like a second flat) Scorch Beast for some reason can eat like 150+ shots before keeling over.
---
This made me literally ROFL... I don't think my son will ever think of me the same.
---
Also he rambles on about the SBQ at the end of his post that was the only part I heard apparently.
---
The canvas bag glitches through someone's face...
---
Spam the Mini Nuke and hide them on an alt
---
Small suggestion, I’d consider 3 perception and put green thumb on when you farm or are looking for specific plants. Put the point into intelligence so you can bump makeshift to 5, for added life in your weapons and craft every mod. 
---
But in the end, as long as you enjoy the game it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks.
---
Look me up. I just moved my camp and went through this. Not thrilled with the location, so it wouldn’t hurt to move again.
---
Yeah I'm maxed out on my stash space, but that's because I have some weapons I want to keep in it
---
Hmm .... so trying to stimulate discussion while fielding opinions and response isn't a means to accomplish accountability?
---
Not sure you understand how this works.   Silence clearly does not lead to accountability.  Killing discussion does not lead to accountability either.
---
Yup I have a rad shower next to my pool and would give a disease cure to anyone at my pool party I have had a pool build for awhile now and people love it. And yours being indoors is fantastic and I love it. If anyone's interested it was shown on Miz Traceys youtube channel camp showcase 6
---
They literally have an entire studio that solely works on 76. I am flabbergasted by your words
---
Yeah starred
---
It just works
---
yeah. I have Ultracite PA with Excavator legs moded with calibrated shocks.  gets me the carry weight of calibrated.  I cannot find decent mods for the ultracite PA so this is a workaround.  Skinned as the war rider so you can't tell it's a franken-Armor.  The blackbird apparently needs specific armor types to work.
---
Instead of 'pew pew' does it sound like stirring Mac &amp; Cheese? Asking for a friend.
---
Wtf is lev
---
We say level, lvl or L. Sto hal pronoun stu lik thi.
---
Stability .... a NEW DLC ... can't wait until game developers start adding a price tag to that novelty and special treat.
---
Nice! 👍👍
---
There are some items in the game that can't be renamed.
---
I have created a scheme of renaming to organize my backpack
---
(PA) _&lt;power armor type&gt;_
---
[&lt;Weapon Category&gt;].&lt;Weapon Type&gt;.&lt;Legendary Bonuses&gt;
---
[&lt;Armor Category&gt;].&lt;Armor Location&gt;.&lt;Legendary Bonuses&gt;
---
Armor Category is Helmet, Head, Eyes, Mouth, Chest, Arm, and Leg.
---
Armor Locations can be R for Right, and L for Legs.
---
For example:
---
Excavator Power Armor is (PA) _Excavator_
---
Explosive Shotgun is [Shotgun].Combat.(BoomStick)
---
Chest item is [Chest].Luck.(Regen)
---
Arm is [Arm].R.(Luck) or [Arm].L.(Cha)
---
Leg is [Leg].R.(Cha).{SneakHide} or [Leg].L.(Luck).{Vanguard}
---
Miscellaneous items:
---
[_Hat_].White.Fedora
---
[_Camera_]
---
[_0.0_].Binoculars
---
In effect:
---
the Power armor lists at the top of my Armor tab because parenthesis () come before the letter A in ASCII
---
The items that start with brackets [] appear at the bottom of the list.
---
The addition of underscore after a bracket means those items with underscore come after the items with only brackets.
---
I rarely need to change my outfit, so [__Outfit__] will be on the bottom of the list. (that has 2 underscores)
---
Underscore comes AFTER brackets.
---
I hope this helps.
---
I just wanted to roam the wastes with friends and be a dick to every npc in sight.
---
You know maybe roleplay some good cop bad cop shit
---
350? What does that number relate to? It’s going to max 200 charge for a fusion core and plasma cores I’d assume the same
---
The new game mode is called nuclear winter
---
I spent hours on my camp and it wont blueprint. But I have two random foundations that wont delete. I really hope they fix this asap
---
I dropped by and found liberators last night.
---
Nah. That's not what it is. Same thing happens to people in PA
---
I still haven’t gotten my bag in the mail yet.  Anyone else?
---
What platform dude?
---
Oh damn I didn’t. I’ve already found marsupial and speed demon, and will also go for healing, twisted muscles and grounded. Any other suggestions?
---
I can't find any reference to Todd Howard making those comments at E3 anywhere.  Perhaps you could provide a link?
---
I only eat dog food in game, and every time I eat a can of it I say it should be cat food!  😂
---
Xbox One. Changing the description now, thanks for heads up haha.
---
Suddenly the launcher is duped and everyone in the crowd has a bag launcher too
---
Sending you a request now.  Thanks!
---
Maybe remove it from Adventure Mode but not completely. I hate PvP in 76 but I think a good compromise would be a 1 PvE mode and 1 PvP mode. Adventure and Survival. We don't really need more than that. Split each update 50/50 for both modes. Adding another mode like BR just complicates things.
---
I’m level 49 and the event free range is by top of the world isn’t it? I have a camp there and the event pops up and we (my friend and I) tried it and the wolves were fine however it moved into radtoads and then three Yao guai so we didn’t get the quest completed. What do you get from it?
---
Damn. I'm on PS4.
---
No worries, I'm on PC, shame I'm looking for some free range team ups too.
---
Hi on ps4., I'm dad.
---
The no clip documentary is a great example. They stated in pretty much everything before release that it would continue to grow and evolve for years 3,4, 5, however many years people want to play it. You did no research, got called out, got defensive because you look dumb. Gotcha.
---
Occasionally I get that bug too
---
I tried to do that but I was working with a small space. So I blueprinted most of the camo and just replaced the camp at the same spot. So frustrating ly painful
---
YouTube original Fallout76 advertisement.  It does not say "polished masterpiece" but it doesn't say what it truly was either.  And of the two, it is far closer to saying "polished" than it is to saying "turd".
---
The charge for ammo quantity. The condition increases to 200% max, but the charge is the number of shots. My 46 intelligence gets me a plasma core loaded into my Gatling plasma with 500 shots.
---
Yes. There are a few wood resources around, big logs like a workshop that you can build your camp near and build a resource gatherer on.
---
It’s in multiple locations. Yes it does get progressively harder. But boi you wait for that sheepsquatch. I believe spawns at level 80. Uh, Legendaries for sure (Always legendary sheepsquatch) Bumch of xbox just from killing everything else lol. Extra loot for protecting brahmin (not sure what. Haven’t completed it either.) And some sheepsquatch type weapons. Good farm tho. Quick one.
---
Ah alright. Good luck though
---
Oh yeah that makes sense, thanks.
---
Okay so yeah it just means they designed it so that scorchbeasts are the toughest enemies to use energy weapons against (which kinda makes sense because of how heavily mutated they are) but it does suck because the battling plasma is one of my favorite weapons but it just means that miniguns and 50 cals are the better choice versus scorchbeasts
---
Im reslly out of the loop here, E3 is tomorrow? What time again??
---
I see that I have the status "Scarly Skin" which gives me -50 AP. When I cure that status I have 70 AP which isn't even the base stat of 105? dafaque
---
an addiction? meaning I play the game too much?
---
"No Clip" Documentary?  Link?
---
It was Mr Gutsy who hit the Assaultron dominator over the head with a critical vats shot with a broken lamp in the parlour.
---
Go over to the overseer camp, walk south towards the group of mongrels and get them to agro you; then throw it near them.
---
The other bit that supports the theory for BR is the story behind the vault and voicelines. All the datamined voicelines are from an AI which was put in charge of a vault that was an experiment on tribalism. The story is revealed to us that all weapons were banned from the vault, and the AI determined the best way to decide who would be overseer is he slowly began introducing weapons and pitting the vault dwellers against eachother. The holotapes that were put into the game as teasers support this as well. Ive just got my fingers crossed that the BR will only be a part of the new game mode and not the entire focus.
---
It’s not close to saying either. It’s a marketing trailer. It’s not a hard concept. Was the game a technical shitshow? Yes. Is bethesda game studios the ultimate evil and Todd Howard the biggest scum bag Antichrist imaginable? No kiddo I’m sorry but you’re just worked up.
---
[Strong liked that.]
---
Did you not read the roadmap?? Look at the little badge. "New Gamemode Nuclear Winter"
---
Fr? Idk then in the clip you did small chip damage at random amounts until he gets stunned hence why he can now take damage from Sentinel not working
---
I'm about to go to work but I'd be down to anytime as I still need plans out of it and it's not bad xp/legendary/ ballistic fiber farming. Also looking to do project paradise for the first time and whenever I get recall cards Encryptid event since I want plans from that one as well.

---
Bethesda’s e3 presentation is tomorrow evening, i think 830 eastern. I don’t know about the rest of E3
---
u/CarterG4 absolute pandemonium.
---
Its more of a "Pa schew"
---
As in you took too much of something (psycho mentors etc) and it’s lowering your AP.  There’s no way to tell easily, just pop an addictol and see if the brings you AP back up.
---
To be fair, Fasnacht was based off the real Fasnacht event. Unsure when it happens IRL, but I assume it would be around the same time Bethesda tossed in game for that week in March
---
Hi on pc, shame , I'm dad.
---
Maybe even like a notification like “hunting the hunters event has chosen you as the target, do you accept?” With a yes or no option.
---
Alright! Let me know when you’re on.
---
If you’d want I’d play some time to grind (sounds like a fun event) I’m a bit low so if needed I can get to a higher level my gamertag is Igiveuponwords 
---
Probably couldn’t do it now as I got a few jobs to do but I’d still love to do it another time
---
There’s a roadmap? I thought they were just chugging along with no plans in mind, that is how the game was released broken, right?
---
everyone knows that red dildos make better suppressors...
---
I used it on brahman cows in flatwoods, worked for me
---
Yeah man, love to have you with us. Just let me know when you’re on. Ah, doesn’t matter your level.
---
It’s a YouTube channel. I’m not wasting my time doing the research you didn’t. Honestly just about every time the developers were interviewed they talked about this game growing and improving for as long as players would support it with playtime
---
No my entire point was that it was content made for all level players from low level to high level.
---
oops nvm.. the vault boy is actually walking around pretty happy I must say. No addiction I guess. I do have the Scarly Skin status which gives me -50 AP. When I cure the status I will have 70 AP which isn't even the base of 105 AP. ugh..
---
There was a recent poll of 1600 players and about 5% listed PvP as one of their favorite activities. My issue with survival mode is that spending time and resources on a mode few players enjoy takes away from the things players DO enjoy. There is a question of how much more
---
Enjoyment players would get from PvP if it were any good, but I think the majority of players aren’t interested no matter how good it is, or like me, just think it’s too clunky and just not a good fit for the game in general.
---
It would fire an actual explosive, representative of how everything has blown up in Todd's face recently
---
Does the atomic shop and being able to buy atoms not generate revenue? Fixing the game would keep people playing and buying atoms.
---
wtf now all a sudden I have 40 AP while I haven't changed anything. Im flabbergasted
---
This isn't my shop by the way, I'm just the customer who's second in the queue.
---
Yeah. The max is 30 intelligence for a 100% bonus condition for 200% condition total or double the base “mag size” from the cores charge
---
Cleaner walls! Yes, Bethesda please! Give us clean wall options!
---
Ive never seen that
---
I think they are fine. They arent that difficult but encountering them does provide some challenge when they appear. The queen could use more consistent better drops but even so it's not a big deal. It's the way the game is, dont need to complain that you dont always get cool stuff

---
made a few tweeks to make it a little bit better overall, if you are not going power armor then adamatium skeleton is a must because you will have broken limbs like crazy, fireproof is also a nice addition so you are not blown to bits
---
What sorts of stuff can you get from the event? Only thing I’ve gotten so far is a plan for the staff you herd the Brahmin with.
---
When you're in a party chat and somebody goes "I'm done" after blue screening or failing to get their loot drop, then see them the next day. That's Fo76
---
There's a few reasons for that.  The biggest is that lots of people don't have encyclopedic knowledge of vendor prices.  Then there is no way of knowing what the selling price is for a given item because there is no transaction log for sales as a whole.  Then you have people who put them up for sale just so they make a few caps rather than dropping them on the ground.  All of that together results in a system where no one can figure out how to price something appropriately - If you take a vendor plan that can be bought for 5k and sell for 4k, that's a 20% discount, but little Johnny doesn't know that 5k is the vendor price and thinks it's too much.  So people lower prices just to get items to move.  Personally, I'll take a lower sale price if it means I get higher volume of sales.
---
Does anyone know the cycle rate for the shop?
---
Hahahaha you are joking right, Starfield will probably be released in 2020/2021 and Falllout 5 probably around 2026/2027.  
---
Also clearly you haven’t done any of the Camera quest because it does in fact bring you to the Mire.
---
I can’t remember what I used mine on, I think ticks? I’m not sure
---
Not sure of everything. Definitely legendaries, bunch of xp from those yao guis and such. Not sure the loot from the event itsef tho
---
If you were a big trader or on the the 76 market with a list of what you got then yeah
---
Are you sure you learned an outfit plan and not one of the mods for the outfits? IE; Learning BOS resistant underarmor won't allow you to make underarmor, just mod the different underarmors
---
So which set offers the best energy and balistic resistance?
---
Ok, so I just crafted an ultracite plasma core with 33 Intelligence and it gives me 350 shots/charges/rounds whatever you wanna call them. With a 46 intelligence I get 500.
---
Question, is there any mod or anything that will allow me to get coordinates manually from exploring or would that get me banned from Bethesda?  Thinking of gathering the data myself. Any tips would be much appreciated!
---
Ah, gotcha.  Im not that hard core
---
Well that isn’t how it’s supposed to be working so submit that to their support site as they’ve said 30 will cap the benefits. Still not sure that’s correct maybe you’re losing intelligence from some sources
---
it's 6 months kid, they're about to start shipping, crying over a bag lmfao
---
They don't explain it at all, but you can't just drop it. You have to equip it like a grenade and throw it. That will activate it, and nearby creatures will come to eat it and blow up.
---
I have a bloodied ffr that seems like no slouch...

Sounds about right. Hahaha
---
Mutations in my opinion are an endgame type of deal. After you've done all there is to do and got your favorite weapons and armor, it's time for a little fun! This is fallout for crying out loud! When has it ever been meant to be serious?
---
Lol, yeah I've been working on this for a while now. Even have another post about it. 
---
I was curious the extent in which intelligence can actually be valuable outside the experience bonus. 
---
But the OP asked about magazine size. This is how you get a larger quantity of shots in this game. Wether it's designed this way or is an error on their part, this is the way it currently is.
---
Ya know I meant to put months but typed out years without thinking and when I read it I laughed so I kept it. Little boy.
---
I mean intelligence *is* intended to give bonus condition upon crafting an item like a plasma core
---
Bloodied is easy to manage. Just be radiated at all times. Also be ready to die at all times.
---
I do like your build though.

Dont items say their value when you look at them in the inventory? And i know they show how much their selling for and how much their worth in the camp-vendor menu too
---
There are two bowlers, only one counts as formal wear and I don't remember which. I know the three piece suit counts, and the silver shroud costume if you bought that
---
With 1 or 2 points in Fireproof and a Dense mod on your chest you can still rock your TSE weapons as a bloodied build. My BE shotgun does negligible splash damage, and half the time Serendipity procs and saves me anyway.
---
I have been wanting this for long.  Dragon Age had this back in 2009.
---
TuRret INsuRaNCe OnLY 1200 AtOms
---
Yeah just killed a lvl 50 one with my Instigating, Limb Damage Gatling and it only took like 40 shots...
---
I have full Sentinal assassin and I can tell you for sure that it doesnt negate this much damage anymore. I get 2 shot all the time AMD this railway is way stronger than handmades.
---
Hey, people are circlejerking here, number one rule of a circlejerk is no eye contact, number two rule is don't interrupt it!
---
My bloodied character with a high cap backpack and 4 pieces of deep pocket armor has a carrying capacity of 455 or something when I'm at 20% health. At this point I hate using PA because I lose 100lbs of capacity.
---
Yes.  I actually run away from them now...   Before, I ran to stay alive... now, it's to save bullets...
---
Yeah, that's what I read in the description. I wanted to test it to see how far it can go. I'm really only missing one intelligence from possible max in game stats. Just need an Unyielding left leg with +1 intelligence. Then I can get the maximum possible intelligence to craft some stuff with. I'm excited to see the outcome.
---
Which armor set would you recommend for a more neutral play? Highest resistance against damage of any type?
---
Still safely in that 4 to 6 month time frame.
---
It’s a pretty fun event to just grind I suppose. Last night I saw it pop in the NW corner of the map, but it might have been a big.
---
It is in that area. It has multiple locations.
---
I’m just excited that we’ll finally have an answer instead of everyone speculating what is going to be what.  I waited specifically until real info came out before assuming what is coming based on very little.
---
You can find the mods in the Command Center of the Bunker. The modus terminals there have the mods. They are random. Not currently learnable.
---
Im excited but i will watch after stream only want to focus on the fallout 76 aspect without having to be bothered with filler
---
👍🏻
---
Very excited. I keep wishing it were tomorrow already.
---
I'm hoping BSG figures out the Survival mode so all the workshop PVP losers will harass each other in Survival and no longer need to feed their  sociopathic nature in Adventure.  Best news possible is Adventure eliminates PVP completely - workshops will be timed and you lose ownership after 2 hours if someone else wants to use it otherwise you can keep using it. Make PVP whatever it needs to be to get these guys out of Adventure forever.
---
How does one farm Free Range? I thought they were random. Is there a spawn trigger?
---
Stop being a cunt to people asking for help
---
Powerful creatures like deathclaws 😂🤣
---
Agreed, I think people take datamined stuff into account and try to draw a conclusion from that and take it as confirmation that what they think is true. If the new mode is Battle Royale I wouldn't honestly care. It's free content at the end of the day and we're getting soooo much more like the Vault raids.
---
They built on a preexisting foundation. Hence why I said Arktos was the house whilst Eckhart was the Horseman
---
I found when I was in PA weight reduction armor was a rare drop, as soon as I got out of the PA it started dropping regularly and I get a new piece every day. I now have full sets of every type, weapon, junk, food and chems and swap out a couple pieces when Im loaded up to tune my set and squeeze more weight in. I started using sturdy frame perk to reduce the weight of my weight reducing armor and now I cant step into my PA anymore without being overweight, unless I just did a big cleanout. I find I can just play longer, collect more stuff and spend less time worrying about house keeping.
---
Heavy combat chest with heavy leather limbs is popular, but id recommend heavy metal limbs, then just get extra backpack mods to swap to suit the situation
---
The "value" on the interface and the default selling value in the vendor machine is not the same as the vendor price.  Small letter set is like, 10 or 12k from a vendor without perks/charisma, buthe the vendor machine default is like 1k.  
---
What I meant by "what they are selling for" is lets say 10 players are selling the same item.  A makes a sale for 500c, but the other 9 don't know that a sale was made at that price.  B might have them set at 400c, but the buyer also doesn't know that unless they check all fo the vendors then remember who sold waht for the lowest price.  Basically, the current configuration leaves a lot of room for market inefficiencies.  Compare vending machines to a typical auction house that lets players see the price of sale for the last 10 sales for a given item.  If we had that, people could set better prices.
---
Uhhhh can't you just crouch?
---
YEAH! You should just let companies falsely advertise to you! There's nothing wrong with that! Don't be such a cry baby!
---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm level 111 and you just taught me this. FML.
---
When the sbq is in the air I shoot it with an endangerol syringe and then hit her with the shotty/Enforcer perk. Soon as she lands, it's my 3star DC guantlet, orbital grenades and nuke Mines
---
It is random. But they only spawn in a select few locations. Just either hop servers til you find one, or go to other locations.
---
Ah, ok. I've seen it at 3 locations, and thought it was random. Was hoping to learn a trigger, cause that'd be cool.
---
Never said you should let them, feel free to riot, boycott, all that, but whining about a damn bag like a kid is pointless
---
Yeah it’s 3 I believe. It’s just find one
---
Yea one just counted. It was a legendary from an event
---
Radioactive swimming pool reminds me of maniac mansion 1.
---
Why the heavy metal limbs?  I've been looking to fill out my armor lately and I'm also curious on what I should be hunting for
---
I got the Mire and Cranberry Bog mixed up  .... but yeah, it does bring you to the Mire, but no where near Cranberry Bog, the highest level area of the game.... you know where the End Game is.
---
I've already seen what happens when an online game that's not doing so hot implements a Battle Royale and becomes popular because of it. If this ends up being a Battle Royale then I think I might just be done with Fallout 76 sadly, otherwise I'll be happy to try out whatever new mode they come up with.
---
Very much wish I had more than one upvote to give this post.
---
FO76 zealots are my favorite zealots
---
Ze enclave bunker
---
Thanks for the pointers, I really like your idea of making floating houses on the water. Definitely bearing that in mind!
---
Fatman works well with Instigating, Auto Nade launcher would work well with two shot from what a friend says. 
---
Furious would be awful with the fatman
---
You’re completely avoiding my point. This content, unlike all the other content, is for everyone. 
---
To do these quests you don’t need to be lvl 100+, or have the best gear, etc. That’s amazing
---
Do you think that maybe, just maybe you’re in the wrong here? Since this post has 150 comments and you don’t have a single upvote? 
---
Also, please stop using ellipses (...) it’s annoying as hell
---
That's gonna be some complicated postage.
---
At E3, Howard’s comments were during the discussion of the beta. I took them as a bigger picture commentary, but it could be construed otherwise. 
---
However, Chris Mayer (development director) discusses post launch plans at length in the NoClip documentary that came out that same week. It’s unambiguous. Plans were in place, but the game would evolve as time goes on. His relevant commentary starts at 31:00. 
---
https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs
---
This is exactly what has happened since launch, messaging from Bethesda has been consistent with it as well.
---
😂😂😂
---
I literally just said you should speak your mind and let Bethesda know you're on to their bullshit as long as its not just some whining that won't get anything odne
---
Its cool ive been to his bunker, we can just fast travel there
---
No ... I just re-watched that clip ... had no idea what it was called last June when it came out.  It does not say anything that you claim it to.  Not even close.  In fact it suggests Fasnacht is part of the existing game, and that the game will open with player vending as part of it. ... both since added later as additional content instead of start up material.
---
Commando perk currently effects Gatling plasma damage didn't know that? I have a explosive furious plasma and didn't know till yesterday that demolition perk doesn't work on explosive energy weapons.
---
“Vaguely” lol
---
Only if you have RobCo prime.
---
The datamined lunch boxes heavily implied pay to win once a upon a time...
---
Yeah I’d personally just run bear arms then have multiple heavy weapons, I have just a bloodied gattling plasma and I only take it out in certain situations or if I’m running out of 50 ammo
---
I'd probably go with a mix of vanguard and bolstering so that you're covered on both ends. Or, just get 4 pieces of vanguard and a chameleon piece, and spam stim packs to keep the bonus.
---
Thanks for the advice, Endurance is the stat I really understand the least. I’m guessing with phrama farma on backup the idea is to farm when I’m running low rather than hovering up chems all the time? Makes sense.
---
Not being a cunt. I’m providing commentary on the transition of game lingo that is unneeded and unwanted.
---
The same way people are now saying LTB or LTP instead of WTB/WTS/WTT.  Too confusing to change jargon just to look hip (or be lazy and disregard an established culture norm).
---
Only thing I’m hoping for is some kind of Fallout 3/ New Vegas remaster. Nothing else matters to me
---
To be really fair, June 12 of 2018, a documentary was released in which Bethesda suggested the Game would start with this event in it and 10 acquirable masks.
---
You speaking what I'm already doing lol
---
My daily drivers are that Gatling, a FE/TSE Gatling Plasma (I have more than 1) and a FE Harpoon Gun
---
Yeah, and having a monstrous deathclaw in my stash certainly is temping! We’ll see, I’m pretty committed to this build this time.
---
How did I whine? Seriously. I didn’t even buy the damn power armor edition so I’m not whining about or expecting a canvas bag. I was making a joke. People do it on reddit all the time.
---
Cringe normie bruh
---
if they gave random plans and ammo they'd be infinitely more useful to kill
---
Dang figured it was worth a shot. Hope you find a workaround
---
What time does e3 start?
---
Not bad I use a unarmed build  is it a one handed sneak build?
---
Quad is always a good one to have with explosive
---
none of what youre doing leads to accountability.   stop buying video games is your only option.
---
Yeah basically I think. If I found an instigating power fist like I did in my sniper build I’d totally switch to unarmed.
---
good luck out there.
---
D'aww. Glad you had some fun.
---
Especially for starched genes. There's a good amount of mutations I'd love to use when needed but having to potentially lose my other 5 mutations and spending well over 1000 caps each time I want to try one out just isn't worth it atm.
---
No I mean if it should be Metall, Marine ect
---
Yeah fair point but you did it in a completely dickish way intentionally trying to belittle op  and make yourself feel superior so in my what I assume is unwanted opinion you’re being a cunt.
---
Oh that would be great.  He can feel free to shoot one all the way over to my house since I bought the power armor edition on an open-box deal (labeled 'used' on the receipt) last month, right after the deadline.  Really though it's not that big of a deal to me.  It just would've been nice to get what everyone else is getting.  To be fair though, I only paid $81.09, and everything was there and sealed except for the broken package seal on the outer box.
---
Cool
---
Thanks, that's all really useful info to know. I'll keep these posts on a tab for reference as I go forwards.
---
God Howard be praised!
---
I bought get some but cannot seem to apply them to my armor....any ideas what I am doing wrong?
---
Fixing the game would require paying the development team for several months at least, which adds up quickly.
---
So, do you spend X dollars to fix a product where the only new revenue you would see from that investment is Y% increase in atom shop purchases? 
---
How much of a percentage of Y would you need to break even after spending X dollars on repair?
---
Yeah those are weird because they don't say which piece they go to. Like polymer limb or deep pocket limb. They just say polymer or deep pocket. So you gotta apply it to the right piece.
---
You can still play the core game, that won't be affected. Bit like when they brought us Survival mode, I don't like it, so I don't play it.
---
Cool I'll add you when I'm on again we should try to figure out a time when we can all be on what's your time zone? and what's a good time for you?
---
Not sure where you see me saying the things you are quoting me as saying.
---
I have said that I liked FallOut 76 in this thread (not loved) and never called Howard a "scum bag Antichrist" or anything near to this claim you are making.  I have posited the opinion that this game is not Howard's focus, nor what he cares about, beyond what it does in sales.  Indicating that someone is a businessman and that I think his sales technique/modas operandi lacks integrity is not calling him names like you suggest.
---
I use unarmed its fun but its not as strong compared to one and two handed
---
You want mirelurks? Because that's how you get mirelurks.
---
Thanks I will what time zone are you in? I'm uk time zone, on late nights as well
---
Scaly Skin is a mutation.  Mutation negatives can be nerfed with Class Freak (3 ranks) by 75%.  Also, Strange In Numbers increases the positive mutation parts by 25% if your teammate also has that mutation.
---
a model and some textures is a lot easier to scrap than recorded voice lines.
---
Freedom of Speech is as valuable as it is, very clearly because it does lead to accountability.  Maybe you missed that part of democratic education?
---
List SPECIAL, any and all effects on Status tab, PERKS loaded, and gear, please.

Microsoft - Sunday, June 9, 1pm Pacific Time 
---
The folks behind Xbox have been making fascinating moves with Game Pass and xCloud, but they still have a lot to prove when it comes to first-party games. It’s safe to expect Gears 5 and Halo Infinite, but what else does Phil Spencer have hiding under his video game t-shirts? With Sony out of the picture, this will be the one remaining place for big third-party gameplay trailers. Some safe guesses include Borderlands 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. And is it too much to hope for a Rocksteady reveal?
---
Bethesda - Sunday, June 9, 5:30pm Pacific Time
---
After the disastrous launch of Fallout 76, it’ll be interesting to see how Bethesda handles this one. Will they address their online game’s issues? Ignore it in favor of Doom Eternal and whatever new announcements they’ve got coming? Or just spend the whole time talking about Quake Champions?
---
Ubisoft - Monday, June 10, 1pm Pacific Time
---
Ubisoft’s always good for a surprise or two, and this year should be no exception. Assassin’s Creed is skipping this year, so don’t expect to see Vikings just yet, but perhaps it’s time for Watch Dogs 3? We should get a new look at Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. Maybe we’ll see Pioneer, the game that was teased a few years ago and now looks very different than it once did.
---
Square Enix - Monday, June 10, 6pm Pacific Time
---
Last year’s Square Enix show was one of the most disappointing E3 presentations in recent memory, in large part because the publisher failed to even mention two of its biggest announced games, The Avengers and Final Fantasy VII: Remake. This year, that should change. We hope.
---
Nintendo - Tuesday, June 11, 9am Pacific Time
---
As usual, Nintendo will be holding a digital presentation to talk about all things Switch, likely highlighted by Animal Crossing and this year’s Pokémon games. We probably won’t see Metroid Prime 4, but we’ll definitely see the new Fire Emblem and Super Mario Maker 2. One game we won’t see: Reggie Fils-Aime. :(
---
This year there are also a handful of smaller events, including Devolver Digital (June 9, 7pm PT), the PC Gaming Show (June 10, 10am PT), and the Kinda Funny Showcase (June 10, 4:30pm PT), all of which should be good for at least a few interesting indie announcements.
---
It only stays in the world limited time, but no one can take it if that's what you're asking.
---
Well they're certainly more powerful than a radroach 😁
---
I have a 2 star my favorite of hundreds of weapons
---
Ya because this game, with all its issues, needs a goddamn battle royale
---
Well I logged back in and the quest isn't in my list anymore, no idea how to get it back.
---
Cool! Thanks, I'm beyond excited
---
Nylon bags would be funnier. They probably still have some lying around that they'll never use too.
---
Oh well I wasn’t too sure lol but yeah I guess just save the gattling plasma (sadly) for sheepsquatches and stuff unless you don’t mind the ammo cost for using more bullets 💀
---
Content being delayed is perfectly normal and healthy. Common as well. It happens. What you’re seeing are the closing months of development figuring out the best possible state they can release the game in given the time and resources they’ve been allotted by the business side of the corporation. Not Todd. Not any of the dev team. This is a real world situation and apparently more complicated than you realized.
---
The truth is that as far as armor performance is concerned, its type (leather vs raider vs combat etc) is irrelevant and can be ignored.
---
The math that is happening in this game is in 'layers' and the whole DR thingy is just one of those layers. I assume you are PvE.
---
First off you need to define minimum set of your defensive perks. It contains fireproof and adamant skeleton for vast majority of good builds. I know adamant doesn't reduce the damage, it reduces the stagger (that happens once you break your leg) and prevents your character from entering unresponsive state.
---
Then, when the defensive layers of perks are defined, its time for chest mod. If you don't know what you are doing you certainly need dense mod.
---
After that is put in place you need to think about your desired playstyle. There are three main archetypes of armor used commonly, and two more that are neglected but still great. The first three are assassin, sentinel and hoarder (weight reduction), and next useful two are sneaker and blocker, the last one pretty much PvP only. For PvE, its finding the right balance between standing, running, sneaking and carrying lots of stuff. Sneaking is the cheapest build to use on so many levels, one of them is 2.5x the damage each sneak shot and every shot is a sneak shot once you learn such character and that makes one handmades magazine equal to 20+ killed mutants.
---
For majority of the PvE players with your constraints for what they look for it'll end up as vangaurds sentinel, vanguards cavalier or vanguards harder to detect while sneaking, the last one kinda pointless, lowHP builds are the best sneakers.
---
Well you’ve already capped out if you’re at 200% unless the game is completely broken and even that doesn’t work. An unfortunate possibility
---
the shadowed worked on the legs and arms that's as far as i got
---
Me to but weapons aren't my problem I have been hoarding junk
---
Why wouldnt you just take the workshop for free and gets caps off him after initiating pvp after claiming the workshop? Who cares about a level 28?
---
Do you have a link to the audio? I've tried searching a few times, but I just get clickbaity shitty YouTubers that have never proven themselves a reliable source of information on anything.
---
Except that the game launched with a noted and reviewed "lack or content".  All the major reviews made specific reference to the emptiness of the World and how little there was to do.  I am merely asking did all of the content that was intended for launch actually make it into the game at launch ... or was it now added as somehow being something to "keep the game fresh" as the No Clip documentary suggests.  Considering a good amount of the content that we have gotten in Wild Appalachia is either referenced or shown while they are talking about what the game already is as it is packaged for sending out and not what it will be, i still hold by my question.
---
Also the part I was speaking of specifically was the older gentleman assuring everyone they know a game like this (an online game as a service) lives or dies by how fast they can pump out content.
---
The light go dark, the audience wonders what game will be announced next. Somebody in the distance cackles, could it be The Evil Within 3? Music, almost at the edge of perception plays. It's hard to make out, but as loud footsteps fill the room the music gets louder. "Tell me lies," you can make out.
---
"It can't be," you say to your hot girlfriend that you take pictures of for karma on /r/gaming.
---
Todd walks out, the music goes up to 12, knocking people out of their seats. Behind Todd he's pulling a massive Red Rider wagon, thins falling off the side and onto the floor.
---
You scream, "Todd, have sex with my girlfriend while I watch."
---
Todd holds up one finger, everybody falls silent. He holds up one of the things that fell off the wagon. "Canvas bags"
---
The audience screams again.
---
"You know," Todd says, "I really like canvas bags, and when I heard you guys weren't getting them I went out and got some of my own. These are not just any canvas bags, they are stitched together with my hair."
---
You hear the sound of a thousand orgasms.
---
Todd lifts up a gun connected to a chute on the wagon, "Then I heard you assholes blamed me for the canvas bags. So you know what? I'm going to give each and every one of you a canvas bag and you're going to like it."
---
The first bag flies out and decapitates a person in the front row, a mob rushes to grab the bag, but more bags are shot into the crowd, cutting them down, and sending entrails flying into the rows behind them. 
---
A bag flies into your girlfriend stomach, she's pinned to the seat, blood shoots out of her. "Finally, I get my canvas bag," she says as she dies from hemorrhagic shock.
---
Bags fly past you, but you want one so bag. You reach out to grab one and it rips your hand off. You flail your arms, sending blood into the band from Todd Howard Middle School. The few remaining live children savor the feeling of the blood from a hand that touched one of Todd's canvas bags.
---
"You assholes like it?" Screamed Todd. "You like your fucking canvas bags?"
---
A bag flies past your head and embed itself into the concrete wall behind you. You grab it, and spikes shoot out into your remaining hand. Todd's venom fills your blood stream. You finally get to feel the sweet taste of death. But no, you don't feel death, your missing hand grows back, and you shrink two feet. Could it be? 
---
You feel your hair, perfect. You feel your abs, a 16 pack. Your genitals are girthfull. You're turning into Todd Howard. You don't know how long you've been standing there, but you feel a strong hand grip your shoulder. You look to see who would dare touch your godly visage. It's Todd.
---
"Well Todd," says Todd, "it's looks like you and me are best friends now."
---
You chuckle. "Let's go visit the Cyberpunk 2077 demo and show them what a real RPG is."
---
Yeah, that's the thing. When I look at the condition bar of my 500 charges, it's not maxed out in the double. Then I had some weird bug where they all stacked in one stack even though they had different charges. I'm burning through the rest of them to start over. Just a matter of time.
---
this sounds like a /r/NotTimAndEric sketch haha
---
It's an online game. There is constantly a team working on it to fix it and keep it running. Your arguments only make sense if it was an offline game. The microtransactions are what let them continue to work on the game. Also there are games that only get their revenue through microtransactions (free to play games)..
---
I use the civil war era suit and hat.
---
I clicked on it by mistake at lvl25. I could see 1 friendly arrow but he was somewhere i could not find... And being chased around by all kinds of high lvl stuff i dont even know if i remember one bit of that place 😄
---
Me too, I hope we get some info on new quests and Wastelanders tease cause that's the DLC I'm most excited to find out more about.
---
( Please introduce Automatron building and NPCs, I beg of thee )
---
Making a joke out of a shitshow. How "epic".
---
They’ve patched the vertibot one now haven’t they. It gives you a lot less xp
---
I had to wander around in there for a while to get it.
---
Google leveling service FO76
---
They havnt even got Survival right yet. This would be such a shitty move.
---
THIS ISN’T FALLOUT 5!? /s
---
Ok hold up we don’t know how that system will work slow down
---
Guys with girl Avatars dressing like that creep me out.
---
Thanks it’s great to play with others. Would I need a mic (is probably be a bit shy as I haven’t played with strangers on any games in months) but I stolid would be willing to try.
---
But Ultracite is not a stock version. It is supposed to be an improved model of the T51b. T51b ***is the stock version.***
---
Quite frankly, I am not concerned by up or down votes.  Only discussion.
---
The Backpack Scout challenges, to me look precisely like content that should be initiated early upon exiting the Vault as opposed to gone back over at high levels after having already done all of the things asked already 100s of times to get to level 150 in the first 5 months after game launch.  Or, in other words content that is intended for playing when the first players begin playing ... not 6 months later.  As does the "Bucket List" ... 
---
In spite of the 150 comments in here, there are really very very few responders, who respond repeatedly and repeatedly down vote ... it does not mean you are more right, simply because you have down voted more times.
---
I'm in a game anywhere from loading into the world to 3 minutes if I'm lucky. 
---
"Server Disconnected"
---
All day.
---
Wtf
---
Nah man you don’t need a mic. If ya can atleast be in party that’s great.
---
Sweet as
---
Exactly my thoughts as well! 
---
I have collected one of each and never used a single one XD If this got added I’m sure more players would see a benefit from them
---
When will you be on??
---
Those damn artists taking resources away from story content! /s
---
Probably in a couple of hours. It’s 11:21 am here 
---
I’ll try get on as soon as possible but chores yknow they’re horrible
---
MAKE ALL SCORCHBEASTS LEGENDARY
---
Ya because the entire game is being scrapped and turned into a battle royale.
---
Use ya brain
---
You’re taking this way too seriously.
---
A bug or a respawn protection mechanic gone wrong.
---
First, VATS was used here. VATS bullets aren't 'homing bullets' and they will fly on the line they were shot from. This makes it so that a 'snake run' can put you out of bullets path and you can simply dodge the damage. But here we have a stationary target, so that not the issue.
---
Then, VATS shots upon hitting are filling the critical bar. This means that none of the bullets sent there that actually hit the target were registered as hits. Nevermind the explosions on their faces must have been a missed shot lol.
---
Was the target still kinda loading there or were they there for quite a while?
---
Did I say that? Do you really think that this game, with it's awful pvp, should really have a br? Is that really what fallout needs dumb dumb?
---
I appreciate the assist though.
---
My god even the plasma gatlings ammo is bugged to hell. Godd save us.
---
I think it’s fair to assume that at least some of it was intended to be there at the beginning. Whether the delay was intended to work as a content trickle or the result of the game being a rats nest of bugs is debatable. I’d bet it’s a bit of both. 
---
Ultimately, I didn’t find content lacking at release. Was it a buggy mess? Absolutely. But I found a huge world full of lore and stories to explore for a solid 150 hours before anything felt repetitious.
---
Central time zone. I get on about 7pm ish
---
Tonight I have a bunch of free time I can use in the wasteland. So hit me up. With XB1 if you add me I wont see it so what's your GT
---
Oh, I agree with that.  What I am asking is, did they keep some content back from what was originally intended as platform/foundational and add it later, advertising it as "NEW" to help with the keeping the game alive?  And was that decision made because of it being incomplete, or because of lack of alternative material to add gradually to keep the game alive?
---
We already have the Halloween candy item, they could make a treats bowl similar to the punch one to give out stuff like that 
---
(Doesn't have to be specifically candy either)
---
I'd like to see the Halloween decorations in game released as camp items, maybe even create some new/repaired variants in the same style, I dig the whole retro Halloween stuff, and it fits for the game.
---
They can make the Halloween buckets camp items too, or use that for the candy bowl/trick or treating
---
Also the candle lit pumpkins, I need those in my life.
---
Shhhhhhhh don’t let them know
---
Sentinel assassin would not prevent crit bar from loading up. None of the hits, besides last two, were registered as hits.
---
Alright no problem. Haha, yeah. 7/24 PM for me. I’ll be on all night so no prob
---
Please please fix broken challenges. I enjoy achievement hunting, (as many of the people still playing FO76 likely do too) and this really rankles me.
---
oof didn’t see that. You get a treat.
---
Let me hang a bobblehead on my backpack. That gives me the buff i want permanently. 
---
Then theres a perk called "heavy duty chain" that lets you have 2 bobbleheads for 3 perk points in the charisma skill-line.
---
Ey not a bad thought! Would be nice customization as well!
---
Motion retroactively seconded

There are two endings, not positive but I believe the 3 waves of bugs ending has higher chance to give a badge. Cant 100% confirm but when I got them it seems to be with this ending.
---
Sorry, I am a PS4 player.
---
Hmm. I think it maxes out at 500 based on what the other people were saying. May just be a visual bug. But I haven't crafted any since that first batch at 46 Intelligence.
---
I don't care if it has BR or not because it's one gamemode that I don't have to play.
---
Apparently more complicated than Bethesda realized as well ... or the product they released wouldn't have caused them to take such a huge negative hit to their reputation and good name.  Not sure you have noticed, but outside of this forum, the game still has very negative reviews, as no one has moved their original numbers or grades one spec, thought they have acknowledged the "new" content is an improvement to the game, but not the score.
---
I'm willing to try it out, even though i don't expect it to hold my attention for very long.
---
I just don't understand why they're making another new PvP mode when the vast majority of players are PvE exclusive. I get they're trying to expand the player base by pulling in people that like PvP. At this stage in the game's life, I feel like they need to just play to their audience more. Which, to be fair, is what the vault raids are. It just looks they're like dividing their attention, to me at least.
---
Fairly sure it is bugged.  We tried multiple outfits, that have previously counted for prior camera challenges requiring formal wear, and killed scores of legendary mobs over the course of a session and neither of us tallied a credit.
---
Because it wasn’t ready. No discussion. They have a studio specifically working on purely fallout 76. Player vending was shown off. That cane outs months after launch and was still mildly bugged. If the game launched with that it would’ve been permanently marred in most people’s eyes with presumably totally broken functionality.
---
His crit bar still didn’t load when he confirmed the hits
---
Okay this will be my last message as I’m done arguing with a brick wall.
---
You are mad because the upcoming content is for low level players. Is that correct? Let me address that. You do realize that there are low level players, right? Bethesda should release content for all levels to enjoy. 
---
As for the backpack missions, this is completely 100% your opinion. BUT you’ve completely abandoned your point in the original post. 
---
This upcoming update was planned to be at launch. That’s what you said. And I (and many others) say no it was not. Why can’t Bethesda release content without people like you thinking they have some other agenda going on? 
---
This is an online game. It gets content added to it later down the line. If I were you man I’d delete this entire fuckin thread because you’re in the wrong and everyone else is making sure you know it. Good luck with the other people proving you wrong lmao
---
This doesn’t happen on a regular basis and it’s easily avoided if it does. Have you even played?
---
i only run marsupial and grounded because it suits my playstyle.. I dont use class freak at all
---
I don’t know about resetting. I just had this issue. What I did was rejoined the server and as soon as stuff began loading in I brought up my camp menu. Doing that helped me.
---
Also explain why you think anybody in the dev team *wanted* the game to launch in the state it did? They didn’t. It’s the real world. Sometimes things just have to happen against people’s desires.
---
I have had zero luck getting in
---
Also I was told their is an effective cap. Like after so many points (idk the number) in strength it doesn’t effect your damage output anymore just your carry weight. I had a dude explain the whole theory to me last night. Not 100% sure but he said he tested each SPECIAL with the correlating number of pieces. He said after a few the benefits were redundant. With that being said, I have 4 pieces, lol so I’m not changing anything either way.
---
My wife and I had a nearly identical issue since beta. We used to get around it by forming team with everyone in the main menu. It’s a bit of a hassle to all quit out to menu every time someone has a crash and such, but you might try that. 
---
Are you all on the same network like we are? It’s kind of screwy, but the best working solution for us was to turn off NAT in our router.  With that done we can form teams in game and have no issues while playing, but it does screw things up for other machines on our network until we turn NAT back on.
---
This sounds reasonable.  Thank you.  (I did feel the game was empty, myself though, but because it was still Fallout, I was okay with that as Wild Appalachia was announced and I felt like I got to watch a game in development - and I was still waiting for a decent rifle to drop in RNG to use).
---
I think there may be a PvP only mode, but the PvP where the location of others is displayed is equal to the wall hack PvP. The displayed side suffers a disadvantage.
---
In the current survival mode, the map is too wide for PvP, and the Top 3 display for it is the worst idea thought by people who have never played PvP.
---
You do know a lot of games have bugs at launch right, like you do grasp that?
---
Not sure how it would apply to 76, re: what actions would provide karma as the game is presently built. There's...almost no (or no) decisions for the player to make in quests besides Optional stuff that may function as a shortcut.
---
It was sorely missing in FO4, and some (not I) had criticisms of the largely faction-based karma v. largely world-based in FO3. It was absurd in FO4 that I could do almost anything and not lose a companion, so long as said companion wasn't with me when it happened.
---
And I’ve gotten the majority of mine during the camp counselor ending.
---
Blessings be to RNGesus
---
That'd be cool for real. Or allowing us to browse inventory before we spend caps and fast travel.
---
I haven't said a thing being worried about upcoming content.  This whole thread is about the game that we NOW have.  Maybe this is why you have become so agitated? You didn't read the original post, you just jumped down my throat with a negative response.
---
Can you rename the backpacks? I put a - in front to move everything up top.
---
Threw four of them -- at wolves, bloodbugs, molerats and mongrel dogs. None of them cared. Finally one exploded right in top of a dog and crippled me but did nothing to them. Fucking Christ man.
---
My proudest fap.
---
Development team vs. Bethesda business .. not the same.
---
battle royale is its own genre that demands a game strongly dedicated towards it, it doesnt work when shoehorned into existing games. 'if you don't like it don't play it' works, but not when development time was flushed down the toilet for a mode that will be DOA.
---
Your not doing something right if your wasting a ton of ammo.  Wait for them to land and give em a couple wacks with a sledge hammer.  Easy Xp and ultracite
---
Yes... exactly... I’m glad you understand.
---
Happy cake day!
---
To make things more interesting. Actions made against players or with players given percentage gains. Like stealing a bag of loot that was dropped as opposed to from a dead player drop. Shooting at players. Trading with people. All those things that don't yet bring the community together could be done by this possibly?
---
How did you end up on the same server as the guy again ?
---
Tomorrow at 4 PM eastern is Microsoft's conference, and then at 8:30 PM eastern is Bethesda. Here's a color coded schedule for each conference and time zone. [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6N1EGXVUAAMIMG.png:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6N1EGXVUAAMIMG.png:large)
---
EA did their livestream today. They have EA Play which is near E3 but is not part of E3. The only new things they showed off is the Jedi Order game. The other games are Madden, Fifa, Battlefield V, and a Sims 4 expansion.
---
Have to ask--were you the one who delivered the killing blow? With most of the "kill (x)" challenges, you have to be the one to land that final shot to get the credit for the kill. Contributing damage doesn't count for challenges.
---
Oh, I see. AFAIK, BOS combat armor has the best dr/er combo.
---
That's on you though. They cant please everyone. Some people wouldn't mind a deathmatch mode. There is a bit of stuff for everyone here.
---
This is the same as when people complain that there is too much content that forces teaming up.
---
Like yeah   no shit. It's an mmo
---
Yes.  I saw a big woodpile near the Dolly Sods workbench that you can set up the "sawmill" extracor and harvest all the wood for you.
---
That’s on the players unfortunately
---
An optional game mode that if it completely bombs, means it was a complete waste of time and that the time and resources spent on it could have been spent elsewhere... like more pve content. I'm not remotely confidant that this new battle royal mode will be... spectacular, and the largest concern is if it could even begin to compete with other battle royal games. With Fallout 76's reputation, it's quite doubtful that a new BR game will suddenly pull an audience to the game. Hell, BF5's Firestorm BR mode died not long after it was introduced. None of the matches are full, and matchmaking takes far too long as well. The only way I can see this remotely working is if they make it free to play (for just BR, like how Fortnite has a paid pve and a free to play battle royal mode), otherwise it could very well be dead in the water upon release, or soon after. People aren't going to go and start buying copies for a game that failed in their eyes, and with the constant issues this game has had, they will likely just laugh at the fact that this game even tried to make a BR mode and poke fun at it as they have with everything else in this game. With how much this game still suffers from performance and server issues and how much they still persist (yes its improved overtime, but performance issues keep creeping back up, I've had ever constant hitching for weeks now), I can imagine how poorly this new mode will perform with 50+ people. Poor performance kills competitive games VERY quickly. No one likes dying to lag, hitching, frame drops, etc.  If this mode fails, god know what resources they'll put into it that could detract from other projects for this game, which will only delay other content. Unless they've hired on a serious amount of staff, this will impact pve content. I hope to god they've hired a significant enough staff just to work on this mode...
---
This. It has been expressed people want pve.
---
We know nuclear wintwr isn't "just" pvp. But if its a large part? Yeah, I'll quitetly be ticked while still playing.
---
Yeah that's pretty bad but after reading that next update i felt happy but sad at the same time. I am willing to bet the upcoming game mechanic update  where they are allowing us to run and gun and shoot while unholstering are entirely added for more reactive pvp combat. Which to me screams preparation for an unconfirmed upcoming battle royale. You can say lets put the brakes on the hype train but at some point you have to accept the signs because it aint a beta.  But yeah  sure those updates certainly help the pve aspect but the timing to release it just seems like it had none of our interests at heart. That survey a person put out today stating that only about 6% were interested in pvp out of about 1600-1700 people also put me into that mindset. Putting a focus on all these pvp aspects on a seemingly small minority seems counterproductive to me.
---
peace man.  this devolved into you taking shots.  i dont want to politely be a dick, so im out.
---
Isn't that something like a paint or does it drop that way?
---
John Brown's Body is a pretty well known folk song, it was even covered by Pete Seeger (can be found on YouTube). Possibly why I, a western Canadian, am familiar with it. That or my Hippie mother, whichever.

Bloodied,  especially melee 3*,  sell between 1-3k

Yeah I think it’s glitchy as I just got 1
---
Me too.  Went one time, died.  Went back for my bag, died.
---
To be fair, I've been waiting for a more challenging area.
---
Be careful what you wish for, I guess?
---
I tried to set up a complete set of legendary for urban or forest and the issue with not knowing which mod went to which part finally frustrated me enough to abandon the effort.  Maybe they will get a better description in a future patch.
---
What happened to the nukashine black &amp; gold paint for the minigun? I’ve only seen it in the ‘datamined’ image set. Was it ever in the Atom store?
---
A crafted dragon which has 400 range suffers some range fall off against scorchbeasts more often than not, even long range weapons like hunting rifles feel the fall off if you are anywhere except right beneath them, they fly as high as most weapon's base range, and are twice as far laterally as most enemies, which combines to drop your weapon damage by around 30-70%, which applies before armor, effectively doubling the effective value of said armor.
---
It all combines to make a horrible concoction of them taking way less damage than most enemies.
---
I've sold mini nukes for 1 c and even free.  Too much hastle to waste space.  Unless I'm at sbq and notice someone is using a fat man.  Then my prices go up a smidge
---
I could go for getting XP from anything/anyone that dies from the initial explosion. I'm not sure just launching the nuke should give its own bump though, although if you kill the robots yourself (instead of hacking all the terminals and turning the turrets on them) that should probably give more.
---
It's a good point, but there are nuances here. For instance, let's suppose Bethesda do indeed implement some sort of Battle Royale mode. Sure, that's going to involve a bunch of programmers - but it's probably also going to involve some new voice assets that need to be written and recorded, and maybe a new level or two that will require some level designers and maybe some new art assets. I'd be extremely surprised if the mode comes out and we all say "literally no one who worked on this could have been useful making story content".
---
A cleaner example would be fixing bugs in the underlying engine code (i.e. the code used to compile the game's executable, so not just some papyrus scripting). You really want proper programmers working on that stuff, so your artists are of zero use fixing those sorts of bugs. But even here there is a tradeoff when you look on a longer time scale. Sure, the artist isn't useful fixing engine bugs. But it was a *choice* as to how many artists to hire vs how many programmers. And while obviously there are frictions that mean Bethesda won't suddenly fire a bunch of artists and take their salaries and hire a bunch of programmers (e.g. team morale, the time it takes to onboard new staff), it's also true that they have at least some flexibility in hiring more people.
---
Personally I'm fine with Bethesda making stuff that other people enjoy and I don't - I'm fairly patient, and there are lots of other games to play while I wait for more quest content, particularly if they take their time to do a good job. But I can see where people are coming from when they say they hope Bethesda have been working on something other than a Battle Royale mode. By this time in Fallout 4's release cycle we had gotten Automatron, a really cool piece of content with a neat quest, two interesting dungeons, and some new gameplay mechanics, as well as Far Harbor, which even most of Fallout 4's critics say was an excellent piece of storytelling. And yes, Fallout 76 is a substantially different type of game to Fallout 4 - but that really just brings us to re-litigating the massive discussion about the marketing of this game in the first place.

I am sad for you, and I have weapon envy.  The closest I've come to a weapon like that is getting killed by it in PVP.
---
It's been 4 days. How long does it last for you?
---
I have ZERO criticism of the development team or its creativity.  I love Fallout as a franchise, and the people that are working on this title (development) are the same as the ones that did the other titles.
---
I do wonder if their focus is split between too many other Bethesda priorities however.
---
It was a joke. Stop trying to sound intelligent and move on. Point blank a battle Royale mode that *may or may not be coming* isn’t going to soak up much from the writers etc and at the end of the day we’re at the mercy of the devs decisions. Don’t like the mode? Don’t play it so they know and can plan accordingly going forward.
---
Still need help?
---
Nah he can use the repair kit for only 50 atom
---
unlike many other suggestions here, while good are too complicated to implement. I like this, short and sweet.
---
[Brotherhood hated that.]
---
Random encounters.. if they don’t work I usually reboot the game and there fine .. but I do use those quarry lights and they help immensely
---
Iv heard no plasma plans exist?? Not 100% on that but you may have to settle for nuka nades. Cool explosion and its fairly cheap and effective.
---
Happens often to me ending up with a few same, recon them by name and Camp spot etc. especially if they are vendors lately.
---
Maybe just same time zones, game times...
---
This is one of the reasons I wish the handmade rifle used 7.62 like in Nuka World instead of being 5.56. Because by doing so, the handmade completely invalidates the assault rifle as a semi-automatic option.
---
That's amazing yo
---
That's awesome luck
---
Oooh! Sounds like a perfect opportunity to show the wasteland my world famous Pterodactyl screech!
---
I think people liked it, but compared to many of the other add-ons it just ends up as one of the lesser ones, not because it is bad or because people don't do it, it is just less impressive than most other added content. No matter how fun it is.
---
Had the survey instead let us set individual ratings for each added content piece I am sure it would have been a 9/10 by itself. It just happens to fall far behind many of the other parts when ranked together.
---
You need the plans for the chemist badge.
---
Every time I play survival I go into ultra survivalist mode and just SURVIVE. Eventually, I hit the top three and my level 27 dies instantly to level 100+ with decent setups. It's great except the head Hunting.
---
I do that and then holster my weapon and back away to be non-threatening.
