I suggest moving slightly northwest. There’s an underwater acid deposit nearby. And it’s also right in the sweet spot to avoid literally every single creature spawn in the area.
---
---
---
I usually have a couple of buddies just shoot me with some low level guns. Lol. Its hilarious to watch honestly. Pro tip: open your pip boy when theyre shooting/hitting you. It keeps you from staggering, gives you quick access to your aid, and lets watch your armor break.

Girl on PC with anxiety, here. That's exactly why I refuse to use a mic with randos, too, so I totally feel you.

Rarely someone will ask me if I have a mic, but I'll just give the Thumbs Down emote.
---
I’m on PS4
---
Then you got guys like me who use it to take photos you'd either see in some kind of Cryptid Hunter magazine or on someone's Instagram featuring sun rays shining down through tree canopies.
---
Do you know what the % on the fridge is? Been curious about it.
---
If you’re in a multi-level area stealth can seem a bit crazy. Picture detection radius as a giant ball around you in all directions. Sound plays a big roll in this. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense but you can be invisible to an enemy 5 feet in front of you with a clear line of sight but get detected more easily by an enemy a floor above you in a closed room who can’t see you at all but hears your movement somehow. Light sources also play a roll. Try muffling a piece of armor and showing another. The stealth system is crazy.
---
I'm not aware of the bonus, and I've listened to it many times.  Worth keeping for when you get stressed out and need to relax and remember this is just a game.  Don't let them tear down your pillars.
---
Hi Nuke! If you want someone to play with, too, and are on PC, I'm always down to team up. My ign is the same as my username on here. 🙂
---
You have the sneak cards. Legendary armor can help boost agility(unyielding armor or +agility stat) to increase sneakiness and harder to detect while sneaking(Third star effect) armor makes the sneak effect to 90% from the card. Shadowed armor mod on leather armor increases sneak but only works on leather armor. Keep your pipboy light off and avoid artificial light sources while sneaking.  Hopefully this helps you out.
---
Isn't this a bug all the way back from skyrim? 
---
I remember dragons I killed falling outta the sky wherever I went.

Haha yeah I've seen that camp as well.

Really cool.

Lol that does sound hilarious. Would it work if I just stand on an exploding grenade?

You know what I hate? Whiners.

---
I use 40mm
---
It would probably just break the legs, if you can survive it. Lol
---
Bethesda will change things to like -4 Dex. But +10 damage with missile launchers and claim they listened to the community.
---
I sure hope not. Can you imaging everyone now moving their camp to these locations. Then all the "Why can't my CAMP be placed" posts.
---
lol  this build is really high risk and maintenance 😂
---
The Fallout series has given me literally hundreds of hours. I’ve spent about 400-500 hours on each Fallout game then another 200 or so with each DLC pack per game. Fallout 76 is supposed to be online, so it needs to change and adapt constantly, not once every year. And seriously break every ten seconds. I’ve had maybe 200 hours of content out of this *period.* The rest is bullshit grind. The *same* shit *over* and *over.*
---
I must be missing something, because I've hit enemies right up close with every part of the blast, and it barely takes a third of their health (also without relevant perk cards). Yet in that first video of yours, the damage shown in screen is barely registering in the 30s, total, for those first couple of kills, yet they're dropping like flies. Certainly looks overpowered, but I'll be damned if I could ever recreate that based on my time with the Gauss Shotgun. (And no, I'm not the most skilled player, but I keep pretty close track of the damage I'm dealing, and it's never anywhere near to killing anyone in one blast.)
---
Wait! There are WOMEN on the Internet?!? O.O
---
lmfao
---
Once I hit about 15k I start buying up ammo out of player vendors. There’s not much I have to spend caps on anymore, other than the 6k weekly to Smiley.
---
150 is ridiculously low considering you can roll for any specific category
---
At least once per week.
---
Honestly, though, permanently losing the stable flux is not something most gamers would expect to happen.
---
I swear Minecraft servers are the real test of friendship. I’ve had so too many arguments over little things in minecraft, it’s so sad
---
I would be happy if the windows on building sets had actually ANY glass. As far as I know only the Barn set has some broken ones and that's it.
---
Ah well for an explosive gatling, lmg, etc. U use practically the same perk cards. Heavy gun builds are nice and with plenty sneak and agility to still can use sneak kills with loud weapons.
---
Once you get the armor set up with the right perks. Its pretty manageable honestly. I hardly ever die anymore, but ive been running the build for over 10 months now. Lol
---
^ This. I have to tell everyone this when they die and dont have flux in their bag so they accuse me of stealing it.  Lol.
---
Red rocket Missile launcher paints
---
No one knows for sure yet. I’d make sure that alt has finished the Vault raid asap, or of the next listed reward shows bullion as a reward, switch over to a more advanced character and complete that one.
---
And making it ultra-light for less stash size because the scrip machine is already empty.
---
I keep my flashlight off most of the time, unless I've cleared all the enemies from an area. It's something I've learned to watch for.
---
I don’t want to come off as a jerk...as someone who doesn’t get that many good drops or still have need for caps...tbh I just started the gauss mini gun challenge...so i am buying all the 2mm ammo I can find as well as lead and steel from vendors lol
---
And that’s exactly why I stopped playing a while back. I may come back to check out all the recent updates but a lot of basic chores remain unchanged and they seem to have added more chores. Some may enjoy it but it was mentally exhausting doing all the chores
---
No
---
Awesome. I’m usually on in the evenings too so no problem
---
Wait why ultracite is bad can you explain statwise isn't it better than most
---
Yeah I had this happen yesterday, probably lost ~4000c when someone bought up all my .308, .45, .50, 5.56, and 5mm at once. 
---
Had I been selling the .50 and 5.56 at 1c/ea instead of 2c I probably would have been under the limit lol
---
my loading screens are photos of my nuts to my knees at level 1, 10, 20, and so on with the ID badge background
---
This.
---
I thought they fixed that in a prior patch.
---
No. It’s 100% RNG. The only thing you can control is when you buy something from Murmrgh you can pick the stars and base gear type or you can craft the new plans with legendary modules and control the specific item type but not the stars. 
---
Nothing else has any impact, not even the alleged ‘seed’ of the server that some people believed in but was debunked a long time ago.
---
Anyone who has their ammo at more than a cap each loses money to the dude that does.
---
Whoa that’s amazing bruh, I’ll have to give it a try. I thought about using just the hazmat suite and berserker weapons for nuke zone farming, but it removes my backpack, so I gave up on the idea. Looks like broken bolstering armor is the way to go.
---
You’re guaranteed three.
---
Here’s my all around stealth commando build 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ac745c6&amp;d=sb0sa0s60sf2sv3p00pa0pd1p80pk1pp1p90pl1e60eo0ej4c72i10i90ic0s10i40a71s70a41am2ar0an1ao0lr0l71lt1lv0
---
Although this is not the optimal amount of stealth I would top it off with stealth effect on all your gear pretty much as well.
---
I’m also using vats btw.
---
It used to happen often by site alpha that’s why I moved it LOL. But seriously I fought the SBQ twice today and got a 1* mutant’s 10mm pistol and a 1* ext pump shotty... it never used to be this bad before I moved the camp.
---
Awesome! will do! I'd love to talk shop with another teacher. :)
---
I always assumed it's the weapon's base damage but each enemy has their own mitigations.
---
Buy legendary modules. Craft your own legendaries after you’ve completed the Vault raid and have acquired gold.
---
You know, I can’t find a good argument against it so I’m just going to do like the others and downvote without giving an effective argument why because I secretly agree with you but I’m not allowed to have a different opinion on this sub. ~~I upvoted really~~
---
Well use gatling plasma then. I don't use 90% of my ammo types in my stash.
---
*le tips fedora* that is a fine picture of you ms, would you do me the honor of sending me the link to your only fans mlady
---
It's sad we have to think in such terms, but I'm glad there are people out there who will stand up for us and help us feel comfortable when playing! If you want to play with me sometime, I'd be glad to host you! My username is the same as my reddit name.
---
I'd be happy if he would just shut up about the detonator I am supposed to have "lost".
---
I would just like to know why the crater bullion machine and vendor are inside.
---
I’ll be on early
---
Tomorrow afternoon CST if yiu have not done it already
---
Damnit take my upvote
---
This makes a lot of sense. The places it's seemed the most random are west tek and white spring club house.  I've also wondered if the number of enemies reduces your ability to be stealthy, where the enemies get a detection bonus in a group.
---
Absolutely true!
---
Then again, I have no roof since I have an enclosed stair leading to my third floor which functions as the rooftop. ;)
---
I wish they provided a option after you take a photo to keep it, but could also turn it off if you needed action shots or rapid fire it.
---
Absolutely! I'm purpleketchup, so not much different than my reddit username.
---
&lt;3
---
Also not the case!
---
Sometimes it can be fun just wandering around with another person even if they aren't talking. Small steps are great and almost every person I have come across in this community has been at the very minimum polite. The select few that aren't I just block and move on. I know it can be tough at first but even just being willing to take that first step is a big accomplishment so I applaud you!
---
I love photos like that and I still have a number of them like that.
---
Thanks. Is the sneak bonus from armor better than the +20% from the garb of mysteries? I'm not sure how it stacks with the sneak perk card.
---
Season's pass* and like with Nuclear Winter and exp, the character you actively select with be the one that gets it. As for you gold bullion question, we'll just have to see, however, it makes sense to get the vault raid done asap anyways
---
Kind of weird to have anxiety in an online game.
---
"Logo on the back"? Sorry i never saw something like that. All i see is my backpack.
---
I thought they said it would be the character that was active when the reward was earned same as things like repair kits?
---
Thats how i started out. I ran around in a hazmat suit in a nuke zone until i leveled up enough to get the perks i needed. Gave me plenty of time to find the armor i needed as well.
---
On a side note, since the armor is broken, level dont matter. Just look for the effects you want, you can find steals in peoples vendors. I put my set together for less then 6k caps, pretty much paid scrip price for everything. Hah
---
"Doom boxes, doom boxes everywhere"
---
true but then again some of these mid tier weapons wont trade unless I have a bloodied whatever or legacy weeps so in reality I paid 30k caps to gain 25lbs if stash space lmao
---
But it is... Uranium Fever always spawns three legendary Mole Miner Supervisors. It’s a crucial part of the event lore wise as they’re essentially the leaders of the rebellion.
---
ugh, Cait! My father died of drug addiction, after so long of me trying to help him get better. God, I cried so hard when I played her story line.  I loved her so much during my playthrough because of how she wanted and fought to get better. 
---
FO3 was even worse, because my dad was a man of science, like the lone wanderer. When I rescued him and we ran across the wastes together, fighting and trying to help humanity, I was so happy...then, well...If you've played it, you know. 
---
And Billy, the boy in the fridge...I have a young son, and when I rescued and protected Billy I felt so emotional at the thought of not being able to find his parents. I was hoping there was an option to adopt him if the worst case scenario happened. I was all ready to move him into one of my settlements and give him so many toys from the stash I'd collected for Shaun...
---
get shot in the face by another player
---
Sounds good, obligatory "put it behind a locked door"
---
No I was meaning. Ok so you know how the tunnel snakes jumpsuit has the logo
---
May I add you too? Or are you only wanting higher level players at the moment? totally understand if so!
---
Indeed that's how it's supposed to go with the lore, but this is Bethesda we're talking about here, that event must be glitching out regularly when I play it because I very rarely end up seeing all three, even if I'm the only one there!
---
Sirenhead and the zetans are not even in the game the zetans was on the book as a concept
---
Don't sweat it, just enjoy the ass
---
I always carrry around 3000 5mm and 4000 .308. Both ultracite for my gatling and lmg. I use the chemist packpack mod so i can use Bear arms in combination with heavy weapon perks. Down side is that i really want to stash unused drugs and stims to keep inv neat and clean. But then they weight a ton again.
---
I guess this has been around for a while, but I’ve got thousands of hours and this was the first time these mud rats pulled this little surprise on me.
---
I have a bunch of stuff that just won’t move.
---
I had a furious FFR minigun sit for weeks at different prices ranging from 1-5K.
---
I finally put it up to 10K and someone bought it minutes later.
---
I’ve actually surprisingly sold all my 40mm recently and when I restock they go pretty quick. What they need to do is give us a way to scrap ammo or sell to vendors. Most of my stash is ammo but I refuse to drop it just in case. Can never have too many bullets
---
For sure! I tried to add you but it said your username didn't exist. Is it spelled differently?
---
I'd like to add myself to the list of people that would be happy to team up with you. I'm a fellow anxiety sufferer, but I find that being with people that get how it feels can help immensely.
---
That’s amazing deal and good strategy for this build. I remember seeing many low level good armor deals during last Christmas scorched event, dumb me bought a bunch and scripped them all 😭
---
Cool build. Thanks for sharing
---
I’ve never seen more than three or less than three. Only time I haven’t gotten all three legendaries is when other people kill it before I can pull the trigger on my Karma Syringer. I’ve done this event over a hundred times too.
---
Aww! My boy likes to watch me build settlements in fo4. He "helps" me design things, so all my settlements look wonky, but they're functional. :)
---
I hit 30,000 caps before I realized glowing meat could be cooked and sold for more caps.
---
This is the only time I can tolerate them. They’re in your sights for 2 seconds then you see mole rat chunks flying, it’s amazing.
---
I buy .308 whenever I come across it. And sometimes 5mm too.
---
I just want different variations of the jukebox. Like the one from Sons of Dane compound, the one from the Nukashine bunker (where BIV is), and the one from Vault 51 NW.
---
Yes and add ironclad &amp; adamatium and it minimizes the damage so much. Even in getting rads, life giver gives so much. What I've noticed is that if you chance perk cards, log out and back in because they don't always equip immediately.
---
I've actually had friends tell me not to join the event as it they end up not spawning! XD
---
If there's one thing I've learned as an adult, every group has quirky folk and zelots. Befriend the former and stay AWAY from the latter!
---
add some actual end game content then fix the bugs, imho
---
I have 8000+ .44. Someone dropped thousands one day and I scooped it up. Hopefully they finally allow us to sell to vendors or break ammo down.
---
Does it make me unable to see anyone in the map?
---
I always turn up just for the treasury notes.
---
I'm surprised they havent nerfed bloodied yet. Guess that's what happens when the majority of the playerbase uses. Or they dont care. Meanwhile Laser and Plasma rifles are still useless
---
Was that question for me?
---
If so, I welcome all friends and teamups, no matter the level. 🙂
---
Use the scrapper perk and loot super mutants for their rifles. For lead I camped on a lead deposit so I wouldn’t have to farm lucky hole mine. Also use ammosmith (agility) and super duper (luck) when crafting ammo.
---
I'm just straight-up not playing until they fix it. I'm sitting on so many legendaries that go for 20 to 30,000 caps right now and I can't even put them in my machines for a third of the price because I know that they're going to put me at cap limit.
---
I never thought of it that way. I price all ammo at 1c, to keep it moving, but it's also helping me dodge the cap limit more than I realized. Pro tip
---
Alright so against the queen
---
Explsoive 10mm does 6 dam a sec
---
Explosive Assualt rifle does 6
---
Handmade does 9-17 its furious so the damage likes to bounce 
---
I haven't tried my plasma assault rifle against it because it typically does 20 damage less on normal enemies then my other guns pretty disappointing tbh loved to use energy weapons in past fallouts but in this there pretty bad
---
Tin Cans are your friend.  2 steel 1 lead each.  The hanging tin can "traps" that make that clanging sound when you walk thru are worth 18 / 9 for each string.  Camden park has 4 sets of strings you can grab quickly without having to go inside another location to wait for more load time.  I usually just server hop 3 or 4 times and can walk out with 300 steel 150 lead in less than 10 minutes with minimal resistance.  Tons of plans / items to sell in your vendor too- AND....  the scorched there regularly have combat rifles you can scrap to upgrade you mods or just sell to the vendor bot near the front gate. I enjoyed the story for what its' worth- hope you catch a break on your next adventure.
---
Sweaty ass
---
I never knew this was a thing until it happened to me during a breach and clear event. I was so confused
---
Yes it does
---
Does it work with half walls?
---
Yup
---
Wow this just happened to me last night for the first time and I had no idea that it just keeps selling your stuff in vendors.
---
My bigger question is this: what happens with the vendor when the buyer purchases something and you hit your cap max? I ask this because last night when I hit my cap max the buyer suddenly started buying everything and wiped out all my legendary weapons and  serums. They bought over 10k worth of stuff in a few seconds after I hit my max. Basically cleaned put one of my vendors.  Seriously I want to know what happened because that seemed like it wasn't a coincidence. Did they get it for free because I was at my max? Could they tell I was at max caps? If so, that is a serious exploit and it needs to be fixed ASAP.
---
r/bethesdagamestudios_ or r/LoneVaultWanderer any insight on this situation?
---
One Cooked glowing meat also gives like 20% food bar too
---
My stash seems to be laggy when I scroll through it.
---
Now go and get yourself killed my friend 😂👍
---
It’s become Inventory Management 76 for me. I spend more time trading and moving stuff around than playing. In large part because there isn’t really anything left to do.
---
once you find spots to farm you'll be swimming in crappy 1-3 star drops, If I only log in to sell for 21 days (granted I'll have to buy some when I get near the 1000 cap) I'll finally clear out my inventory
---
I believe they pay full price and your caps go to wherever caps go to die
---
Oh sorry I meant to say is Penguinonne
---
Am I alone in thinking the RR was kinda shit anyway.....? Who needs a diner when I'm crying out for armor and weapon stands, functioning shelving.... Weapon skins or armor dye-ing.... If I had control of that section of Bethesda for one ATX period I'd generate enough revenue to fix F76. That's right, fix it...
---
They also have place able items for allies... so they’ll just be mini-allies lol
---
No, it has to be 2 doorframes, but if the wall is a door  you can remove the foundation, and move slightly to get rounded by placing the corner of the foundation at the corner of the wall
---
I've tried to get the half walls in just about every way
---
I'm sure you meant Paige and the saw mill ;)
---
hmm i’m not sure, i built one for my brother a couple of weeks ago on XB1. right after the mole miner event.
---
Or an April Fool's Jukebox that only plays that terrible cover of Ring of Fire and the audio is 200% volume regardless of what your settings are
---
My big brother and I made sport out of hiding on the map in Minecraft and then hunting each other down. When we were kids, he was the cool older sibling and I the younger nerdy one who idolized him. 
---
We used to bond by pranking each other, building lego cities, making stop motion movies, and gaming. I would always sit on his bed and play N64 and he would play PC games. He'd make me turn the sound all the way down on the TV so he could play his industrial metal music so loud that I could feel the bass in my bones. To this day, I can't play Ocarina of Time without Marilyn Manson in the background. 
---
I love playing games with him, especially since he lives across the country from me now, but he doesn't have fo76. I'm considering just buying it for him and telling him he either plays with me or I won't make his favorite cobbler for Christmas.
---
assuming you want a Gauss weapon or SS armor
---
Add me too, Athletic Sloth. I'm a higher level but I can give you a weapon and supplies if you want :)
---
Never sell these in a machine. Ever. Trade these for medium and high tier items. Never take caps for something so valuable.
---
Strange, even though encryptid is in it's name (E01B_Encryptid_LvlAssaultronSheepsquatch) it does not have the &lt;ActorTypeCryptid&gt; keyword.
---
But the Angler does...
---
Mine is god awful. It's gotten to the point I dread even going into it. If it's the 3d model for the items loading too slowly, I'd be happy with an option to turn that off and just have a still picture. I really dont need to see the back side of a folded outfit.
---
Yea. That would have been a good time to buy. Lol. People flooded with excess legendaries, selling super cheap just to free up stash space. Honestly, with meat week coming up soon, that would be your best bet. Not as good as the Christmas scorched, but probably the next best thing.
---
Yeah, not sure what's going on with the damage numbers. I just charged the shotgun up to full power and clapped a whole team. Wasn't expecting that at all.
---
Well the harder 2 detect legendary effect is 15% sneak so it stacks with the sneak card to a max of 90%. If its 20% for the garb it will only stack up to 90% so it will only use 15% of the garbs sneak. Agility has no cap to increase sneak. I run bloodied with unyielding and I have around 40 agility and I'm undetectable. Shadowed is only good for leather armor but drops defence, not sure how much it stacks up to. High agility and one H2D legendary armor piece should be good for sneaking. Wear shielded raider under armor for 3 agility.
---
Can't really give you advice on any of that stuff without you first telling us how you like to play the game. Do you like to be a big tanky boi who can take a heap of damage without going down? Do you like being a stealthy boi who hides and sneaks around? Do you want to do *all of the* *damage* but go down to a stiff breeze? We need answers to these questions (and probably more) before we can give you any meaningful advice.  
---
Also, just out of curiosity, how far did you get on your first character?
---
Yeah it’s mainly for the Queen and Encrypted. Nothing else is challenging in the game at this point. I’m finding the full unyielding secret service armor is kinda the answer. Not as stealth as the leather but it’s so good across the board.
---
Well its because I hardly had god weapons and TSE handmade is pretty reliable is what I've heard.
---
You can also place scare crows which will draw incoming attackers to them and they're cheap to repair.  Place a few of them in range of your turrets and watch the meat fly, but honestly glowing yao guai's are brutal and I doubt any turrets would really put a dent in them.
---
Yes, they have the ActorTypeCryptid keyword
---
Can we extend this to scrip as well? I know this is really on me, but I’d love if the game stopped me before scrapping items for scrip when I’m already at the limit.
---
Sorry to hear about your loss, mate. Goes to show how impactful writing can be when done well. I loved the detail that Father still decides to give you Shaun if you decide to destroy the Institute, as a final gift to the parent he never had. Fallout deserves more credit than it gets, it’s an amazing series.
---
We aren't whining. This is a legit issue and valid concern.
---
Not sure it was always there but I have noticed a max script warning at least. It's saved me a few times
---
Thats a neat way actually, put all this crap in a separate vendor, out of access, so it doesnt auto scrap. Not that it should be scrapable in a frist place...
---
Stop posting until you upgrade your IQ points.
---
2 shots in stealth with an instigating lever.  2 shots in vats using the fancy shotgun with no shotgun perks applied.
---
I’ve only dropped 3 nukes since the game came out just because it’s a long tedious process I don’t care to do. I like this idea
---
The FOV slider can be a super zoom or a mega-wide view. Its so OP it's broken haha. Even if you're not a bush wookie, you can use it around corners etc.
---
Intentional typo ? ;)
---
I hate that goddamn cap limit. There's jack shit to buy in this game except for Smiley's bullion. During the recent month of vendor downtime, I got down to 6K caps. Do the math. That's 4 weeks of buying 300 bullion at 6k every week.  That's it. There's nothing else to buy. There is no cap sink that can keep up with the rate I can earn caps in this game. 
---
As soon as the vendors came back up, I was right back at the cap limit. Like the OP, I had to bail after one guy bought 20K worth of stuff in one go. Dumped him right into the water. 
---
That was what? 2 weeks ago? I haven't logged in since and my 1st subscription has expired. Dealing with this cap limit sucks the fun right the fuck out of this game. I'm so tired of it.
---
Or...only make Stations fast travel locations
---
Imagine the smell of power armor after a long day of being in the swamp.
---
Thanks. It really sounds like agility boosting armor does the best for improved stealth.
---
It doesn’t work for me on PS4 either and I don’t know why. I need ingredients for Rad Shield. Does anyone know how to get the stranglers to bloom???
---
Their strategy is completely wrong for weapon skins. If people can have any in game gear any time they want, the strategy is ok. Someone sees the baton skin and goes ‘I’m gonna go farm a bloody baton today and get that skin’, voila a sale the next day after he acquired his god baton. 
---
Unfortunately the RNG in this game makes sure you WON’T get the stuff quickly. So this ‘limited time sale’ strategy simply won’t work. When people picked up a god roll baton, oops it’s gone from the shop. Then two months later when the player got tired of the baton build, sold it and switched to a golf club build, the atom store baton skin is useless to him when it shows up again. 
---
High availability makes impulse sales easily when RNG plays a key roll in this game. Even for camp items people always look for ways to dress up their camp. You have to make sure people can find it when they want it. When they cannot find it the sale is lost. The store owner doesn’t get it.
---
Yeah it's weird, if you don't die, and he goes back, he sometimes just becomes passive.  But still heals.  I hate having to use chems to break through a bug, but maybe I'll try that.  Go on a super mutant master hunting spree, save up 1000 rounds of 5mm ammo, grab a minigun, pop some chems, and hope it works.
---
Wendigo is always in the final wave.
---
I solo nuked New Gad in the lakebed on a private server hoping for some good flux but ended up with next to nothing. 
---
One random thing I noticed was a camp of Blood Eagles in the midst of the rad storm were outside but they were wearing Radiation suits!
---
I think the refrigerators should take cryo cells to cool the food to at least 90% slower (Like the perk card). Maybe every couple of hours or so you need to replace the cryo cells.
---
My question is, why do we pay a vending tax? What economy is there that there is a tax? Where does those caps go? Are they in the void, or does Todd have a account on every system that collects the caps and that's why we have a limit! 
---
Also, where does our caps go, when we hit limit? Just the void? We should least have a back up supply of caps, or a system like in ESO where you can store your caps (gold in that game) since we are already getting a basically getting their level scaling
---
I wish we had something more useful than favourite to use outside the gear wheel. I'm afraid 1 day I'll be half asleep and scrap my responder coat+helmet or longshoreman outfit, or accidentally sell/scrip a legendary. A simple "lock X item" would be nice.
---
I will add you for sure! If you've got stuff you aren't using I'd be glad to help you get more inventory space. 
---
Being as I hate confrontation, I favor distance weapons. I put a scope on a pipe pistol (lipstick on a pig?) Just so I could keep as far away as possible. 
---
Everytime something sneaks up on me in game I make the most undignified sounds... You wouldn't believe how many things I've knocked off my desk from literal knee-jerk reactions!
---
Imagine if u can tame a scorch beast snd keep it at your camo and it has a big like nest for a prop and u can use it for 1 free fast travel a day so if u live at the bottom of the map u can fly to the top kina likr pokemone
---
Best way I've saved space is by offsetting weights using legendary armor perks. Such as Ammo, Food, and Chem reduction. Allows me to carry more and leave room in the stash
---
Tbh I don’t know, because I figured this game would be like the other FOs I played growing up w a tad more of a twist. I feel like guns break too easily and then always being low on ammo is frustrating af. But then the problem is I’m carrying too much food/water to stay fixing my items or build ammo and then stay near over-cumbered.
---
So essentially I was thinking go tank, hold aggro, have a bigger inventory weight, and start disemboweling fools and carry the mats I need to fix my weapons/armor and still have stuff to eat and drink. 
---
I mostly only played sneak or shooting builds in last FO games so this might be a nice change of pace. 
---
Sorry I didn’t make this clear in my original post. 
---
Also, is it just me or does the game not give you enough caps (from questing) early on to buy ammo, etc?
---
Edit: sorry forgot to address, I think I’m level 21 and stuck doing cuckery for Rose and tryna just keep my head above water like a freaking stoonad.
---
I’m on PC and run with a gang of wild, friendly people. Free free to add me! Coco_antiques
---
absolutely! The length of which it takes to max rep makes sense just not the tasks available.
---
So true!  I just took a boob shot of my character while she was playing the piano.  I was playing with the camera rotation while waiting for my teammate and couldn't help but take the photo! lol
---
I'll add you as soon as I'm back on. I look forward to it!
---
Seriously are there any plans to address the trading mechanism and vending machine cap issue?
---
What system are you on?
---
Advanced power connectors would work better, but it’s hard to explain, easier to see in person. Are you on PS4 by chance?
---
Woah nice! I'll have to check that out. I've been looking for a good plan spot and a suppressor for my combat rifle so that sounds literally perfect. Thanks for the recomendation!
---
They're taking the Destiny 2 route and it's tragic. I really enjoy everything else about the game. I try to ignore all the micromanagement, but it's hard when it literally affects gameplay if you don't manage it at least a little.
---
?
---
PS4
---
I'll be your friend, Sock! I play on PC semi regularly and dont have many friends on the game anymore. I need help launching my first nuke of you're ever up for it :) You can add Koshercrab
---
Totally understand. I tend to have the same issues when socializing so I'm mostly on my private server. I'm on PC as well so if you're like to group of send a friend request to THRDStooge.
---
Two shot used to be double damage but now it's 25% and it's split between both projectiles so each does 62.5% with a big accuracy penalty. Explosive is 25% bonus damage. They're not god roll anymore. They are better than some but weapon durability will be crap. The handmade is a great rifle, but don't overlook other legendary prefixes because you are looking for TSE thinking it's as good as it used to be.
---
I totally agree. Shit why is there even a cap max? ESO has no gold max. Its like they want to force you to spend caps. Problem with that is when you encounter something expensive that you want you may not be able to afford it. Im already spending 6k a week for bullion. I should be able to save my money as high as I want.
---
😂😂😂
---
Yea hopefully I can put together a low level set so I can figure out an easy way to break it lol 👍
---
Yikes. Yeah might actually move..lol
---
Yeah I havent had any problems with sneak since I went bloodied with unyielding armor. If your not running bloodied try for whatever armor primary armor effect your after and then +agility and harder 2 detect on leather armor that you put the shadowed mod on.
---
Scrip, caps and stash limits need to be expanded. Why there's a scrip limit idk. Give us an endless amount of scrip but like...limit how many legendaries we can buy per day/week whatever...just don't limit the scrip. I've easily hit the limit multiple times and because weapons weigh so much, once I hit the daily scrip limit, I can't store them to fast travel because I don't have any damn storage space! So I have to either drop the legendaries or log out for the day.
---
The caps need to be upped to, there's not really an economy here so you really shouldn't worry about how upping the cap limit will "ruin the economy".
---
I suppose I'll give it a shot again whenever I pick it up again. Likely gonna default to the. 50 Cal still, but I'll at least keep the Gauss to make sure others don't hold it. Thanks for the vids and info!
---
There's a glass dome... but the rain goes right through the roof.    :(
---
That does explain that my two shot sniper 1* doesnt do  the double damage. Huh. And what about demolition park for explosive weapons?
---
Lol. Good luck. Also worth noting, the lower the level, the less durable it is. So the lower the better. Hah
---
I'm on PC and just got into FO76 a month ago.  I'm on a few times a week and have one other person I play with. We are both around lvl 50.  Feel free to add me, anyone else for that matter as well.  Game ID: radleyburb0n
---
Got a b25/25/ handmade from the queen and live in toxic Valley. Got me some nice melee weapons
---
It wasn’t his in the first place. I would kill them all. Raiders too.
---
Lost a buddy the same way..refused to play even when they upped the limit to 800 n stash box..says "does my head n mate " 😂
---
Same. I never really went farming for Strangler Blooms during that event, and it worked for me. But maybe things have changed, who knows. I haven’t collected any in a few weeks lol, I’ll have to check for myself later. :)
---
Oh, I bawled at that part. I took that sweet boy in as soon as the option popped up. He may not be my "real" son but he's still my baby! I'm what my granny called a "mother hen" type. I mother anything that comes my way. I even pet my roomba when it goes by. 
---
I lived next door to some of the local college football players a few years back. I'm 5'2 in shoes, and these boys were lineman, all well over 6" and massive. I used to bring them cookies and tea after games and help them with their school work. Instinct, I guess. 
---
Bethesda as a company has many issues, but I do so love their stories. My favorite thing to do is explore the vault and piece together a story from what's left behind.
---
Just having the Jukebox play the radio would be better.
---
As for new music...yeah not happening. Especially not Beetles. Do you know how much Bethesda would have to pay for a license? Way too much!
---
I’m on PC as well and as unfortunate as your story was, it was hilarious. I would gladly help you out some. And I’m sure I have a weapon or two that could help you along the way. It’s nice to be nice.
---
Yea. 3 every time unless you mess up.  If you’re on Xbox I’ll take you on private server.
---
Use it to launch nukes or get into people's camps or to farm legendarys at freddys house of fears 😁
---
SS Armor pretty much outclasses every other armor in the game.
---
Not much. You can reach the daily 1400 caps in like 15-20 minutes if you go farm weapons near a vendor.
---
PS4, I have tried on private servers, this doesn't glitch out every time for me but it has been quite regular.
---
Honestly, I’d only like to meet Julie if she was a killable character. Way too happy-go-lucky for me
---
Aww, thank you honey. I'm feeling pretty good with all the support I'm getting here.
---
Yes, I'm a woman, 34 years old with a house, husband, and a rug rat. Anxiety doesn't discriminate, does it? 
---
I'm pretty much constantly crouched, looking through my scope, and I'm on a private server! Even NPCs can give me anxiety if I'm not in the mood to chat. I'll send you a PM  soon and see if we can find a time to play or just shoot the breeze. 
---
Thanks for commenting, I'm just loving this.
---
It should be and that makes the most sense. But until it’s released it’s not confirmed.  And we don’t know how they would address a bullion award earned while the active character was one that hadn’t competed the vault raid yet. 
---
Most likely it will be like the Atom Shop repair kits currently work, where you get to choose which character it would apply to, not just the active one.
---
Start running bloody mess, VATS, watch them pop 🤟
---
Whats bad is ypu do all 3 even after for the cake 27 scrip
---
Best tip for early game is get all the mutations.
---
It make your life so much easier and then just use melee weapons since you have no accuracy.
---
Cows milk for cleansing radiation on cooked meat or soup for healing since stimpacks are hard to find.
---
Later on transition to what even build you want once you get a good legendary gun. Probably rifles or shotguns. 
---
At level 30 energy gatling guns become available and they are monsters even without damage perks and ammo is so cheap.
---
Life is over...
---
Just give up and die...
---
Give us all your money...
---
What a stupid guy...
---
It was! You commented to nuke, and I wanted to make sure you were willing to have a low level tag along before I added ya. ;)
---
lol, just realized you commented further up. haha, I really got to work on my reading comprehension...
---
Bugggy roaaaaaads...
---
That’s very true, i should start farming events in low level areas now then, like leader of the pack etc 👍
---
Where do u do that?
---
Yes but it only adds 60% of the 25% bonus.
---
Meh, i kinda like the little stuff like this. It makes me think, its super casual, and i actuallynfimd myself genuinely enjoying the inane random stuff we gotta deal with. The cap limit is lame thou, but so is the bullion cap and especially the scrip cap...im literally swimming in legendaries and the only thing keeping me from that sweet sweet scrip is time...like bruh really? Up the daily cap to 500 and double the scrip total, literally everybody who plays this game wants more
---
It is but aside from getting lucky with player vending you can't purchase mods for it, plus I believe it's fairly expensive to repair. The stats aren't necessarily ENOUGH better to make up for the inflexibility of modding + repair costs.
---
bu...buy ammo? Why would you buy ammo when you can just *make* it?
---
Take me somewhere...
---
I usually play Roblox defensively to give my kid the chance to have fun without being constantly griefed. 
---
It feels weird to hunt down campers when you know they're kids, but come on, quit spawn sniping my five year old...
---
See ya
---
It devoid that I did that for plus and it start recharged me even with that on.
---
No. Both anti armor and furious are legendary prefixes
---
Where do u deactivate auto payments?
---
No sorries needed, honey, I'll add you soon as I get back on. Thanks for putting out your hand!
---
LOL yeah. My perks were/are a mess. Started as a shotgun build, wanted more range so I split it into a shotgun/sniper combo, then I found chinese stealth armor and realized I can save loads of ammo using a gnarly 3* combat knife I had. Kind of want to fix it, kind of really like having a 3-way build. It's just not strong enough in one specific class
---
Damn, I like how you said it better
---
That didn't rhyme....
---
But oh weeell...
---
Buggythesdaaaaa....
---
Fix this gaaaammmeee....
---
And take me hooooooome, buggy roads
---
Dupe glitches...
---
Far as the eye can see...
---
Blurry textures...
---
Dunno what just hit me...
---
And why do you think we care?
---
Well I’m dressed like a Pirate and now I need RW Broadsiders. I’ve got guns &amp; caps.
---
ok
---
Every night i drop decent (like 2 shots or furious) low level legendaries to level appropriate randoms. Its really fun!  (And clears up some of my already super full stash : O)
---
That's pretty good for the daily challenge that requires you kill one. One will sometimes spawn at my camp too, but rarely.
---
They fixed it on PC at least.
---
Go to your camp feature, go to edit, hover over the item you want to lock, then you'll see an option to lock it. Click that button and add whtever lvl lock you want.
---
A lock feature would be perfect!  I too worry about that.  I occassionally think I need to hit the bumpers to scroll through my inventory because in other games I play that's how I do that.  So I'm constantly hearting and unhearting items at random.
---
Yeah, as mentioned already, that red outfit doesn't go in a machine. From everywhere I have read, its well over 100k caps in value.
---
That is so true. Im really missing my other teacher friends right now, but their don't their own things right now and they aren't gamers. 
---
I'll add you as soon as I get back on tonight.
---
Yeah I'm not sure why they have a cap either but they seem to be persistent about it so atleast make it a decent amount. I personally wouldn't pay anymore than 25 - 30k for something decent so they need to do a decent increase. Not a mere 5k increase either like they previously did.
---
Wait for the uninitiated....what are you talking about? You can tame animals? How?
---
In build mode, aim at the extractor and there will be a list of buttons at the bottom, on PS4 I think it's R2 to put a lock on it. Might be misremembering because I don't generally lock anything. As for bobbleheads, you can't lock that but you don't need to, nobody else can interact with display items.
---
Well see there is such a high demand to raise it they might just do it.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I will just play a game where developers don't make mirco buffs and inventory managment 90% of the gameplay while focusing 90% of development on how to sell people more stuff with sneaked in utility function. Thank you for trying to help tho
---
The community is amazingly nice.  That said, you can also play the whole thing by yourself if you'd prefer.  Welcome to Appalachia!
---
That’s smart, tbh I didn’t even consider the mutations. It’s annoying because I thought if I quested enough and went through the normal fallout motions I would’ve had been able to shake off the rough start and had caps in my pocket and a high level that I could hold my own. 
---
I was wrong lol
---
What effects do you have on you mutant shotty? Do you use VATS? :)
---
Basically, OP has a crap computer and a shitty ISP
---
Lol, ya know, I always wanted a Skyrim or fallout like game where I was the companion to the chosen one. I'm a reluctant hero for sure, so I could really see myself as a dedicated follower. I'll add you soon as I get back on tonight.
---
Because Facebook and other social media has brainwashed some people into thinking random people give a shit about what they want/think/do.
---
I have nothing against social media, I'm typing on it now. But man, when someone says they're upset because someone else didn't "like" their photos...grow up, you're in your 30s.
---
I'm starting fresh on PC before update 20 drops, my main is PS4 but I need more people to play with on PC. My bethesda ID is Vicksauce.
---
lol trust me I know, another problem I had was not being able to find a plethora of mats
---
Vats fills faster and vats hit%
---
The aa was explosive and vats fills faster
---
Baby steps are my favorite kind! I'm usually not the lonely type, but quarantine is getting to me. :) Thanks for reminding me that it's okay to go at my own pace! It's important for folks to remember that they don't have to do what everyone else is doing to be happy.
---
huh, what you mean mats?
---
If you have someone to play with make an alt character and use that to store crap you want to scrap. Build your camp near the rusty pick and that way you can just go inside get your 150 and then every now and then treat yourself to armour or weapons. If you get something good transfer it over.
---
My alt has a full stash of 3\* gear. Some is only worth 4-5k but i go some armour pieces worth 20k+
---
its too op you can literally merge into rocks
---
Hmmmmm....so not a magic shotty. I’m trying to think here....lol. :)
---
Mumma don’t like quitters! 
---
Peace out fuckbags ✌🏻
---
At least once a play session.
---
Also the easiest to get rep on that character .. and the one who needed it the least.
---
Nevermind 33% vats hit chance..
---
he on the toilet  
---

---
3 x pieces of crap. Keep getting Assassin n lead pipes, wenches
---
Like junk, scrap etc
---
Gimme all your stuff 👍
---
What I wished is that if a player buys something that sends you over, it would just go over but you can't sell anything to the vender for caps and anything you sell, would be considered zero.
---
If you mean the vault 79 raid I did that and I have some gold I gotta look up about the crafting tho
---
33% vats hit chance is a “magic effect”, as long as you fire in VATS. You pretty much obliterate mobs. :)
---
I know right, it’s still scrip. Underlevel crap. But still scriptable.
---
Uranium Fever no longer drops treasury notes. Next time it's active you might notice no '!' In the event icon. Plus some of the times I do events  get the payment/reward scroll but unless the notes are in the first 3-4 items I don't see the notes until I fast travel out if the area.
---
Unfortunately we likely won't get any Sinatra or Johnny Cash in 76 because of the licensing costs. They'd also have to reacquire licenses to add in songs from the previous games. I do agree with you though, the gritty sound of the songs in previous games really added to the feel of the environment. That said, I absolutely love 16 Tons in this game.
---
Holy crap... That would be like a Chihuahua following a dire wolf around! If you don't mind me nipping at yer heels, I'd be glad to be your follower! Ha ha. 
---
I was asking for low level cause I didn't want to be a drag on a higher level, but if you're offering I ain't gonna turn it down. 
---
I'll add you when I get back on tonight.
---
I have a friend who never turns in the quest so Blooms are available every time they join a server. I freely pick them and just share the Radshield surplus.
---
Places I've camped around their is by the big lake next to it it's got a great view the 2nd place is just a little bit past the super mutant behemath there's a cabin you can build in
---
This isn't an airport; no need to announce your departure.
---
i have no idea what is going on here

---
Dang, so how about vampire explosive? What are god weapons now?
---
Its only a game, if you don't like it.  There's plenty of other games that you can play
---
Still did shit dmg compared to the mutants
---
It's a horrible confusing system but they best way to view it is like health.
---
All the stealth bonuses increase your sneak bar so it take more noise or sight to kick you out of stealth.
---
You have two types of sneak buffs, bar buffs and reduce sound or sight buffs. And example is Shadows armor reduce sight in the dark.
---
Lets say not you but someone else sets the enemy on alert well then they will receive bonuses to detection.
---
If someone else makes alot of noise they will also impact your sneak bar, I don't know by how much.
---
Man I’m at least 2k every time.  But I love spending ammo 😂
---
Ward dropped that one while he was asleep and it rolled down the hill outside his trailer.
---
Hopefully playing on PC is how I experienced playing on XB1. When I first started there were a lot of lvl75+ players dropping me stimpaks, water, upgraded deep pocket armor, guns+ammo, plans+mats, now I have 2 lvl100 toons, and I made it a point to put my camp by vault starting point and intercepting youngins and giving them good stuff to start them out, advice/tips, or helping them for a bit.
---
Happy adventuring, my friend!
---
Will do! Thanks for being so kind. This post was such a great motivator for me.
---
I'll add you when I get the young'un off to bed, around 22:00 or so
---
Your mutant’s had the 33% vats hit chance, right? :)
---
What am I missing? I've not used shotties at all so I'm completely ignorant here sorry lol
---
The highest price you could list it for is 30k and it would sell immediately because it's worth way more than that. One of those things worth too much to sell for caps.
---
check out my mixtape

You mean you didnt go out and smash you disc like all the "influencers" tell you to do?  I dont wanna be the one to tell this to ypu.but you.might be an alien or a lizard man or I guess both is possible too.
---
k, can I have your copper
---
Oh. Friendly hint; after you clear out an area, before you go grabbing everything, look for a bench(any bench will work). That way, you can grab up to your weight limit, walk over to the bench, scrap everything, then go back to collect, then repeat. If you're looking to make ammo, tin cans are your best friend, as they give you both lead and steel. If you were PC, I'd say we should hang but le sigh, you are le PS4
---
My flamethrower melts itself after every battle. I have to bring two to fight the queen.
---
Oh, thanks for looking out for me honey. I do take medication and I have a doctor, but I need to start seeing a therapist again.
---
My old one moved out of state a while back, then covid hit, and I just haven't had the energy to try to find someone I click with again. 
---
But you're right, I should make the effort.  I don't like feeling restricted by my own emotions.
---
Huh? What do you mean “never turns in the quest”? I don’t understand what is meant here.
---
No; the start is pretty brutal, well the whole game is. that's why it's so satisfying to have a good end game build.
---
I tried bloodied(low health = extra damage) heavy at around level 40 sure I could kill things like a monster but I was wet paper towel.
---
Eventually I had a good set of power armor lots of endurance and now I could tank scorched beasts while being at 20% health.
---
A lot of the songs fit into the game and region, but I think that there should be less classy songs in the game and more western/country. Hearing Frank Sinatra would give me a NV and FO4 vibe. To me, it would be like listening to Walking The Floor Over You in Boston. It doesn't fit the atmosphere. 
---
On a side note, I'm pretty sure the licensing for Frank Sinatra songs are expensive. I would rather see them use the money on fixing the game first.
---
You just place a roof where it will clip on the wall, Then place the actualroof where you wanted to place it and remove the first roof
---
Love your username! I make a mean stack of buttermilk pancakes! I'll add you soon as I get back on
---
I thought your other shotty was an AA explosive? Explosive and 33% vats go under the same spot/effect.,(major effect), so you can’t have both. Basically u have a AA/E/15 and a Mutants 33/15
---
That sucks. This game is so glitchy.  Hope it gets better.
---
I got one the first time I did it but just assumed it was awarded the first time you did it. Like an achievement. Didn’t know you had a low chance to score multiples. Good to know.
---
Lol! Sorry. I needed to get that out of me.
---
Red hazmat suit???
---
Yea my mistake, I corrected it. But what does the vats chance have to do with dmg?
---
Good to know.
---
Facts, I need a big brother in this game; but I didn’t know that about the tin cans. That’s gonna be useful af
---
Now how can a crab be kosher? lol. 
---
I'll be glad to help you rain hellfire on the deserving! Look for my request in a bit! :)
---
It's always nice to brighten someone's day and help them push past the early stages. After the treasure hunter event, when I was lucky enough to get all the outfit plans, I stalk people around the map and when they spot me I drop both outfits with the hats and then run away. 😂
---
STAY IN THE FOREST.
---
You're less likely to run into higher levels in that area. Highly suggest you just grind that area until level 25. Go melee, knives especially, low cost in materials, easy to repair. This will get you more junk than you need, sell everything that has no use to you. Basic plans for clothing provide a good return in caps, as does cooking meat and selling to vendors. Take your time, work out when you feel confident to travel further, and try to not rush through the early missions.
---
Your username says you're a daddy, but your actions say your Father Christmas. :)
---
Thanks for helping the other folks like myself.
---
Not a bad idea, fucking scorched beasts haunt me on this run. I encountered them way too frequently and they’d keister my ass even after running miles in any direction
---
Get to the point where you pump the chemicals in the river that triger Strangler Bloom from the one Free State scientist and just never pick up any of it. Just have others grab it. Super useful as it works server wide so anyone down there can get some.
---
I'll add you nuke, I've been looking for other people to play with as well but I'm fairly new to the game since Wastelanders.  Name in game is radleyburb0n.✌️
---
For real, or at least make the cap limit like 200k or something.
---
It's an ok gun eats ammo though if you want an amazing weapon the gauss Shotgun in every way is better and I've been living off the same 20k rounds since I got it doesn't even need to be bloodied to one shot most things and vats it broken with it been able to shoot through walls and snipe with it basicly gun is extremely fun.
---
All good. I just learned this a few weeks ago myself. Lol. I’m not an expert..but There are 3 effects on a shotty that make them ridiculously powerful. Also an armor effect can give it to any shotty u use. Angry Turtle has a video about this on YouTube. Basically bugged (in a good way) damage...till they fix it that is...what Betthesda...it might take a while. Lol
---
lol yeah, there's a lot of stuff to learn and get used to. Also, pencils give you wood and lead, so always pick up pencils!
---
Suggestion as a fellow rifle user - have you considered trying out a lever action rifle? It’ll match the damage of your 50 caliber (excluding legendary effects), fires faster, and the ammo drops in larger amounts.
---
just to make sure, same username on reddit as fo76?
---
I do the same with my alt. Don't finish the quest and always blooms to pick.
---
True. I just thought following quest lines would prove fruitful.
---
is that the good one or the bunk one with a similar name.. I cant keep them straight
---
Yep, someone dropped a stack of glowing meat a little while ago and I said “:Yoink!: Thanks for the couple hundred in caps!”
---
Hahaha yeah and when the missus plays games too.... Gotta be gentle or they'll never play again
---
It's L2 on PS4 :)
---
Bruh lol. I missed tin cans and now pencils. The fallout universe left me back in the Capital Wastes/Commonwealth
---
you know what I am done with..?
---
butthurt threads..
---
I drop random 3* legendaries I'm unable to scrip at train stations for other people 😅
---
It’s 50, iirc.
---
And a mirlurk king spawns there i think
---
Follow the road away from foundation, you'll come across a small bridge, the bridge has a culvert under it, have seen it used as a bunker with the tunnel as the entrance
---
Didn't know you could block! thanks, that makes me feel safer.
---
That’s why I chose to use the Gatling gun over the minigun
---
Will do! thanks a lot.
---
The explosives give good ammo currency, though
---
I'm not much higher than you, but i'd run through it with you. Getting to that point now myself. username is: welcome\_thr1llho
---
I'm the same way. I get close to my cap limit, and I go to the Whitespring and buy some plans. I'm out of plans to buy at several of the bots already.
---
Some people don't appreciate the truth, especially when it goes against what they want.
---
Still feels far too limiting to the players. 
---
I hate that I can't add anymore skill points after level 50 and your max health doesn't go up no matter how much you level up.
---
I hate that every time I need to pick a lock or hack a computer I have to swap out these dumbass cards, then swap back to  other minor convenience cards that help me carry more ammo or junk immediately after I'm done picking the lock.
---
I hate that all 3\* legendary mobs usually drop 1\* or 2\* loot. Especially the SBQ
---
I hate that in order to store as much junk as I want in my stash, I have to pay a monthly fee.
---
I hate that it still waits for me to log all the way in to tell me my camp can't be placed. Then when I tell it to find another world, it logs me into another one where my camp still can't be placed.
---
Wastelanders fixed pretty much nothing at all. It added the daily chore of farming for notes for gold for new plans, and it added a Wendigo Colossus which doesn't have a better drop rate than any other 3\* legendary mob, doesn't give quest rewards or notes when killed, and has like a 1/20 chance to spawn every 10 minutes after you've wasted a nuke drop.
---
Solved this was it.
---
This + same thing for visiting the purveyor, I don't like the double loading screen since she moved.
---
I think he had some tool/mod that pokes into the game files and extracts data he used to make reliable maps. Where the issue was is the tool he used had the potential to do alot more harmful and cheaty things and he ended up getting a very harsh ban after he reported a game breaking bug or cheat that he found because of this tool, in fairness he DID break Terms of service but another of people think he didn't deserve to get banned because he was doing a lot of good for the community by spreading info and making the maps but it was strongly suspected there was more behind the ban than was revealed because it wasn't an automatic ban it was personally issues meaning Bethesda must have had more evidence and reason to ban him
---
Oh ok, I understand now thanks. Unfortunately I’m about 500 levels past that point in the game. I might make an alt character though just to do as you’ve described. That does seem like it’d be super useful.
---
Why can't be get a bank system. ESO has it and it great. But then again someone would find a way to exploit it and ruin it
---
That’d piss off the user base so much, Bethesda may do it.
---
Why would bloodied get nerfed when it's already high risk lol... I'm a bloodied build and if I sneeze I die
---
That's the good one
---
I just buy it when I get close to cap cap.
---
Why did this change happen?
---
That's the thing about anxiety - it isn't really rational. It can be over very strange things. If you had a bad experience one time, anxiety can make you believe that every time you do anything even remotely like that previous experience, it will end badly. 
---
Anxiety is spiraling, as well. It's irrational, overwhelming, and debilitating. But the kindness I've experienced on this thread has been very uplifting and encouraging. 
---
It might seem odd to you, and that's okay - I'm glad you don't have the same issues, as I wouldn't wish them on others.
---
I get willed with either teeth or bullets... or burn marks... or missing a leg

---
Goddamn that's awful. Thanks for the info.
---
Wow thanks for the most obvious advice, and for trying to be condescending about it.
---
Secondary question. Where can you find it? I know it is super rare but where is it's spawn point? And what percentage does it have to spawn?
---
Licensing costs are beyond what Bethesda is going to pay. The older stuff is cheaper, so it fits. Covers cost less, too.
---
Honestly, I like Spank's covers of Country Roads and Ring of Fire. The singer has a really nice voice, and I wouldn't even be mad if they snuck a couple of more covers in.
---
That being said, they could add a whole lot more country and blues from the 30s and 40s. This is the Granddad's country I grew up with. I'd like to see them add some of the "Bakersfield Sound" like Buck Owens, or rockabilly like early Wanda Jackson. But, they aren't likely to add music. Maybe a song or two, but they didn't even add the Eddie Cochran song from the Wastelanders trailer. At this point, I wouldn't count on any additions. (I hope, though. Always hope.)
---
I think this is honestly my favorite soundtrack of any Fallout game. I would like a DJ-free station now that I've heard all her dialogue a couple hundred times.
---
haha! I bet they were left confused and appreciative. What a fun way to play. I think I will make this sort of thing a goal in the future: a reward for overcoming my fears.
---
/yawn.
---
This again?
---
Hey man. I love building bases. I can totally make you a Red Rocket Garage and House combo
---
I've never used vampires because I have healing factor mutation that heals outside of combat. Bloodied and Junkies are widely considered the best right now. My personal main weapon is a junkies explosive handmade. I run a sneak commando and it does serious damage.
---
Chameleon only works when you're still. The armor is what you want, not the mutation. Agility not that big a deal on cham build, you can get almost perfect stealth even in the middle of danger. Here's my main, testing out the facemask and had the high capacity backpack so he took a lot of rads, but you can see his stealth is no joke xD
---
Fixer really puts it over the top. It's basically all chameleon, 1 harder to detect, one shadowed, one shrouded wood, ultralite on all, dense or jetpack chest. Fixer is the key to making it that good though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEmhk7aEscQ
---
My unyielding is ok. He can't do that though for lots of reasons.
---
The problem is (for right now) I'm pretty new to the game still (Lvl 26) so I only have like 2k caps. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Once I'm later on in the game ill remember that when I'm rich enough. Thanks!
---
There is a particular set of circumstance that can cause this.
---
The game tries to spawn enemies away from players, out of site. This is true everywhere, enemies will always pop up around corners, on the other sides of doors, ect. 
---
If there are a lot of people in the event, arranged to block enough of the spawns in the main room the game will spawn things outside in the area entering into the event, if you fast travel and block these spawns the enemy will spawn even farther away, either at the entrance to the mine itself where they can bug out and exit the mine to the overworld, or in the far back area where other mole miners spawn, too far away to aggro on the players and extractors. They can still be hunted and killed, you just have to find them. 
---
Oh, and if you don't kill one of the supervisor before the next tries to spawn then the spawn will be blocked, as the game only allows one at a time, so if one spawns far away and isn't killed it can stop the others appearing.
---
Can your alt pick up the blooms and then not finish the quest?
---
Lol...exactly.  I mean if someone is complaining about 1 to 2 extra seconds of load time, id do it if i was them. Way too much complaining for me.
---
The 1400 daily limit/30000 max is to put a measure of control on the economy in the game.  Otherwise we would have more currencies than the 3 we already do.  If it were a 2800/60000 cap then that would be the new complaint.  Players have gotten around this by selling legendaries in their own stores.  Now their complaint is they hit the 30k cap but people are still able to buy from their stores. 
---
Not sure what you mean by not being able to farm enough aluminum.  Did not have this issue when leveling a stealth sniper.  Had to farm for it and still do but it wasn't prohibitive.  
---
Your other complaints sound more like the lack of end game issue.  Everyone has that same issue of 60 unspent levels at 150. 
---
The thing I wish I'd have done sooner was make a mutant unarmed build.  Tons of leftover mats that I now give to my heavy gunner and sniper.
---
It can stick for me.
---
I agree
---
As with anything take it with a grain of salt, a lot of the info was hear say
---
For sure the caps limit even I hit
---
I meant everything else. I’m not farming legendarios so I’m never maxing our scrip. Haven’t reached bullions yet but I wouldn’t farm that either
---
I generally explore while wandering towards a quest and then sell. 
---
I swear I wish I had yalls problem because then I’d be rich
---
I personally don’t ,ind managing my inventory like it’s been in every other fallout game. Tho tbf I did take a break when I hit the original stash limit (500 I think?)
---
And to the bottom of roofs and floors.
---
This one gets it :)
---
Happy travels man!
---
No they should just bring back survival
---
Excavator armor and crafting with ammosmith and super duper is how you get a lot. 
---
What platform you on?  If PS4 I can hook you up with what I’ve got laying around. 
---
I dropped probably 1200 rounds of .44 the other day before I learned about the upcoming ammo converter. Now I’m hoarding all pew pews again.
---
This 1000%
---
THAT was well worth a watch.
---
Yeah don't go back to finish the quest.
---
That's super are you available
---
Level 26? Do the quest to get the excavator power armor. From there, go to Lucky Hole Mine and mine all the lead. Then go to Tanagra Town in the Mire and kill the cave crickets for their acid. Smelt the lead, make gunpowder, and then ammo. Doing that is an easy way to make a bunch.
---
And you wouldn't even get 30k unless you had literally 0 caps in your inventory at the moment someone bought it.
---
Nope, jetpack is only in the bundle.
---
Not now. But tommorow I am definitely. I have been wanting to make a camp like that and I am very excited to do one
---
I’m in Australia but add me anyway, if we ever on at the same time I’ll jump in. Lvl 46 
---
PSN - Taxi-560
---
If you want to be safer, try running Blocker 3 ranks, Fireproof 2 ranks, Dodgy 3 ranks( if you don't use vatsmuch ) , and serendipity ( if you run bloodied ).
---
 Armor Plated backpack is a good boost too ( + 80 armor iirc ), which is equivalent to an additional combat armor chest piece.
---
This is super useful info for me. Thank you.
---
Go start the backpack quest line, go do the ski resort agility course, you can literally do it over and over again for unlimited stimpacks, radaways, explosives, 50 caps a run, you can make a bunch of caps this way per hour depending on your agility level. I did this with my new character and made enough to buy a few thousand rounds of 556 pretty quickly
---
Wow I feel like a fucking fool. They should clarify on the skin itself that it doesn't come with the jetpack. Oh well.
---
Ok thanks am available after work or do I even have to be online for you to be at my camp
---
Stash all your junk, strip naked, and prepare yourself for a paddling.
---
Not just Navi i have vega 64 and the reflexions with zebra chromed textures apear in my game too. Stoped for a while because it's a game breaking experience.
---
Check out my build for ideas :)
---
It does, the bundle has the jetpack listed while the standalone doesn't.
---
You just need to be online and on my team to let me build. But I dont think you can be afk for longer than an hour
---
the answer is "that is not a feature that can be monetized, and requires more than zero dev time, therefore resources will not be allocated"
---
if there is something that you want, and you are able to say "the player can do _____ to solve this problem" then it will *never* be updated  (regardless of how ridiculous the player solution is)
---
Im usually on late during the week 1am est to 6am but im usually on all hours of the weekend. Feel free to add
---
Added, hopefully see you ingame sometime :)
---
Ah!  I did not know that.  Yeah so then I suggest switching to a weapon that gets your more ammo when you make it.  Using .45 ammo is a good suggestion.  It's rather plentiful and when you make it you get a decent amount.
---
Sweet as, thank you, added you, catch you ingame
---
I never thought I’d see the name of the city I was born in on a Fallout subreddit for anything other than Fallout 1. 
---
But yes. The entire Buck Owens feel needs to come to Fallout. As it stands right now, the only game that has really any country/western music is New Vegas. And I understand that it’s for a “feel” for the game, but more than just Vegas liked Hank Sr. back then. “Country” for a reason, and all that.
---
I did almost the same thing as you... I stopped playing at about August last year. I eventually came back and the wastelanders quests are very entertaining compared to the game earlier.
---
Why is this?
---
Looks cool
---
Hey I'm down to do it for ya! Lol lmk in a pm if you need help
---
I’ve only gotten it once in any game and I wasn’t freaking looking because I heard a noise
---
Yeah, I'm at random because I never knew about builds, but I am a melee build and do 1k+ damage because of blooded. I wish I can send a picture to show my cards in the table (sorry gotta say it)
---
Not everyone wants to PVP though.
---
Why go to the Whitesprings to gather random crap? Why not go to another plastic farming area and hit that up until you hit the 255 limit. Then you can constantly be cycling through plastic without having to waste too much effort picking up other junk you may not need.
---
Id take a dozen or so
---
I know, the standalone should say it doesn't contain the jetpack lol.
---
Just remember that the PA frame has 40% DR and 90% RR built into it, so while the numbers might be similar as far as defense goes, the damage resistance is actually much lower on the SS. Having said that, I'm running a full set of SS with the jetpack and I love how mobile I am, I don't think I could go to a power armour character after this.
---
Have been looking through vendors for a while, down to my last one. PSN mattdabratt23
---
Imo Secret Service is a lot better if you get buttressed plus the Vanguard or Bolstering your Stats will be crazy high.
---
I'll play with you. PSN is big_boy62054.
---
At least if that ammo had 0 weight, maybe I’d keep it.
---
Then dont get the weapon
---
Nope. Each character has a loot pool and a dice roll. That’s it.
---
Enough people complain about it. But know the feeling. Which is why I hate using it
---
Sooooo, they shouldn’t bring survival back because not everyone wants to PvP? Using your logic NW should get removed lol
---
Shotgun ammo I prefer to buy it at 1 cap, if you are low on caps then kill mole miners. Other types I craft them.
---
Sounds good buddy. IGN: C0DE_E with a zero. You can put your ign here or DM it to me.
---
If it helps, I use a full set of vanguard SS armor with buttressed mods. That, plus armor backpack, scaly skin mutation, shielded BOS underarmor, and barbarian perk, I get 727 ballistic damage resist, 630 energy resist and 302 rad resist
---
I had Sophia dressed up in the Sheepsquatch Imposter outfit for a few days, shes now wearing the Stalker outfit with the stalker bandana, a military cap and an enclave eyepatch. I had the Settler chick who plays guitar dressed up in the blood eagle jacket with the ritual mask on, I'd dress up in the ritual outfit and we'd jam together, I have a screenshot of it somewhere.
---
I didn't mean it like that, I meant there should be an alternative to survival to get these weapons if you're not a fan of PvP.
---
From a technical standpoint, that would be redundant. You don't list what's not included in a standalone. It'd be like the diner set saying it doesn't come with red rocket stairs, cooler, or lamp.
---
Mine's the same as my reddit username, StrategicWindSock
---
Actually your all wrong you cant compare the two cus ones armor the other is power armor there 2 different things
---
So there should be an alternate way to activate the scorchedbeast queen because I dont like going to nuke silos.
---
After checking on a couple FO76 trading subs, it seems to go for anywhere from 25-50k. It looks like you could aslo trade for any other rare outfit(s) or possibly god tier gear. Idk about legacies though, probably not. Its a pretty rare item that can go for a good trade if you have interest in trading it. However, I do not recommend using player to player trading, as there is no protection against getting scammed. 
---
There are trade mediators that are supposed to collect both items and then give them to the respective players as a means to complete the trade fairly, but I've even seen those be scam setups.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Just yesterday I accidentally invited someone to a team when I was trying to fast travel to their camp and instantly logged off instead of just telling them it was an accident. Lol
---
The anxiety is real and I only just barely eek by enough to interact with other players at all but I hope you have a great time with the game.
---
Well its obviously needed, I was under the impression it came with it.
---
Odd, I've had an increase in blooms after Wastelanders. Every time I go to the plant there are at least two or three blooming. I thought they decided to finally make it no longer rare. I now have 80 radshield. Guess I'm just lucky? On PS4.
---
I have both, don't waste your time on the PA. The effective difference between it and T51 is less than 5 points for ballistic. It has great rad resist but that's not enough reason to get it imo. I went from a PA build for over 200 levels to using SS, and that's what I recommend.
---
Just FYI (not everyone knows this) there is a PS app for just texting; I use it daily for when playing w those w out a mic or when I don’t feel like being that social. Better than keyboard texting and do not have to leave the game.
---
I got a fully modded and modified set of T-65. The bad boy makes you feel like a walking tank
---
Oook. I’ll bite... which one is that ?
---
Depends on the enemy and the stats of the gun your using
---
1 hour? - Gosh you were lucky.
---
If It's not listed It's not included, that's user error. Like I said, It's redundant to list items not included because by ommitting them they are automatically assumed to not be part of the item.
---
Oh nevermind you were trading to others, i thought you were trying to trade across characters you own, my mistake i misread.
---
Cool. I’ll ad you in the morning when I get back on. I play randomly all hours of the day and night. Just depends on the day.
---
ALSO! The higher you are the easier it gets. You kill things quicker and easier so you use less bullets. And you have more caps for buying and better perk cards for making ammo and stuff. 
---
Are you on xbox by any chance?
---
I play on pc
---
I agree completely. The modern production just sticks out like a sore thumb. Even Wouldn’t it be nice”, which is the original version, still doesn’t quite feel right. 
---
The new versions of the songs aren’t bad versions, they just don’t fit the game world.
---
Absolutely! I saw in another comment that you’re a woman. I am too! There’s not many women in game, so it’s awesome to play with another!
---
Have you checked out the back end of a Snallygaster?  It has a man's butt and legs.  Definitely worthy of a snapshot.
---
Honestly it depends on your build. For me I only feel PA is useful in nuke zones and heavy gun builds for stabilized. The mobility and legendary effects given by this armor are superior to PA by a long shot. My main runs normal armor, uny sent ap refresh armor, and my heavy runs power armor, SH soon to be T-65. I enjoy my main commando build more because of the movement and defence is better because of sentinel and perk cards. Also no fusion cores needed. Just my opinion tho.
---
Not all users are as observant. Bethesda is in the industry of customer service. A small disclaimer wouldn't hurt.
---
That's typically what happens, then you turn on your mic and tell them they're dumbasses because they don't know how to play an event that's a year old.
---
Sophia in a Veil of Mystery and a Tattered Dress. She is dummy thicc.
---
Ah dang. Im on ps4. Have some spare caps and ammo laying around. Would have tried to ease the pain. Best of luck though mate.
---
There are tones of amazing builds my first play though I did vats pistols with flintlock guns and revolver.
---
Sure it wasn't great at long fights, but boy did I do alot of damage untill my vats meter ran out. Headshot like 3 ghouls then run for my life from the last one. 
---
My wife is a sneaky sniper with semi auto rifles, she is a beast but runs for the hills once something finds her.
---
She will frequently out damage me in stealth but does pretty bad running and gunning.
---
What's the easiest way to get ammo but also the most time-efficient? I only have at most 2 hours a night to play.  I would really rather do the quests and stuff, gathering ingredients for ammo or whatever isn't that interesting to me.
---
Thank you for the correction. I leave my purifiers unlocked so I honestly didn't remember which button it was.
---
I suggest using VATS with that effect. :) You’ll do a TON more damage. You should test it out with or without VATS and see what you think. ;)
---
Ah thanks anyway
---
Lol then dont die
---
 This game is already so ee
---
So there should be an alternate way to get NW rewards for those that aren’t fans of PvP, AFK players, hackers, and bush campers.
---
Part of the fun of survival weapons was you had to go out of your comfort zone for a little bit to get the weapons. Why replace that with some little quest, or even the same challenges but with no added risk? Doesn’t sound fun at all.
---
Well, that's good to know. I don't mind a little ammo gathering at times but I'm always low it seems.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Hold up. I was unaware of this and no one in the "PA sucks" threads mention it.
---
That's a flat 40% damage reduction to all incoming damage?
---
You’re actually able to build inside the red rocket in Morgantown
---
I have and use both on my main. I run around in SS, but throw on T-65 for high level fights.  SBQ, Encryptid, Project Paradise, etc Honestly though, if you already have a full set of T-51 then don't be in a rush to get the T-65. It isnt *that* much better. 
---
I have a full set of SS and T-65 just for the sake of having them
---
Oh it's fine 👍
---
oh, god, I think I know exactly what you mean! You realize what you did, and a jolt of fear (and adrenaline) spikes through you, activating your fight or flight instinct, and you just...escape. Sitting with the anxiety is so painful, it's just easier to get away from what caused it. I feel you, friend.
---
Mind you, you should be able to commit hari kari IMO.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Depending on the atom cost I may wait even longer.
---
Thanks! His name is Mr. Clawer.
---
I must agree. Do these folks have fallout kids to put thru college!? It’s ridic. 
---
And I never sell a 1* for more than $100 for levels under 30. All other 1*s get turned in. Waste of time and space. 
---
Nothing is that important to spend 100k caps on. If u work at it, play the game the way it’s intended and are patient, you will find the same items. Or better. It’s sadly a mirror image of how the world today is...everyone wants it RIGHT NOW. No concept of working hard. Half the fun is exploring and looting all the stuff and then trying to maneuver when ur 90 lbs overweight. 
---
That’s mostly those who never played fallout and just got into it cuz it went online. They are missing out and then causing others to miss out as well. 
---
Do the quests! The stories and attention to fine details are what makes these games soo amazing. And keep it’s devout players coming back, begging for more.  
---
Just try Fallout 4!
---
It is AMAZING!
---
Honestly that's the only one I know for a bunch of plastic. And I know going internal WS can definitely go over 255 quick going through the upstairs areas.
---
I don't know if this would be possible - it just depends on how close you can build your camp to another building. But, if I was in your shoes, I would try to look for a Red Rocket already in the world and try to see if I can build the shop right next to it so that it all looks like it is part of the same complex. That way you can see what is already there and build an expansion for it. I thought that would make it blend into the world really well. 
---
Again, I am not sure if this would be possible though - you will just have to try it if you like the idea.
---
Then that is the user's fault, It's as easy as that. While yes, for people who don't understand that buying individual items won't grant unlisted secondary items It's be nice to list that, but It's redundant for the majority.
---
Hmm ill look into that armor and those perks, thanks.
---
I'm on PC, thanks though.
---
Ouch, 1200 rounds? Also, the ammo converter sounds great. I have a bit of .38 and I don't really use automatic guns.
---
I just assumed the queen was like those dark spawn brood mothers from the expansion of the first dragon age game.
---
She usually just chills underground pumping out scorchbeasts in large litters that mature extremely fast (BoS terminal speculates / confirms they mature fast).
---
The nuclear bomb causes the underground caverns to collapse so she escapes out of the fissure where we then attack her.
---
We kill her and the scorched threat is ended (storyline wise).
---
Being a mammal, she is capable of being very intelligent due to the mammalian brain.  Throw on some radiation, FEV, and ultracite, and you get what you get.
---
I also assume, personally, that she communicates with the scorched via sound waves rather than some sort of actual hive mind.  Much like scorchbeasts seem to.
---
Hence why they just wander around aimlessly most of the time but when a SB or the SBQ shows herself shows up they all come running.
---
Morgantown HS for plastic?  Must try this.
---
On paper the base difference between T51b and T65 is almost 100 for DR. How are you only getting 5?
---
Yay! I'm so excited. I'm really glad I made this post.
---
I try to teach him to stay outside in the yard but sometimes he sneaks back inside when I'm away.
---
One time I got it for an hour and a half without a single person even trying to take it. Tbf it was a weird time of day but...
---
We're not booing we're saying DaVooooooooooooo
---
I wish you could edit photos that you’ve taken with the Pro camera so you can add filters and borders 🙏🙏🙏
---
Awesome! See you in the wastes!
---
.308 ammo is everywhere. Especially on scorched.
---
I just rotate between .45 and .308 when one gets low.
---
Is T-65 significantly better than, say, T51b for DR? On paper it seems it would be but other users have said otherwise.
---
76 has some, but they could include so much of that old country with the grainy sound and the folksy twang.
---
If anything would fit best in Appalachia, it would be bluegrass, but they didn't include any.
---
It'd be cool to see if they could do any of the really old Carter Family stuff. "Can the Circle Be Unbroken" is one of the great classics and it would fit well with the storyline. (Even if BioShock Infinite used it differently.)
---
Take the rail south from sunnytop station.  Some good flat land there that i thought made for a good spot though I’m now in a spot where I’ll never move.
---
Ur a god
---
WAIT THERES A CAP LIMIT?!? 
---
NOOOOOOO
---
I'm actually working on the Pioneer Scout questline atm but I ran out of ammo lol.
---
Hmm, thanks for the tip. It seems like a decent way to get a lot, time efficiently.
---
Add me stormy76
---
Then by that logic, there should be an alternative way to get the Ghillie suit if someone doesn’t like NW. 
---
Some things are exclusives. This is true in many MMOs. 
---
Like the Mountain Outfit. If you weren’t playing prior to Wastelanders, then you didn’t earn it.
---
I will
---
Accidentally posted that comment before finishing. Just edited. 
---
But no, there is not a significant difference in the DR of the 2 sets. T-51 is just fine if you have it
---
Hmm seems like a fairly decent way to get a lot, but it seems like a lot of traveling and I don't really have a lot of time to walk or caps to fast travel.
---
Agreed. Monster Mash is my new favourite however: you don’t even need to to run around grabbing the candy, just nice to the first candy bag and farm the ghouls since they’re attracted to it. Twelve minutes of waves and waves of ghouls. I get at least three 3* legendary drops from it and a massive XP boost.
---
Because enemies have continually been buffed over the lifetime of the game, you really need to focus on one weapon and style per character.  Jack of all trades doesn’t function all that well in this game.  I make alts to enjoy different kinds of weapons, but I could see how that might be unappealing to start from scratch.  Xp weekends are great for starting up a new build.
---
Did you maybe accidentally disable a perk card?

Here’s a solid lead farming route that doesn’t require using Lucky Hole Mine. That will let you save up your Acid to make Gunpowder as needed. If you need places to farm Steel, I recommend running Uranium Fever whenever it shows up. During my last run I ended up with over 1k Steel from scrapping all the gear they dropped. You can also reference this doc for Steel or other resources:  https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
**This is the route I use:** *(The #c at the end is how many caps it takes to Fast Travel from the previously listed spot. The entire route costs about 100 caps. If your C.A.M.P. is placed along the route somewhere (mine is near Silo Alpha, for example) you can reduce this as well as have a guaranteed spot to dump your loot easily. And having the Survival Tent will make this easier, especially after the silo runs.)*
---
+ Green Country Lodge (40 Lead Scrap) 9c from Vault 76
---
+ Eastern Regional Penitentiary (80 Lead Scrap) 18c  (or 12c from Vault 76)
---
+ Missile Silo Bravo (80 Lead Scrap) 10c
---
+ Pleasant Valley Cabins &amp; Ski Resort (90 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Alpha (80 Lead Scrap) 4c
---
+ Monorail Elevator (80 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Charlie (80 Lead Scrap) 13c
---
+ Charleston Fire Department (80 Lead Scrap) 18c
---
It’s usually about 600 Lead Scrap, give or take. For the silos, just run in to the gym on the first floor, grab the weights and run out. For the monorail elevator, wear your Power Armor (it’s a long drop if you misstep).
---
600 lead scrap should get you about 4200 rounds of 5.56 with Ammosmith 2 &amp; Super Duper 3. If you make sure that your damage perks are optimized, you can usually kill most enemies with just a few rounds. 
---
That run above doesn’t even factor in Luck Hole mine or the random lead you can pick up from other world items. Make sure Lead is one of your tagged junk items and just pick up items that show as tagged with the magnifying glass. 
---
With just a short time dedicated to an efficient run, you can have more than enough ammo. I run a .50 cal on my main, currently have 20K+ rounds for that and still craft and sell about 30-40k 5.56 rounds every week.
---
I would add that equipping the concentrated fire perk at level one will allow you to target heads with vats.  It’s a huge ammo saver, your headshots have much greater impact on the enemy.
---
Really? Thank you I will have to try it out!
---
Sorry, they’re all gone 😅
---
Make sure you're specced into the right special for your weapon. You want to maximise your damage. 
---
If you like single shots guns try a combat rifle or a fixer. People who know the fixer plan can make them for level 20, 30 upwards. The Fixer and Handmade are classed as the best 2 rifles in the game.
---
It degrades about as fast as SB meat, and it’s quite heavy, but if you’re running Carnivore and/or a melee build it’s good food to keep. Cooking it gives solid XP and it sells for decent caps.
---
You'd think there'd be more records or holotapes left to find with only 25 years since the bombs fell. If we could find and deliver a few new ones as part of an expansion, that'd be swell.
---
I think I'm still a low level bc of how time I spend micromanaging and then not having enough scrap to build and upgrade the things I want. I go out and get scrap, grt overncumbered, search for a workbench, scrap then go back to camp, rinse and repeat.
---
I have been doing that but with .308 and shells
---
The problem is I'm still starting to run low because I'm doing a lot of quests in the Savage Divide and other locations that have enemies way above my level so I have to use a lot of ammo.
---
I like the cap limit. Keeps people from creating bank characters and spending hours and hours buying cheaper stuff and putting it up for ridiculous amounts. I tried to go Back to wow, level 12 items for 3000 gold. It’s just ridiculous. People already try to sell crap on the discord for 90k caps. No. I saw a pepperoni roll recipe yesterday for 20k in a vendor. I guarantee they won’t get all of that so set it lower. It’s not worth it anyway. I don’t use any bonuses from food or chems and still one shot everything with a two star pump shotgun vamp/cripple. I can’t wait for one Appalachia where things might be more difficult.
---
I created a Red Rocket just with camp materials and it did not look good. I'll walk across the map to look for camp-able preset buildings. Thank you!
---
I seem to get a plan on every Distant Thunder I do, but it will generally be the SAME plan over and over until I log off for a while/jump servers.
---
EDIT: And yeah, the plan can be an armor piece or a mod. I got 4 T-60 Optimized Bracers plans in a row one day. 😑
---
Yeah the mask is supposed to be removed when the event pops up, it should disappear when you exit the game. Shame there isn't a version you can keep.
---
U must play with others. Its hard to grief in adventure mode without a nuke tho if u don't lock ur stuff I'll have it.
---
Player vending is amazing as u see other peoples camps and get good prices for stuff. And events like uranium feaver are funner.
---
Go for it there's nothing to be scared off I haven't met a dick yet but there are fools
---
If you follow the steps up the mountain by the bed and breakfast the entire ridge line is full of good flat spots.  Takes about 2 minutes to sprint to foundation.
---
Na it's just u f00die. Get g00d. eZzzZ 
---
Imagine plying on console. PC Master race Boiiiiiiiii 
---
Also it shouldn't be guns plural we all know u guys only use teslas. U should specify just Tesla next time
---
I have a stealth rifleman build so I tend to 1-4 shot everything outside of the nuke zones.
---
Your pain is tangible. I feel yah
---
Damn, that's awful. My system isn't nearly as good but I can run everywhere else at 60fps on ultra, except this place, it's annoying.
---
It’s a bug, it lasts until you die, no one can see the mask except you. There are ways to keep the mask though I don’t know any
---
Steel: you’re best bet is scrapping weapons using the scrapper perk.  The uranium fever event is great for this.  So is a super mutant horde event if you just leave the alpha Alive.
---
Specifics places like westek and Charleston capital buildings are also good sources...￼
---
Also the Grafton steel mill...not for the resource spots but for the super mutants.
---
Cloth: pre war money.  Collision course event at the airport.  Easy to trigger and easy to do.
---
Acid: hemlock holes workshop.  Tangara town inside the tree for cave crickets.  The glassed cavern, loot all the cave cricket bodies in there.
---
Also I find the arktos pharma event a good source due to the crickets, honey beasts, snallygasters, and you guai that spawn.
---
Lead: lucky hole mine with excavator armour.
---
The various gyms around the game (Grafton penitentiary, hotel in flatwoods, Charleston fire department, vaulted university, the first part of each nuke silo (I just go in, loot the gyms and the. Leave).
---
Apply the chemist perk, the ammosmith perk, and the super duper perk, If you have them.
---
Smelt the cloth and acid to get gunpowder.
---
Smelt the lead ore with acid to make lead scrap.
---
Craft your ammo of choice using the gunpowder, lead, and steel.
---
I also just buy steel, lead, and acid, in bulk when I see it...yeah I could just go farm it but I don’t like to
---
They don't call them Bugthesda for no reason.
---
Most of the bugs I've encountered are annoying at worst, at least. I had Play Time bugged for months and it finally fixed itself once I was able to reject the quests and wait a couple of days for it to reset for me.
---
Well if you’re on xb1 and wanna get rid of that hm let me know lol
---
I truly thought the one where you laugh and keel over was a laughing one but maybe it’s the person puking.
---
I'll check that out, it's hard to find flat places for camps, especially for buildings that are not floating. Thank you!
---
I dress Beckett up in a slave collar and grognak costume... Hes my house b*tch
---
I think it's a glitch. Happened to me one time when I left it in the middle to go to Fasnacht, and I still had the mask on for the parade which was fun. But I also couldn't find it in my inventory, and if I equipped other big hats, they would clip through it and equip like it wasn't there.
---
Interesting. Currently, my favorite weapons are a sniper and a shotgun. I have been planning to get the Rifleman and Shotgun Perks. 
---
Here is the build I have been planning. I know it's not perfect but it has a lot of perks I really like.  [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwcIAwcNBwQBAQEAOk8DLQHEAQPNAQFaAVwBpgEBoQEBcAUOAS8DVAMLAw8FNQFbAV0BpwEBogEBEgFsA7cBAawBAWUB6wEDNgLlAQS7AQHXAQEA](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwcIAwcNBwQBAQEAOk8DLQHEAQPNAQFaAVwBpgEBoQEBcAUOAS8DVAMLAw8FNQFbAV0BpwEBogEBEgFsA7cBAawBAWUB6wEDNgLlAQS7AQHXAQEA)
---
I don't think you can actually get the mask as a reward.
---
Same question so tagging along for the journey!
---
A very old glitch allowed you to keep it, even reproduce it. I have one character that has one,
---
can wear it but can’t stash or sell it. I’m pretty sure if I drop it it’s gone forever. It’s a cool mask, hope it’s an atom shop thing someday.
---
Welcome my friend!
---
Chances are, it'll be back. I've played since the beginning and it may take a while, but I have seen most things in the Atomic Shop more than once.
---
I've got one of a moleman going reverse cowgirl on another moleman, wanna trade pic?
---
Is incessantly crying about stash limits a pro player strat or something?
---
Wow. Thanks this sounds pretty great!
---
Ffr seems to do more damage and causes less degradation in my experience.
---
Hmm. No issues like that here (Xbox)
---
Follow up question, how do i add people?
---
Traded it for melee weapons already but ty.
---
I’m level 52 on PS4, first online game I’ve ever played. Everyone is preposterously nice. People keep giving me presents. Hardly anyone seems to use a mic, though I do. Plenty of solitude if you want it but I’m enjoying the serendipitous encounters with random people. Jump in, it’s fun
---
What the heck kinda prices are you getting? Maybe I need to start putting points in Charisma before it's too late
---
Exactly. 
---
If you want the rewards, you should do the related content. 
---
If you missed the time frame, that’s unfortunate. But that would cheapen the efforts the other players put in.
---
Honestly forgot guns broke been 2 weeks since I repaired my Gauss Shotgun lol.
---
I like the photomode for taking [some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/8uUJPf9) that make for nice loading screens and memories (I converted those images from .png to .jpg for ease of viewing online, which explains any loss of fidelity), but I can't say I ever really use the frames, or the noise and other such overlays. I like the filters, and I do like the depth of field.
---
Speaking of depth of field, I do wish we could focus on a distant target, so that everything near the camera was blurred. Right now the depth of field -mechanic only allows focusing on nearby target so that anything farther away is blurred. Could get some neat photos that way.
---
It does, but you've got better chances doing the Stings and Things and Operation Tidy dailies as well.
---
How many times were you dropped on your head as a child?
---
Had problems with some of the locals, but I’ve noticed that allies are semi-decent in dealing with them.
---
Hmm I might have to do that. I'm not a huge fan of VATS really but sometimes when a lot of things are charging you its hard to use my sniper's scope to line up a headshot.
---
It's probably safe to go on public servers, people are nice and don't grief
---
Lmao. Noo that one would be radiation poisoning
---
Thanks, I'm probably going to do something like that.
---
with one of those magic shottys I killed a level 95 behemoth in 4 shots. felt good, op, but good.
---
Assault rifles and combat shotguns usually go for around 28-38 caps each. Glowing meat when cooked yields me 10 caps each. Some of the weaker weapons like mole miner gauntlets and pump action go for 20ish caps. Purified water sells for 5 caps for me, most chems between 7 and 10caps
---
Luck is important as well as it influences the durability at which they drop which more durability means more caps.
---
For charisma all you really need is 3 to put on hard bargaining. You can also use grape mentats if you have ton to spare
---
Usually I can sweep harpers ferry, and Blackwater's mine and make around 1200-1300 caps.
---
At least I'm smart enough to play on pc
---
Have any dilbert recipies?  Those seem odd as you can sell to a vendor.
---
Otherwise I’d consider scrapping the vendors and restarting.  Extreme but I don’t trust bugged vendors.
---
Lost so many caps... I mean, here ya are, doing the sheepshit event, project paradise or unloading an ungodly amount of ammo into a large queen bat and money bags rolls in and buys that Beserkers handmade that’s been hanging out for, I dunno, a year? all the serums and the usual ammo. What is one to do? Log an bail on missing out on the 1* pitchfork and white wolf fedora? NO WAY MANG!
---
I sold all of mine for 1 cap each ...EXCEPT the mounted scorchbeast and mounted SBQ ones.
---
Go to your friends list on the top of the PS4 homescreen. Then search for friends in the search bar.
---
I put Gramps in a Civil War outfit and hat. I had him in the Red Dress but it was too creepy for me. He kinda reminds me of Jeff Bridges in the Civil War outfit.
---
95%≠100%. You must have bad luck!
---
lmfao 😂 auto-stim legendary or perk will burn through them no problem in an event like that
---
Thanks!
---
This is one of my goals
---
Bwahahaha
---
No idea what that is. I just put my machines back up today since the last patch and filled them back up. Not sure why some are tagged as misc
---
I'll put up some missile turrets. Should be alright but if not, I'm SURE Daguerre will protect the camp with her pipe/10mm pistol.
---
I want more wide stairs that I build I missed the vault one and i keep wanting to build a flush staircase but all the others are small and the ones we do have don't work on upper floors
---
No problem.
---
BTW do you have all of the mounted head plans? I got extras for most of them, but I can just make the rest at your camp.
---
Furious shines on weapons with high rates of fire. Early on I had a 10mm furious pistol and slapped an automatic receiver. I burnt through a ton of ammo but breezed through west tek.
---
Yeah fr. I’m losing  interest now that I’ve completed the Wastelanders content
---
Very true. Either way, less than it's worth by far.
---
Yep, same user name. :)
---
It definitely makes it fun. Sometimes they run like hell and I have to emote at them so they know I'm not hunting them in a hostile way. 😂
---
I tried to come back for wastelanders but froze and stuttered and crashed worse than I had ever before. So I've moved on. I still like seeing the content on the sub, like olayer builds, stories about player interactions and so on. But i don't want to play it again.
---
I have pictures of SBQ while in Radstorms &amp; I tweak the saturation &amp; focusing too make picture mode a lot more thrilling of a experience compared to before. It’s honestly a cool aspect about 76.. even though I really do dislike the borders &amp; will not purchase borders with atoms PERIOD. Lol
---
No FC has a ban on complaining about the game.  It is the only FO76 sub that I never drop out of for that reason.  I figure if you don’t like the negativity that pops up here why no look at the sub that focuses on the positive aspects of the game?
---
It’s not working again for me
---
I like that question I’ve always thought berserker is underrated I think it could be done just gotta try there has to be a better way to play then bloodied or junkie
---
Unfortunately, putting anything in the fridge does count towards your budget.
---
I'm gonna do a museum of goofy stupid weapons that I get. I have a Bloodied Shovel (which actually works well hitting mongrels doing the Buried with Honor quest) to start with. I do usually have it up on a display because I always need a shovel for that stupid quest, so I might as well keep the Bloodied one.
---
I don't actually mind getting garbage weapons like that because I occasionally do get good weapons. I can laugh at the ridiculousness of it all and scrip the rest.
---
You have a lot of points being used for situational things. Lockpicking, Hacking, hard bargain, travel agent. Really. You'll be swimming in caps later so you wont miss travel agent or hard bargain (unless you are buying serum recipes that are 24k) So i'd not make a build including them. 
---
Should probably have 8 in luck. Bloody mess gives 15% extra damage. 15% is 15%
---
You don't need makeshift warrior. 5 Gunsmith is fine but if you have 2 or 3 thats also fine. Just means you'll need to repair more BUT you'll not be struggling for parts by then. 
---
I'd not bother with aquaboy or lead belly. Radiation is not really a problem later. You'll be swimming in radaway and rad-x. And you'll probably have a decontamination shower in your camp. I use ironclad as i don't use power armour. BUT if you're going for a sneaky sniper type build you may not need extra armour. You could probably go with a lot less endurance. Like 1 or 2. Most things should be dead by time they get close to you.
---
I wouldn't bother with the extra carry weight. You can get backpacks which increase carry weight. Or food or drink or chems. And the more you play the less you need to carry as you don't really need stuff
---
And you definitely want 15 in perception. 3 each in your rifleman cards. 3 concentrated fire for taking out legs (makes it easier to kill things if they cannot run). 
---
BUT really. If you wanna run with that. Go for it. It's your game. you can always adapt it.
---
No the suit has good DR.  Maaaaybe with the lowest level version
---
The photos ive taken are mostly dumb stuff that i built or has happened.
---
Yes I put that as one of the items. It shouldn't count towards budget. That was my grievance. In my eyes if it fits in the stash you should be able to display/refrigerate/ferment it.
---
No i dont have any
---
I play on pc also! You're welcome to send me a request. I play now and then but you're welcome to join my server anytime :)
---
There are some comments on here about this. Basically let the armor break. You keep the stealth effect but lose all the DR.
---
Even if you don’t use the perk all the time, it’s a great asset, you mentioned using a .44, pistols really shine in vats, the AP cost is much lower than that of the rifles.  I take the card ASAP on new characters and it is so helpful, a huge damage boost with little effort
---
For the fridge or fermenting staton, I agree. It should count toward stash but not camp budget. 
---
But not displays; those are rendered assets. The budget is there to help server stability so the balance is a limit on what can be displayed. 
---
If it’s displayed, it should take budget. If it’s not, then it shouldn’t.
---
I think it works good at the lowest lvl lowest lvl. Imo certain armor mixed pieces are the best.
---
I'll come to your server and give you them.
---
Ur mom puts a lock on the fridge to keep ur big chungus from sleep eating. U should know. If ur on console press F to lock. R u also locking it fridge so u stop sleep eating in game as well?
---
The odds must be very low, I've only gotten one in a year plus of occasionally playing it.
---
Do you have any serums for sale?
---
Smiley is not working again!!!!! This sucks
---
Do you have the explosive legendary?  Those deteriorate way quicker. My explosive vampire fixer has to be repaired every other major encounter.
---
See if we can use the fridge and fermenting station without workshop budget. I could deal with display cases using budget. I would gladly give up that one. But I'm always at max budget so I would at least want to ferment beer or be able to use a fridge I payed atoms for.
---
hmmmm, someone is soloing the queen tonight.
---
No, only plans, nothing else.
---
... West Virginia...
---
I'm going to guess that with Uranium Fever you could get notes just by being in the area, rather than actually doing it.
---
I occasionally sat on top of the cage next to the bot at the entrance and still got notes when it finished. Plus it might stop the one shot kills if there's no real need need for higher level players to attend. Makes the event more lower level player friendly.
---
Not working for me as well. It happened for three, I was able to buy last week on Monday and now again not able to buy. This sucks
---
That’s really weird. Maybe check again after a server hop. Could be a visual glitch.
---
I'm going to tell the Raiders.
---
Seen lots of Sophias wearing swimsuits, for some reason.
---
Also, allies (in general) wearing that craftable fasnacht mask everyone got for free a week or two ago.
---
I’m on board with that.
---
Still the same, just server hopped to sell. 719 plans and 64 misc
---
Well that didn't last long lol Hopped in a power armor and it clipped through like it might stay but soon as I exited the armor it was gone.
---
Oh well, at least I got a picture of it, it was fun while it lasted!
---
There is no fallout 1st atom shop, There is a fallout 1st section on the atom shop, but you only get a few bonus items,  its nothing amazing at the moment, just the ranger outfit and they just recently added a crappy paint job for the scout armour and the wood armour, you're paying for the atoms, the private server, the tent and the scrap box.
---
Whats your psn name?
---
I leave the entire thing completely unlocked most of the time. 
---
I put "free ammo" on the thing and just go about my day. That way everyone gets to use it.
---
Feels like double dipping doesnt it?
---
Yes most definitely, it's sad when you try to use the magazine racks to display all your magazines then realize you use 25-50% of the budget for paper on display.
---
No, this is definitely bad math or bad VATS, not just bad luck.
---
i hear ya. trying to put together a mini museum at my camp with mr. fuzzy's, teddy bears, and pristine/clean pre war items is a drag
---
Not explosive, no. I didn't know that about them. One is two shot and the other is armor piercing. My other armor piercing pipe revolver doesn't seem to have the same problem, but I don't use it that often.
---
Yup lost over 30 K on a longshoreman outfit and a brotherhood of steel palette and paint plan. Literally the most infuriating thing about the game and that’s not including the duping or the item disappearing or the money grubbing.
---
I don't believe so. Oh, like Gunsmith or whatever it's called? I haven't had that one slotted in for a long time, and this is a recent problem. Maybe I'll put it back in, though. Might help.
---
Get downvoted just cause ur on xbox. Imagine only being able to get 60fps
---
Notice I said *effective*. It may look like a big number but the actual difference in damage taken is only about 3 points less. Which, if you're bloodied is fine because that's an additional hit basically. For everyone else it's no different than t51 or strangler heart.
---
I worked for me after three weeks. Someone mentioned to check after 8pm est on Saturday. Finally worked! Try that if you have the time.
---
I wonder if it's counting 0 weight plans as misc? I've noticed some of the mounted plans and such weigh 0 instead of 0.25 like normal plans, curious if that's related.
---
That’s possible. I can try to take one out and see. Will edit post if it changes
---
Not sure on the specifics, but its just what I've seen mentioned, believe it was datamined or something. Anyway, there has been some testing done, so for example, in a full suit of ultracite you have 600 odd rad resist, but usually only take like 1-3 rads in a nuke zone, in a full suit of ss with a radshield and a glowing blood popped for around 700 rad resist, you still take around 12 rads per second. As far as damage goes, if you wanna test it, just jump in an empty power armour frame and see how much less damage you take vs not wearing anything at all.
---
They're referring to the recipes like Delbert's sunshine oil and Delbert's mud cookie.
---
Mine are generally landscape shots, often in radstorms or fog. Or goofy/weird shots.
---
Ditto! I got one of Super Mutants floating and only wearing a cloth.
---
Lock your door
---
I'll only do it for steel runs
---
And wipe your damn feet!!
---
Just because it's the apocalypse, doesn't mean manners should go out the window.
---
Deathclaw Swarm event?
---
When I began I would gather all the books I’d find (Summerville has a home w A TON) and would sell them at guaranteed 1 cap a pc. Same w flowers etc at white spring and as others have said sell to vendors and max daily amt (1400) BUT UNLESS YOU HAVE ALL THE PLANS DO NOT SELL WEAPONS. It is better to scrap and get the mod. Only very expensive items would I bother selling if I didn’t use. My main thing I do, which thankfully I didn’t listen to others who tried to “teach” me when they said bulking is useless. They couldn’t be more wrong. Not only does it free up a ton of space, especially if do not have 1st, but you can then sell the items u have collected the most of. And I mean collect everything not nailed down. Then scrap to make room and keep going. U will get the hang of what components are in what junk items as well and can better manage ur grabs. But I also sell those bulk items in my vending machine ie: metal, plastic, acid, lead, screws and adhesive priced fairly (much much less than they’d pay at vendor- around the price on the bottom ) and they are usually sold before I even leave my camp for my next adventure. Another good thing is ammo. Sell the extra. But NOT mini nukes or missiles. They are TOO heavy and are not used/bought frequently. Try and also focus on the challenges and sell stuff that will help folks clear those. There is a buyer for most things out there. (And honestly I have over 2300 hrs and a lot of those hours were spent helping lower level players I met while giving free plans or whatever. Instead of taking them and using them for enemy bait and saying here take one shot and then I’ll kill them “to get you more xp” (cuz A that isn’t much xp B it isn’t fun for new players at all C it more so helps the higher level player not be targeted as much) I, on the other hand, help them at their level. The main thing everyone wants is to earn xp and the best way to do that is to do the quests and events. Not just running around killing stuff. 
---
I don’t obsess about my XP increasing because I truly enjoy helping others and I love Fallout. And it isn’t going anywhere. So i’m in no hurry. (Since FO 2 ive been hooked) 
---
Just to let u know that if u ever have any other questions don’t hesitate to ask. Or can message me; Ems_Lionheart is my ID if on PS4. I will do my best to answer and if idk I will try to find the answer for you. Hope u enjoy. Happy wandering.
---
PS u will get the hang of legendary selling. Until u do you may want to turn them in so that you can increase your scrips so that you may purchase your own. Caps aren’t always what u need. And until u know what to price what it is just better to get the scrips. Do not let others dictate what prices you should set. I have met many who have steered newcomers the wrong way so they could take advantage. Sad folks have to be like that in a game.  Take care!!
---
Theres nothing to be explained
---
Other than why my purified water is no more
---
lol every time I come to my house my front and back doors are wide open, its not my ally doing it because I didnt even have an ally at my new camp for the longest time and it was happening. I assumed it was players coming to my store and then checking my house out or something, but it almost seems as if sometimes as soon as I load into a server the doors are open, so I dunno whats going on.
---
*laughs in no hackers*
---
No I'm gonna open all your doors. Do something about it
---
Ah, is that why I have people creep around my camps for like 10 to 20 minutes sometimes? Lol
---
Just remove the doors and add curtains.
---
That... would be pretty cool.  :)
---
🤣
---
I have 13 characters for this very reason and haven't spent any moolah... Is this a difference between PC and console?
---
Tagalong question when choosing sides. If I choose to side with raiders, will I never be able to obtain plans for the Gauss Shotgun? And vice versa for the Gauss Minigun?
---
Me: Laughing at console's 5 fps
---
Love my VE LMG.
---
you mean that thing that mini-nuke miniguns do?
---
cant relate
---
No dear. On teams while playing the game. This might be my 4th post ever on this site. (Don’t quote me on exactly 4 cuz my brain doesn’t retain memories like it should/used to)
---
Kill everyone’s tames to spread awareness. Might seem mean but not as many people are on reddit as you’d think
---
Never seen those so that’s a negatory lol
---
Hey at least I dont crash everytime I go to the queen then complain on reddit
---
Omfg! I've never laughed so hard!
---
Had something similar happen to me the other day. I was at 26-27K caps total, which is about as close to the limit as I like to get on adventure mode. Suddenly, I started getting vendor notifications--someone was cleaning me out of all my ammo.  Now, if I'd had no caps, I would have been thrilled. As it was--they bought somewhere between 20-24k of ammunition.  I quickly left the server, but sadly the 'damage' was done.
---
No silly. Didn’t have anything to do w midnight. They just picked a time. Like they did w the Nuclear Winter event, that ended at 7 pm. Who knows where why how they come up w the stop times. The standard has always been midnight EST for most things in the world. That’s all I was trying to say.
---
And anyway if it’s 10 am EST it’s midnight in Papua, New Guinea. I don’t think Bethesda is going on their time. Lol
---
Hopefully this will change sooner than later
---
like particle effects did for months on pc? lmao
---
i haven't crashed in months
---
Same here. I use it on one of my alts, but not on my main. I find it just makes my movement stutter and the hunger is annoying.
---
Too bad
---
Lol we have sfe or do you guys still crash to that
---
Such a fun idea. And I don't think the pip boy breaks character too much- there are plenty of dead vault dwellers lying around Appalachia, and that's a handy piece of tech that any self-respecting brotherhood scribe on a solo intel mission would certainly repurpose and make use of if they had the opportunity.
---
I used it to photograph my character in front of all the great signs in the game. He’s in the same outfit and giving the same cheesy double thumbs up at every location. They look like ads for the West Virginia Tourism Board.
---
I put both Beckett and Daguerre in king grognak outfit. (not to be confused with grognak costume).
---
You're looking up information on a place before you go there but get mad when you find out about what you're looking up...?  lol....
---
For example these items were way to cheap https://imgur.com/a/AHxkZLg
---
It's a *wiki*
---
Sometimes it's wrong though. Still counts some legacies as normal weapons.
---
I agree, come on Bethesda i know you guys can implement something to helps us out!
---
I only started a few weeks back on Pc (Lvl 90) feel free to add me (VaultNugget) &amp; I can get you setup with some stuff if you need anything!
---
Feel free to add me as a friend, too (SageRDU on PC).  :)
---
Heck yeah! I used to pop chems like crazy to get a buff for a deathclaw fight. I would like the legendary one from New Vegas or something similar. Honestly I would love a cool intelligent death claw also.
---
Doors!!!...I don't even have walls. Tents and canopies for me.
---
It would just be nice if they would help shoot at mobs if they happen to chase you into the settlement. I mean cmon they really just aren’t bothered that a freakin sheepsquatch is just flailing around in there?? Luckily for me it can’t fit in the square-ish spiral staircase behind sunnys.
---
Hmm, thanks for the tips. Ill for sure switch out some of my perks for some of the ones you suggested.
---
Yeah, I know it listed a D33 Harpoon as scrip but it is a decent tool for non-legacies.
---
Yeah I definitely agree! Just feels better, idk what I can pinpoint
---
I understand this however is there a time frame between finishing the event and losing the flux? Last night i finished the event and was over encumbered so had to walk back to camp, approximately 10 minutes later i died near watoga and lost my flux. If i carry that flux and die after an hour i lose it? or is it a set time after the event?
---
I have the Wanderer dressed up in the Harness, with Sturdy Metal R and L arms, Military Cap, Slave Collar, and Old Ring. It isn't revealing for the sake of being revealing (not that there's anything wrong with that), and the whole outfit just works well together.
---
Don't forget to make the smart choice and turn in your candy for worthless prizes. ;) But yeah, one of my go to events. It's even more fun if you can find someone who will play it with you the way it's supposed to be played.
---
I price my stuff to sell - usually 50% off from suggested.  Mostly because I like to make people feel like they got a good deal - everyone lives a bargain!
---
Really odd. Hopefully you figure out the cause.
---
Stash limit is so weird, the only reason I can think is its to slow down markets being flooded... also make Fallout 1st more tempting
---
I got home once and someone had shut all my shutters.  Who does that?  Creepy.....
---
yes, iirc they are a subsidiary but essentially operate separately to other studios under bethesda and don't work on games like TES / fallout
---
Or a quest to replace Julie with another DJ from any other faction (in my case the Raiders, similar to [Red Eyes Raider Radio ](https://youtu.be/HYyg1hRL4cU) from Fallout 4). Or to change up her dialogue similar to how we change Travis in FO4?? Somethin...
---
I know a lot of folks like Julie and she’s cool but she’s just a bit too sappy for me. given the choice I’d boot her out ASAP lol
---
Ditto, I run a weapon shop and all of my stuff selss for about 60% of the price checker tool.
---
Wow.  I think I should point out my attention span doesn't last 6 days on something so stupid.  Thanks for the reply!
---
Will do! I'm about to hop back on.
---
I will! Same user name as your reddit name?
---
I mostly use it for the “intended purpose”. My wife and I play together and we like to take pictures together around Appalachia.
---
Hey i had the same issue and if it's cool with you feel free to add me since I'm also looking for people to play with I'm reyanderson1 and I'm level 23
---
Love the user name. I'll add you in just a minute or so! Thanks!
---
Excavator power armor - lucky hole mine - 1200 Lead most of the time when I run this. Pick up all of the raiders weapons whilst in there getting the ore, there's a chem bench at the end of the mine you can scrap &amp; smelt at. Equip the perks Scrapper/Super duper/Ammosmith &amp; you can make thousands of rounds within an hours work.
---
I will try to. So far, everything checks out. Maybe it counts plans for mods for weapons? Ex: 
---
Plan: Pipe Rifle NVG Scope
---
Maybe that’s something? Or mods for armor too? Will have to do some tests
---
Oh good idea!
---
Like I would have thought that maybe you could “found” the Pitt if you sided with the raiders or something. Maybe the settlers found some other well known town.
---
You can't sadly.
---
Yeah the Ultracite Laser Rifle nerf had me doubting my sanity when I saw it. It just makes no sense at all given how awful it already was.
---
I think the one that hurts the most though is actually the minor buff to the alien blaster’s fusion mag. So many in the community have screamed for a rebalance of the gun, and yet one of the dev’s consciously took the time to adjust the conversion mag, but decided the gun was still somehow okay in its original form.
---
The alien blaster in this game is an insult to past iterations. I keep telling myself that maybe we’ll see an event around it and aliens... that it’s time just hasn’t come yet... but it still hurts to see such an iconic weapon be so damn broken and bad...
---
What is the quest for. I can remember a but I don’t remember where
---
Now all I got to do is find a BOS power armour paint because I'm a power armour build
---
So i’m just screwed and have the ability to craft it forever but can never actually have it?
---
this is for PC btw.. not console. just a FYI people.
---
Awww
---
Don’t get me started on how bugged the Wastelanders main quest line is. It’s very frustrating! The second raiders quest (the Ra-Ra one) kept bugging out over three attempts. I had to go into a private server to make it work. 
---
People shouldn’t need Fallout 1st just to be able to complete a main quest! Guys I’m sorry I keep giving them my money but it looks like I need it to just to finish the main quest line and pre-critters fix, needed it to complete my Tadpole badges.
---
I'm not sure about that honestly, you might lose all flux upon death or just the exact amount you got from the event.
---
Its suppose to be craftable after you earn and scrap (no idea if the 2nd part is neccessary) the helmet from the Fasnacht parade. Its currently bugged so hopefully patch 20 will fix it, as it's also not tradeable. Cause I got 2 of em and it's a waste of 20lbs
---
Also you can clip through the walls at fort defiance (the outside wooden part near the turret)
---
I haven't seen that, but it sounds so cute.
---
[I'll just leave this here.](https://i.imgur.com/XP0Z0NC.jpg)
---
Bethesda doesn't care. I've been using Baka's Glow Piles, Perk Loadout Manager and Better Inventory forever.
---
I feel like the tool was a little better when it separated trading forum prices from the vending machine prices, they seem to be different worlds of trading. I still find it to be a very useful tool, but it has limitations.
---
You can add me. American but living in Ireland so the time is a bit iffy. Normally I'd be online in the mornings here which would be really late at night your time. But if that works for you, my PSN is lyrical_theory
---
I can also craft you the treasure hunter outfits and marine armor helmet if you need them. Also around the same age so that's a plus.
---
yes i accidentally scrapped it (because it wasn’t a legendary and i was spamming you scrap all my armor [big mistake]) and i frickin scrolled it on accident
---
There is a fear bear in the basement of the asylum.
---
Technically you don't even have the ability to. A few other PA skins have had a similar thing happen where It shows a skin but it's unreleased or uncraftable. It's probably not even inended for us to see it in that menu. 
---
The Helmet itself dropped from Fasnacht with a 1% chance, and sadly it's also the only Fasnacht Reward that can't be traded or dropped.
---
They can, and will, die to the random camp attack spawns. I think he was alluding to the fact that people visiting your vendor often spawn them. I've lost several pets to such events.
---
I usually just price it at cheap, since, if I'm selling it, I'm not using it, and someone else might want it and I know I'd like to find my dream gun for cheap.
---
Are we going all the way to poop knife
---
You just have to believe hard enough! It is like Santa Clause, the ability to craft the helmet will not exist if you don't believe!
---
Had 25k caps and unexpectedly sold an item in my vendor for 25k, lost out on 20k over that. Awesome.
---
Those technical data missions are a pain to do, but I wish you luck. Honestly still need to get around to working toward those as well. Been playing since release but I have a habit of ignoring technical data when I find it because it's discouraging to hand them in one at a time only to get nothing worthwhile half the time. If they could be turned in by the stack I'd do them a lot more often.
---
I'd rather them create a new region to explore in all honesty. I think they should go westwards or southwards instead of the northeast like f03 andfo4.
---
I haven’t spent much time testing weapon durability, so I can’t confirm or deny, but if that’s the case then I certainly welcome the change! I’ll try to pay closer attention to mine next time I use it to see if it feels any different.
---
If I remember correctly Robert House said something to the effect of pipboys were fairly common place before the war.
---
Eh, the feeling isn't exactly the same, but I suppose 5mm yields more quantities of itself.
---
Saw a base with a Red Rocket theme near Whitespring. They had Gramps dressed as a cook with a chef's hat and surgical mask behind the counter.
---
BE is better for a rifleman build where FFR doesn't help to 1 shot enemies. For a commando build the FFR would be more helpful.
---
No. It's not. 
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1270356055772536833?s=19
---
It was never supposed to be craftable and is a text/UI bug. As per Bethesda. Patch 20 isn't going to do anything for it.
---
At least on playstation, you can just browse and copy them directly from the PS menu.  The limit is in-game only.
---
Avoid UV lights buy a lot of bleach.....nasty Nate and the boys may have visited your camp lol
---
Those are all awesome!  Especially considering the scale!  I love the liberator, I want the friendly on from wastelanders!
---
All I know is a ton of stuff needs buffs, because even if we nerfed the other stuff they'd all still need buffs lol
---
Agree with Kantusa's comment: LOTS of yellowcake at WS if you place the nuke right. Include the road east of the resort and maybe up to the train station in the blast zone. If I can get enough HRF, I'll usually be able to make 30-40 stable yellow without a problem.
---
I was a team effort, Hope did the painting and she made a fallout cake for the occasion too!
---
Good question.
---
You can unusual  find two in the desks in the military branch of the resort bunker
---
Make it a toggle for those that want to auto scrap things and leave the rest of us to stop having our shit broken when we don't want it to, lol.
---
Unarmed
---
Dude, that's like asking the Lamborghini salesman what kind of key ring do you get with your new car. What your paying for is free monthly atoms, an unlimited stash space #unfuckinglimited, and a magic fucking tent that you can plop down anywhere and create a free fast travel point, AND where you can store all that precious junk you can now horde. Whether it "should of been in the game for everyone!" or not, it ain't.  Come to the dark side...it's beautiful.
---
My Gt is Punk Wrecks I too have some difficult social anxiety I deal with feel free to shoot me a friend request I always appear offline though just an fyi 😊 and all I do is hunt for loot and work on my camp.
---
If you feel deceived about the whole deal, then lodge a ticket with Bethesda, but they might only refund you the atoms spent on the power armor, and not set you up with the bundle version.
---
But, realistically the whole deal could have been avoided if YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION, and even better, check online for exactly what you get, perhaps check reddit?
---
See this is the kind of content we need
---
There is a Bos paint for the combat helmet. You can unlock it crafting and scrapping helmets.
---
You can test thia out easily. Get a power armor frame without anything on it, and walk into a nuke zone. Then proceed to behold how you actually dont take any rads.
---
I live there, Twin Lakes, right on the bottleneck before it becomes a stream heading south.
---
I have been looking for this Behemoth for about two days, where tf he at?? 
---
Also yes this is a fantastic location.
---
I know of the exceptions that aren’t correct, namely the fat man, missile launcher, broadsider, and the gamma gun seem to display as double their true values on the tool tip. When I have the time, I’ll periodically test various guns out in game against enemies with very minimal DR to make sure the numbers are in the right ballparks. Beyond those few weapons mentioned above, I haven’t seen anything out of sorts yet. If there are any others you know of, let me know because I’d like to look into them for my own research. 
---
I do check other sources too, but have found some inconsistencies in the past, particularly with energy weapons. If the data mined numbers have been updated, I’ll gladly give them another look. I do believe in hand-testing at the end of the day. But I’m always willing to consider all possible data sources to make the best conclusions.
---
Forceful stocks will increase durability considerably.
---
seems like every tom dick and harry has one...
---
This is only the chemist mod though
---
So long as its not something super odd like it glows a bright like a safety vest to all enemies lol.
---
Xbox? If so I’ve got a couple knight paint plans available
---
I see the error in my ways. I legit thought it was like a sarcastic so funny it made me puke.
---
The price is a bit off, it's definitely a 100k+ outfit that's quite often traded for legacies. Seems like the value has dropped a little as of now but one could example get a couple explosive lasers for one :) 
---
Agree with the trading, though most of the scams involving couriers hasn't actually been real couriers and simply happened because the trader didn't verify enough. Couriers is a 99% sure way to do safe trading as long as you verify from top to bottom 👍
---
I've found headless enemies, enemies that are completely normal, but won't attack for some reason, floating trees, gaps in scenery, etc. I also have a few glitches that are fixed now. Of course, some bugs can't really be shown in pictures, like enemies regenerating health, or other weird lag problems.
---
Definitely Twin Lakes. Theres a lot of good farm land, and the lake itself provides water which can be turned for a nice profit at the Whitesprings station nearby (unless the Foundation vendor is better, idk).
---
And its a very short distance to Foundation.
---
Is the stash unlimited or just the scrap box? And I'm here for the cosmetics and CAMP building 🤷‍♀️ not really interested in free atoms if theres nothing good to spend them on.
---
Edit:and I meant the fo1st tab
---
I will open all your doors and shutters, and turn your radio on (or off, if I find it on). I will change your lamps and randomize your bulbs. I will eat all your crops and drink your water. You’ll find your extractor and your robot both emptied of their contents. I will leave your outhouse door swinging in the wind. I will leave your TV on. And I will do all these things because you let me. 
---
Lock up your shit.
---
Maybe not free, but selling it standalone in the Atom Shop would be a big step up from it being completely locked behind a monthly sub.
---
I'd say bloodied/junkies would be strongest damage. Instigating is only good for that first shot and then its regular dmg. Hell even executioners could be better. I'd say the 33vats hit chance would be best second perk since it increases your vats percentage for hits, and maybe either 25 less vats cost for the 3rd perk. Instigating would be great for everything you can 1 tap but not sp much the queen
---
A person after my own heart. They also like to do weird stuff with decapitated heads. ;)
---
Ah damn, never saw that. Heard during the beggining of Fasnacht it was supposed to be craftable and tradeable. Guess that was all just speculation, damn.
---
But honestly, BGS said at one time they couldn't roll back characters, return items, etc. So its not a far stretch to say the helmet is suppose to be craftable and tradeable, but they just royally fucked up
---
Keeping all of your junk on you is a bad idea.
---
I had Beckett in the Garb of Mysteries and Toothy Man mask. It was the stuff of nightmares. I changed the mask to the enclave hat lol
---
I dont have one yet but heard it's super powerful. If I could get that B 33 25 rolls I'd be so happy and I'll let ya know
---
I could not agree more. I find myself disappointed by how "things" have been managed since the release of fo76.  
---
This max. caps. issue, the max. legendary scrip. issue, the consistent lag in crafting (especially slow: ammo, cooking, chem.) Legendary enemies disappearing leaving you with no reward for the work or cost. Respawning and Fast Traveling issues on the reg. Challenge Log not registering completed tasks. Perhaps some of these issues are related to wifi connection, but they also occur regularly on a private server...
---
We are well into year two and there has been little addition to the game aside from Wastelanders (they also took away the 3 month membership when it released - and blatantly prioritized new players over us vets.) I mean Fasnacht was the same, aside from the secret service drops, and they failed to launch in time. The treasure hunt was fun, but there were few rewards.
---
No new dungeons, very skewed Enclave and Brotherhood lines. Perhaps the skewed storylines are taking a while in order to stay true to the timeline of rebuilding Appalachia.
---
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Or perhaps we have to wait another two years for some big buck investor to say, 
---
"yea release that new pack thingy, accounting just said we've made all we can for now. And no, you cant spend any money on hiring additional developers, those programmers at Square Enix will eat our profit margin. Oh be sure to take that board with scribbles out of here, whats that called again?"
---
"That is the story board sir."
---
"Whatever, just get it out of here."
---
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
On a lighter note, I have endured these issues time and time again because I do enjoy the interactive world in which they have made and, honestly, the bottom line is - its Fallout with friends. Lastly, I believe fo76 developers are capable of producing more in depth content at a faster rate, I just think they are being held back by corporate intent to max. profit margins.
---
I wasn't into it at first but the music definitely helped ease me into the world of Appalachia and I now really appreciate the sound track, however for such a massive game I wish we could get a bigger tracklist...
---
I do totally get where you're coming from though.
---
I mean at least its not the original division, some legendary/epic gear didn't use its ability in dark zones pvp. Youd have a rifle whos bullets eventually explode in what they got embedded to, which made up for its slower fire rate. Meanwhile most others worked. So the one that used more skill to place shots almost always lost to the guy with a bullet hose. Get their health down to a few shots and their armors abilities coupled with the healing items and instant recovery. Dunno if ever got changed either.
---
3rd floor of Ft Defiance (Allegheny Asylum), west of Watoga. Check the bedrooms in the hallway with the elevator, and also in the shower room. I can't find the link to the numbers but I believe the chance for red tide spawn was less than one-half of one percent.
---
Because oppression olympics don’t exist in Appalachia.
---
Walls? Where we're going we don't need walls.
---
Its the whole create a problem then sell the solution philosophy of game design. I don't think its the worst offender I've seen but its certainly shitty.
---
my question is.. where do those caps go? is there a bethesda version of rich uncle pennybags with a monocles collecting all of those vaporized caps?
---
Yes but i have nowhere to put it!
---
\+1 to all that got the joke
---
\-1 to all that did not.
---
Doesn't also work on mirelurks? But yeah maybe group hunter in with it?   Call it pest control.
---
agreed
---
As a Bakersfieldian, I'd KILL to see some Bakersfield sound in here, especially alongside Spank's covers which are definitely derivative of Bako/outlaw sound.
---
Maybe even a more Nashville sound focused station for the refined cowfolk out there. 
---
Also shout out for still keeping the Sound alive ❤
---
What does that have to do with hairstyles? You're just trying to be racist for no reason.
---
Fellow Bakersfieldian here, also surprised lmao 
---
Our sound deserves to be in this game. 
---
Bako Sound revolutionized country dag´nabit
---
I'm starting to feel like this might get down voted for no good reason
---
We need a home decorating compliment emote.
---
Hit me up, I play pc. Skoll#8446 on discord, sk0l1 on fallout 76. I have 1st and am down to play, questing, pve, whatever.
---
That would be the nail on the coffin for power armor.
---
I was pricing out some armor using this today and was surprised at the results. They were pricing assassins cavalier with random 3rd effect at over 25,000 caps. Why do they rank it so high? Is it a good armor for PVP?
---
I’m not understanding the value/appeal.
---
It would be WAY too OP to be able to customize a full set of armor AND have full rad resist.  What would the point of nuke zones be?  Chinese Stealth Armor is basically an armored hazmat suit, closest you're gonna get and even that's almost OP.
---
WTF.  I didn't realize verdant season had any benefit at all!
---
True, but it’s already got next to nothing going for it- so why not just nail it already?
---
A quest to kill that happy Bitch and put rose in charge with some abrasive garage rock from the 60s
---
Remember to switch to Scrapper perk when scrapping weapons. You will get tons of steel, so much that you don't even know what to do with all that steel.
---
Broken stealth suit, yes. No, radiation resistance does not negate berserker. 
---
https://youtu.be/thD8fuBsNOM
---
You’re right, my only solution for that would to be to make the rarity of all hazmat suits much greater and try and find some nerfs, like maybe an oxygen tank system like fusion cores. Maybe I’m crazy.
---
Go to the sub itself (not viewing all your subs) the click the 3 dots in upper right and select user flair.
---
May be a bit different not on mobile.
---
I mean, this is specifically fallout in its earliest chronology though: aka American 50s. They even removed asian presets from the engine for crying out loud. Strange from gameplay perspective? Yes. Inconsistent with lore in term of time and place? Not entirely.
---
Yeah but its one of those cards that i keep three stars no matter what
---
Haha, I don't use it myself, but I'm betting the ones that do would beg to differ.
---
Unfortunately like the site states this is only reflecting of the PC market and to my biggest disappointment it doesn't list price for plans. For example I actually received the plans for the Light Raider Torso Plan (Which can only be obtained from Signal Strength MSQ for a staggering 5.88% drop chance) that I want to sell but I'm not sure how high I should price it.
---
My serums aren’t showing up under aid either. Is that unusual?
---
Anyone else having issues not getting any loot at all? I'll put a few hundred rounds of various gun types onto her and no XP and no loot.
---
Thanks!  I’ll look into that right now. 👍
---
Hey I play on PC, if your ever looking for a teammate Im probably available. I may kniw some tips or you may know some.
---
I find that the community on this game if very nice and holesome. There are a few rotten apples but oh well.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Honestly I agree but I am a fo 1st member I don't think it should be locked behind a paywall but let's all be honest here if anyone wants this game to continue there sales from the atomic shop aren't going to keep this game afloat support wise so I see it as a necessary evil at this point.
---
You’re probably right, maybe Bethesda will find a way to balance the two out, making everybody happy.
---
Well u got me beat. I’m headed in one direction w complete propose, all of a sudden 20 min later im on other side of map, no where near where I intended. I forgot about this thread til I went to read another and saw I had like over 50 replies. Felt lil guilty so fig id better respond to some.
---
Ah I see. Dang that sucks.
---
I get what you're saying with the hazmats, would be nice if it worked like an actual hazmat suit that you could wear whatever you wanted in.  I could see them allowing underarmor in a hazmat or even better legendary hazmat suits.  
---
The stealth armor makes hazmats suits completely obsolete, I hope they do something to encourage them.  Still looking for my Emmett Mt. suit.
---
All thier stuff has a 50s aesthetic then random survivalist things. I don't think its malicious, probably just hasn't crossed their mind. Either that or it'll be in the bloody atom shop in a couple if weeks.
---
I really like the idea of a legendary hazmat suit, and at that point you could even throw on skins for them and make an entire survival facet out of them. As for the Emmet Mountain Suit, the best advice I can give is patience.
---
If you're past level 50 and this game is remotely difficult your build is done in a way the devs didn't decide the game should be played
---
Dang
---
Just remember the cult of the mothman welcomes all!
---
Might just be you unfortunately. I just logged out about 5 minutes ago.
---
You could create a mule for the weapons and armor you want to keep but don’t use, that may free up some space for you
---
I have a bloodied limb damage with dr while aiming I like it but from what I have noticed any of the 5 Gauss shotguns I have will chunk her I have killed her in under a minute flat though that time was due to my vats glitching out and my ability to just spam away. I personally favor my executioners vat crit vat cost or my furious vat crit vat cost neither have been primed except the bloodied started running low on my Ultracite rounds but have a plentiful amount of reg ammo.
---
It really sucks
---
Imagine creating an alt Reddit account because your posts are so stupid you don't want them associated with your main.
---
we need Bethesda to know about this because its BS
---
Every week this post
---
It does drop, but it's a low chance (20-25%).  Your best best is to harvest all the bug parts from Camp Fire Tales and keep doing Stings and Things (quest resets if you change servers, allowing you to keep doing handins for a chance at a bonus possum badge).
---
Limb damage is not the same as health damage and they have different counters. When you shoot limb, it does damage to both. Damage to head does headshot health damage AND limb damage (head is a limb too). When the limb meter goes off from the head, enemy is stunned and loses accuracy. It does not make you kill things faster.
---
I do understand your anxiety. I run a low pop, friendly Rust server for that very reason. But in my 150 hrs I've never been attacked in FO76. I did have someone nuke my CAMP but all you had to do was (server hop/log out/change CAMP location quick) use scrap to bring it back to exactly the way it was. In general though I find the game lonely tbh. At first I thought it was going to be too lonely because sometimes there's only a couple people on the entire server. But now I like the "lonely" of only a few on. If you still want pals hit me up. Same name.
---
Indeed!
---
Especially w some of the finds in this game
---
whats a mule?
---
Congrats! If you lack confidence for Whitesprings, a power armor might give you the needed edge to survive the multiple assaults.
---
Know what? The membership they designed gimps players who don't pay vs pay? They know it's not gonna change. Also save yourself the headache save 14 bucks drop all your junk in it and cancel your membership all of your junk will be safe and accessible just won't be able to put any more in.

I'm in the south EST - you can add me. I'm on sporadically depending on when I get time to play. I am often on late at night when my kiddos are in bed. my user name is ezabet. I rarely ever use in game voice but I do use discord (and have a group I play with when I can hop on for group activities)
---
I love building and have a stash full of plans on one of my toons for building that are free as.
---
We have infinite fucking scrap let us save food jfc
---
So I can pretty safely scrap this item then, it’s basically useless.
---
I like the bank idea, but what about if you could go to a 'bank' and trade caps for a 'deposit' slip (think gold note style) worth however many caps you 'deposit', which takes that same amount (of course minus Bethesda's cap sink fee...) from your caps stash, and when you're running low on caps, you can 'cash in' your deposit slip back with bank for said amount?
---
are they ever gonna increase the stash limit tho
---
Thanks, I traded for everything else that came with Wastelanders only missing the suit and SBQ mount plan.  With my RNG luck all the legendary hazmats I'd get would have +25 rad resistance.  They would need to be a totally new legendary system or the stealth would still outclass them by a lot, but fun idea either way.
---
No most likely not it used to be a loooooot less btw
---
No worries, this is as good a place as any I guess lol
---
Meh, that's how I know that people actually explored (and hopefully enjoyed) the space I built for them to enjoy.
---
it always gets weird fast and sadly more often than not. I rarely will use voice for that reason. as soon as they hear a girl voice 😬
---
Are you on PS4? 
---
If so then add me IProject_IPat 
---
My favorite spot is right outside the entrance to the foundation can’t,  miss it!
---
My gamer tag is the same as my username here. Anyone one xbox add me up
---
There is a freaky little bug that does this. I just about shit my pants when all of doors at the asylum slammed open at the same time.
---
I love you!!!
---
Get all rifleman perks + bloody mess + tank killer, and change your rifle magazine to perforating. 
---
Get the quest to obtain the excavator power armor. Go to lucky hole mine with the power armor to mine lead. Equip super duper and ammosmith perk when crafting ammo. As a rifleman you will then hardly run out of them.
---
Get woodchucker perk and go to Sylvie &amp; sons logging camp for wood. Go to the multi story building near the abandoned bogtown workshop, 2nd floor for cement, climb up to the roof and drop down from the lift to the 3rd floor for screws and gears (typewriter and globes). Take the lift to the top of the monorail elevator for more cement.
---
Uranium fever drops a lot of items that can be scrapped for steel, grab everything in the mine and every drop from mole miners. Mole miners, scorched, and mothman cultist drop ballistic weapons, which you can get a lot of steel by scrapping. Equip scrapper perk when scrapping weapons and armors.
---
You can create new characters, each with their own stash collection. A mule is a character you don’t necessary play but use their storage stash space,
---
True true, as for the SBQ, I think that’s a guaranteed drop from the queen every time the event is completed. I’ve found like six or seven just lying on the battlefield after the fight- and I got one myself the first time I did it. Could be wrong though.
---
Or If they could make INSIDE DOORS! I’m so mad that I can’t have a doorway with wallpaper on both sides. Sorry for my outburst just venting...
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
Because it wouldnt really fit the culture of what America is in the Fallout universe. Also, it's not like there's alot of customization in hairstyles or facial hair in general
---
The fact there's a Fallout without a dog companion is kind of mind boggling.
---
how does that work? but can i transfer stuff to my main or...
---
Use food build perks - Traveling Pharmacy, Thru Hiker are staples on my characters.  Bandolier and Batteries Included for ammo carried as well - I don't keep explosives, drop all those heavy ordnance stuff and sell grenades away to vendors.
---
Bottom line - you can carry way more ammo and aid on your characters this way, don't bother tying up the stash with these items.  The best bang for the buck weight reduction armor to me is weapon weight.
---
What are u talking about. The dupe was fixed. But  players who duped still have hundreds of thousands of presents. They open a few hundred to max their caps and bin the plans and booze.
---
Yeah! I mean we have the damn Buck Owens Crystal Palace for God’s sake.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/caxmpq/guide_how_to_transfer_stuff_to_another/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf take a look at this thread
---
I also collect teddy bears! I have 7 different ones displayed so I dont loose em to scrapping
---
Maybe I already know it?  I haven't had it drop in about a dozen queen fights the last few days.  I'll have to double check.  I know I have the regular SB, those came from the saved up holiday gifts.  Thanks again.
---
Facts lol
---
I use a sorting mod with icon prefixes on PC and I've noticed about half of the mounted creature plans have a different icon from the standard plans. I'd say there's a high likelihood that those are the examples being listed as misc items.
---
How did you place stuff on each of the shelves on the right? I can only place items on the top shelf.
---
Just get a bunch of key cards in advance lol
---
I see so many in this thread - awesome and surprising !!
---
No worries, best of luck on getting it!
---
Doorway with wallpaper on both sides? If you are talking about the doorway itself, you can do that.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClJYKJRBVDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClJYKJRBVDE)
---
Insta is the best prefix on a lever
---
Yes, that’s a good PvP piece. 
---
And the Cavalier was the third effect. Depending on the 2nd tier effect, it could be even more valuable.
---
That sucks. I didn't even bother tallying up the loss, I don't even want to know but it was high. The only upside was the stash space that was freed up
---
That could work as well. I was thinking more on the lines of less effort on Bethesda’s part. The Deposit slip idea would provide more of a “physical” value to the player and seems more appealing, but as far as coding and implementation, the bank account with auto deposit seems like it would be a more attainable goal for the near future.
---
I don’t think the server could handle either the mannequins or PA displays, however in the past there was a hacker who’s camp has both.
---
It's easy to assume that, but in reality the stash limit is justified. When this game initially released all the stash limit glitches made the servers run like absolute dog turd. The problem is Bethesda taking one of the best and most popular gaming ip's in history and not giving it the love and attention it deserves. The fact they put a tinkers bench at the purveyor and not a weapons AND armor bench just shows they don't play this game very much. It's a shame, because this game could be such a cash cow for them if it were handled properly.
---
You can just bash low level bots. They sell bayonets at whitesprings you can attach and use. The bots at vault tec ag near flatwoods are easy pickings. Lol
---
Shotguns are in a bad place atm outside of the gauss, which id say the consensus is will be nerfed.  Go heavy.
---
Oh yeah.  Mole Miners are great for this.  If the event isn't going on, just fast travel to Welch, kill the whole town while taking all the loot, then hike back to the train station to scrap/store junk.
---
Removing cap limit would be enough. Or making it like 1m lol. But the market would be chaos for a couple days
---
words of wisdom
---
One shouldn't have to resort to using a bug at twice the budget cost for an obvious feature.
---
Okay yeah, that is valid. I misunderstood
---
Ok, I might be on tonight.
---
Just scrap box is virtually unlimited.  Stash limit is same 800 like every one else.
---
I think an ever growing bank account would actually be harder to code than single issue value tokens. But I'm not much of a coder sooooo
---
I’ve had so many great encounters with other players on this game. People giving me hundreds of rounds of ammo when I was low level, players giving me multiple legendary weapons during Fasnacht, and someone randomly showing up during my first nuke launch. I had never had a bad experience....... until today. I had never played on a team with anyone before(I’m level 90) so when someone asked me to be on their team for a nuke run I said what the hell, might as well try it. This group went to my house that I had put so much time into and literally destroyed everything with their deathclaw gauntlets, why are teammates aloud to destroy your house? I had to leave the server so they would stop. I want to drop their GT but that might upset some people. Sorry for the rant but this just happened. But seriously he other 99.99% of players I’ve encountered are amazing
---
Even with 1st you still run into the stash limit problems. It's the exact same as when they raised the stash limit last time... It's solves your problems for about 2 days than you're at square one again.  Once you're at a certain point you don't even need to a lot of junk... Just a small bit of the items you need for repairs and a bit to sell off. Even than you'll rarely be using your junk for repairs once you start attending Scorched Earth and Encrypted regularly. The only time you'll be hurting for junk is when you're crafting the WL gear, but even than an hour of farming will net you more than enough to roll several piece's.
---
Thanks and I will
---
:D
---
thanks mate
---
I take pictures of my character with immortal enemies
---
Good luck and happy trails
---
I hope so. I was surprised on how much I ended up enjoying the selling, buying and exploring all the different camps aspect of this game
---
At least the raiders have two whole daily quests. They really need to add more ways to get settler rep.
---
yeah i understand that
---
Mine were fine
---
Same. I got an assassins sentinel and it was 30k to need to trade for whatever.  Didn't realize PVP still mattered but I dont think I care to try to get half of that. Put it in vendor for like 8k. See what happens i guess.
---
I feel this ... I think PA is really cool especially for the BoS but I really don’t like wearing it the clunky robot man feeling is the exact opposite of how I’ve always played FO....I am asking for something even more basic like when I throw Chinese or Hazmat suit on and off can it just requip my armor set I hate this so much I just never go in a nuke zone
---
Hmm depends on play style more.
---
Heavy guns slow you down while you shoot and rely alot on bloodied and junkies for damage.
---
While shotguns are more user friendly and can get by vats headshoting most enemies.
---
You don't need bloodied or junkies to be good since things like furious get maximum trigger from one shot.
---
Shotguns suffer the most at range while heavy weapons make you very slow when you are firing and have massive gear requirements.
---
Me and my Brother assaulted West Tek yesterday because Gramps had sent us after a weapon case there. At one point we both picked up a missile launcher each from the dead mutants and fired them at the remaining mutants for fun... One missile to the chest of a Supermutant did about 25% of his health. Then at one point we both fired at a mutant with our own launchers and both missiles hit him center mass and somehow only did a sliver of his health in damage.
---
Explosive weapons in this game is in such a sorry state... they need a serious buff or they need to stop giving us this heavy ass ammo for these POS explosive guns as quest rewards.
---
(Not just explosive weapons, explosive legendary guns too, I remember one of my favorite weapons from Fallout 4 was an Explosive Double Barrel Shotgun, gib and body parts fly everywhere when I used it, one shot to a raider’s chest would turn him to paste. In 76 an Explosive Double Barrel Shotgun takes like 3 or 4 chest shots on most stuff to kill it... this is just sad.)
---
That's a very end game view, most weapons are fine just not end game.
---
Why is the red one so desirable?
---
Congrats!  I love days like yours, I had one yesterday where I was killing everything and even managed to get a bloodied rifle and a real nice handmade.  Today, not so much I actually got a 1* switchblade from the SQB event and a couple of 1* lead pipes from some others.    Some days you win, others you might as well not have even logged on.
---
Vertibots actually do damage if they explode. You probably use anti-explosion mods/perks, but otherwise they'd damage you. I remember a vertibot crashing into the fasnacht bots mob destroying 'em all entirely and also I was in a situation where they destroyed a part of my camp the way op described.
---
I totally agree on the "neutral until attacked part" though.
---
I would kill to have a Flatwoods Monster at mine.
---
There's a player who's on most nights, (apparently in the same region as me, as I often end up on the same server as them), and they hit up all 3 silos every night. After the queen goes down, it only takes him about 10 minutes in the next silo before the warning sirens go off again and another nuke comes down.
---
No idea how he does it. Some people are just really prepared I guess.
---
I agree with the power armor, it’s never really felt right with me- hopefully they start adding some more player assistance like either preset armor combos or hazmat buffs.
---
Oh no no lol. I am always a stealthy sniper. FO3 FO4 Skyrim. Im always a sneaky girl. I have 2 sets of power armor. The excavator for Lucky Hole Mine and Ultracite. I just don't like the bulkiness. What's extremely helpful is the Chinese Stealth Armor. 
---
It's very stressful to be worried about being ambushed. I like to just relax and enjoy playing without worrying about dying lol. 
---
I love fo and ES games. I played FO4 and Skyrim several times vanilla but I have many many playthroughs with the mods. 
---
I like seeing the enemies first and trying to come up with a strategy on how to kill it. Usually involves finding a high point and luring. 
---
Anyway I admire and hope to get to the point I can rush into the club house lol
---
It's a neat little 10lbs paper weight. I have one on an extra chassis just in case but yeah it'll probably just chill there forever.
---
Dont you need to wait for the first nuke to face before starting scorched earth again?
---
I keep 300stimpacks on me and my friend keeps 800+ stim packs but we still manage to keep about 100 free space in inventory and about 200+ free in stash box.
---
Beating the robots to death with the black powder guns count towards the challenge?? That is actually amazing... I think I have a bloodied dragon with a bayonet that would be perfect for this bwa ha ha, Thanks for the info.
---
Yea, I completely agree with you. Also it does not work on half walls or slanted half walls.
---
I just thought I would mention it in case you were not aware of that trick.
---
You need to kill the queen each time yes.
---
If you launch nukes in quick succession then no...you dont get 3 queens at once...this sub would be filled with those vids
---
Ya, any of those challenges work that way. 👍👍
---
I see you've probably made more than enough friends by now, but if you or anyone else struggling to find someone to hang with would like to play together my ign is becko12. I don't use mic because of my anxiety but will happily run around with you doing whatever. I use the text chat mod on nexus as well. Fantastic place to make friends since there's a decent sized community which uses it.
---
It's not surprising that my price is off, I was only able to find a few results for proce checks from 2019. But I also didn't search too hard. 
---
I'm sure there are plenty of good couriers that make sure trades complete successfully. It's just that I'm not willing to run a "background" check to have a 99% chance of not getting scammed lol. Hopefully one day Bethesda will improve trading by adding a confirmation setting that ensure both items are being offered correctly and pressing accept will complete the trade.
---
Huh I thought scorched earth wouldn't be available again until the entire nuke faded looks like I was wrong
---
Hey, as a new player, I can say that this game has one of the best communities, whatever platform, I am personally on Xbox (one of the most toxic platforms, mind you), and I have NEVER run into a toxic player, sure there’s the occasional person who sells overpriced goods, but that’s the extent of toxicity. It’ll be great, all those caps can now be spent on weapons and other stuff. It’s a blast
---
The hunting rifle is a pretty underpowered weapon tbh not as broken as others but its just not worth it to use.
---
Honestly, utilizing every maxed out perk:
---
Super Duper
---
Ammosmith
---
Party Girl
---
Happy-Go-Lucky
---
Professional Drinker (in the chance of addiction) is ofc optional but I'd still recommend it.
---
Also for adding into Luck, eat food with a Luck stat that is at least 2 or 3 points.  Tbh I'm not sure if eating foods with Agility also help but maybe consume that as well
---
The settlers really get on my nerves with all their whining.   The character I am playing RPs as a good guy so sided with them.  My others, not so much.
---
I really hope BGS makes some changes to Foundation NPCs soon.  They suck.  I do like Jen tho.  
---
Oh, and Samuel is sneaky.  Don’t trust him.
---
Haha, i know the feeling. Around level
---
135 and Brotherhood quests are not even finished yet. I like to just travel really slowly and take it all in. I also prefer sniper or a quick and powerful revolver for closer combats. 
---
Good luck on your travels!
---
Santa Caps is real?!?!
---
Can you reconfirm point 1? My “camp box” is inside my house and people do not spawn there. I don’t want them to either so that’s fine. At the moment people seem to spawn outside considerably far from that box.
---
In short form yes it's strong no the Tesla probably would not yield you an explosive flamer and imo not it's not worth wasting time and or effort over.
---
There's a cooldown, but it's per silo, not per queen.
---
As soon as the queen is killed, you can have a player already in a (different) silo and fire off another nuke to immediately respawn her again.
---
I've taken screenshots of the bog with 3 queen corpses piled up. It's pretty hilarious.
---
believe it or not...people of color is as racist as colored people...white is a color and a skin tone and a peoples...by your defintion
---
also defining people by their hue swatches is pretty basic
---
Also the game has helmets, hats, power armor
---
in reality...lets role play here
---
in fallout reality...you going to cram an afro into a PA set?
---
edit: just remembered i have purple long hair...its not "ethnic" but i put on the treasure hunter hat an im bald...so it doesnt matter what hair you have...its a goddamn game...
---
Pets now display the owner's icon, which is helpful.
---
Check the small museum at the spawn point for Harpers Ferry. There's a rifle, a pistil, and .50 balls spawn in the display cases. 
---
If it's not max level, don't pick them up, just hop and check again
---
Yea Beckett won’t give me anything either. Switched back to wanderer and she gives one a day.
---
Very. :)
---
Practically all the kids toys have lead in them and scrap unused weapons for steel.
---
tbh you can launch 3nukes at the same time...but you only get one queen.
---
Most people launch, kill queen...repeat until 3 are dropped...noone else on the server can drop more
---
And what words would you have, were your God to be slain in front of your eyes? Imagine what it would feel like to have the being you worship and devote your life to suddenly be destroyed by a mere mortal. With little more than the pull of a trigger and the sound of thunder.
---
Ikr, those two new skins were such a huge letdown. I'm hoping something decent comes tomorrow.
---
It's completely hit or miss with all of them.
---
Love this.  👍
---
I'll be the first to admit that I know virtually nothing about server limitations, but what makes the PA &amp; clothes different from any other item you can display? You can already display most clothing items in normal display cases and even customize your allies with them. Would a static mannequin really be much different?
---
Dude I swear when I saw the skins, my $100 came back and smacked me in the face “you idiot, you wasted me” XD
---
There’s someone out there making a killing on Troubleshooters Bash Damage weapons bwa ha ha 
---
“They called me a madman... who’s laughing now?!”
---
(This’ll work great for the energy weapons one for me because the ammo is costly to make.)
---
They should keep everything they add, and just have limited time items that don’t come back
---
It would require a lot of budget, as the server has to load it in just like any camp item, but this would obviously be bigger
---
The Free States questline is still bugged and doesn’t drop correct Loot (protective and shielded casual linings that they sell variant s of in the atx) That’s the Vanilla main quest please just fix the Vanilla game PLEASE
---
It WOULD be funny if a bunch of girls ran around as cliques in fancy outfits with Valley Girl accents, though... xD
---
haha. I only do that voice jokingly.
---
Wait.. the blue cases are your stash, not a communal ammo box. You're taking and putting your own items in and out of there.
---
1st is a premium service and keeps the game running. It allows for things like Wastelanders and other new content. Therefore, there is going to be perks associated with that service that are locked. 
---
It's 1st and atom credit purchases serving as the lifeblood, and if you want more stash or room for scrap get a membership. I don't see a world where it becomes available for base game ever, as without that income stream and all the hate-press there won't be a F76 as the pissy $5 to buy this game won't cover the shitter paper being used by the devs let alone the man hours to try redeem the whole thing.
---
Dude yeah lol. That’s the only reason I ever get on anymore is to check it my limit is back
---
Formula p is a reward from the event Project Paradise.   Personally I would replace Formula P with daddy-o, for more ease of acquisition, unless you have a specific reason I cannot think of.  
---
I am a junkies heavy PA tank with the addictions alcohol, mental, daddy-o, daytripper, and med x.  So to answer your question, the best additions are the ones that dont hit your build too hard.  As you aew a stealth commando, I would stay away from perception dullers and agility dullers.  But that's just me.  The other option is to get addicted to something readily available as you can take the chem to alleviate the addictions while still having it (therefore it still counts)
---
Gues their waiting for the new update
---
1: Sweet mutfruit tea give you 20% critical damage, alot of starfire berries can be found around slocum joe's.
---
2: If you need nukacola the red rocket mega shop workshop has many nukacola machines.
---
3: For bloodied players herbivore mutation let's you eat spoiled food without getting diseases to keep your radiation bar high.
---
4: Sulfur fountain in white springs can cure diseases.
---
5: Another acid farm is thunder Mountain workshop since there are many coolant cans and a common attacking enemy is crickets.
---
No ps4
---
But thanks anyways
---
I want the diner stuff they have at the Red Rocket Mega Stop!
---
Unlimited caps would inevitably be duped or exploited. I dont know how. But I dont know how to dupe items and people do that.
---
Yeah I’ll take a wasteland deathclaw steak burger and a large diet Nuka cola!
---
BLOCKER!!!!!!!!
---
I'm level 875 and in my opinion Blocker is the one of the only staple perks every build needs. Unyielding stats + blocker + dodgy and you are a mega tank against everything. Then serendipity is there to act as backup.
---
If it doesn't matter why are you reacting so negatively against my question? We're able to cramp mohawks in power helmets so why are dreadlocks a stretch? Is it too immersion breaking to imagine a Jamaican in the wasteland?
---
I've had multiple very wonderful experiences with the fallout community, and encounters that you would only see on 76. A week or so after I found a group of people that invited me to their team and welcomed me to their group. After a while we all started playing different games together. I still play with them to this day. And a few of them actually live fairly close to me and im considering whether on not to meet them
---
In conclusion the fallout community it pretty great
---
how is it negative to point out reality and facts? also a POC can have a mohawk...but again like someone else said...the oppression olympics dont exist here.
---
if hairstyles in one video game out of thousands upsets you that much
---
dont play
---
also i noticed you didnt address the first part of my statement
---
are you uncomfortable with acknowledging white people as POC....or are you a segregationist
---
&gt;blue suitcases
---
Like the one directly in front of the vendor bot at Watoga
---
Haha I bet you hate fighting ghouls then, I'll mod some weapons to make them long range for you, I'll keep an eye out for you when you're online
---
Mole rats I can dead with. Liberators and regular scorched dudes drive me bat shit crazy. Fuckers stand miles away and constantly land hits with a combat shotgun while hiding behind a tree.
---
Why the lack of all hairstyles. Like in real life I've been rockin the same hair since I was born.
---
Actually I didn’t even notice, but it’s fitting so it’ll stay lol
---
What American culture? There's robot slaves before the nukes dropped but dreadlocks are too unrealistic?
---
Those latest skins are hot diarrhea.
---
They should just convert the safe from a stash box to a caps only stash.
---
In my experience they spawn roughly to the side of where you place the CAMP the first time, but moving it afterwards doesn't change anything.
---
They're talking about the suitcases, most people dump stuff in them but it's worth checking other containers since I've found people use lockers too.
---
If you go to Camden Park you will find every kind of Mr Fuzzy in the game I think. 
---
Also if you fast travel to Fort Prickett and head across the road north westish youll see a ruined shack. Most of the bears will be in a loft compartment in whats left of the roof. You will need something explosive to get them out though. Fire a grenade or an explosive arrow in there and itll rain bears. The Quantums are all there. Teddy Fear turns up in "creepy" places. Id have to double check but I have a feeling I saw one in one of the sheds across from mama Dolces that has all the traps etc in it
---
Amen I even wrote Bethesda over this. I loved that thing. Now it's so irreversibly fucked. Try hang a frame or ANYTHING and it'll sink into the wall. (PS4)
---
Tbh I sell any ammo for 1 cap 
---
I'm not gonna use it , can't sell it to vendor, or break down like new Vegas, and it take up room in my stash.
---
Don't sell mini nukes or missiles case no one buys them and take up so much weight tht it's not worth vending
---
That's awesome. Which plans did you end up with ml
---
With no mindless rambling DJ.
---
that'll be 30 caps lol
---
They are fun and not too bad damage wise. I'd recommend going for something other than tse as they aren't accurate. The quad tesla would likely not be enough.
---
I thought it was false as well until I randomly got one while playing with my gf, should really do that more often tbh, easy to do alone
---
If you are asking if legacy energy weapons deal more than the normal 20% extra dmg from explosive, then yeah. The damage boost is closer to 90% especially with the beam splitter
---
Ya the Fatman one works the same!!
---
Not anymore.
---
Id especially like this for Hardened Mass. Last update they added a bunch of things they will no longer auto scrap but they didnt include that
---
Yup..
---
Well said
---
Wait... there’s a Fatman robot challenge?? I don’t think I’ve seen that one yet... interesting. I saw the one that says kill robots with no weapons and laughed because I’m running around socking low level bots and sending them flying. Lol
---
I've had that happen way too many times, once right before I went to launch a nuke, thankfully I hadn't but it's getting to the point I'm gonna take a break, between that kinda crap and glitches and lack of consistent content, I'm kinda spent with my generosity for this game
---
Here's a helpful visualization https://i.imgur.com/eYGqgR6.jpg
---
Just let me put on rad suit then when I take it off my armor is still on. I had power armor but now I use it just so I can not have to re equip every price of armor and cosmetic skin and all that lol. Like if it was like power armor where your armor adds zero stats or protection I would be happy.
---
It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t locked to the scout armor and wood armors only. I just got fully upgraded to good secret service armor pieces so the paint is of no use to me. Otherwise i would have used it.
---
ATHENA needs to understand that all because I gave her a body doesnt mean we are friends. Please leave....
---
For real though, they've been in the files for ages and they couldn't even touch them up?!
---
I had heard about this one....never encountered it...played since BETA...was following my friend and he said 'a radstag in the ash heap weird'...radstag meat is always worth cooking....i immediately ran up on it and one shot it....wasnt til i looted the body i saw "Observant Radstag"
---
I felt so damn dumb...first and only time ive run into one...
---
Servers would die a terrible death....
---
"Old World Radio" is a Fallout themed 1000 song playlist, hit random and you're good to go, if you have the chatpad you can pause it as you please too.
---
You get unlimited junk, a tent, and a private server. Why are you complaining?
---
For the gun: Bear arms, Bandolier, all three heavy gunner
---
For you: Blocker, Iron clad, Rad Resistant, Bloody mess, Quick hands, and bullet shield.
---
That should cover your basics. Anything else you want to add is gonna be situational.

Fuck, if you can find one absolutely, especially with the recent changes and distinctions to fire damage, flamers fire rate and dot combined with range is a devastating combo I'd you get used to it.
---
I’ll be sure to follow you for more updates especially when patch 20 comes out, really great work here if you need any help with testing be sure to let me know and I’ll do my best to aid you!
---
With carnivore, it also heals a good amount of health over a brief time.  Since it’s so plentiful, it’s a good alternative to stimpaks if you’re planning on fighting a bunch of tough enemies.  When V94 was around, I’d hotkey the raw version to 4 on my keyboard and pick up more as I went.  You could just spam as much as you needed while taking poison damage and not worry about running out.
---
I agree that it is heavy, but it’s not impossible to move some perks around to fit Thru Hiker into most builds.  I’ll use it for farming and normal play, and swap in Dodgy if I’m doing an event with hard hitting enemies.
---
you can only have 5 characters on each account.
---
the only way you could get more was if you had characters get robbed during the inventory hack during xmas.

Unlimited aid and ammo stash *ebil laghter*

thx this rlly helped &lt;3

Shishkebab, Wooden Patio Chair, and one more that I can’t remember. What was really nice was the 10 stims, ammo, and other junk.
---
The few I know just shoot things before it shoots back. I have no clue, but I think its a mix of zigging, zapping and vatsing

Using a glitch. Here is a video explaining it. Happy decorating.
---
I enjoy the explosive flamer. But an explosive plasma will out damage one. I'd recommend any but a Tse as they are super inaccurate. They are not a game changer but are fun to use, specially with no wind up.
---
As for value I recently traded a fe rw gattling plasma, a Tse 45 sub, a v 33 25 fixer, and another decent thing I can't remember atm, for a Ve +agi flamer.
---
Umm, I use them. I run heavy guns and explosives. Bear Arms and Ordinance Express. I carry around 200 40mm, 50-100 missiles, and anywhere from 25-100 mini nukes. I also have hundreds of grenades. 50 nuka nades, at one point a hundred plasma, 90 pumpkin, almost a hundred mirv, around 30-40 of each floater nade, a handful of flares and dynamite bundles (very fun to throw during Fasnacht) and a handful of various mines and a few strike beacons.
---
Yeah. I'll gladly take those 40mm nades and missiles off your hands.
---
Yeah the hard freezes/game crashing to the home screen happens quite often.
---
I mean people keep taking photos of the place and selling them to Crater.
---
It's infuriating to not ever be able to do my ally quests. Server hopping rarely solves the problem either. Garbage.
---
There’s at least two pirate ship camps on pc, and both have multiple broadsiders and harpoon guns mounted like naval armament.  My first though upon visiting both was “damn, I hope for the sake of that guy’s stash that those are all 90% reduced weight...”
---
Obviously not! You never leave a door open in a fucking barn. That's how the stock gets out.
---
Stay away from my CAMP you perv....
---
;)
---
Instigating is better on rifles and single shot weapons, however I believe that it is bugged right now and works way better than it should on fast fire weapons like the Gauss minigun. Give it a whirl and see how it does.
---
I need to really start doing that. I'm leader of a small Brotherhood of Steel Roleplay/Milsim-lite group on Xbox, me not actually truly role-playing it out makes feel like a complete idiot.
---
To bad you're PS4 or else i would've recruited you on the spot.
---
I do however know of one Brotherhood of Steel group that is Roleplay focused on PS4: Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel, u/Paladin_Aqua can sort you out.
---
If any PC players (who're reading this) are looking for a true Brotherhood Roleplay/Milsim-lite group then u/Nymith is the guy you're looking for. His group also does videos via YouTube of their patrols/stories. (Something I'm truly thinking about doing either via Twitch or Mixer)
---
If any Xbox players are looking for a Brotherhood of Steel Roleplay/Milsim-lite group let me or u/Emy1250 know.
---
There's lot's of great stories/adventures that can occur when it comes to immersing yourself into a role/your favorite faction. Sadly there's a sizeable lack of roleplayers/enthusiasts especially on Xbox. I hope this comment slowly changes that outlook.
---
However i understand roleplaying it out: In character/immersing yourself into a suitable role/being any assortment of a specific build isn't for everyone but it's definitely one fun way of having new things to do.
---
It's one thing I'm planning on embracing, after all Fallout 76 was originally meant for players to create their own stories/backgrounds. Sure there's now Human/Ghoul NPCs but that doesn't stop us from thinking outside the box.
---
Edit: There's a Brotherhood of Steel Subreddit as well. Some of the members of it kinda Roleplay it out, I'm sure you can find a Brotherhood faction for PS4 that'll fit for you: r/Brotherhood_Of_Steel
---
Maybe add a status effect to them, because rage seems to be a likely reaction. Something just about double the psychobuff effects, maybe something like a bloodied effect on them, that'd be really neat. Rage is powerful enough to fell men mountains or countries, and has a great many times before. No more blood has been spilled than for the honor of a god, and to avenge one, razing cities to the ground would be a menial task. Could also make a really cool quest in the future, kill a legendary Mothman of some sort as some way of dealing with the cultists.
---
Instigating is great for a stealth rifleman type build where you intend to kill 95% of your targets with the first shot. I suspect you got the gauss minigun to fight the queen. If that’s the case you will be disappointed with the instigating effect (although it’s still a great gun against her. 
---
At most you will get it to proc 1 time if you are lucky enough to get the first shot on target.
---
Deathskull Radscorpion has entered the conversation

First 2 shots have the instigating damage if it shoots fast enough

The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter (PC) is always looking for new Initiates.

The way AA and DR works in this game is that AA always increases damage by flat \~29% (28.88%) if the target has enough DR. Less than that if it doesn't. Also stabilized perk + AA effect is not 90% armor piercing effect, it's calculated differenty also. It's 72.5%, so the difference in damage when compared to non-AA using stabilized is negligible. Furious with stabilized would naturally have 45% armor penetration.
---
I'm not trying to be dick about this, as it is clear you obviously have some misconceptions about these effects. I recommend you look at [this link to see calculations.](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Antiarmor_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Furious_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-9_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_HeavyAP-45_Other-0) Firstly you can see these two effects compared against each other with normal perks one would use. The first numbers you see when you scroll down are for basic damage/dps numbers without any DR calculated. You want to scroll further down to see the comparison tables (set it to show dps not damage). Now after that you will see the what increasing DR actually does. All the way to the bottom is Queen.
---
As an example, high level Super Mutants can have up to 135 DR / 80 ER. Sheepsquatches from 150/150 up to 433/433, usually 300/300.
---
Now remove the stabilized perk from the calculations. You can see, when you look at the comparison tables again, that from 0 DR to 25DR AA does less damage, as it has nothing to penetrate and has "punched" through all the armor the opponent has. And after 30DR it does that flat bonus to damage i was talking about earlier.
---
EDIT: Made this table comparing AA weapon to a non-legendary, both without stabilized. So you can see the actual effect of AA, and the flat damage bonus at 30DR and beyond.  [in this link](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Prefix-Antiarmor_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-50CalMachineGun_L-45_ModReceiver-Standard_ModBarrel-Heavy_Major-FFR_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-9_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_Other-0)
---
Quit asking questions as if they are listening.
---
I thought this dumb ass shit ended last year
---
Obviously a well put together game shouldn't suffer too much by simply raising the cap limit a bit. /s
---
There's no armor penetration for explosives.
---
A perfect example of Butthesda making a system, not testing it out or fleshing it out, and abandoning it. 
---
The whole game system is now a relic, a skeleton, and the bones are all of these abandoned, half developed systems. It's a like a human body but the lungs work at 25% capacity, the bones constantly break and need resetting, only to break again before fully healing. The liver is shot so there is no security and bugs and dupes run rampant and break the body down further. The brain has a hard time keeping all the malfunctioning body parts working in harmony y so the body stutters and stalls constantly. Nobody excercises or gives proper TLC to the body so when it IS put under stress it completely crumbles under the pressure. 
---
It's got a kind of pretty face and was a cute kid though, so we keep it around.
---
Ummm....what?!?!
---
I was thinking of building a group like if I was a survivor and wanted to rebuild the brotherhood of steel
---
I've been kinda suspicious that the lack of original inworld songs has to do with difficulty localization in other languages. Songs don't translate like regular dialogue does.  The big red flag was how the settler wanderer never actually sings anything, she only hums.
---
Could be wrong though, way outside my knowledge of stuff, would definitely be cool to hear.
---
Awesome man thank you 🙏🏻
---
would make a good and simple app for android. simply select what you did (sold \* item) and the app would start a timer and alert you when you could repeat. like say the encrypted event has a 3 hr cool down ? part of the app. if anyone is a android programmer.
---
Targeting bloodied builds though :) Most damage reduction / avoidance perks don't kick in until around 20-30% too. I might even wager the higher health pool guys would be easier to down. Take a 2 shot explosive let's say Gauss, pack on the +sneak damage perks + demo etc then pop a chem + high voltage hefe. Suddenly you're doing well over 1k. It's just the ones sitting at &lt;30% id personally worry about.
---
My co-worker’s wife is a big gamer and plays FO76 with us almost every night. She has also joined us in Dragon Quest Builders 2 and No Mans Sky. I know it’s not a females-only thing, but I can get you in contact with her and you’re always welcome to join our group.
---
That would be awesome!
---
Bandolier and bullet shield are meh. I’d definitely get blocker before either of them.
---
I have 4 chases full,  but to be honest you only need the best set and the Exc set.
---
I should be able to make sure she’s ok with it and pass you her PSN first thing in the am.
---
I think it does but don’t quote me on it
---
Thank you! That is very awesome of you
---
or they can bump up the fridge to 80% so its still not as good as a 3 star perk but good enough that its worth using without it being required.
---
50% is so low blow its just not worth it.
---
The answer is always unyielding.
---
I’m not sure, because I just wanted to inspect it but I accidentally hit the transfer key so mine came off, but I don’t really see why is wouldn’t compared to why it would.
---
Making the switch from stealth rifle(wo)man to stealth commando is super easy and will increase your damage output and survivability multiple times over. 
---
Since doing so I easily sneak through and waste all the glowing ones on whitespring nuke zone without ever even getting detected.
---
I memeber when it was 400, that was harsh
---
It's pretty common, that said, whatever people will pay
---
Why do you pay for something you don’t feel like it’s worth your money in a videogame? 
---
People, don’t buy that Ripoff of a subscription and wait until Bethesda includes something worth the price.
---
Yeah honestly don't remember how I made that work I think used to only keep 100 steel lead plastic aluminum and ballistic fiber around at any time and even then I could barely hold another setup of gear lol
---
I had seen a couple of them shortly after I started playing, but I just thought they were a different variant of the radstag, so I just went on my way.  One time I saw one and ended up following it, just because it seemed odd the way it was acting, and it was not running away from me, the way radstags normally do (nor was it attacking me, the way erratic radstags do).  It also led me to a log with cool loot in it.  I posted about my experience on here, and several players told me to always follow them, because that is what they do, they lead you to a log with loot in it.  I have run into one more since then.  I have been playing since January, and I have only seen them a total of four times, so they are not very common.
---
Robot slaves? Really pushing ain't ya. Protrectrons, assaultrons, sentry bots, handys, gutsys, etc are all advanced machines with a pretty innovative and advanced AI. But they are not slaves, by your statement siri or Alexa would be a slave. The only thing I can think of that would be even near your ridiculous statement would be any generation of the Synths. But, the institute is its own culture, and is not an accurate representation of prewar American Society. 
---
But, the American society in Fallout is extremely xenophobic and heavily traditional. The Fallout America deviates in the 40's so most of the cultural advancement, and broadening never happened. And new cultures or ideals that blossomed in the Fallouts America were quickly shunned, or reported as communist propaganda. So you can imagine people just followed the traditional route as it was safe
---
Honestly its seems like you're just complaining to complain, and making issues where none exist. Fallout 76s customization isnt the vast to begin with. Alot of common hair styles and beard cuts aren't there, so why would some less common styles be the there?
---
I can't believe that I can't buy this anymore I love that fucking singing collectron
---
I hit the cap limit and this guy comes to my vending machine and buys a bloodied weapon for another 30k, I might as well just give them out for free what the fuck

Ah ok thanks

I'd recommend serendipity over ironclad, it has low benefit for how many points it uses. Serendipity and Dodgy are much better defensive perks as they negate damage. You'll also want adrenaline for some extra damage and one gun army. Also keep mind that some heavy weapons are really hard to use without stabilized which only works in power armor. For example the Gatling plasma had crazy drift and does not work well out of power armor.
---
Kids today don't understand how good they have it.
---
Handy thing, if you can fit it into your build, grab Enforcer under Agility. Even rank 1 is nice, I typically run rank 2 and it's real handy. Makes your shotgun, any shotgun, into a crippling machine. Aim for the legs and you turn any Yao Guai into a defenseless target (That you might eventually feel sorry for, but keep in mind, it will totally try to rip your fucking face off the moment it can). I highly suggest a combat shotgun for this, explosive if you can find it, and throw a drum on it. If you can find a QE combat shotgun, even better, and the damage numbers don't really matter so you can snag a low level one too. You can VATS the limbs to make sure, but if you run low on AP/don't have Concentrated Fire, you're good just aiming for the legs.
---
Works real well on big shit and can give you some room to breathe. You got like a minute or two before their limbs regen and they come back, but IIRC the limb only regens a little, so another couple rounds and they go back to be crippled.
---
Can also silence the shotgun to make it easier to remain sneeky breeki.
---
At times like these I like my base placement, I put it on a lead deposit, and about 100 feet away is a spawn point for glowing animals. Infinite food and ammo
---
Instigating is a terrible effect at queen fights.
---
I just ran into this at someone else's camp and Im so sad I didnt snag it. 😍😪
---
Back in my day we killed scorch beasts with a tin can and some string we also walked to the cranberry bog from home over encumbered barefoot both ways 80 kilometers and we drank our nuka cola warm.
---
Does Zealots work against scorched beasts, or only scorched troops?
---
Just completely ignore the history of racially driven oppression and current imbalance in power dynamics that led to the term PoC being developed. Nice. 
---
Using realism as a justification for why things aren't in this game is also ridiculous considering well... everything in it.
---
Well you could do what you said and that'll get you over the line but you have to think about the things that are commonly plastic as a thematic group and then work out where those things tend to be.
---
Think about it. The plastics you generally get a lot of from Morgantown high school fall into 3 categories - food utensils (cafeteria trays and cutlery), toys in the gym and pumpkin buckets. Food utensils leads you to places that have a diner or cafeteria. Toys leads you to places you find kids like fairgrounds etc.
---
It's not hard to work out for yourself as the game is pretty logically consistent that way but you could just do the lazy thing and google it and find out where people have already worked out where to find large pockets of plastic.
---
I believe it to be because of mass duping of holiday presents, which people found or bought them. On Xbox, a guy was selling literally millions of them for a cap each.
---
That's one way of doing it, however do be careful who you place in leadership positions. Don't promote people to full members (Knight/Scribe) who've only been there for barely a month because to be honest that's not enough time to learn if they're going to be truly loyal or not towards you. Just keep that in mind **if** you do end up forming your own Brotherhood of Steel chapter.
---
I set up my own Brotherhood chapter 6 months ago after some pretty big disagreements me and my Sentinel  (Who's also my girlfriend) had with the (last group we were apart) leadership over how things were going, so we left it and formed our own.
---
In a Roleplay perspective i guess you can say we forged our own path, my group abides to the Brotherhood's main ideology, we also tend to help those who're in need of assistance. We're currently pathetically small (5 members as of now, originally had 14 but most left because they didn't like how things were being slow (Had to or else rushing things would've ended terribly): A rowdy/disrespectful Initiate practically poached them so eh) but it won't be forever.
---
Keep in mind there definitely are some bad actors at play so ask any potential recruits why they truly wish to join your group, be assertive, tell them about your group and its ideologies. Heck even post things like the post you made here, it'll get you positive attention from likeminded people. You'll grow, but it'll take time. Bottom line: Don't rush.
---
Definitely a cool random event.
---
Almost forgot about that. Thank you for reminding me.
---
You have an infinitely large scrapbox for junk. For most people that have reported on it, that's like saving 500 stash.
---
You're just hoarding.
---
I think all
---
True
---
Doesn't matter what we want, they won't increase the cap or anything, they probably prefer the caps disappearing into thin air when some duper comes and buys out your entire vendor.
---
I'd personally like maybe a timer on anything over cap, that is if they have zero plans of increasing the cap.
---
I'm sure that Bethesda could triple the stash for Fallout 1st and people would STILL complain that there isn't enough stash.
---
OP has to stop hoarding.

I know they are.
---
What I meant is that you can get both effects from your SPECIAL perks. And I think that you should have as much Furious like effects as possible because its DPS (stacking Furious + Tenderizer + Concentrated Fire) while Anti armor effects have big diminishing returns DPS wise above 75%, which you can achieve only with tank Killer perk and/or penetrating magazine (which for example is allmost useless if you have tank killer considering the VATS cost is lower with just a big magazine and the DPS gain is really low).
---
All that comes from the fact that the heavier armored ennemies in the game dont go alot above 75% armor and even if they are, the DPS you´ll gain from Furious with 2 or 3 consécutive hits will compensate and out perform armor penetration

---
TS effect is one of the worst effects you can get. Adding/talking about explosive effect on it doesn't make any difference as any other prefix can use the same explosive effect, that does the same added % damage. Even AA is better than TS, because of the extreme accuracy and recoil penalty TS has. On paper TS does slightly more damage but in reality, you will be missing so much that AA becomes better. Only thing worse than TS are the effects that give flat damage bonus to certain enemy types, like Ghoul Slayer's. TS is 25% increased damage, and makes TS weapon shoot two projectiles each doing 62.5% damage. Making it really bad to miss one of those shots.
---
TSE used to be the best there is, until it was over nerfed from doing 100% increased damage to 25% early 2019. Explosive effect was also nerfed, from 100% to 20%. Also.. Demolition expert got nerfed severely. Making TSE weapons well... Crap.
---
In a game as easy as this, where enemies die if you throw a stick at them.. One might argue that all these talks about what is best and what does what % is pointless. And that all weapon effects do the job just fine. While this certainly is true, there are still people who want to min max everything. And if you do, TS is a baaaad baaad prefix.

clearly you didn’t read my post. I got something from the exploiter and used it to give everyone else around me .
---
Huh, I’ve only encountered one, when I was very low level. It saved my ass from some liberators near the river bridge above Flatwoods (remember, I was low level!), then it looked at me for a few seconds and ran off. I wish I had known to follow it!

Umm... why leave free damage on the table? A non-stealth bloodied commando is just a bad stealth bloodied commando.

I get the anxiety, I don't have the cash to do fallout first so I just try to stay as far away from groups as possible, though I'll try to alleviate some newer players anxiety and help them whenever I can. Hell, if I see someone at my camp I absolutely avoid it (despite having vendors intentionally) until they're gone so nothing can go awry. The exceptionally psychotic pvp'rs I've met and heard from ruin the fallout experience for me so other players are something I try to avoid unless I'm in a group with you. I'm on Xbox so I can't join you (I read you were on pc in another comment) or I would but you're not alone.

If that's your reason for subscribing, then you never wanted to subscribe in the first place.

I hate that you assume I’m hoarding, that really irks me. If they’re not going to give us anything for a year they could at least make an unlimited stash is what I’m saying.
---
Same here Chembrlee. I recently started playing FO76, having picked it up during the free trial they had back in May. Having passed on the game at launch (it sounded like a hot mess), I've been pleasantly surprised at how much fun I've had with it these past few weeks.
---
Currently I'm still pretty wee, only level 64, and I've been working on a sniper/stealth build (no Chinese stealth armor yet, sadly!) - its a good time skulking around and trying to take stuff out quietly. I was lucky and got a double shot legendary combat rifle, which I've modded into a silenced sniper-worthy weapon.
---
I play on a solo server for the most part, but I hop over to public servers to try to find rare clothing/outfits from other players' vending machines, as well as get in on nuke/scorchbeast events. I don't have a gaming headset, so I don't really have the ability to make friends in game since there's no text chat. That kinda sucks, but I'm still enjoying the game vastly more than I anticipated. I love all the collectible bears and things, at least when I don't accidentally scrap them! XD
---
Twas his vessel he'll be back mortal! ;) I agree would be nice to see some reaction.

Hey, glad to see you found a friend to play with! If you're looking for more folks to hang out with, do some events, whatever, feel free to drop into our Discord, The Rusty Pick ([invite.gg/TRP](https://invite.gg/TRP)) - we're in-game pretty much every evening, and we enjoy hanging out with new people and playing together!
---
I’m not hoarding. And that upsets me that people would assume that. My point is they haven’t updated it for like a year and if they can’t come up with new ideas then just make a bigger stash at least so we have something useful...
---
I miss Fasnacht so bad now lol
---
What platform/ign? Add me @ TheMasterDev, I'll give you buckets of ammo, better weapons, and some materials for your humble abode.
---
No I read your post and stand by what I said - you benefitted from an exploiter and then are bragging about it.
---
It's like buying stolen goods. You didn't steal the goods but the fact that you got them knowing that they were stolen means your hands aren't clean. You're not all that much better than the exploiter themselves.
---
I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but if you love sniping like I do, consider saving unyielding armor pieces you find and experiment with playing at low health.  It makes your life so much easier.  You don’t need amazing three star pieces to get started.  Plain one star unyielding will provide the most important benefit, and everything else is mostly just icing on the cake.
---
The +15 agility boost makes you insanely stealthy, which means you’ll be able to take on high level enemies without them ever being able to find you and hurt you.  It happens sometimes, mainly vs mole rats or if you’re directly under a spotlight.  With the Escape Artist perk, you can usually just retreat and reacquire stealth in most cases, then continue your headhunting as normal.  You’ll have more leeway to maneuver around, a larger margin for error, and dictate the pace of the engagement to your liking.
---
The massive boost to stats will also give you a bunch of extra carry weight, great vats accuracy at very long range, better buy/sell prices, more xp, more AP and faster critical meter fills.  You’ll also get those perfectly preserved pies fairly often.  LOL.
---
Even if you don’t have a bloody rifle, adding in the  damage bonuses from the Nerd Rage perk and Adrenal Reaction mutation will significantly increase your damage.  All of a sudden high level enemies don’t seem intimidating anymore.
---
I know it’s not for everyone, but I resisted the low health meta for several months.  Once I tried it, I just fell in love and never looked back.  It really, really shines for any stealth build, and certainly worth seeing what all the fuss is about.

Not even remotely underrated. It's been a top event for ages. Not many events guarantee 3 legendaries during them. Even if the items are not max level, that's a good bit of scrip. Add in the steel farming and/or cap farming aspect of it and most people who've been playing for a decent amount of time are well aware of it.
---
just putt them in a display case before scrapping or manually scrap everything.
---
The good solution to avoid that would be for the Scrapbox to NOT scrap the junk you store in your stash, even if its not displayed.
---
Good on you for reaching out bud. I hope that it inspires others in a similar position to do the same!
---
They could ask Inon Zur to compose some of his awesome lounge tunes for the jukebox.  I’d happily listen to him while working at my camp.
---
I plan on subscribing once the xmas tent is available again. If they'd let fo1st subscribers access previous atom shop content like the succulents, concrete tires, and contemporary home stuff I'd subscribe in a heart beat
---
Lvl 3 bandolier makes most ballistic ammo, like 5mm for example, completely weightless. When I was still running heavy I would have between 20k and 30k 5mm on me at any given time. Not to mention the thousands of rounds of .44, .45, and 10mm I kept for backup.
---
However you're right that blocker is most important. More creatures will run up and smack you instead of shooting back
---
The sad truth is is that if it doesn't cost Bethesda any money, they just don't give a shit. It's such a lot priority, it won't be fixed.
---
I agree that it should be fixed somehow but I honestly don't see it ever happening.
---
My partner and I try to play together every night. Wouldn't mind a buddy with us.
---
I have crippling social anxiety, but we're both pretty chill.
---
Pretty sure my in game handle is Axelma.
---
well, shit.... I havent tried yet. Ill let you know if mine works. Idk if that would be helpful but yeah
---
How could I forget adrenaline. I used to count off how many people I killed so I knew when I was full "murder frenzy" lol
---
Me and the wife unloaded clips into it. The next week I felt great regret after looking up what they are.
---
Damn - I saw one yesterday for the first time in the savage divide and ignored it.  I just thought it was Bethesda just fucking with me with weird names.  Live and learn.....
---
I feel your pain
---
I hate mmo’s usually because of how many people there are and I’m still on the fence on 76 (for different reasons) but 1. Seeing other players in the game is not really that common because of the limited number on each server and 2. Every person I have seen in game has either ignored me or tried to help me and no one has gotten mad if I ignored them
---
The scout armor variant looks pretty fresh ngl
---
Ok. Well. I bought everyone’s stuff and gave it back, and then I started messaging people to sell me a purified water for 10k caps. Either way it goes, I got no gain from it, besides pure joy of knowing I made someone’s day. So yeah, I’m bragging, because i feel good about helping people. 
---
I appreciate you trying to make me feel bad about myself, you’re just a jerk obviously.
---
jeez i wish i could have rough experiences in the game i want two game modes like survival and like actual realistic wasteland like everythings a one hit and having a pipe pistol would make you seem rich mutations are mostly harsh c.a.m.ps take forever to build resources are really hard to get and theres no quest just survival and nukes just randomly drop at different random areas no fast travel you always need a gas mask in the ash heap the savage divide is filled to the brim with enemies  of high levels water is always dirty and boiled only gets rid of some diseases not all btoken limbs are constantly harrassing you and yes just turn it into hell
---
Sofia is (imo) the most consistent. The others seem to love forgetting they have a job in my CAMP. I generally get a daily from her 90% of the time. The last 10% is her disappearing for an hour or so (a day of game time).
---
My point :(
---
Sorry bud. There weren't enough players to justify the game mode. What incentive does Bethesda have to bring it back. You guys didn't show up when it was available.
---
If you’re not going stealth—a questionable decision,  it to each their own—then Bolstering might be better for you than Unyielding. The primary benefit of Unyielding for a commando is the increased stealth, so if you’re not using that, then it’s a lot less beneficial. That said, if you use VATS, the increased accuracy from boosted PER, extra AP and increased Luck might still interest you. 
---
If you don’t use VATS, then the extra protection Bolstering affords could be best. 
---
As for secondary effects, AP refresh is always good, but so are weight reduction buffs. If you’re not Unyielding, you’ll appreciate the extra carry weight those will give you. A lot of people love Sentinel, personally, I don’t get it. Why would anyone stand still in the middle of a firefight? Are you role playing as a Redcoat or something? But, if it fits your play style, it might work well.
---
That’s where all my weight comes from. Ammo and aid items, I sell all my stuff to low levels for like 1 cap or sometimes I’ll buy stuff from them for like 10k caps. I like to help people.
---
Nah. I'm a lazy seller. I usually just leave whatever the recommended price the game sets. If something doesn't sell for awhile, I'll 1/2 theprice. I don't care about making caps much.
---
Damn all these cool groups are only on pc, there ain't nothing on ps4 ;-;
---
Thanks for the idea, I'll try them out,. PC user
---
Awesome!  Thanks for the info.  I guess I will need to keep some grenades.
---
Or place extra caps in vending machine or another box for 48 hours or more.
---
If I could have more than 3k in my account at one time that would be greeeeat! But yes a fair point!
---
To me, it’s just as much a convenience mutation as speed demon or marsupial.  As a stealth guy, I might use one stimpak a week outside of a mole rat instantly putting me on blast at SBQ.  I only carry ten, keep my carry weight way down, and don’t need to waste perk space on traveling pharmacy.  I run a lot of mutations, so I put the perk points into class freak.  It makes the mutation penalties trivial.
---
Other than some over compensating dudes running around in PA for seemingly no reason &amp; the occasional d-bag, 99% of people have been very cool. I have played many multiplayer games &amp; they were all filled with twerps. FO76 has reunited my faith in humanity...a little.
---
I think there were a lot more players when it was set to kill counter versus survival score. I remember being able to switch servers more than 10 times and not run into the same people.
---
Why don’t they give it one last shot to see if it will be a hit with the new crowd? Re adjust some parts to it. Maybe remove a scoreboard all together and just have a survival mode where players can shoot on sight. It would make player encounters more enjoyable.
---
No, he's absolutely right. Even if your intentions were good, the effects of your good intentions were objectively negative. The responsible thing to do would be to buy all of them and then drop them on a private server or get rid of them in some other way, not to contribute to devaluing the value of caps by using a duper's items to "benefit" yourself and others.
---
Cool!  Thanks for the info. I will have to check that out.

"It just works" - Todd 2018
---
One of the wonderful bugs the game is full of. And has been from launch of the game.
---
I am trying to apply to t-65 armor and no luck yet w/o the plan. But I have no problem applying the free estates jet pack on it. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Been there... Sorry to hear.
---
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
---
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
---
Laughing like children, living like lovers
---
Rolling like thunder under the covers
---
Why?
---
Basically you're asking Bethesda to setup a system to store the excess caps which then renders the cap limit useless and wastes resources creating this bank.
---
They're better off using code that already exists in the game that vendors use. If they don't have enough caps, you can't sell an item to them. You just use the reverse logic. If their purchase pushes you over your limit, it stops the transaction.
---
Or they could remove the cap limit which is what your bank effectively does but there is a cap limit for a reason so that's just never going to happen.
---
I remember New Vegas had a quest Like that where you had to gather a bunch of people together to form a band in one of the casinos. I could never do it because my game crashed literally every-time I tried but I found the songs in the game-files. It was kinda cool to hear songs about the wasteland
---
There are lots of BOS groups (and other groups) out there that are cross-platform or PS4. Check out:
---
r/FactionBoard76
---
r/Fallout76Factions
---
Unfortunately I can't recommend any good ones as I don't know what they're like. 
---
But what I will say is the biggest ain't always the best!
---
I’m down to join! I’m usually quiet on mic but I start to open up.
---
There was a lot about survival I loved. I played it a lot. No map marker always possible pvp... If they got rid of things like aid being dropped and maybe made legendary effects not work on PvP it would have nice. Like mash NW and Adventure.
---
I know that is why I left the bears and the board, when I thought I already had that bear.  The caps were too tempting to pass up, so I did take those.
---
If you feel that it's real I'm on trial
---
And I'm here in your prison
---
Like a coin in your mint
---
I am dented and I'm spent with high treason

Through a glass eye your throne

Is the one danger zone

Take me to the pilot for control

Take me to the pilot of your soul

Take me to the pilot

Lead me through the chamber

I am but a stranger

Prolly the pa skip. You can skip most of the silo by carrying in a set of pa, getting through a level 3 door and terminal, and then using it to clip through a pile of boxes. 10 minutes even sounds a bit long to use the glitch. I'm usually in and out within 5 minutes. As for nuke cards, it's easy enough to get them if you're drowning in caps and are willing to vendor hop until you find them. I found a dude selling 90ish of them for 100 caps each yesterday, so i'm set for a while.
---
Gotcha, I appreciate it man.
---
A new raider radio would be awesome, I loved RedEye and his shitty songs.
---
You realise that those things aren't related to each other? 
---
People HATED scoreboards. Not everyone of course, but the majority did. That's why they eventually got rid of it in survival. 
---
Even back then the numbers for survival weren't good. What proof have you got now that there are sufficient numbers that not just want survival back but, and this is the important part, will play survival mode enough to justify it.
---
The truth is you don't.
---
If your post blows up and has like 10k upvotes, then maybe that's proof enough. Past experience has shown otherwise but happy to be wrong.
---
 Great friggin username
---
I just told him that. I’m sorry if you guys aren’t seeing this. I don’t know why I’m getting all the hate. I replied to tell him I dropped all their stuff and told them pick it up, so they keep the caps and can resell their item. And then I would go to low levels and ask them to charge me 10k caps for a purified water. At the end of the day I got rid of all the gifts and the caps that came with them. Its making me sad that everyone is giving me hate :( it’s not fair. So as I said once, I didn’t get any benefit besides feeling joy when players gave me a heart emoji and felt happy for my gesture.
---
I've scrapped my teddies FIVE times!!
---
So yes, a favourite option for junk would be so greatly appreciated 😭
---
You on XB1 by any chance?
---
Hello Friend. Glad to see you are still playing. Last i remember, you were going to stop playing and hence you gave away tons of your cool stuff. 
---
Like you, I have and tried out full unyielding leather set. Its really nice. OP prewastelanders.  Now with stealth suit, that , i think, became obsolete.    Then i got lucky and rolled some secret service unyielding rolls. 
---
Now rocking a full set unyielding secret service. Its really good. That high rad resist is a game changer. The only thing that can kill is poison damage. No need for blocker or barbarian. But between the two, blocker is superior choice. Just need a few poison resist pieces and you will be tanky for sbq mobs, have the rad  resist to survive fart bombs drop on you, stealthy enough for imposter.  Life giver is also better choice in your list for endurance perk.
---
Im no programmer , but it sounds pretty simple to put a system like your stuff cant be sold if the cap limit would be reached ? 
---
Anyone smart know if such a thing would be possible ? 
---
I got so much outfits and stuff i would like to put in vendor but i wont because i have no need to loose caps to Todd
---
I'm pretty sure the chances were higher before Bethesds decided to nerf the drop rate from the event, back when you could manually trigger Campfire Tales by walking to the camp at night. I remember simply server-hopping til I could do the event and getting a badge about once every 3 completions. 
---
Grinded til I got my hands on the High-Capacity plan since that was glitched for whatever reason (having it on you would automatically learn the plan without having to press on it and use it), and decided to spread that plan around while backpacks were still relatively new and people were focusing on maxing carry weight
---
Nice skid marks. True resident of the wasteland right here
---
I agree completely. A lot of the reasons for the survival nerfs were because of the leaderboard essentially putting a “kick me” sign on players who wanted to farm with a 20% XP boost, which was a bad idea. A lot of people try to say survival was never popular, but it certainly was before they started changing it.
---
Texture glitch more than likely
---
I use youtube playlists, but spotify works too. there's a 24/7 fallout music radio on YT, they  have a decient playlist. But I kinda wish I could toss in a mod like Boston Radio, with the... bazillion channels they have. Gotta hand it to them, it sounded like their DJ's had too much fun lol
---
maybe youve got BO and nobody wants to be near you.. did you think of that..?
---
They should add a Bank. The bank would allow you to store X amount of caps, accessible to all characters on your account. Could add it in a way that you would have to do a quest line to unlock access to the bank, say having to complete the main story to gain access to it to prevent mule characters from being able to use/abuse it. 
---
Add in bank notes. Bank notes would be used to buy caps, treasury notes, unique bank related cosmetics, etc. They could even make it where you have use X bank notes to increase your bank account limits. Say your bank starts at being able to store 10k, investing bank notes could increase the amount able to be stored. 
---
Create a new public event where Blood Eagles or Cultists try robbing the bank, and if nobody helps defend the bank, anyone on the server with stored caps would lose a small amount. 
---
Even go as far as adding in a ATM for your camp to do transactions at a higher fee, but saving you the time of going to the banks on the map.
---
Radio Raider in the priest outfit.  It is amazing how well it works.  Both creepy and hot.
---
Been an issue with shotguns for as long as I can remember, but with wastelanders it got driven into overdrive with all kinds of weapons. It does it with my BE laser rifle with beam splitter.
---
Every time with Wren and Bruiser. And don't get me starting on NPC sleeping!
---
Too much. And on the private server to boot. I know it's privilege and all, but I won't even transfer things to mules at this point, for fear of losing items. That hasn't been am issue simce I bought first.
---
I accidentally scrapped my mr fuzzy suit earlier, F
---
I don't think we need another Imposter Sheepsquatch boss, man...(where she just mows through everybody like tinfoil while you can't do anything about it)
---
Hey there. Thank you. Yes. Wastelanders brought me back. It’s hard to stay away. 😃 I actually like it. I did roll the unyielding secret service and it pretty much makes the leather obsolete. I got lucky and rolled powered, sneak, poison. And since it’s so tanky blocker does seem obsolete as well. And that jet pack. 😃 But now I’m in similar OP state but even worse. Lol  nice to see you again.
---
Just more bethesda RNG, in all seriousness though, if you're using a friend to trade, you should probably do it directly, you can "sell" items via direct trade for 0 caps.
---
Maybe, being in a vault for 25 years is not good for the skin
---
That sounds like a great idea!
---
I mean you could have just left the server instead of being stubborn with your knife.
---
If your nuke wasn't placed right and people have to fight the Queen in the nuke zone no one will show. Yes you are allowed to place it where you want. But others are allowed not to show up if they don't want to.
---
And no one does pp since the rewards are sub par and without a decent team or communion you can not get the top tier rewards
---
Also if you're hoping one wasteland will help your game play you might be under leveled or under geared to be doing the Queen or colossus
---
People keep saying that the ammo consumption is a problem, but for me it has always been the weapon’s durability. That being said, thry are great weapons, especially in PvP, and I’ve loved all of the ones I’ve used except for the TSE, which has too shit of a recoil to be useful imo
---
If you can't find someone to sell you the recipe, just keep your eye out for the campfire tales event, I've had heaps of the smores recipes drop from doing it.
---
No no. Speaking through miming only.
---
Meh this game's getting more pointless day after day tbh
---
Yeah I've done it over 10 times now, just never seem to get it.
---
My main char is a junkies commando, non stealth and no VATS
---
Im my experience players spawn north of where u initially place the CAMP. And at the edge perimeter.
---
If I remember correctly, they reverted the change to fire damage.
---
You are more than welcome to play another game if you're not enjoying yourself. It's your time. Do what you want. Might I suggest some old school games like, fable tlc, or kotor 1 and 2
---
Thnks man
---
theres a small little tiny group of players that are complete assholes but most are really nice im a high level and i gave a low level a legendary weapon he wanted and he sounded so excited it was really wholesome
---
I’m gonna leave your doors open, manually turn off all of your lights, and kill your brahmin. What are you gonna do about it?
---
Don't own an xbox so nah
---
 😃 But now I’m in similar OP state but even worse. 
---
—- you say that like its a bad problem. 
---
Yeah that jet pack is nice. Something i recently found out, having bird bones really helps mitigate fall damage from not super heights.  1 fall damage piece helps for bloodied not die so often. 2 fall damage pieces for total immunity. I like the jet pack but i died a lot due to lag and jumping, my jet pack would just sends me off to the moon and then ill die of course. More HP the better your buffer to absorb fall damage if you dont have any fall damage reducing pieces. Hence, life giver does double benefits.
---
Problen is the limit of scrips per day. And i got at least 3 dozens of such 1 * scrip that giving away also doesnt help the low levels
---
They can’t leave the doors open if you don’t have doors. Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
I mean there are some old post on this sight where some people spent 20 plus hours on a sever or had survived a couple hundred hours before dieing
---
I occasionally run a non stealth Bloodied commando with energy weapons. You'll want a lot of luck... You'll need Starched and Class Freak of course but also Serendipity, Grim Reapers Spirit and your choice of Crit boosting perks. You'll want Adreneline and Gun-Fu in agility... You can also still roll with some stealth perks as well. Equip Barbarian under strength, Radicool and Lifegiver or Fireproof.  In open areas you can sneak into close range and get a good Gun-Fu chain going. Grim Reapers Spirit has good synergy here. Fall back when needed and use Escape Artist and repeat if necessary. The laser rifle is so freaking cheap on VATS it's unreal.. But lately I've been using my Plasma rifle, both are really great .
---
Let’s hope for the best. And pray for it because I would be on survival 24/7. Other players should show as neutral but would show as red if shot at or shot by them. Also players can side with their factions so raiders and raid (whatever the opposing faction’s name is) and vice versa. That would be awesome.
---
i sell most of my legendaries for 250 at most because all the prices are like 5000-1000000000 and its so annoying i have just started buying legendaries from people because its annoying as shit with the high ass prices
---
...that doesn't make any sense. Don't you mean "They should make Electromagnetic Charge Packs" or something of that sort? You don't make 2mm 'cores.' That doesn't make any sense
---
Yeah... i have seen maybe 1 griefer in the last 2 years. 
---
Just go to another server.
---
None of those weapons were any good anyways. Like half of them were nocturnal. One of them was a fucking pipe wrench lmao
---
Yes I believe the scoreboard ruined a lot when it was set to survival score. Kill counter was ok because it only set the top 3 player killers as visible. So even a marathon survivor could join in and send a message the the troll player killer.
---
They are all bugged I think. I also havent had a quest from Beckett in a week or two. 
---
Although I did happen upon a kidnapped settler, turned out it was my ally quest for that day, I rescued him and then got the message to tell Beckett. My guess is the quests are there but nothing informs you. It's just happy chance if you find the objective.
---
Hoping it gets fixed real soon. Along with fixing thier amnesia.
---
Ha yeah the goal is to get invincible but then the game gets a little boring is all. Yeah I also rolled a fall damage too. lucky as hell. Having a tough time nailing the last piece but not complaining.
---
Wifey plays if you wanna send me your psn and don’t mind me being around 50% of the time lol
---
All scorched.
---
Just like the prime receiver
---
It happens to me last week. Someone bought my junkies/+10dmg while aiming gatling plasma for 2000 and this lovely game got me only 39 caps. Reason is highly logical: I was on max caps... Tragical
---
Really? Hmph, well, I've given up on trying to keep up with this game, I dunno if we've hit rock bottom and went up or if we hit rock bottom and brought a pickaxe with us, looking like the latter in some ways.
---
Maybe the traders where out of money for the day.
---
There was the animated music video I remember seeing years ago of this guy who wandered around the world giving angry and upset people hugs to make them feel better. 
---
I get you man, game can be a turd and sometimes you can have bad luck and a bad run.
---
*hugs*
---
Yes it was and I hope Bethesda can give it one more go. 
---
Even if it was a promotional trial weekend. But please use Player Kill counter for the visible leaderboard and allow other leaderboards but only to view in the menu. It was great when you could see who was alive for 10+ hours but you could not find them. Or you could see who had mega XP but again you had to find them randomly. 
---
It was good knowing where the top 3 player killers were either to avoid them or to shoot some pop shots at them to mess with them.
---
The one with the password to Fort Venture's command center, so you can open it each time without hacking. You can't choose the password option if the holotape is in your stash.
---
That's the only one I keep for the few times I'm there and loot it.
---
there is a rubberbanding bug with shotguns when used outside of VATs. I recommend using VATs all the time with shotguns anyways as most shotguns are magic and do something like 4x the damage you're seeing here in VATs and will one shot most enemies in VATs.
---
Ouuu I like this one
---
And that was awesome. I know for a fact they enjoyed that.
---
Much appreciated :)
---
Kill people in workshops and take their junk
---
The only time I’m not going stealth is if I’m bouncing around in power armour because I’m farming lead.
---
Otherwise it’s just too costly with serendipity and dodgy proccing and stealing all my AP...not to mention the damage lost
---
They tried to make it competitive instead of making it survival. It was too confusing but I did grind to get all of the weapons
---
They are in the Discord
---
https://nukacrypt.com

Encrypted cool down is per server not per person. So groups usually hop repetitively from server to server and the same person can keep starting it as much as he wants as long as he server is readyfor the event.
---
Did you by any chance switch from the Bethesda Launcher to Steam?
---
I was wondering why mine was feeling like it was thunking way less than before. Even with FFR its still much slower than it was, fuck.
---
Unfortunately, stealth sniper only gets you so far in this game. Eventually you're going to have to use power armor, especially if you're trying to complete the main quest lines.
---
Get yourself a heavy weapon, lots of ammo, and a solid set of PA and you'll find your survivability increases as does your ability to complete dangerous missions.
---
Maybe wear actual armor that provides more than 100 DR
---
Are you in Toxic Valley just south of Crater? I had my camp there, and left after 2000+ lead, in exchange for a view.
---
I have a bloodied autogrenade launcher I use.  So that I don’t mind, but missiles are useless and way to heavy.
---
They did revert it. Pretty quickly to
---
The tax is pretty straightforward. They go into the void, to balance out all the caps that come out of the void when people get their 1400 caps per day from vendor bots. Without that, the economy would inflate even more wildly than it has already, to the point where eventually F76 would be like Venezuela and 100k caps couldn't buy you a single stable flux. We'll probably get there anyway eventually, but the tax slows that inflation down.
---
Wouldn’t you be technically better off wearing stat boosting legendary armour that has broken?
---
Like weightless AP 20% less carry Weight.
---
Or even pieces that reduce damage from individual enemies percentage wise (zealots, hunters, etc)
---
The big down side to that would be no nuke zones without rad shield and being in a team though.
---
Good one :D
---
Yeah, I got bored and went back to adventure griefing when they removed the showing of the top 3 on the map. At that point finding people to fight became a crapshoot and was not worth my time patrolling the map to get 12 caps from a kill...
---
If you’re on pc, I’d be glad to join you. I usually play solo but I’d like to have someone to play with.
---
Yeah they should have stuck with survival. Again the survival score visibility ruined it for a lot of survivors. We have NW for competitive now. 
---
With all the new features of wastelanders Bethesda can definitely create a new survival mode with faction battles and what not.
---
It is marketing strategy of theirs to handle it like this.
---
Rifleman and with a little bit of juggling pistols.
---
It's underwhelming to say the least. To compensate I never put cooked meals in, just raw meat. That way when it is about to spoil I can still make it edible with a full spoilage bar. A freezer would allow us to put in some actual recipes like cranberry relish, and not worry about it while playing. 80% would indeed make a difference. But still not enough.
---
and mannequins or maybe they do it themselves
---
I didn’t think you could put stuff in containers for other people
---
Can bethesda tell they are duped?
---
ffs people have been dumping unused plans in train stations forever, doesnt mean its dupers.
---
That is being added sometime this year
---
I use nvidia’s built in recording software
---
After the event is over, go through the door you entered (the one with the bench on the right), make a right, pass a small "room" on the left with two Mole Miners and beds, then go under the water, swim until you see a pipe, Mario out of there, and you'll be in  a room that's filled with rads in some areas. There's a ladder that leads out of the Mine.
---
You are level 50. Any level above does not add any dmg, any stat. It is just for tweaking your char and the ,, good feeling ,, . But I read somewhere that lvls give you more camp budget.
---
\+ This feature is comming, it is called ONE APPALACHIA and it will scale enemies to your lvl. ( 50 lvl )
---
But I noticed that around 90-100, max lvl enemies will spawn for you in every location. When I was 50-80, I was finding lower lvl enemies than with my 300+ lvl. ( Example : Whitespring - your lvl 50-80 - ghouls lvl 32-52, rarely 62. When I hit 80-90, it starts spawning 42-62 ( max lvl ghouls ).
---
Same issue here, so far I didn't find any solution. Right now straggling with the support...
---
I was just curious, because they’re in my stash. You’d think they’d be trying to tackle it but clearly they’re doing not much
---
They are a very rare drop from events in the savage divide you cant buy them from npc venders
---
Heavys are better 100% you don't need pa. But I would recommend it. Without pa you are losing about a 25% damage bounse as well as a very good accuracy buff from stabilzed
---
Forest or urban because I saw an urban in the vendor this morning
---
Sounds like you aren’t ready for a nuke zone fight if you have three weapons break and no repair kits to repair them.
---
FWIW I had the same thing happen with the wendigo colossus yesterday as I was in a hazmat suit and therefore over encumbered.
---
Had to respawn at vault 76, change back into my normal armour, fast travel to my camp near the grove, change back into a hazmat suit then go kill the thing again...
---
Its a REALLY chill game to play solo even with full servers.  
---
Jump right in.  You totally won't hinder or hurt anyone's experience, and in the 500+ hours I've played I've never been griefed.
---
If you're on PC let me know.  👍
---
Some more of what?
---
People drop at most a few or dozen plans, not hundreds.
---
This sounds a lot more like it was from a duper.
---
Am I in the Travis-loving minority? I thought his awkwardness was hilarious.   
---
I was sad when I accidentally converted him into suave Travis.
---
In my entire lifetime of playing MMORPGs, only Fo76 managed to piss me off with the cap on currencies and, by extension, cap on currencies earned daily. 
---
This cap isn't satisfying to see at all, period. 
---
I used to have issues getting enough thousands of some games' currencies to purchase anything, without a cap of any sort, but I'm happy that I can keep playing the game to my heart's content, earning the currencies with as much effort I put in, and finally buy whatever I want when I have enough. 
---
But here, in Fo76, I feel like I just *can't* keep playing Fo76 forever and that I legitimately have to wait to feel satisfied. I don't like waiting, it just feel horrendous, knowing I'm missing out all because of how much I can earn a day. 
---
I wouldn't mind if a daily quest has to be daily, just don't make currencies earned have a daily cap. It dulls the game so hard.
---
+50 limb damage is a magic effect on shotguns when using VATs, so yes you should be using VATs all the time if you want to take full advantage of the guns damage output. Assuming it's a max level shotty, you should expect to one shot anything the size of a Deathclaw or smaller, no matter where you target. For bigger/tougher, enemies, you have to experiment with their weak spots. If you can't one-shot them, then try the legs, that's always a safe bet.
---
I have a glitch in the Rusty Pick where the Purveyor consistently gives me exactly what I don't want.
---
Jesus I wish this happened to me. I’m lvl 34 and it’s an absolute GRIND to get to where I have so far. I got so frustrated with high level players being all over the map (not their fault) that every time I go someplace that’s been occupied, I get a level 60 ghoul horde beat me to death with their bare hands.
---
Where the hell do I get better armor other than a 1 Star legendary chest piece I got at lvl 7? 
---
On the bright side, I finally got the excavator armor so that might actually get me some defense!
---
This is entirely a you problem.
---
I was vending machine shopping and landed at someone's camp when I saw their collectron bot station. I proceeded to steel 2 dozen items (you know, that glorious feeling of having to hit "E" repeatedly while the list still goes and goes from the container) out of their unlocked container while they worked on their power armor within viewing distance. I walked up to their vending machine and purchased a treasure map (I have started to collect them so I can farm them in the future) and then I hear the familiar sound of an emote. I turn around and the player dropped a bag with 20 more random treasure maps for FREE. Worst, best experience after just robbing them blind, I am rewarded with free stuff from them. Lol. I love this game and the people.
---
I should add that limb damage is most effective when paired with the Enforcer perk, so that you can cripple limbs. but again, this really only applies to larger or otherwise tough enemies as you'll likely one-shot everything else.
---
Some people are hoarding stuff, you should have seen my old mule for plans I was going to use for my alts... that was some hot stuff mess. I was forced to drop them in other to make another toon to play from scratch. I kept the weapons and recipes. Rest I dumped.
---
She is very saccharine. Very, very, very.   
---
I was hoping for something funnier.   
---
The traditional FO humour has been a bit lacking in 76 :\\
---
Glad it's not just me! I've just got some armour and plans in mine just now, I have 2 misc items. Cant figure what they are. I do have a couple recipes, not Delbert recipes just random food ones. 
---
I did check the vendors with my husbands account and there isn't anything amiss, nothing for sale that shouldn't be, so that's good. I'm guessing a visual thing or perhaps recipes are now classed as misc.
---
There were 3 to 4 for each armour and weapon plan and like 20 for each camp item, it probably added up to 100-200
---
From the makers of "Run Errands on a Horse" comes "Micromanagement 76!"
---
Unrelated but how is no mans sky if I don’t have friends and enjoy fo76 solo?
---
Yeah if they detect they're dups  they might ban your account especially after all the dupe glitches that came out after wastelanders, they even emphasized to repot players you see attempting or doing glitches so you can tell they're trying to get strict,  who knows if they did but I've purchased atomic shop items and don't want to risk it all over items
---
Gotta wait until the event is over, then launch.
---
no we don't
---
Not saying I disagree with the idea, but the cryolator freezes at a temperature lethal to humans and animals
---
I literally just block my vendors off when I hit max
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
i had an alt **specifically** for holding copies of plans at one point before i gave away what i could before dumping them at whitepring station. i had over **600** plans. plans arent hard to horde, and can be bought very cheap.
---
ffs op thought they might have been for the purveyor inventory, and doesnt even know that you can stash items in containers, i doubt there even were "hundreds". people exaggerate shit when they are surprised by something novel.
---
I leave stuff  there and in white springs station all the time, nothing duped, just stuff I collect and don’t need.
---
Not necessarily dupers. I don't mess with duped crap, and drop 20-100 plans on low level players quite a bit. Just hoard them till I find someone to use them. Probably still have 500 plans across 4 tunes.
---
I run exactly that. A shotgun/single fire build. Your legendary guns matter more important than your perk load out. Opening up melee too is where you've got an issue. Once you take strength for melee you lose shotgun damage.
---
Not really.. But if you have stacks of hundreds of the same thing it's pretty obvious that they were.
---
Most of it wasn’t high value stuff to be fair, some of the weapon plans were decent but it was mostly plans for mounted creatures and armor mods
---
If its just about xp, do you already use full bloodied with unyielding and all intelligence booster? Max xp per kill is 4k ✌🏻
---
I have about 15,000 5mm rounds. There are unsellable at 1 cap each. I used to use a Furious Explosive Minigun for crowd control. While I've moved on, I CANNOT stop collecting all 5mm I find. Help...
---
I was a water begger for a couple months in early 2019. But back then we aint have muchuva choice
---
Theres a lot of Easter eggs and caps/weapons stashes and stuff hidden in marsupial/jetpack only accessible areas (unless you're just a god at building climbing)
---
I never once thought of this.
---
I just placed my camp down near fissure site prime and left it there.
---
U can do it 3 times in a row after completing one after another then server hop unless u feel like waiting 4 hours for the silos to reset
---
That came from Xmas presents. People open a bunch, then dump the extra plans and such. I wouldn't worry about getting banned, or even the imaginary moral issue that these try hards have about “dUpEd” stuff, none of it is valuable now, which was kind of the point.
---
I'm running this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e5b&amp;d=sb2s01sq2s31sr1s22p72e00eh1c72cr0ic4s12ip2id2a70s72a00lb2l71ls2lu2&amp;m=051c29fe3d&amp;ad=017a8
---
I'm a hoarder so I can pick up anything. Food lasts forever, especially grilled radstag (+20 carry for 30min) and the pepperoni rolls (+30 carry for 1h). It also weights nothing, so I have lots of Rad-Ant lager (+50 carry for 1 minute so I can fast travel to my camp when overencoumbered). I'm also running in Excavator with calibrated shocks and core assembly (for a good AP regen in PA - biggest weakness). 
---
I'm also running with whatever rads I'm at until around 40-50%, then I'll take a Radway.
---
I use a Junkie's gatling gun, minigun, a gauss minigun, a .50 cal, gatling laser and plasma - however I feel at the moment and what's the situation! Also have 10s of both fusion and plasma cores on me all the time, 10000s of 5mm rounds, 5k of 2mm and .50 rounds. And still have 200+ free carry to just play, pickup and scrap or sell. And everything melts :)
---
Yup.
---
What!!?!! No way!! I have 19 intelligence with my full unyielding set. What other boosters can I use because the most I get is 220xp :’(
---
They dont individually track items, meaning if a duper drops you 10 bobble heads, you wont get banned. What they look for is people acquiring large amounts (like in excess of 5k or 10k+) over a very short period of time.
---
Good luck, we’re apparently the meth heads of the 76 community.
---
People who whine and complain about why not people showing up to others nuke. If you want other people to show up why don't you fucking learn how to put it.  
---
Is there anywhere in the game says when u/Steve_Thing nuke somewhere all of the player in the game must go to help. If I saw someone nuke where I will die without carrying 200 radaway and using them every second .you can try to kill it by yourself and fail like this
---
That's a goofy snallygaster
---
I saw a workaround in other fo76 post.
---
Put your collectibles on sale into designated shop with 30k price and they won't get scrapped.
---
I've done over a dozen nuke zone fights with zero problems. Like I said it was me and one other guy trying to kill a wendigo colossus. That shit isn't a cakewalk
---
This is brilliant!
---
So the game being a broken piece of shit is my fault? Cool I work at bethesda now
---
I really miss the glass warehouse wall pieces from Fallout 4.
---
So it would only need a tiny percentage of its capabilities or power for it to be effective enough to stop food from spoiling :)
---
I do know how to put it thanks. Been in this game since day 1 so i know the cranberry bog pretty well
---
😂😂Worth a try. Pve builds will always be salty but it’s part of the game. They should try to do something with it, it’s badddd.
---
count me in too! i got plenty of crops and fertilizer!
---
You can’t sell inert flux sadly. I have like 200 of it and it never shows on the vendor for me.
---
I had the same issue today, nuked whitesprings and was killing ghouls and a few of them just sat there and just absorbed bullets and didn't die. Bar would just bounce back, I use the handmade rifle.
---
I wish some event linked to Foundation or Crater that can help with reputation
---
Pretty sure yes
---
Yes they can. They can't destroy anything
---
For faster silo runs, look up the “Zetan shortcut”.
---
There’s a piece of ceiling missing and you can jump up and take a faster route.  Been this way for many (many) patches.
---
Angryturtle has a video on it.
---
Yeah, I remember when you could just start destroying someones camp. Those were the good days
---
Thanks :)
---
Compared to any fallout this is the best we are spoiled
---
My insitagting shotgun one shots lv 52 cournal gutsys and lv 46 assaultrons
---
I had my heart melt by the 2 bears rescuing a 3rd floating on the with a pickaxe. You find them in the glass cave or whatever it's called where the BoS had that big fight.
---
Relax lol it has a lot of potential and understandably so, at launch, and still today there are issues with everything involving the game and development but its at the point where it seems nobody is trying, y'know? Maybe this will inspire. Hopefully.
---
I mean it’s not that i don’t want to use stealth it’s just that i thought energy weapons weren’t able to be silenced
---
Good idea
---
Especially since the vendors get their 10% cut from every sale.  It would make sense that extra caps can be stored with the vendor.
---
I didn't like him and get guitar girl - she's giving me quests everyday.
---
IAM there lieutenant join our sub reddit for recovery of America r/We are the enclave
---
They do not spawn at the box, but they spawn at a position relative to where it currently is.  Rotating it and repositioning it will move the spawn points around.
---
If you saw an urban scout mask in a vendor earlier I really hope you picked it up. I sold one for 20k caps last week. Both are really rare drops now
---
I have an extra deathclaw mask, had it in my vending for 5k until I read this thread- lol
---
R.I.P to destroying camps of the melee builds that one swipe the legendary so nobody could loot.
---
Discord is an app. It is commonly used among gaming communities to discuss things and hold huge voice chats. I don’t know if there in an official one for 76, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there was
---
I get you’re movement I loved NV Fallout 4 was great 3 Was amazing as well the game has got lighter was a lot more grime in the day and has focused more on grinding and using that to replace story who
---
Knows I miss when companies cared about the story
---
Hey, well if you're interested message me. Username is the same here as in the game... coincidence actually.
---
I have some anxiety issues of my own, I do have limited time to play and I am from Australia but been meaning to get more into the social side of gaming again as my original group just don't have the time anymore.  
---
If you're PC that is
---
Now pvp is a jumping contest using a tesla, or a legacy weapon. Battle royale is fun but adventure mode pvp could be much better
---
I love how the community for Fallout 76 is so wholesome and inviting! I haven't been able to play much at the moment, but if you want to shoot me a friend request (I play on PC; QuantumJay), feel free to do so! :D
---
Here is the Discord channel from this subs sidebar: https://discord.com/invite/falloutreddit
---
No I'm in the mountain range, in the area between *Top of the World* and  marshlands
---
Which vendor?  The Enclave at WhiteSprings?  I keep checking and I never see it.  There is a Vault 94 Scout mask plan that you can get from one of the factions for gold bullion.  But it has strangler heart vines on it and doesn't look as good as the base mask.
---
My first and only Scout Mask drop came from the enclave event in Harpers Ferry.  I can't count how many people wanted to trade me for it.  I then accidentally scrapped it (this was before being able to rename items).  I kept whining about missing it until one of our crew found one for me.  Haven't seen another since.
---
They are definitely hard to come by.
---
Should have grabbed it. You can change any Urban armor over to Forest and vice versa with the armor bench. It doesn't change the name but you can change the paint jobs.
---
Actually the hacked PA displays didnt work at all, and the hacked mannequins constantly duped anything in them, so they probably arent in a super releasable state. I wouldnt be surprised if we do see them eventually though.
---
In my experience, for no stealth a pa is better than any armor set I have ran( authough dodgy and blocker wasn't on that character) but still a full set of sentinel armor seemed weaker than a full escavator pa with emergency protocols
---
Yeah it was whitespring vendor didn’t know urban was rare last time I played was in October
---
The gold, or animated, perk cards count separately from the normal ones. So you can tech get two of every card, normal and animated. If you get a second animated one then it will scrap for like 5 times that of a normal dupe card.
---
Shoot I would of grabbed it if I knew that plus I guess they are rare now
---
Shotguns don't have range, but my God they are in a great place now( have to use vats though) I can one shot assaultrons and lv 52 cornel gutsys
---
[you got it](https://imgur.com/a/tOMGTAO)
---
Basically more perk space at the cost of caps....
---
[yes](https://imgur.com/a/jl7sid2)
---
Yes. Google is also nice.
---
Oh very nice. Thanks for the Swift information.
---
But you get something every month! The private server, unlimited junk, and the tent. Oh yeah and you get atoms!
---
That’s correct. It’s their major downfall. I see where you were going with it.
---
The rubberbanding is a glitched effect doing way more damage than it is meant to, but the server compensating for that and dealing the correct damage. Vatsing ignores that server check though
---
Yea it sucks ass, which is sad because it’s all that really keeps me playing. The new content is so slow to come out, and everything is such a dumb ass grind, the game itself is ungodly boring once you reach a certain point. I love those random battles with people I don’t know, but it’s becoming harder and harder to find a fight. Most players are salty as fuck, and salt mining is entertaining, but I’d rather find cool folks who don’t mind a friendly battle. It’s bad when collecting hate mail is more fun than actually playing the game.
---
Unfortunately, they would probably have to start the game over from scratch to fix its bug. It’s been 18 months and the game is still riddled with bugs and when some get taken out, others are added in. We are most likely going to just have to manage and work around them for the rest of the games cycle.
---
I did but I couldnt find a direct answer. Thank you.
---
Turn power patcher into batteries included. Take 2 ranks of tenderiser and invest in fire proof
---
I once caught them in the middle of Foundation.
---
Go to the amusement park car park (bottom left) then go the left portapotty, open the door, take the nuka cola cup &amp; straw from the teddy &amp; see what happens. It's hilarious.
---
Yeah, I’m actually thrilled that legendary perks were pushed back.  The perks and system for upgrading them were pretty terrible.  I’m glad that PTS feedback was acknowledged instead of just releasing something that was overwhelmingly disliked.  I just hope it doesn’t take them another year to rework it.
---

---
3 seconds
---
Screw u this is what this subreddit is for
---
Agreed.  Stash your junk and take the leap. You just might win especially these days when the hardcore crowd is in hibernation
---
50xp i think.
---
launch them if you have them, but you dont need to farm them to level up. you'll get more buy placing in top 10 and killing as many creatures as you can.
---
The answer the op’s original question, is yes, you can side with foundation and still do the raider stuff, also, keep doing both quests until faced with “siding with” whatever faction u want
---
It's also a Jukebox, they could also let you change between both.
---
Yeah it's driving me bananas. It didn't happen today though, maybe a hot fix?
---
Umm... the whole subreddit is but one of a few avenues you have for reporting bugs. There's the subreddit, the official forums, the official PTS forums, the support page on the official forums as well as official social media accounts like on Twitter.
---
Yeah, Bethesda not short on bug reporting/feedback options. Any of those will do.
---
I named examples that resemble existing perks, sure. A gap closer, and energy bursts are not though. 
---
If you have any ideas that do not resemble perks, then it will not be "basic" at all.
---
I was always raised to look for answers before asking. Must be a generational thing. This question is also asked several times a day
---
Not necessarily. It's a Bethesda game, no? Of course there will be legacy bugs, optimization issues, etc etc but there are huge bugs and things that can get ironed out to improve the user experience and maybe lowering distance rendering on console to start lol
---
What platform are you on
---
Yeah but this is quick and easy, getting help from others is fine, don’t sort by new if u don’t want to help then
---
*Can I offer you a Radtoad egg in these trying times?*
---
Yea I was doing that anyways just for xp but now im doing it for the rep also.
---
That really sucks. Given the bugs with the camp where you can't ever remove stairs without having to relocate your camp, that's a backdoor way to grief someone.
---
Why can't public teams just be functional i.e. you join up to complete events or farm legendaries. If you want to do the whole camp building thing, you can just normal team up like we already can.
---
Yes you can , would suggest you get both factions to the point of deciding to do the raid first, this will give you the most reputation and rewards up front, and make grinding raiders reputation to ally a bit easier later.
---
I have at least 6 photos of Samuel in his underwear
---
I absolutely agree. PvP should be fixed such that there is zero chance that you can be pulled into it without you consenting to it. 
---
If you're willing participants, go for your life. If you're not, you should never be affected by PvP ever. Well, except for maybe a few cases like workshops but even then there is room for improvement to make it crystal clear what someone is getting themselves into.
---
we did it leddit hurr
---
I saw one and it glitched into the Overseer's home and attacked Davenport.
---
The Companions also open doors without closing them.
---
It's not that they are short on feedback options it's that they don't give a fuck about randos tweeting about how shit the game is with a clip of the game breaking. That's not constructive and does nothing. If enough people chime on or this movement gains traction, they will be forced to see there's a strong commitment from the player base to see the game succeed and thrive but it has to be right. Nothing available to any of us now has worked so now I'll try something different. Thanks for your reply though.
---
It's what you prefer.i have my build down to a science (3 characters with 1000 hours) armor build or pa builds need different perks to be just as effective. I love the ability to be able to go anywhere nuke zone or not in my pa character and not have to change anything at all. I also like being able to not have to rely on vats or sneak to do my damage. To each is own but I feel pa is superior to reg armor
---
I mean im max strength and perception and use pretty much anything i like but again i have decent bloodied weapons and full unyielding so that might just be carrying me
---
Awkward Travis for life, brother.
---
The mounted creature plans came from the Xmas event and gifts.  
---
Not long ago there was a dup glitch and a lot of players went to town duplicating leftover christmas gifts.  Bethesda stopped the gifts from dropping script, but they still dropped mounted animal plans and caps.  So people had a ton of plans which, once you added them up, weighed a lot. 
---
I had been away from the game during this time doing work on the house and only came back to the game just before Fasnaucht.  But even then I was seeing people dropping the mounted plans all over the place, which is when I found out about it.
---
So, it's possible that the mounted plans came from dupes but there are so many out there that I wouldn't worry.  The weapons and armour plans should be fine.  They are typically found around the wasteland and from event drops.
---
Well, yeah, my build is similar - I figured non-automatic perks apply to non-auto shotgun and I got loads of shells rusting in storage so why not.
---
Shotgun backstab works pretty well.
---
Nobody should work for free, no matter what's the case. 
---
Now I will just start to wait for Liberty Prime to come and DESTROY me.
---
This happened to me a while back. Same thing. Had my tent there to mark my spot, moved it to place camp, and couldn't due to "overlapping existing build area." Waited a few days, went back to area, and was able to place my tent. Today, same thing happened when I tried to move my camp to another area I scouted and placed my tent to mark. After reading your post, clearly there it's an issue created by a delay between despawning your tent and placing your camp. Almost like a cool down. I'm going to wait a day or two and hope it clears up. Fingers crossed. Did your issue ever resolve?
---
I only got one RW Broadsider. The rest just comes down to dedication ;)

Just disable pvp for good. Nobody wants em. And ban pvpers. Half of them are either hackers or dupers. Besides, pvpers succck balls. You run into them during NW and you'll notice they are shit lol. How they are able to kill someone during adventure mode kinda proves how broken pvp is in this game
---
People will spawn several yards North of your "C.A.M.P.". Always north.

A lot of Sophias in shock collars or marine wetsuits
---
I personally scrap everything then bulk it all so I can easily see how much I have to sell off I also have 90% junk weight reduction so everything except the rare stuff (ballistic fiber, screws,..) is in my inventory. This means I have all the space in my stash that I'd ever need.
---
Personally I'd like to have at least a dedicated spot to drop off my junk instead of having it mixed with the normal stash, even if it would have limited capacity... But I don't want to give Beth too many ideas to do greedy shit.
---
Usually there actually under the map for some reason
---
Yeah, it almost feels like some parts of the development team put an insane amount of love and care into the game and the other just doesn't give a crap.
---
You don't need to, there's community.

And considering the fact that we assaulted a blood eagle camp, murdered several blood eagle leaders for him, and saved him from a gruesome death, we should NOT be paying 50 caps for a nuka cola
---
As a long time gamer (gaming since the early 90s) and mental health sufferer (depression and anxiety), i get where you're coming from.
---
Try not to let it bother you too much with FO76 though. There is very little griefing in this game, hardly any pvp (made even less if you enable pacifist mode), and as much or as little player interaction as you allow. You can play pretty much all of the game without needing any interaction from other players.  
---
However, if you branch out a bit and join other players for events, you'll get a lot more out of the game.
---
Feel free to add me on PC, name should be Ardaz. I tend to mostly play by myself but you're welcome to join any time if i'm around.

except the unequip on death bug, but that should be fixed in the next patch i heard

I read it as infinite weight glitch and clicked so fast. Disappointing
---
The power armor stacking has been around for along time not new
---
They do grow, or at least protect, Mothman eggs.  So, I'm guessing that the deity that they worship isn't the physical manifestation that you just killed.  
---
What I would like to see is once you kill a Mothman, 3 or 4 Vengeful Mothmans show up to seek revenge.  Then Mothman farming for Ballistic fiber would become a thing....
---
Haha Todd wouldn’t let an infinite weight glitch go past unnoticed because FO1st subscriptions will go down
---
I have heard about Enclave, but what does this Enlave do?
---
How come? I got a 3\* lever, tried it out and went back to my 3\* ap .50 hunting rifle ... got the impression that only the rate of fire was better.
---
Yeah I just figured out though I am a relatively new player and hopefully this helps someone out who didn’t know about it.
---
Yeah. That's what happens when posts get a lot of attention. Could be a single post gets a lot of upvotes. Could be the same post being made over and over. Could be something that gets a lot of attention from gaming news and youtubers. This already exists.
---
Basically you're creating a redundant system. Which is fine if that's what you want to spend your time on. I'd just ease up on the sanctimony that this is the start of some "movement". I'm pretty certain the CMs are well aware of the concerns of the playerbase without the need of a "movement" to be started. 
---
There are people already taking care of this dawg. However, you do you.
---
omg I'd love to get an ironic HOA fallout group going

Honestly OP , telling people to dump their Ammo , when the Ammo Converter is coming with the next Update is just plain dirty.

Ah okie

Yes i know how TS was nerfed and isn’t reliable if you rely on VATS. With explosive effects however and on heavy guns, it’s a different story. I have the AAE, TSE, JE and BE gatlings and have compared them myself. The new gauss mini has explosive effect built-in that’s why the TS version is very good, very powerful without penalties, unlike bloodied and junkies.
---
 have scrip'ed everything  I have ever gotten with " assassin" on it. wood armor to  handmade and fixers.

---
2 years and we got NPCs and some atom shop refreshes I don't think anybody in power really grasps the missed potential here. YouTubers don't do anything positive for the game regardless of the content made by this community. Change has to come another way and however that is, from reddit, Twitter, etc trying never hurt. Unless you work at Bethesda, I doubt you know their process lol.

Or stellaris, I’ll make exception to the planetary micromanagement there. Other than those two, count me out.

What I did (just maxed both sides) is just the dailies. I would pick crater for the photo daily and give them to crater mainly because raiders have an additional daily. I maxed them at the same time this way. Good luck.

Ok bud, good luck.
---
I think that they should keep the cap limit but raise it to 50K.  That would give a bit more buffer space for those who want to hold on to caps and it might move some of the mid to high end weapon sales from third party forums back to in-game trading.  Though, a lot of trading is done via 5.56 or .45 ammo rather than caps.
---
Are you asking for the plan or for someone to craft it for you? Because the plan is sold by Modus and most people will craft one for you just for materials cost, if that if you're lucky.
---
Oh my god the same thing happened to me the other day, so awful when somebody buys my thousands of 1 cap ammo and I don't get the full amount.
---
Plus, it only works on 15 items. Not 15 stacks, mind you. 15 INDIVIDUAL items. Frankly, it’s a waste of atoms.
---
Gun mutations? Are you talking about legendary effects? Or actual mutations?
---
If you ever have the means and inclination, the PC version is really nice at 100 fps, feels almost like playing Destiny sometimes
---
My GT is DragonRider4596, I'd be down for some 76
---
Wanting to buy one that’s crafted. I have the plans but I’m having trouble getting the materials to craft it.
---
Honestly I don’t understand why they used this worn out piece of shit engine when they had a perfectly good multiplayer engine that eso was built on
---
A lot of higher level players will sell the most common and useful mutation serums in their vendors from 200-450 caps a piece in my experience. Buying them from Modus is expensive and the recipes are pretty late game imo, so I'd just do some vendor hooping with your fingers crossed.
---
General knowledge would be nice. I'm looking for some legendary effects but I'm not too familiar with them either way
---
cant you get them from treasure maps too? would be weird if it's really only the msq quest as that would mean there will always be a deficit. then again Beth.....
---
I recently insta-vats-killed an observant radstag so quick i didn't realize he wasn't hostile, now I'm salty.

I love fallout pvp and I have 20 banner and 4K damage banner in apex legends. Just look up what that means and it proves your dumbass comment wrong. It’s not true aim battle it has to do with builds and strategy. Ur pea size brain is salty and can’t decipher between the two.

I launched a nuke on Whitespring few days ago with the hope of farming some glowing mass for flux, but the server was way too crowded and there were like 10+ people all gathering in Whitespring (3 in golf club) so I decided to wait for other people to finish farming (I can't sprint while wearing a PA) and I just went to player vendors around the map and shopped some items. 20 mins later, as I was ready to go back to Whitespring, I was disconnected from the server and it really sucked that I got nothing from the nuke I launched myself

I don't have a mic atm but plan on getting one soon. Let me know if you want my psn. I play with my son most of the time but he often abandons me for buddies.

I see posts like this a lot! It's funny because as someone who also experiences anxiety (I know everyone is different) I really love playing alone, but I get very anxious if I am actually alone in a world, or area in the game. 😂 I usually won't progress in small solo quests areas like caves and dungeons until I either work up the courage after days of stalling and doing literally anything else, or get a friend in the party chat with me to make me feel not totally alone. I think you are very brave for playing alone for so long :)
---
Yeah totally, you definitely make what you want out of F76 (and any game really for that matter).
---
I have had heaps of fun recently since wastelanders (~300hr); like you I have collected heaps of PA and outfits, tried a few different builds (loving Junkies atm), explored the map slowly - stopping to smell the roses, I have grinded events and farmed areas till my weapons where crimson with the blood of my enemies, I have traded and built countless camps.
---
There is definitely a limit to the current content and I get that some people find it is going stale quicker than others but I would disagree that it is only a handful of hours.

Yeah Tesla should be heavily nerfed in pvp, at legacies you have to slightly aim them. Shooting the ground and winning a fight shouldn’t be a thing.

of the countless people i've met online, i'd say only 10 of the 300 + players i've met and done events/missions with were deliberately mean. everybody is usually out there just doing their own thing and are happy to help others if they're low on supplies/need a hand with a mission. during the fastnacht even a couple years back we had the whole server working together to speedrun the event over and over and we even had people giving away free masks that they didnt need. hope you have a blast dude!

There a crap ton of songs in the public domain they could pay a one time fee to a developers teenager to cover and slap it in there that would fit. Cost them less then $100 and put the kids name in the credits. Slap that on your resume Alphonso.

And this is why bethesda can't fucking win.  When  the fridge first came out people whined that it was p2w and it's only saving grace against that argument was that it was 90% novelty and worse than what you could already accomplish with a perk.  Now people whine that it isn't ps2 enough and should be equal to or better than the fucking perk.

While the lever lacks the additional armor piercing, the hardened receiver is in fact on par in damage to the best 50 caliber receiver of the hunting rifle. Combined with the faster fire rate and more abundant ammo, it’s one of the preferred rifles for the endgame, especially because it handles itself better when detected.
---
Ultimately, the choice is yours to make, especially considering that the weapon is uncommonly found and needs to be scrapped several times to find the mods.

I  too have anxiety. But the game can be quite relaxing with you play alone and like to explore and stuff. What triggers my anxiety is PvP especifically. I just avoid it overall.

Ok, thanks for advice!
---
    scrapped several times to find the mods.
---
About that - I thought I'll go on a super-duper making-scrapping spree when I got all required perks, freeing up stash space as a bonus.
---
Because yes, one of the lever cons was a current lack of suppressor mod.
---
Me and one of my friends discovered this trick for the exact same reason. We made it up top and took some epic photos
---
Nice to have? Yes, all of them game breaking? No.
---
Nice Power Armor xD
---
There are few quests that doesn't require much interaction and still you can finish them successfully, i.e. Lode Baring - you have to just get inside and wait \~6 minutes. I've done Uranium Fever and Heart of the Swamp yesterday evening and get rewarded with Treasury notes after that. Best is to check amount of them before and after the event, not look at the rewards list, since sometimes it's the last position and it's not listed.
---
Yeah I was with a friend and asked him to drop me his power armour it was a pretty fun experience

You can drink it for the same benefit as purified water, plus a tiny disease resistant buff.  It also weighs less than purified water.

You’ve never done that? You’re missing out. Big time.

I’m also a teddy snapper. :) so glad I got the photo of teddy playing poker in Flatwoods before the update, as the dead body has since been removed.
---
The 10% melee buffing steaks also stack on top of each other.  It’s pretty nice.
---
Very much so. I just made my first alt, a curator whose primary mission is to establish a post-war Museum of Appalachia, and I'm already cringing at how much interesting junk I'm going to just lose - especially since for some reason whole items in your stash are pulled FIRST as materials even if you have lots of scrap.
---
Some stuff can only be crafted by buying mods like power X-01 Power Armor mods
---
You definitly can, private server is not needed.
---
Just the thought of people not doing this stuff normally confuses me
---
I dont understand why are you mostly blaming the game ( yes, the game has some serious problems ) but here, the problem is your expectation.

But wouldn’t it be as simple as customizing your ally?

Wow, what an apt description of the game!

I had a similar encounter as you did except instead of ammo he gave me a load of plans for usefull and useless items as well as a laser pistol that had awesome legendary boosts.

May I ask, did you convert your CAMP back from the contemporary house style for camp budget reasons? 
---
I thought that using that style would help to save budget, but it seems to do the opposite.
---
It depends. Not all "plans" can be learned by breaking down weapons. Some you need to either find or purchase.
---
If that’s true then why do people in Fo3 and Fo4 treat your pip boy like a unicorn
---
But for normal weapons and armor you can learn them by scraping. But it can take a long time to have ALL the mods. But note that Power Armor mod plans must be bought. You can NOT obtain them by scraping.

Honestly though. "playing with lots of people", is more a fear than a reality. like most of us just run around alone doing our thing, ignoring whoever else is closeby.
---
sometimes some people will do the wave or salute emote, you hear the emote and look around for who did it, and then salute/wave to them, then quickly cancel your emote and be on your way.
---
If you are playing in EU, almost nobody uses voice. I mean, to the point where you can go "hey where did the sheepsquatch die?" and nobody will answer you.
---
The only place you'll ever run into people is public events. And like other people said, just keep Pacifist on so you don't accidentally murderlize people and you will be more than fine. I believe in you!
---
And I mean this in the best of ways, I understand and can relate to your anxiety. F76 is chill though!

Good luck out there, vault dweller!

Its generally a problem with power armor
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XPEVOn8oDS0
---
Why cant it work similarly to placed power armor but without it being claimable by someone else or going into your inventory after one minute?
---
It literally isn’t
---
If power armor should have anything it should be the ability to walk over thorns without it bothering you. The amount of times I walk over those fucking things and look around thinking something is shooting me at range only to remember that I'm wearing a set of armor that make missiles seem like BB's but apparently not strong enough to stop your legs from getting fucking crippled when you walk on a god damn bush.

Sense? Maybe not. Damn I'd love me some Beach Boys ingame though!
---
Not a fan of either Travis tbh. But I preferred awkward Travis.
---
No, you messed up the things:
---
* Most weapons and armor can "teach" you mods upon scrapping, but there are some mods that can be learn only by "reading" the plans (usually, but not only some scopes and unusual receivers).
---
* Almost all weapons and armors require plans to learn if you want to craft them (non legendary versions), you won't learn plans to craft weapons or armor by scrapping that weapon or armor.
---
* some mods can be found in the wild as boxed mods, but 99,9% you won't learn that mod by scrapping mods, you'll just get few crafting mats
---
* there is Enclave Plasma Rifle/pistol that doesn't drop as legendary and won't reach you mods by scrapping - you can only get boxed mods as a reward from some events.
---
* Power armors pieces and mods are all learned from plans, only exceptions are colored lamps for some of them, that require boxed versions found in the wild. You won't learn anything by scrapping Power Armor pieces.
---
Notice how that’s not a Bethesda posted video, if it were part of the OST Bethesda would’ve posted it.[here’s  ](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)  the actual link you fraud.

Id say do it, but to stop the server hamsters from dying, make it so that you have to be lvl 50 and above, and can only have one.
---
I know, I know, WhY jUsT oNe, i WaNt tO DiSpLaY 35423 PA PiEcEs!!! one is better than not having anything at all. IF bethesda ever decide to up their servers then they can add more.

No, you can buy whole set of X-01 mods plans in Enclave Production Vendor, since many patches ago.

I have a pic of a Scorched with their arm around me, as they are standing glitched into a pole.

&gt; Eventually you're going to have to use power armor, especially if you're trying to complete the main quest lines.

That's not true at all.

You can do the main quests just perfectly fine as a sneaky snake. Some decent legendary armor and some decent legendary weapons.

RW is definitely a go for me, just wanted to know how much should I invest in finding a perfect shishkebab. But it seems that there is no clear opinion on this, because people say contradicting statements, so it's not that obvious, I guess it's up to testing this myself as well.
---
Honestly i just posted on reddit countless times can someone help me XP grind! I invite them to a team and then basically with the level 60 enemies you shoot them first but let the higher levelled player finish them off (because of the weapons they have) and you still get the XP. (higher levelled enemies give more XP and its so much fun) Also excavator armour took me ages to get so well done!
---
&gt; I think it does but don’t quote me on it

A grenade launcher works better for "accuracy" since its a bit of an awkward spot to lob a grenade by hand. Shouldnt be too hard to pick one up off an enemy

A nuke key card, and nuke codes

Thats just evil, to be honest
---
He wants a new paint job ha ha Great photo!
---
Many people are complaining about the limit for a while. Do you really think they are going to do something about it
---
It does have very good stats, one of the best armors in the game.  Calibrated shocks become very important later on when you are trying to carry a whole arsenal of weapons and ammo though, and especially with losing legendary armor effects inside PA it can hurt.  I have much higher carry weight and a lower current weight in regular armor than in PA.  I've always wanted to use my ultracite but just can't get that mod I need.
---
The only way to get mod plans is from them dropping from the scorch beast queen.  Particular mods have a really low drop rate though.  Based on the number of improved repair kits I have, I have done the queen somewhere between 200 to 300 times and still haven't gotten them.  It's all luck, or willingness to trade/pay someone else to mod it.  Ultracite has high DR, x01 has high ER, t51b has high both combined (exactly 1 more of each than the previous 2)
---
Comleted enclave quest line and some ammo/stims
---
This would be great, stuff not on the radio that only the Juke can play! I'd go searching for that!
---
Don’t forget a large amount of ammo.
---
That first handmade looks nice
---
I mean they have before, so
---
My idea is simpler - just accept caps up to caps limit then block the ability to buy anything, similar like robot vendor works (with information vendor can't accept more caps). If the transaction caused the limit to be exceeded, a message would appear similarly as with robot vendors.
---
Im a woman in my 50s and fairly recent only just started partaking in SBQ events and Im having a ball standing shoulder to shoulder with a bunch of randoms pouring bullets into her while everything roars around me. Its a bit of a rush. It took me quite a while to feel confident taking on the tougher areas too but I can tell you once you try and feel some success there will be no stopping you. I was terrified of my first scorchbeast. Now I light them up. havent run into a Wendigo Colossus yet. Thats probably my last mountain to climb in the game as far as fear goes
---
I’m having the same issue. Even if you jump to a private server then back a public sever, it will still put me in the same public server as before.
---
Oh i must have never noticed
---
Is it though? Do you want to see it spammed with caps sellers and trade requests, are you ready for that?
---
What will you do? Will you stand around at foundation or crater messaging each other?
---
Maybe an option to leave messages on terminals at peoples campus would be nice but not text chat
---
Yes, sometimes I loot items to check on display cases and I'm too used to scrap stuff... and then there it goes, gone lol That would be a nice useful feature.
---
Contrary to popular belief the questline is not needed so as long as you get to the door while its opened from another player
---
Mmhm. Used to be only 25k.
---
That's been back in loads of times hasn't it? It's in one of the bundles
---
You can craft legendaries?
---
Oh ok
---
Yea they want you to buy atoms hence the time pressure, can't blame em they want money... But like people have said be patient and it'll come back on sale anyway. Everything has done at this point.

That's kinda fine tho.
---
You might need to do some minor modifications. My first char was rifle/shotgun. Over time I put more points into rifleman-specific perks.
---
I'd still rock the Enforcer and have three shotgun perk cards equipped, with one point in each. More than enough to cripple anything that comes unexpectedly rushing you. Then one can use melee and cut their heads off.
---
 [This was the gist of it](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3a14173&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl0sd0so0sp0as2c72lt2a72a00)
---
Could run anything, cripple where needed, add other perks depending on flavor of playstyle.
---
Also, instead of hunting rifle, maybe try out lever gun? and then pray to get some decent legendary over time.
---
Finally, if you're on PC let me know if you need some help to get your camp back up and running! :)
---
Damage... obviously
---
In the end game it takes 60 seconds, 
---
equip super duper, make 3 serums, equip hard bargain, sell serums. With hard bargain and 6 in charisma you get around 1250 caps for 3 serums.
---
There is plenty of weapons around and this would pretty much ruin the feeling you get when you loot something awesome as you level up.
---
It could just be added as a section in the pip boy or something or if not you could just block whoever is soamming unless your the one spamming trade requests. Are you going to harass people just to get some item out of your inventory? Are you?
---
Hornwright site 3 is chock full of iron ore, it complements Lucky Hole Mine very well.
---
And before that, 20k.
---
No I mean what is all the Junk I need If￼
---
I suppose it boils down to a few things.
---
The damage is insane, up to 95% extra.
---
Synergy with nerd rage, emergency protocols, adrenal reaction.
---
When you add, blocker, dodgy, lone wanderer, serendipity it becomes very tanky. Fire dot is your biggest fear, 1 shots are rare.
---
If you dont use some of the damage mitigation perks it adds a level of tension that other builds dont have. I died about once a week playing junkie, now I die about two or three times a day. It's refreshing.
---
With Unyielding/Bolstering armor there are no so many cases where you actually get one-shotted in PvE. 
---
It also depends if you run with 5% HP or 20-25% HP of course. If you are a purist and run &lt; 5% HP it will of course be a bit harder.
---
It's fun indeed. Even better if everyone is low level,like 30-40
---
Yea I definitely want some more interesting displays, I'd really like a workshop bench with display slots on it. Something you could place near your workbenches and display a mini nuke or some of the electronic items? God tier display would just be an ashtray that works as a single display slot that you can place anywhere!

That’s what quickly bounced me off of fantasy star online 2 I loved the combat but every time I went back to the ship it was 20 minutes of inventory management and another 10 reading through all the info just dumped on me I made it to about lvl 40 before I just couldn’t find the fun anymore. 
---
I’ve stuck way longer with fallout (lvl 151) but have had so many walls put up it’s hard to continue I mean f**k even here you have to manage levels as a resource and for some reason it’s the only one without a cap, it’s just so backwards and hard to recommend to people as much as I’ve enjoyed it and especially it’s community, but the community just continually agrees on things we want changed and the comradery comes from never getting it

Haven’t played for a bit due to it feeling like a job - and a shitty one at that - so could so win ole lease explain what the OP means by ‘ I definitely went over’.

If the mask was in a vendor, that's because someone else who didn't know or care about its rarity and value sold it to that vendor. There's no point in vendor hopping for those things.

---
Well the songs arent hundreds of years old yet
---
I don't die in one shot. Some peeps bloodied builds are really bad
---
The reputation system is honestly the dumbest thing about this game. You have to repeat the same quests so many times.
---
instigating is a bugged effect with fast firing weapons generally and as well with shotguns using vats.
---
continuous fire or bodypart shot on close range using vats does more damage than it should.
---
if you shoot in 3rd person view the gauss sg should also have a faster fire rate than it should.
---
Is there a bunch of ballistic fiber? What's the big time?
---
If it is part of the pip boy then you could just avoid that part of it altogether.
---
Well if you also kill everything in one shot it kinda makes you untouchable. If you have the correct armor and perks, you can still be hard to kill even if you have low health
---
Hey just thought I'd mention since this post I haven't had a single auto complete by going directly to the game before checking the shop ☺️👍
---
Badass! Have you tried a stealth ninja melee build? Totally worth it.
---
Allahu Akbar!
---
Yes please, especially the Overseer’s place.  Sitting through one load screen to jump right into another one, talk for 15 seconds, then loading again to fast travel makes me avoid Photo Opportunity 90% of the time.
---
Assuming you load in at your camp and fast travel to the photo locations, then give the pictures to Ward or Kitomi and come back to the Overseers house, there are 7 load screens involved in this quest.
---
Older mom here too. What platform are you on? If youre on xbox and want a pal let me know. I mostly just putz around and gather materials and do challenges and dailies.
---
Ohh yrah it better be country too!
---
I can definately get behind that idea at long as it stays off the hud
---
Sweet. Maybe next character i make could be a bloodied build
---
Hey dunno if you're still getting auto completes on the challenges but go straight to the game instead of checking the atomic shop first like the guy commented above. So far I've had zero auto completes doing this :)
---
She did a great job of aging and roughing it up a bit. Damn awesome. You have a great team there buddy. 3-D printing was just coming out when I had to stop working. You could get one, but it was like 10 grand. I could have bought a 4×8 C&amp;C router. In fact, my buddy did. 😂😂😂
---
It's the smell. Like copper mixed with despair.
---
"isn’t reliable if you rely on VATS" It actually hits in vats, unlike in hip fire where you will miss most shot at range.
---
"With explosive effects however and on heavy guns, it’s a different story" It doesn't matter what type of gun you use, it's the same increased damage number based on your weapon.
---
"very powerful without penalties" With heavy recoil and accuracy penalties.
---
Here is some numbers for you. Using 50 Cal as an example weapon, with all normal heavy gunner perks. Not using demolition expert as it doesn't make any sense to calculate it to every weapon.
---
BE with build necessities - Dam 338.38, Dps 3079.26, DR300 Dps 2002.53
---
JE with 5 addictions - Dam 163.78, Dps 1490.38, DR300 Dps 743.17
---
FE - Dam 158.32, Dps 1440.70, DR300 Dps 638.63
---
TSE - Dam 132.23,Dps 1203.25, DR300 Dps 554.79 
---
AE - Dam 109.19, Dps 993.59, DR300 Dps 550.46
---
Now compare the AE and TSE on high armor target, same'ish dps but AA doesn't have the huge accuracy and recoil penalty making it a way better weapon. If you wish to bring up non-boss gameplay then there will be more prefixes that are better than two shot.
---
And about penalties you brought up.. 
---
Bloodied heavy gunner when build right is the tankiest build in game. Junkies heavy will reduce couple completely irrelevant specials that have no impact on game play. 
---
Furious gets it's stack up under a second on fast fire rate weapons like heavy guns generally are.
---
Two Shot is, and will be the one of the worst prefixes in game. Just because you personally prefer to use it does not make it good, it is just what you personally like.
---
Make freezers reduce spoilage by 100%, but make them consume power or something.
---
I’ve said too much....
---
Food spawns in my crops and i have to get rid of them when i get to my camps or else my crops will have food on them. Same thing woth water and water purifiers
---
The spawn points (there are several) aren't generally AT the camp unit, but move in relation to it, i.e. if you move the camp unit x yards to the north, so do the spawn points. The most commonly used spawn point is to the north and slightly to the east of the camp unit. There are others to the north and slightly to the west, as well as to the southeast and southwest, in decreasing frequency of use, at least as far as my experience goes.
---
Stop selling is the most assured easy to fathom way of handling this.  It's brilliant.
---
Some sort of cap bank would be interesting - 30k is the carry limit. If you exceed that, your additional caps go to the bank.  When you are below 30k you can draw out more caps but you pay a withdrawal price.  This isn't a fully formed idea and I'm just riffing.  Ultimately - anything is better than losing an entire sale's caps.
---
This would be so frustrating as someone visiting your store. If i finally found something i wanted to buy after endless vendor hopping and got that message I'd be pissed off. It's up to the vendor to keep an eye on cap limits
---
- They can't kill you if they can't see you (with 40 agility you're pretty much invisible)
---
- Hardly ever have to manually aim thanks to the AP boost
---
- Don't have to grind for ammo all the time since each bullet does such high damage
---
- Extra carry weight without having to dedicate many perks to strength
---
- Feels more realistic that most everything including yourself dies from 1-3 bullets to the head
---
oh yes. with all my heart yes.
---
I roll a bloodied handmade and a bloodied lever with the Chinese Stealth Suit. I like the fact I have to be sneakier or faster than my enemies to survive. 
---
I do some stupid high damage numbers and can one shot all regular mobs and two/three shot the behemoth and mirelurk Queen.
---
Haven't heard they are but I was hoping so, i want my water wheel to spin again
---
Nope, never happened.
---
it depends of point view - for you it would frustrating, for vendor owner it'll be saving his items from being sold for 0 caps...
---
You must have not been playing for long or any game in this genre for that matter. End game content is PVP, every PVP feature has been rolled back. What type of end game content is there for a shooter? What do people expect? Bethesda to churn out a new story line every fucking month? If you dont like PVP you dont like these type of games, and thats why this game is fucked, it got hijacked by role players who would be better off playing a game like ESO, this game was a clone of RUST, how the fuck do you turn a game based off of RUST mechanics into something like ESO or even past Fallout games for that matter. The reason why the long time players are so pissed and jaded cause all of their end game gear became worth shit the day they introduced damage caps. There is no end game content in this genre, Fallout 76 actually is one of the few games in this genre with an actual story line. Games for reference RUST, DAYZ, now its obvious there trying to move more towards Generation Zero, 7 Days to Die, State of Decay, which are co-op survival games. End game in those games are horde killing. If you dont enjoy PVP or mindless horde killing these games are not for you. Horde killing games get old really fucking fast, hence why FO76 gets boring so fucking fast.
---
According to the data mining you can ONLY get Raider armor plans from that quest. You can get Raider Power Armor plans from the treasure maps.
---
You will need 30 circuitry and 45 steel to repair the damaged mainframe cores.
---
My GT is OrangJELO. Hit me up anytime you want to mess around in the wastelands
---
at least you have a magic shotgun, should be able to nearly one shot it in vats
---
huh? what is annoying?
---
How do you get past the elevator then?
---
(・ω・)b
---
Wow, a lot of good suggestions, and concerns. And it's great seeing so many giving feedback.
---
Thank you all for the feedback and keep making your voices heard... There's a ton of good suggestions!
---
why was this removed? O\_o
---
Bolstering/Vanguard pieces are a joke, especially with a set of SSA. They are one of the lowest tiers of effects for end game. One piece of each enemy specific armor (i.e. Troubleshooter, Zealots, ect.) reducing 15% of damage will offer you far better protection than 175 extra points of DR will. 
---
If you're going Bloodied than Unyielding is probably going to be the best choice in most cases, but if you're really looking to be tankier don't go the Bolstering route. It's one of the biggest traps in the game still, even though their effectiveness has been debunked forever ago.
---
No one beats three dog, but she could be an equal with some additional quality station breaks and more variety music wise. I’d be happy with the songs from the previous games even
---
https://gearsofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Ticker
---
This it?
---
Trade out power patcher for batteries included, remove 5 points from Intelligence as gun smith isn't necessary. Through two of those points into luck to get starched genes. Through the other 3 into Endurance and through on Max Fire proof.
---
One possible reason: if you are in an area with only a few active players at a time, it will put you on the same one over and over - because there is only one running. They use AWS as far as we know, and you are automatically routed to the closest server center.
---
Ah, you got the Ass-aultron model
---
Haha lol no just fucked like you
---
I haven't been playing MMOs since the 90s your right my bad.  Lots of other games have end game content, or more than 1 boss to fight over and over.
---
I've only had that happen once.
---
Neither of those are steaks or beer, disgusting.
---
If it is truly "mental torture" then you really should consider hanging it up and having a crack at something else.  Go back at play Fallout 4 in a different way than you have in the past, or use mods to enhance your experience if you still want to stay in the Wasteland.  If you're younger than the series itself go back even further and play New Vegas or one of the first two games.
---
When games are online these things are bound to happen.  Bethesda isn't charging anyone any money to play the game so as far as that goes our qualms with their services can only go so far.  
---
Every Fallout First subscriber on this sub can account to you the countless times they were in the middle of a mission on their private server when the game blue-screened and they got pushed back a couple of minutes and lost progress, or even worse, getting bluescreened while crafting weapons or armor while being low on supplies and loosing all that progress.
---
Bethesda knows how much we love them and for the most part I feel the community is pretty unforgiven.  Just think about all the hate this game had for it back when it first launched.  Somehow they manged to weather that storm and somewhere during that time one of the greatest communities for a game emerged.  
---
With all the downfalls that still exist and even those you mentioned, I feel it all comes out in the wash, this community makes up for all the times the bullshit happens.
---
We hope you don't get irritated with the game and stop playing.  More Fallout is better for everyone.  Don't get discouraged and if you happen to be on PlayStation maybe we can link up sometime and you can vent more and together maybe we can find you a better place to be.
---
Keep your head up, champ!
---
With resepct I disagree, I've done all the content in the game as a stealth rifleman, with ease most of time. All the quests, silos, nuke zones, PP, encryptid etc.
---
It does not increase attack speed, but your damage the lower your health is.
---
I just did some calculation to other discussion so i might as well link them here aswell. Just to show you how much the damage difference actually is. Using 50 Cal Machine Gun as an example weapon with commonly used perks. We were discussing explosive damage etc so the calculations will show that. But it doesn't change the differences.
---
 
---
Bloodied Explosive with build necessities - Dam 338.38, Dps 3079.26, DR300 Dps 2002.53
---
Junkies Explosive with 5 addictions - Dam 163.78, Dps 1490.38, DR300 Dps 743.17
---
Furious Explosive - Dam 158.32, Dps 1440.70, DR300 Dps 638.63
---
Anti Armor Explosive - Dam 109.19, Dps 993.59, DR300 Dps 550.46 
---
Two Shot Explosive - Dam 132.23,Dps 1203.25, DR300 Dps 554.79
---
Anti Armor is ranked higher as it does not have heavy accuracy and recoil penalties and does very similar damage on armored targets. Making it a better weapon.
---
When you build your bloodied character with right perks and top tier legendaries you will basicly be as tanky or tankier than full health characters. So the low health is not an issue. Unless you are very new to the game.
---
Can you please clarify #13? I've had scorchbeasts be reduced to ashes with my laser gatling and never finding them.
---
Regs gas it for sale for gold bullion in vault 79.
---
I would like a quest to start up a new or restart an old station or two that played different stuff. 1. Country/blue grass/swing. 2. A news reel / propaganda/ local 3. A commerical channel/soap opera/ comic book 4.   Farming radio during the day/ raider at night. 
---
Then pick which dj goes with each: A. Mister Sauve B. Loud Raidier C. Bored tired D. Sweet old lady E. Hates it.
---
Exmples: 4d-she reads the weather/chop reports and the latest blood eagle attact.

2A- mr sauve- reading reports about the taking of alaska, buy war bonds and the taylors halloween ball.
---
Also Blackeye let me give you your stupid shitty mirkelurk queen meat without me having to try to give it to you four times. I hate you and I will keep killing Bruiser because of your actions.
---
Ahh! I see what you mean now 😃 More hilarious with the Vault Boy cutout directly pointing at them 😆
---
Did not know this. Will definitely be trying it later.
---
Everyone has different views to the max caps issue.
---
1) Disable vendor if 30,000 caps reached, with a notification to owner and buyer. Possible.
---
2) Have reserve bank of caps. Not sure how this would work and in effect just raises the max limit.
---
3) Raise the caps limit. Then we would all be in the same dilemma once the new higher limit is reached. And market prices may also rise.
---
My personal view would be option 4.
---
4) Allow us to remotely disable our vendors from the menu anyway in game. You’re busy doing an event somewhere else on the map that you really don’t want to leave and see someone buying multiple items of yours every few seconds. Ch ching ch ching ch ching. Max caps approaching. 
---
I can’t see it happening, or whether there are coding issues with this, but it would be a nice feature IMO.
---
Hey man love is tough to find in the wastes!
---
Somewhat new to the game myself, I see the finger on the cut-out there.  Is that the one they just put up in the ATOM Shop or the one that I had from the start.  I was just curious because I thought the ones they added to the ATOM Shop recently were pretty cool but they didn't really show much in the preview.
---
That explains all the "headaches".
---
That's true; on my side I typically run a set of Unyielding armor; however in specific cases (such as Encryptid) i run Troubleshooters armor.
---
`Love-making subroutine successful.  Please back away now.`
---
Yeah, The Burrows was a weird "DLC". I never understood it's point. Not so long ago I went there again and it was still the same.
---
I hope they update it at some point.
---
I was just having a conversation with someone about these "type of songs" the other day.  I noticed a couple similar tracks in BioShock back in the day and the Mafia series seems to also be friendly to the same era of music and we were discussing is the infatuation for that era of music for no other reason other than licensing is probably a helluva lot easier to get clearance on?
---
tite
---
Hah, no!
---
This is a perfect oppertunity to introduce yet another currency. It will be called perk coin... no wait. Legendary coin! And if you scrip legendaries you get one perk coin, I mean legendary coin, and to level your weapon you need 1500 legendary coins.
---
Nailed it.
---
The pipe revolver is a great early game weapon, stick a long stock on it and you can use both gunslinger and rifleman perks for a massive 120% damage boost. With a silencer and a scope you get sneak attacks too so it's actually very powerful.
---
By far the most efficient way to do it.
---
You have to find the plan for them. Sometimes they're for sale at a player vendor.
---
I wonder if that will be the case really?
---
So hypothetically Uranium Fever will have lvl 50 mole miners? More posts about people killing the legendary incoming.
---
Hey, another sloth. Hi cousin
---
Remember Fisto...

I actually wonder what happened. Like, I'm happy there's new content, but it seems like they had an idea they halfway through they went "You know what Joe, let it go", it's weird...
---
Once i jumped and hovered with my jetpack to avoid these hell rats and one of them tunneled and came up in mid air to attack me , I EFFING hate mole rats
---
Definitely possible they were maxed out. In any regard, I am thankful.
---
You technically can disable it if you have a vandor room and a locked door and cut the power supply so that it doesnt show on the map.
---
from [Nukapedia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76#PvP)
---
&gt;Player versus player (PvP) combat does not become available until the player character is level 5. Player characters invite other characters to duel by attacking, though these attacks do not deal any damage. Before patch 7.5, they dealt nominal damage. If the player being attacked fires back, the damage being inflicted between the two players is regulated, but only if there is a large level gap between them. Players who are close to the same level inflict full damage with no restrictions. Player characters who are severely different in level have their damage placed on a curve with the higher level player doing less damage than they normally would at their level, while the lower level player does more.
---
&gt; If the opposing player responds but then dies, they can seek revenge. If they kill the initial instigating player, they receive double the rewards. Killers can collect any junk their target drops.
---
&gt; If a player continues to attack another player and that player has not responded, but eventually is killed by the instigating player, the player who did the killing has a bounty placed on their head. They receive no loot or experience for killing the opposing player. The now-hunted player is visible to all other players on the map, indicated by a red star. They also cannot see anybody else on the map. Killing the marked player results in higher-than-normal rewards.
---
Im stupid. I meant to write attack damage
---
I can run a silo in 15-16 minutes, no glitches.
---
Really isn't that big of a deal to launch a nuke, in my opinion anyway.
---
Gold Bullion in 79, huge grind though
---
Thank you for your comment but there is no information about workshop pvps in this text..
---
And your GPU?
---
My camp is parked right under Fort Defiance. The scorchbeasts of the event often stop attacking event participating players and go straight to my camp. I moved there because there is a lead deposit so i have a resource extractor pumping lead all the time (and lucky hole mine not too far as well). 
---
Camp's guarded with 9 heavy machinegun turrets and a missile turret. If something is badly damaged but not in need of repair yet, I just store it and relosition it for free heal. Only thing that bothers me is this method also stores attached items so in case of a wire connector i have to redo the wiring as well
---
My issue, everytime someone brings out how much the engine sucks, is that most of those QoL and small bugs issues have been fixed by amateur mods, sometimes for years.
---
I mean, it doesn't make sense that we are hindered by bugs from fuckin fallout 3 in fallout 76 when there's been mods to fix it literally a week after the game came out.
---
I am absolutely not asking the mods to work freely for Bethesda, and I definitely understand how hard it is to take dozen of small patches made by independant devs and include them in your real production-ready (haha) code base. 
---
But I believe a bunch of professionals hired by one of the biggest studio in the world should at least prove more efficient than a random bunch of nerds in their basement. (This is not an attack, I love nerds, I love basements).
---
When i dont have enough water to make enough beers i have to use purified water and the farm is for selling at a nearby vendor for fast travel money. Everyone knows that the true way to get food is to take over that one workshop for infinite never-spoiling salisbury steaks
---
/u/ApolloSky110 asked the question I've been unwilling to ask and /u/NukaColaChugger provides the best answer imaginable.  Thank you!
---
That’s more acid to have to farm though, might as well just clear BlackWater Mine and scrap all the weapons.
---
How would i be able to get my hands on a stealth suit?
---
Yeah but is it really realistic if you can take down a dragon with relative ease by yourself?
---
Your welcome
---
I also like watching people. Do you have any tips?
---
You solo'd Encryptid as a stealth rifleman?
---
I think 1 point tenderizer is enough.
---
 [This is how I would build it](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e5b&amp;d=id2ip2sr2s32cu0a04lu2s20sq2c72ic4lt2ls2s01pe2eh2s12l71sg2&amp;w=ih2if2&amp;m=c5f9&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=112534&amp;n=PA%2FHeavy%20Full%20Health%20)
---
Looks like you're getting plenty of offers, but if you fancy adding another name to your friend's list I'm Infernus_Joseph. I'd be happy to launch a nuke on your server and take you around whitesprings for some fast leveling, stocking up on legendaries and flux crafting. I run whitesprings with a mate fairly often and we have a pretty good system I'd enjoy sharing with you. Just grab a hazmat suit!
---
boils my piss
---
I then apologize, as I am new to the game.  I did not know there is an entirely separate mechanic for Workshop PVP and look forward to seeing the correct answer.  But seeing as how there is no mention of it on the Workshop page, I doubt there is.
---
If it ever puts on the sheepsquatch outfit... run.
---
Thats upsetting
---
No, not solo but I have completed the event plenty of times. Same with PP, I might try it solo one day, with stealth it's probably doable with the right prep beforehand. Might need to switch from a bloodied build first though.
---
If you want more detailed help pm me
---
I messaged the german support (service@de.playstation.com) and I received feedback from them. I had to submit the transaction number, so they could cancel the subscription for me.
---
I’m a stealth commando and had about 12 perk cards that I hadn’t packed, so I specked out an archer build with the intent of getting explosive arrows. It makes farming a lot of fun. I jacked up demolitions expert and have a lot of fun blowing up super mutants at Westuck.
---
See, this is why I stick to Settler Grandpa.
---
This is a great shout. It’s been known by the community for some time but a bit of signal boosting never hurts!
---
Use super duper too.
---
Enclave events or killing legendary enemies - if you want to do it the easy way, do horde events in the forrest area.
---
Its cause its rare, not many seem to have that plan.. I bought two helmets a while back cheap for 100 caps but i've never once seen the plan drop.
---
Finish the Wastelanders quest line and side with the Settlers, or rep grind with the Settlers and buy the plan for bullion.
---
I thought you learned the plan by scrapping one of them, maybe I'm thinking of a different helmet though.
---
I just completed this last night at level 20. Saw this thread while searching around did you look at these comments?

---
The worst part is that people are begging to PAY Bethesda. All the simple QOL changes, or features that should have existed from the start; people are begging to pay for them.
---
Console?
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol ,I somewhat agree with your ASSessment...
---
No but silly play of words aside ,I frequently use the photo mode . The game may look a bit outdated but to me the game enables me to create very pretty pictures of vistas and such ... I like it.
---
The only problem is on consoles the pictures you can save is woefully limited :( but oh well thats why we have capture gallery I suppose
---
Forrest and ash heap quests have a 1% chance for a drop. I keep hearing fly swatter is a good one for it, but have seen people saying any quest down there has that chance. 
---
No info on toxic valley. 
---
Or you can spent that 50k and hope someone will trade or sell. Good luck.
---
Some areas show down for me, but I'm also on like a gx960. Possible internet issues of it does matter how low you turn down the settings.
---
You're part of the reason this community is so great.
---
Yeah we really do need something to preserve food forever.
---
They're a plan, I have a few plans in my vendor
---
Maybe i've only got one left, if i scrap it and lose it i'll have none.
---
I'm super new so I could very well be ass-talking but isn't that mods only?
---
Nuekah cript
---
Do an ini files check, theres a useful guide by angryturtle, worked for me :)
---
RemindMe! 14 days "Did you find a Marine Tactical Helmet yet?"
---
That's fair, I wouldn't mind if there were some enemies that were tougher for bloodied build. It's not even relative ease, I can take down a level 80 legendary scorched beast in 2 seconds. High level mobs/hordes is a challenge though since bloodied has to be in stealth and have control of your surroundings all the time.
---
Yeah, serums show as Misc.
---
Ohh I can already see the capdupes with this method
---
Cool
---
Upvote for visability. Good luck!
---
I too search out teddies, my favourite was 'Mary Beary', teddies doing a cookery show in Clancy Manor which is sadly gone although still love the sloth being roasted on a spit by the gnomes on top of the Encryptid cabin😂
---
The last few dupes were vendor related. I can only imagine adding another cap-stash to your vendor will lead to bugs which will lead to exploits
---
If you attacked someone you could have had a bounty???
---
Oh ok.
---
You'll need full health to work as a pylon for all 3, and when solo i suggest carrying 200 stims just to be safe
---
I have a bunch of pictures of my toon sitting in the altogether in some questionable places (looking annoyed) with excavator pa leering at her.  And a fun picture of the time she lost her head but was still walking around.
---
But you would still need the code because having a super nuke button ready to launch without anything else needed is kinda op
---
That makes sense but WE are the ones that spends the money there right?
---
Yeah, will switch to junkies + vanguard or something and run it solo one day, need to farm some equipment first though.
---
Devs couldn't implement proper trading in the first place. You askin for too much
---
if im remembering right the 'Leader  of the pack'  event in the forest generates 4 legendary wolves at low levels,  3 wolf pack leaders and a wolf horde boss, fairly easy to do with map markers
---
From my time doing music, I kinda had the same convo. The only problem is the dicodomy of rock vs classical vs country. For an example, think of selective radio. We are given a oldies country station vs 80's vs current hits vs other. Big band is still seen as rock. Which we need more big band also.
---
I always question the "Beth can't" because we have a mod for FO4 with an entire malt shop radio station, and it's a mod. The mates aren't making tons of money, they are just distributing FTTP music.  Totally doable with the right songs. I really love that mod though. Thus, having three or five "new-ish songs", even if attached to a quest for our new DJ, might be nice!
---
Check the train car west of watoga station, it can be on the crates near the skeleton with the submachine gun. I got it there yesterday, it shares a pool with other marine armour so it's not guaranteed. The wiki says it only spawns at drop site c2, but that isn't true so try the other spawns as well.
---
It's because the Brotherhood of Steel is the best faction in the franchise,
---
*ASSUME THE POSITION*
---
No I can’t blame anyone. It’s a totally normal strategy. I get it. For some things in the shop it just feels like they were supposed to stay. 
---
I get how some skins can be limited. 
---
But it can’t be everything right?
---
It honestly depends, there isn't really a rule. Some weapons/armor/mods you can learn through scrapping. Some can only be learned from plans.
---
Yeah I know but the “limited” feeling disappears, for me at least, when it’s all of the items in the shop that circles. 
---
Nothing is more special than the other. 
---
I get how some skins can be limited. But nothing really stays for long imo.
---
Not required but level 3 lockpick and hacking REALLY helps!
---
Hell yeah, sloth gang
---
Put my C.A.M.P. in the southeast at the lake close to the bear on the map. Haven't had any enemy spawns there and it's been a week.
---
Angry turtle has a video about stealth and mentions that it does give a small bonus even with normal armour equipped.
---
ok will do.
---
I would gladly see that mate. 
---
Let’s go! XD
---
Np man. Hope you figure it out
---
Sorry, but i am not everyone and i just LIKE to use my little artillery to cause mayhem on the battlefield. especially the 40mm are very nice to have for certain occassions.
---
I can't feel my legs...
---
Hopefully the patch and maintenance today takes care of it. Last night and the night before were probably the glitchiest I’ve seen where I saw the health bars fluctuate particularly in the Mire and I even had dead scorch beast bodies falling onto me every few minutes while there.
---
You could also devote yourself to the holy and wise Mothman. He will grant you incredible power if you worship him in the nude for 700 in game hours.
---
Thanks for the reply.  I'm going to save your comment.  This damn sub is about as informative as Nukapedia and for that sir, I thank you!
---
*NUMBNESS WILL SUBSIDE IN SEVERAL MINUTES*
---
Well you only talk to her once a day and if she doesn't give the correct dialog you leave the conversation... Lol
---
99.9 percent of the time yes, that is the case.
---
Just act natural. Like if they catch you standing naked in their backyard fingering your belly button just throw out a friendly greeting and comment on the weather.
---
Fair point, unless someone can confirm I wouldn't scrap it either lol.
---
The union hats was even cheaper before and sold for same amount , but Bugthesds nerfed  the vendor price ofc :/
---
I'm still what the boys at work would call a "greenhorn" in regards to my time on 76, so what other ways might a low level 20 be able to do to generate caps?  I know the purified water method isn't too lucrative but I have six of them installed at my CAMP so that's x30 a crack when I empty those bad boys out but I'm all ears on any other suggestions!
---
Here's a better idea, raise cap limit - no need for fancy programming with intended bugs as a result...
---
Or find a cap sink...
---
you're not wrong lol.  currently the ps4 build is both hit or miss and goes in bugginess "waves"  for me.
---
yesterday, in several hours of playtime, my only bugs were a sentry bot dominator corpse derezzing before i could loot it in the bog by watoga and a headless, unkillable, inactive, but "living" ghoul at camp venture.  otherwise a very good day.
---
a few days ago i remember having the groups of enemies out of thin air problem, had quests being extremely wonky, insufferable lag in vendor menus, and multiple times got locked into a weapon for minutes on end, not being able pull up my quick wheel or unequiping the weapon registering in the pip boy.  just kinda had to chill out unto the weapon swap actually happened.
---
might have to do with server age, but who knows with this game.
---
How would i get the recipes? Selling them sounds nice
---
Oof sorry man
---
I’ve seen this maybe 5 times and every time it bugs out and doesn’t take me to anything
---
What's the bloodied damage without the correct build, so without nerd rage, adrenal etc? Eg like the other legendary effects.
---
I'm only 350 bullion away from the last pieve of T-65 but I just cba going to dull public events.
---
Think they've kinda done that with some items. They keep the main thing available but you lose the bonus pack item if you wait? I dunno we'll see if the new seasons thing works better for all this stuff.
---
I always dump plans  , too lazy to sell em in my vendor for 10 caps , i get the 10 caps faster with shooting a few enemies
---
I even buy the calibrated shocks mod for this PA ( this mod really need a buff,  +50 on one leg isn't enough)  but a good legendary armor is always better than PA. It's bad. 
---
Happy cake day ! :)
---
What patch?
---
Some sure. But it depends on how you have it made. Mine are behind 3 sets of walls, 2 are garage doors and wood window walls. When the shop is closed, the shop is closed. Unless your looking for a bounty.
---
Perhaps a bank account for each character with fees for everything including withdrawal of funds.
---
Also what it feels like when you face multiple super mutants with miniguns
---
This. It's pointless to buy a new limited time bundle right away since it will reemerge in couple months at 50-66% of its original price,
---
ok great! hopefully thats true. do you know if it is currently bugged because I dont know if I should drink the serum or not.
---
Hi there! I'm a 32 year old lady that usually plays solo because of anxiety issues as well. Feel free to add me, my ign is MellyRad. I am higher in level but still play like a noob so I think we can have fun!
---
treasure hunting outfits and hats work the same way, only better ;-P  they cost like 3 cloth and one oil lol.  been selling them at 25 caps each.  was doing 10, but too many people were wiping me out in one go.  tried 50, but it didn't seem enough people were buying sets.  25 seems juuuuust right lol.  still have some people buying every set i have, but have more people just buy a set or two and leaving the rest.
---
i'd imagine the marine armor helmet and the insurrectionist outfit/hat would be equally profitable.
---
been steadily selling the forbidden knowledge bos clothing items i get extra too.  they seem sell solidly as well.  go 15 for the science scribe outfit and 20 for the bomber jacket.
---
You mean all the cabins that are locked with scanners? Or all the rooms in the resort locked the same way?
---
The answer is you can't/don't been that way since beta. Maybe they will use the space in a future DLC.
---
They will burn in good time. Going to tame the SBQ first.
---
That's not really on Bethesda for this. You know there is a cap limit so once you reach that limit, pull the power on your vendor or spend your caps. It sucks yes but the cap limit is on because of the dupers and you need to keep track of your inventory.
---
I use it to take photos of base I've nuked or bombed
---
Lmao , never thought of that since i dont use PA  , but its fucking hilarious :D
---
its all ravioli anyways
---
As a beginner it's super easy to get yourself a decent start, the stimpacks and radaways are super useful as you level, also if you're still not max level, find yourself a decent melee weapon. Even with no melee perks and  I used one against garbage mobs like low level ghouls and scorched.
---
Pick up every thing. Sell everything. But also scrap weapons and armour for mods. Sell unwanted ammo in your vendor for 1c each. Not missiles or nukes though. Learn what things in the game are rare. Check enough vendors and you'll learn what stuff usually goes for 
---
Do events that have waves of enemies. make sure to tag as many mobs as possible. As you level making caps is easy. I had 29k caps the other night (max is 30k fyi) so I bought a serum recipe. I went down to 11k. I added some stuff to my vendor and went in the shower. 10 mins later o returned and  I'd sold 10k worth of ammo and stuff.
---
Press a button get a notification...
---
In before people push it and fast travel away everytime you show up.
---
I like the idea you are going for.
---
Yea man not even close to ture I'm only 91 (stealth cammando with stealth suit) and I easily solo wendigo colossus.  In fact after wastlanders PA has become almost useless
---
It does. Ive got 7 extra so far.. I know it sucks but its a really los chance
---
Are you on xbone?
---
I actually take some pretty nice landscape shots and try to he creative
---
Maybe I should have used hotfix more than patch for when they do maintenances.
---
Is that the one who says 'pull my finger'? Yeah, I ain't trusting that one either
---
Effing bs, this is the second time now
---
Someone on here said they asked for a refund and got one  but they also got to keep all the stuff from the bundle.
---
At first I didn't know that the photos you took ended up on the loading screen, so whilst I was doing a quest in which I should take a photo of a cat, the only one I could find was a dead one, that some random guy had shot before I arrived, so it was face planted flat down on a couch in the ash region, took a photo of it, then onwards to fast travel, and ever since that picture keeps haunting me lol.   
---
But it's also kinda funny
---
Lol tbh that's Bethesda's fault
---
not a data miner, but if i remember correctly from my research and etc...
---
the mutation is the same as the legendary effect, only with the additional drawback of only triggering if you have no armor on, unless said armor has the weightless legendary effect.
---
i have it for the flavor of being a full mutie, but you're way better off having a single armor with the effect vs actually making use of the mutation, unless you're using perks or something i don't know about that boost your nat damage resistance or junk shield or something.
---
they way i mathed it back then was mutation + 5 weightless effects = 4 pieces of armor that were basically two stars, vs, chameleon armor + four other effects = actually getting a "real" use out of the third stars.
---
i'll have to look put for that event thanks
---
Yeah it seems to be ratr. I don't have the pack myself. Yet..
---
The white fire breathers outfit?
---
You suggest this like a solution to a problem, the issue is Bethesda do not see this as a problem. 
---
There is no technical reason for caps to be limit, it’s completely arbitrary. Bethesda is setting all of these limits, caps, bullion, vendor, script to influence playing style. They want you to play little and often, prolong the game and increase the monthly revenues from FO1st.
---
Increase or remove the limit then people will grind the game, more people grind then server response suffers &amp; will cost Bethesda in investment in more hardware to combat the load. All of these restrictions are put in place so that Bethesda can get more bang for their buck. It’s not a “bug” or a problem but a business strategy.
---
I have the T65, with mods, gauss minigun with all mods, the ammo maker, tomorrow Ill have the Plasma Caster with all mods and in the weeks end, Ill have the farming tiles and the cattle rod.
---
After that... I dont know what to do.
---
I've got a bunch of glitch photos, some of which are still outstanding (*very minor*) bugs
---
- In the Whitespring crafting area, where they removed the third armour bench, there is still a glow effect where the 44 gallon drum used to sit
---
- Also outside Whitespring above the main door where the balcony is, many of the balustrades on the right side are missing a filler piece between the floor and the balustrade leaving a gap, the left side is fine
---
- Right next to that, the columns in the main balcony area overhang the floor 
---
That's just a few from Whitespring.
---
It would be nice from a roleplay aspect to have a stock of cooked special meals to sell. Especially with the RR stuff added recently, could run a little cafe with meals for sale. Ice cola nuka too heh
---
Honestly, your idea is actually a decent one maybe have the text chat area same to how the mics work
---
might be something in the overall build.  on ps4 here, but the watoga area, whitesprings, crater, and a few other places i can't pull off the top of my head have been having noticable drops in frames at all times, not matter what is going on, on ps4.
---
not enough to be a slideshow, but still a extremely noticable.  was only going on for the last week or so.  used to happen now and then, but is currently an all the time "on" feature.
---
Yeah, I know where to find them, I just don't like having to carry them over there one at a time like you have to. It's very tedious.
---
There's been no mention of maintenance either.
---
[You should see the kinky stuff Emerson was up to](https://imgur.com/a/0UoFFmX)
---
Ha ha that gun does not care about your armor stats at all
---
Photomode is invaluable in silos.
---
Update: just getting started and lovin this.  Live vats is pretty sick and am learning that I’ve definitely been using it as a crutch through FO4.  Scary out there scavenging any shitty armor and weapons you can find before you’re able to curate a decent setup.
---
I'll definitely give that a try, thanks.
---
I actually got it from fly swatter last night.
---
If you're doing it for completionist sake maybe get the gauss shotgun (which I find better than the minigun) since I'm assuming you're a heavy gunner build is easy to switch to if you've got the extra levels. And get the turbo fert fertilizer too. If not just save your gold if Beth adds more things to buy with buillion.
---
If we googled everything, we'd have no use for this or any sub.
---
Bloodied damage scales with health. Every 5% health you lose, you gain 5% damage. People just stay at 19% health because nerd rage triggers under 20%. 
---
This is with all the same perks, and same BE 50 Cal. Removed nerd rage and adrenal mutation (don't know why would you want to do that) and the damage drops as follows.
---
Still at 19% health - Dam 196.53, Dps 1788.46, DR300 Dps 953.34
---
It's worse when you stagger like hell during a reload.
---
Thanks. Ill get everything from the raiders and from the settlers and maybe I get the strangler hearth PA too and the chest from SS armor to get the jetpack (without PA). After then I keep my notes to future update.
---
Snaptail reed is not needed for healing salves (though it is for disease cures. You will need firecaps also for disease cures).
---
Make a new game, call it fallout 5, lots if peeps would be happy. Downvote in 3,2,1...
---
With max strength, you could run melee/heavy weapons/shotgun build in one character.
---
What's up your ass ?
---
This but to add to that if your bloodied always keep a little spoiled meat to get your rads up quickly without having to search for a radiation spot
---
Athena has different attachments, and they vibrate.
---
This is much faster.  And you get alot of aluminum too
---
You mean swapping perks for different styles, or all at once?
---
Would've been neat player housing, I don't know if there are enough locked doors for every player in the server though.
---
Workshop PvP is heavily one sided towards the attacker. Once someone initiates a claim, its a full on fight from that second, giving them the upper hand. 
---
But to answer your questions. Workshops arent active PvP zones until someone trys to claim the workshop. If you dont own the workshop, you can walk around in it without having to worry about being killed by another player (typically). To start PvP in a workshop, you have to either have someone trying to take the workshop from you, or you taking it from them. 
---
So in short, if someone owns the workshop, you can initiate pvp with them by starting to claim it like you would normally. If you own a workshop, keep an eye on your map to see if someone is close by. This way you can be prepared for a battle instead of being caught with your pants down.
---
Scrapper perk for steel. Scrap all pipe weapons you get
---
I have a sneak build and the bird bones mutation helps alot with sneaking but your limbs take more damage so I have to stay away.
---
I regretted like 100 times that I bought it on pc and not on ps4 apparently it’s just a Bethesda thing
---
Yeah I bet its good, I just personally really like the 3325lvc combo, my first perk can be pretty  much anything from furious to vampire or anti armor
---
swapping perks of course. Since the damage perks for those live in strength. 
---
I used to clear whitesprings with melee, and switch sometimes weapons (when I run out of one type of ammo) for other enemies
---
 Ofc, that was before I started trading ammo.
---
1. It's fun to do such rediculous damage. 
---
2. Bloodied melee means no grinding for ammo 
---
3. There's almost no penalty for dying so why not?
---
I only really use it to get through locked doors...
---
There is one important thing which is if someone trying to claim a workshop and you get inside the zone of that workshop this automaticly creates pvp between you and the claimer
---
I think the instrument loop should be the chorus to "Country Roads". Imagine how much more often people would 'jam' then! Even if it picked up playing somewhere in the middle of a line, it would still be better than the no-melody, tuneless banging we get now.
---
I looked for a long time for someone else playing an instrument to see if more than one was going if they would play the same song. With Wastlanders, some of the NPC's play, but tend to stop and stand up when you approach them. (That jerk at the Welch station!! Every. Time. Even if you're invisible!) I finally heard several raiders playing together at Crater and a few real ppl at Fasnacht... The jury's still out on whether they're playing the same tune. :/
---
No problem. But generally speaking, you are right, you need to find a plan for weapons/armor. Learning it through scrapping works rarely.
---
As for mods, it's the other way round. You can learn most through scrapping, but for some you need to find plans.
---
Dunno. I miss fallout 4 and the building system
---
The Crater jukebox has a short surfy rock ditty.
---
Not really a song though and it's the some ditty on loop over and over.
---
When they added the Burrows, there still weren't human NPCs yet so it's another of those "people lived here but they all died" environmental storytelling opportunities. It was intended to be a difficult dungeon for a team of high level players, but it turned out to be a lot easier than what Bethesda had intended. It's fun to run through and learn the backstory about the settlement that was once there, but aside from a bunch of ghouls and a cool looking dungeon location, it didn't add much overall. It was forgotten for the most part after a week or two. I stop in occasionally hoping they'll secretly add to it and was wondering if wastelanders would have brought anything new to it but it hasn't. Would like to see a possible settlement start back up maybe in some far corner of it or an instanced room deep inside somewhere, maybe an actual quest instead of just a sewer full of ghouls.
---
I've invested too much time as a PA build, I might switch once we can save card loadouts.
---
Should be an alternative to the regular garage door? Tried swiping to the side?
---
No, they can't even access the build menu in your camp.
---
A key card, nukacrypt and to know the glitch to teleport through doors.
---
Hello,  
---
I feel you man, but hear me out.  
---
During the week, I crave for fallout, when I come home from work, i spend my free time in appalachia, it is usualy 2-2,5 h.  
---
But when weekend hits, its different story. After those 2 hours I become easily bored with the game and turn it off.  
---
So, when I got much free time, game becomes boring, but when i can play just few hours a day, I m really enjoying the game.
---
I’m really gutted I missed the Mary Beary! 
---
I’m rather tempted to create a group to upload Bear photos to now. 🤣
---
Yes, when the beach boys song comes on after some of the much older stuff... It's just so... "Oooooh! 'Thunderstruck'! Turn it up!" It's just the most metal thing on there, next to that foot-stomper 'Country Roads'! :D
---
Hi there!   
---
Well with more than 2 decades of experience with gaming, I can honestly say that I have never encountered any community like the FO76, and I mean that in the very best way possibly!   
---
I have spent way over 200 hours of ingame hours on FO76, and that's only on the Steam release, I bought into the game when it was initially launched, and despite all the frustrations that came with lack of content, bugs, crashes and annoyances, the community was what made me stick around! At first I also thought that I would be griefed, nuked and shut down every chance that high levels got, but I can literally say I have never been griefed in the entirety of the game.   
---
During an event when I was level 46 I accidently shot at one of the participants in the event and got the wanted level, I apologized and literally no one attacked me during the event, they said it was fine and could happen to anyone.   
---
Also I see a lot of people who has emptied the game for quests and content, that still sticks around just to lend a hand to newcomers in Appalachia, or just straight up roleplaying! I have had so many awesome memories in this game, that it could take me ages to tell 'em all.   
---
My favorite moment was when I was low levelled, a guy with a stealth suit followed me, and I couldn't spot him, but I would hear the sound of his mothman emote and see it flying around the vicinity, and it was confusing and a bit creepy, then he decided after having followed me around to use the voice chat and do an "insult bot" joke on me, then puked, and threw a shit loads of ammo, junk and modded weapons in a wrapped gift for me and left.   
---
Beautiful strangers everywhere!
---
Upvote for trying anyway.
---
Start? lol, they've released more patches in the first year than most games receive over their lifespan
---
If you're doing it with weightless armour some of them are bugged, I know marine is one but can't remember the other. The serum has no downsides and doesn't bug stealth.
---
Orbital strike/beacons?
---
I found it in watoga city
---
Sounds like an orbital strike beacon
---
I actually made a few friends on fallout that helped me alot with the game! My first nuke launch, SBQ Event and a ton more other things
---
This, i got all of them from there
---
&gt; Why does it feel like there is just couple people working on this big game
---
Probably because there are? I know you said Bethesda studio isn't a small group, but if you think the people who made Skyrim and Fallout 4 are working on 76, or for that matter ever worked on it in a significant way, you have no idea what's going on. 76 is being made by BGS Austin, whose only other projects are a failed MMO (or something) and helping out with the multiplayer for Doom '16. This game was only ever a side project for Bethesda, and honestly I think they've given it a healthy amount of attention. It was never meant to be their next mainline game.
---
Yeah maybe time will tell. 
---
Thanks for inputs
---
amazing! i use unyelding so im safe. thanks very much +karma
---
Bump
---
Oh absolutely.  I switch from heavy gunner to slugger perks when I’m doing easy stuff like farming Westek or clearing my daily quests.  No need to waste ammo on that stuff.
---
Yup not there
---
Nope move the little camp thing that you actually set down to place you camp you can get it just right. I spawn in right by my vending
---
Yea they should throw in poison damage too and make it the most unholy enemy in the game ha ha
---
Yep those are it. Kind of insane looking. Thanks for the info as well kind sir.
---
This is also one of The weird things about The shop! I’ve done this several times as well. 
---
But now there’s a lot of stuff they can cycle so unfortunately for us it will probably take longer time for it to return
---
I have one of these and unless they fixed it recently it doesn't do the damage you would assume.  Believe it was adjustes so that even if you charge all 20 shots the damage caps at 5 charges worth....and even then the enemies health usually rubber bands like with a shotgun.  Disappointing to say the least, I keep it around for when I need more rads.
---
Hellfire @ level 100 works on T65.
---
Water is not also ice.
---
Tried building the regulare one, then change it like a wall paper? Am just guessing at this point!
---
Yes it is. H2O. It's a molecule
---
I see people drop it all the time I drink that shit lol
---
Its like they removed it
---
Yep, the last few days have been strange (PC here).  Hopefully there will be maintenance today and reset.
---
I know, I was just quoting from Sunny because that line makes me laugh.
---
This post will have 2K upvotes by tomorrow.
---
Exactly this my friend. Just my thoughts as well. 
---
I totally get the other side of this strategy. BUT, this is the problem. 
---
They should spend extra time maybe on limited skins and keep a lot more basic stuff in the store imo.
---
Someone should make a list of fixed bugs right from the beginning to remind people who say, "Hey, Beth when you start fixing your game" how much fixing has already happened.
---
Hey people when you start to fix your broken memory?
---
If that happens pull out the pro snap deluxe (camera that you equip like a weapon ) and zoom in like you aiming and in the top right corner it will tell you what you are pointing at so In your case it should say ash pile
---
It atm at least... but yeah it has been there a couple of timea
---
I just started a new character to play with my son and revisited the smaller amusement park by Tyler County Dirt Track and found almost every bear there (maybe not Nuka/green? Or may just not have come across him). They're on/around all the rides, and there's one in the folding chairs in front of the stage, and one in the spaceship climber in the playground area. Idk if it's because it was my first run through there or if it's always like that and they've just been gotten already before. It also gave me a quest to find Jangles in the park, which I hadn't seen before.
---
I was annoyed because I found both the imported panda and bumblebear, which I'm missing on the toon that needs them for the Collector badge. Lol
---
You guys should collect beanie babies outside of fallout , their like, really fun.
---
Wow that sucks...
---
This would make me buy more stuff I’m sure. 
---
And ain’t that the point lol?
---
Go ultracite receiver and play like you would play with bloodied fixer. With perks, unyielding armor, mutations you are looking at 2500+headshots and you have 75 ammo +200 fire rate. LMG also has best range and you can easily snipe with it in vats. I can fire half a mag now with my AP bar. Its the best weapon in this game. I can kill colossus 4x faster than bis bffr fixer
---
Youd be surprised how many “limited time” items in games come back numerous times ruining the “if you don’t get it now you never will” kinda scheme of things you know?
---
Don't give them ideas!
---
I mean, still give it a try.  I haven't tried using it as a weapon in at least 7 months so who knows, it could have gotten adjusted with wastelanders.
---
Maybe they changed it last time I tested it, it worked with spoiled food. Only herbivore though.
---
I hadn't heard that :)
---
Shit I still can’t play with people, social anxiety is a fucking pain. I shut off my whole system if someone sends me an invite.
---
Just got hit by one of these. I heard a sound like a door open and then insta death while browsing the vending machine.
---
He says a lot of weird and funny things. 😂
---
There's a side quest to repair a ProSnap Deluxe camera and then use it to take 7 pictures of buildings in the Mire.  Also part of the scout challenges.
---
That camera, when you have a mob in its sight/range, its name shows up in the top right of the screen.  So if you have trouble finding a body in the long grass or whatever, you could scan the ground with you camera and the corpse, whether its in pieces or ash, it doesnt matter, will still show the name once in its field of view.
---
I'm not too sure its going to work with disappearing scorchbeasts tho because i get that bug as well and those motherfuckers disappear entirely, i'm certain of it.
---
Once you get used to it - it just feels normal and you adapt to different situations.
---
"Finally, someone with the guts to help."
---
It would not work for fo76 just not feasible
---
Someone gave me a ton of presents. I didn’t know what they did. I spammed them and realized I could keep cap maxing. So I just went around and gave everyone the caps :) let’s just say I bought some really expensive purified water lol
---
Yes! I had a bunch of teddy bears given to me by randoms when i first started over a year ago and sadly they got deleted during the last display disable. 🙄
---
On a Jukebox saaatuuurdaaaay niiiightttttt
---
Sorry dude, but this is a live service game and like any other live service game it's maintained by a skeleton crew and that's not gonna change. If other projects are finished then the staff goes to their other games still in development, like starfield and ES6.
---
Exactly my point. 
---
For me nothing is really exclusive. Some items were but. 
---
We kinda know already that if they know they can earn a little more on the same item again, they’ll add it. 
---
And no prob about that. That makes total sense. 
---
But then why not just let them stay. Or maybe just keep at least a wider variety of items so that there’s always something in the shop that someone wants to buy.
---
For sure, I don't run with blocker or dodgy as I don't get seen often enough to warrant them and prefer the weight reduction perks of traveling pharmacy and through hiker for QOL. I notice I'm much tankier with them though.
---
Wizard’s Museum of Severed Heads and Glowie’s
---
Wow nice to know I am not the only 50 something in this game.  My wife thinks I am crazy addicted (which she may be right) but this game is fun, grindy but fun.  I am level 303 now hate to miss a day.
---
At least now you know a good place to get them with the other toon. The Teapot usually has a bumblebear in the gift shop too. At one point I had all the bears but swapped them out for masks and only kept the 4 i like most
---
I'd absolutely love this. My camp is set up as a small trading settlement. There are two to three random NPCs that spawn in addition to my ally, so I've got a couple little buildings set up like houses and a workshop garage, my character's home, and a building set up like a store. It'd be great to have a little description I could add with the name of the "settlement" and some info.
---
So you left your machine on after you capped your limit and that’s Bethesda’s fault how? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
How the fuck is it tedious if it takes 5 seconds on your next camp visit?
---
I’ll never forget. ❤️
---
Yeah you could create curiosity to visit your unique camp with just a few lines of text. Like I already want to see this haha
---
MNV &gt; Travis &gt; Threedog &gt; Julie, she has so little personality I don't really get it.
---
Oh that kind of camera. Thanks I actually have that quest still in progress. I'll try it out next time something 'disappears'
---
Bloodied people usually either 
---
A) Want to be like Doom Guy and RIP and tear everything easily which is fun
---
B) PVP random people just knowing they will win because of their high damage and damage resistant armor.
---
Just In case I carry around with me a 3* Faster Fire Rate, 25% Less Vats, Assassins Gamma Gun.
---
This is so that if a bloodied build tries fighting me, I can add more radiation to their health, killing them easily
---
You don't need to side with the settlers to get it, you can get it and still side with the raiders, which is what I did. When you do the quests for foundation and crater, play both storylines for max rewards up until you need to choose a faction to side with. Then decide who you want to assault the vault with.
---
Exactly just a few words could "set the mood" before people even arrive.
---
I remember Todd Howard saying they were gonna make mistakes. 
---
Not that they would make EVERY mistake possible and then not fix it. 
---
Its my opinion that they only have a handful of devs working on it, and the code is just too outdated to be fixed properly. Its never gonne be right. (and im afraid starfield and tes6 will suffer the same issues) 
---
All these limits are crazy silly low too, this is the one game that frustrates me to play it. 
---
I still have some map exploration and quests to do, but when I'm done, i'm dropping this game and be happier for it.
---
“I’ve got my eye on you.”
---
Why does Davenport need so many damn photos of the same two things? Oh wait, he never gets them bc I give them to the raiders
---
They have fixed over 1000 bugs in the wastelanders update or so they say and touched up on the lighting in the game.
---
They don't have a lot of people working on this game anymore as resources have ben diverted to starfield and elder scrolls 6.
---
Much of fallout 76 developers isn't experienced with the games age old game engine that is basically using fallout 4 assets that date back to skyrim but that doesn't mean they're not learning how to use it. They learn as they go and it shows. 
---
But keep in mind this game is a place holder to keep people busy with something until starfield comes out next year and then elder scrolls 6 could most likely be out in late 2022 or early 2023. By then this game will have done its job in keeping players occupied with spending money on fo 1st and atomic shop purchases. By 2025 I don't think this game will be online anymore as they might make a sequel to it or focus on a single player fallout game on the new game engine that starfield an es6 used. Maybe by the end of the decade they'll release a sequel to fallout 76 but who knows what they are really planning for the next 5 years. I'm just speculating on a business standpoint and looked at how Bethesda planned things from all their major titles in the past, starting from elder scrolls 3.
---
Cap also makes it so items are not millions of caps. Runescape the new end game weapons would be 900 million gold coins for months and months and months. It takes ages to grind out that much money.
---
You lucky dog. 😭
---
It would be cool to be able to create your own settlement and recruit settlers or raiders or whatever to live there, but the camp budget is already pretty limited so.
---
Store your vendor when your caps have gotten high enough. Then put it back out when they get low enough.
---
Key card, Codes on Nukacrypt website, A will to live and survive, bullets, and a gun that won't suck
---
I havent been able to find out, but the enemy health rubber banding is definitely a bug right?
---
N o
---
Feel free to add me and join my game and check it out. Lol. IGN same as here on PC
---
Increase the damn limit. 
---
Players just makes mules which needs couriers. And it all just becomes weird when trading and stashing. 
---
Just remove it. Or maybe 100k. Idk. 
---
Something needs to be done at least. No way it “controls” the economy.
---
I have this issue with raider punk one toon.  On my others he gives missions just fine.
---
Rad Ant Lager doesn't have a recipe, it's randomly learned from the Biv dailies. And hunting ants (2 per beer) in fo76 is painful, the only semi-reliable location (they spawn frequently and are not instantly killed by something) I found is Fort Defiance.
---
So while it might be a useful drink, I am not sure it is worth the effort.
---
&gt; Huh, okay....
---
As far as damage goes I don't think there is much better single shot damage then a .50 cal hunting rifle for a high Health build except for priming it.  Especially if it's instigating, can one shot a lot of stuff from stealth.
---
There are far more mature aged players playing games than I think many people realise. Im part of a small group who met up playing Red Dead Redemption. Weve mostly all gravitated to FO76 now. RDRO was my first foray into online console games but had been gaing for a few years before that. I even had a crack at Dark Souls 3. The kids bought it for me as a gag gift because I can be a bit of a rage quitter. So I persisted just to show them. Hated it and didnt quite finish it but I got pretty cose to the end lol
---
I still can’t get this mission to work. When I go see him he says go to my terminal at camp but when I try that there’s just the scout ones on it.
---
Where is this “Burrows?”  Haven’t heard of it
---
I agree with this. I sell shit but recently I acquired a lv 40 bloodied, +1 end and 40% power att dmg chinese officer sword and aince i had a quad assaultron head only for sale, this one could get some interest, like showing highlights of the store
---
Store the floor/roof it’s attached too and it will be auto stored.
---
Yes please
---
Sadly I'm on Xbox but damn the curiosity is real
---
Yeah you could post your Deal of the Day for example!
---
Chinese Stealth. With that you’re invisible as long as you’re crouched, even if moving. Chameleon is only when you’re crouched and standing still. 
---
A full set of Unyielding armor at low health, with maxed AGI is really the only thing better than Chinese Stealth.
---
Same thing happened to me only I didn’t stop because I was out of the room. I think I lost about 15,000. They even bought a bloodied lever I had in there. I’ve now stopped playing the as of this happening 2 weeks ago. Playing Kingdom Come Deliverance instead!
---
I still have that one uploaded to my feed and on a load screen😁
---
Cant, something out of reach I am stuck
---
If they were instanced it wouldn't matter, lots of players could share the same door assuming a loading screen was involved. I hope they do let you use whitesprings in the future, would go a long way to making it a trade hub again, especially if they let you place vendors in there.
---
I would say relocate your camp then, everything is auto stored.
---
I gave him a dapper suit to match my own!
---
Well yes, almost 2 years of release and it didn't get fixed I think they are not able to... A go-around would make our lives easier at least.
---
Modus also sells serum recipe for around 18k caps with max charisma
---
Upgrades to RoboSuit. Does nothing.
---
That would be good, I would like to be able to name my shop so that it shows on the map.
---
The only thing todd howatf cares about is money.
---
Ty bro
---
Same. Did it twice yesterday. Exactly 3
---
We all need a safe space, perhaps we could always fast ^(unconditional) travel to Vault-Tec University if we need to escape the horrors in the world. 😎
---
Hahahah this had me
---
I've  noticed that the old red rocket garage door, the one that I bought from the atom store a long time ago, has been replaced with one that had a little guy on the door.
---
The original one I had with the rocket logo on, has been removed from my build menu. Are you experiencing this also?
---
I gave up on the Rep grind and it feels good.
---
That’s great news. Can you be drawn into unwanted PvP with public teams?
---
When you start getting more caps to play with, buy the underpriced mutation serums from player vendors. With hard bargain and grape mentats they can be sold for 500 each at vendors
---
I’m also getting tired of living purely on canned dog food...
---
60xp plus  kill xp
---
Agreed. I came back after Wastelanders, finished it and now I am.back to the point of having no content to use the new gear I have. Wastelanders was released without addressing the lack of end game content, and now I'm bored as all hell.
---
Yes and cant remove it from camp
---
Oh yes!
---
If you have marsupial you could jump on top of the golf club roof,walk across to the other side where the green/ white canopy is ...hop on it and fire on the ghouls inside..
---
I call it the drive thru hahahaa
---
I'm scared as well to go thru alone but if you ever wanna team up to go inside, my gt is krisy6six.😊
---
Once you go bot,  
---
You just can't stop.
---
That's if we still have a world worth living in, the way things are going we may be living in a facsimile of Fallout in the real world.
---
I’ve gotten maybe 2 - 3 badges in months of camp fire tells.  Its drops.  RNG is gonna RNG.
---
No as far as I can tell walls are walls budget wise I didn't gain any space. I just didn't want it to look stupid with only one brick wall, plus I don't like how the seams on mixed walls line up.
---
Thank you for that summary. It does appear that you're been reading through this sub, and I would congratulate you on being on a first-name basis with the multinational company who's currently administering your gaming experience
---
PA armor in general needs a bit of a buff to keep up with regular armor.
---
Sí
---
id rather a scorchbeast anyday to a bloody gutsy. They are ridiculous
---
It'll sell out of your vendors for 2c.
---
Me. I log in for a couple minutes, do 1 or 2 events then get bored. Played almost everyday since beta and have run out of stuff to do.
---
On the bright side I am already 35 hours into a new save in No Man's Sky. Such a great game now.
---
The Last of Us 2 is launching in a couple days and Cyberpunk releases in September! Pre-ordered both.
---
Starfield will be released most likely next year.
---
At least my boredom wont last long.
---
They patched that out when the mole miner pail thing started dropping the plans.
---
“It can’t be dropped.” And “drop it from an alt.” Are conflicting. If it can’t be dropped then you cannot drop it for yourself either.
---
I only had this problem once, it lasted a few days. I raised a ticket with Bethesda, the gave me the generic - power cycle your console - response. 
---
I tried it and it actually fixed it for me, never had a problem since. I'm not sure if you are pc or console, but raise a ticket. If they get loads of tickets reporting bugs, then they will have to fix them as it is on record. Complaining on a forum only, can be ignored.
---
But if what you are talking about is the one where it takes 3 or 4 attempts to fast travel, I believe that is fixed in the test server version of the game already.
---
It’s expensive, you can’t drop it, and you buy it at Vault 79
---
As far as I know the plans are untradeable
---
I think the plan you get from the settlers is an unlock rather than a readable. To buy the plans is something like 4000 gold bullion from the Settler vendor whose name Im blanking on
---
You need to have a Pro Snap Deluxe camera. You can find them on dead enemies (personally noticed this to be a regular drop around the Valley Galleria on scorched) then fix it at a Tinkers Workbench.
---
Note that it’s a ‘Broken ProSnap Deluxe Camera’ that you’re looking for and not just ‘Broken ProSnap Camera’. It has to be the Deluxe one.
---
Never had that happen
---
I didn't want any of the other mods because the negatives were too steep, but I've got both faction mods. If you're not using any mods it's definitely worth it.
---
"WHHaaaaat?"
---
Hahaha well im not gonna lie, its a good game and i like it for what it is, but its got so much potential on being better and theres alot of room for improvements.
---
Oh I have one, need to remember once I finish work.
---
Ah cool thanks, will check my stash as to which one I have.  Do I need to have it equipped?
---
The ceiling issues in this game NEED to be addressed like soon! This is just completely moronic for a studio such as Bethesda.  
---
Sometimes I really wish I have not invested so much into this game over the years because of stupid shit like this that should have been fixed by now.
---
Good old Fisto... I bet the F4NV modders will have a blast bringing him into the game and voicing him
---
All i know is the floating damage numbers have never ever been right, it's more a guide of what damage your roughly doing, the game isn't telling you your actual damage, more of an estimated damage. And the tool tip has always had issues, for example the gatling gun fire rate, it was at what, 400-600 i think. They've changed it in the tooltip but the fire rate is still the same which kinda shows the two aren't really linked. I really wish we were able to get the right numbers, it's kind of mind boggling that Bethesda take their usual route to solving problems by just completely ignoring the actual issue over giving us actual real numbers. Appreciate your post though, you put a lot of effort into it :)
---
I don’t think so. I never have it equipped but I do have it in my favorites. I’d imagine once it’s in your inventory and not in your stash you’re good.
---
Don’t think it takes much materials to repair at the Tinker Bench either.
---
me and my wife play together she was kinda the same way ( little scared of people at first) but now she actively looks for low lev characters to go out a rescue and give gear and help out, she's always the mama bear.  So if your on xbox and looking for help easing your way into playing with others we can always help
---
PA should stop all poison damage anyway! How's an insect gonna staf through 5 inches of steal?
---
I'm not having a go at you here and I'm not wanting to come across as a dick. But just play another game, or get another hobby in real life.
---
The marine helmet was a drop in the mole miner pale event I've never seen it out side that.
---
Too true I’m the same I came back for wastelanders and looking back on the dlc I can only describe it as “surface level” all the new quests are fetch quests (allies quest lines are insulting for this I think) and once it’s done it’s over, I thought the characters were good but that’s about it. And like you say there’s nothing to use the new stuff with, not like acquiring the new stuff is entertaining or rewarding either I don’t feel like i “earned” my gear I feel like I repeated the same mundane tasks for days in end some of which I was doing before the wastelanders dlc.
---
It is a bug for sure.  Doesn't seem like one that will be going away any time soon either because it's been happening for a long time.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Everything in the game can be solo’d. Multiplayer was an afterthought and with the exception of group events, it’s more like playing a solo game. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, multiplayer exists and  it works, but it’s buggy and not that well implemented.  That said, they’re constantly improving it and it’s getting better. 
---
Long story, short - with the exception of Nexus group events - which are actually solo-able - multiplayer is more like playing a solo game where you can see and talk to your friends while they do their own thing in a shared space. It’s possible to do more than that, but you have to work for it.
---
The "Glitch" position. Classic.
---
Christ I can’t imagine how burnt out you must be, I log in and as soon as I see the games sky I begin to feel bored once I do my regular stuff I just aimlessly walk around looking for something to do (especially when I play with a friend) I’ve been thinking about no mans sky actually I should have bought that instead of a couple models.
---
It’s unfortunate. I used to give them away and let folks know the scrapping glitch. Had a LOT of angry traders complaining about that. 
---
Sorry not sorry... but exploiting ignorance in the game isn’t something I’m going to support.
---
You see, the main problem is the lack of useful weapons at level 70...
---
And while at it, can they pay for my home loan?
---
Maybe camp turrets attacked. When I had my camp in whitesprings, upon logging in i had good chances my turrets would shoot nearby whitespring bots especially when it was a sentry.
---
True that, and they also tend to reintroduce some of the bundles/items more often then the others. (Like PA paints for example)
---
So yeah, it might take more time, but I prefer to keep my atoms which 've been in quite a short supply lately.
---
The tunes all sync up if multiple instruments are being played. Any two or more instruments will sound like they are intentionally playing together.
---
Do you have any mutations? I sure as hell wouldn't appreciate if my partner was Marsupial. Compared to that a solid steel rod is a safe bet...
---
I think this is a bug, I only noticed it since they added all the other red rocket stuff.
---
Seems similar to when fasnacht 2 plans were added. The balloons I had previously learned had become locked again.
---
I plan to raise a ticket, requesting that they fix the problem or give me my atoms back for the one I bought. I suggest you do the same.
---
All you can do for now is move your camp, then delete the saved camp blueprint at the new location. I hope this doesn't cause you too much of a problem, I know for me that would be impossible to move my camp is built into a pre existing cabin.
---
Yes. You gotta watch out for this. Also, theres people that like to kind of work this system. If the person who owns the workshop has a buddy with him thats not on his team, that buddy can initiate the claim and draw you into PvP as well. Just gotta be careful when entering a workshop zone and always be prepared for a fight.
---
I’ve been playing Star Wars seem as it was free with ps plus and I’ve got a couple buildable models on their way so those have and will be entertaining for a little while.
---
I am looking for ways to spend caps, not get more.
---
 Each time I play I get up to around Max caps from my player vendor.  I have already bought every plan from every NPC vendor in the game. After smileys 6k I have to go around buying bulk ballistic fiber from train stations. Literally nothing else to buy.
---
 My stash is full of God rolled and legacy weapons and I have over 15k of my 2 bullet types i use. Its a riflemans wet dream in my stash.
---
  I'm in non automatic rifle users so I really only use one bullet at a time so i am set there.
---
What else can I buy?
---
What gets me is we have jukeboxes in the game right now that play different music. Why can’t we have those options as well. The jukebox at the bar where you
---
Fight the windego has some jaunty bar music I’d love to have in a bar themed camp and there is another but it’s been a while since I was at it I cannot remember what it plays and where it is located.
---
I have multiple games on the go and a totally different, non-gaming hobby too. Doesn't mean I don't want Bethesda to add a load of level appropriate content to a game I have mostly enjoyed playing.
---
Love when the game defies logic ❤️
---
*build.
---
Know your worth King 👑
---
Personally I disagree with you on the part where you suggest pa will get a buff.  I'm 90 percent sure that nothing about power armor will change mechnically.  I will remain the same likely until the games end, becoming more and more irrelevant until it fades into obscurity. 
---
I can however, see us getting some fresh suit from their return.  Unfortunately however,  any increase to the defensive stats would be pointless as we are already well past the soft caps.  It would need to have something else as a set bonus.  Something like strangler heart, but maybe defense oriented.
---
Do you need sneak cards with SA  ? Saving to buy it , not too thrilled to switch any cards though since i only would use it in Queen fights
---
I second this
---
Feel free to add me. I am currently level 85, but I'm more than happy to help out.
---
If you get a chance to get it I would definitely get it next time.
---
I played No Man's Sky when it 1st released and comparing that to how it is today it's absolutely amazing.  It went from not much to do back then to too much to do today.
---
 All the game systems seem to mesh together seamlessly. They have done really really great work in the past couple years.
---
 I'm having a blast.
---
Please dont , lol
---
What an amazing thread, had a pretty bad day but this warms my heart for some reason.
---
I try to make pictures of very cool things that would fit into my loading screen
---
The best way to give yourself a bit of rads is using a gamma gun on yourself. It it has 90% weight reduction even better
---
&gt; head is a limb too
---
Whoa. Thanks this is big.
---
Yeah, once I finish getting T-65, I'm just done with the game at least until something new gets added
---
Seasons will be added fairly soon though, so that should be fun.
---
I just found a nice Instigating Explosive combat shotgun and I thought, "I would like a skin for this, if there one in the atom shop?" Well, no. The only skin for it is the free states skin and its not there. Will it ever come back? I dont know. If it does, when? Will I have replaced my combat shotgun by then? Who knows?
---
It would be nice instead of them lazily implementing ways for their player base to come back, there’s a desperate need for more end game content it’s nauseating all the end game gear is useless without end game content, you’re perfecting builds and acquiring new powerful gear for what? The next update that’ll only add one end game event by the looks of it?
---
Thanks gonna try it, my luck I will aggro her magesty and all her brood, and everyone will be like, NOOB!!!!!
---
When I first bought it on XBox, I had an Xbox one S. I thought it was a bad WiFi, or just really buggy. Going to areas like Harpers Ferry would bog it down so bad. But, I built a computer, then bought when the PC version went on sale. 
---
I discovered, it was so not my WiFi, it was the equipment. This game was optimized for the XBox one X and PS4 Pro, and for PC, you're going to need so much more than 8GB of RAM and an 7 year old processor. No doubt, they should've advertise this. I think a lot of people played it on their less than stellar systems, and got less than stellar results, and thought the game was bad. The thing is, I just do not see what exactly is using all these resources.
---
Wow, really. Damm it. Lol
---
Can you tame a sheepsquatch? My camp is right by a tandom encounter location so i get deathclaws, megasloths and sheepsquatchs all the time.....would be so cool
---
True, I am looking forward to Seasons and the WC event too.what I really want those is challenging end game content, world bosses and high level dungeons
---
Im 40yrs old, squeeze an hour in between kids bed and spending time with the missus.
---
I actively avoid fights unless i have to. They stress me out. I prefer pottering around, collecting, building, exploring etc. Sometimes the dailies fill my time anyway.
---
If i see a sheepsquatch in the distance, ill go round it.
---
However if the daily says kill a legendary enemy at a fissure, its power armour on, and explosive minigun time. I have never died from a scorchbeast whilst in power armour with the auto stimpack add on. The only thing that kills me is mirelurk kings and multiple bears.
---
Welcome to add me if on PS4. Ldavison10.
---
Thanks, yeah just wanted to know cause I didnt want to have a weapon doing half damage cause its half broken.
---
They have. I checked my notes. My statement is correct.
---
I’m sitting on over 10k Atoms because most of the stuff they’ve been adding I think sucks.  There are a lot more appealing things in the files they could release and I’d go on a spending spree!
---
I can only speak to my experience but I don't think I have ever been griefed on PC. Even when players certainly could if they wanted (workshops etc).
---
Am I? Really? Maybe you just lack the ability to think critically.
---
Yeah, I figured that out, but it's still a sort of "tuneless whistling" sort of music. :)
---
I feel like they want us to use them but don’t want to put in the effort to make them actually good and useful.
---
The other day I was doing uranium fever on my own,when a low level player joined me. A legendary appeared, so I emote for them to follow, equip my lowest damage weapon, went to get a hit in and . . . . I one shot killed it, meaning they got nothing. I gave them the legendary item as I felt awful about it but ffs how is the game so badly designed that I have to even consider binning off my good items so other players can have fun and get rewards?!
---
ive always wondered, on PS4, when someone smacks me to initiate PVP and my self-defence electric or mini explosion triggers (i cant remember the mutation names) doesnt this trigger PVP? I dont want to fight them but my mutations do?
---
If someone griefs me, i just log off and back on, just in case....
---
How’d you get that assaultron?
---
Outside Harper's Ferry
---
Yeah some effects are better suited to some weapons. Reduced weight it one of my favourite effects and I have it on 8 of my 10 weapons that I carry. The other 2 wouldn't benefit from reduced weight as they're heavily modded.
---
It's like if you got a fat man with faster fire rate, and said faster fire rate was the worst second effect. It's just a good effect on the wrong weapon.
---
Yeah, number 3 is way off. Idk where OP got this list.
---
Man, that chick was my girlfriend for a while but I kept finding her hanging around other dudes' camps.
---
I don’t think I’ve seen anyone actually wearing T-65 apart from one guy near the release of wastelanders and myself I really like the chunky appearance it has but I wish I could paint it with my nuclear winter paints I earned, I got it fully modded and I just wish I hadn’t now given how much greater regular armour is now and the cosmetic options that are available in comparison, I could show off my jungle pirate cosplay if I had normal armour.
---
I had Beckett in my camp, and he hadn't been giving me any quests, for over a week. I decided to delete his bar, and add the Raider Punk. When I did, it said that I failed whatever quest I was supposed to be on. There was no quest: I don't remember getting one, or asking for one. I had finished the last quest, and from then on, nothing; until I deleted his bar. 
---
What I'm proposing is, perhaps he thinks you're already on a quest. It probably won't show in your Pip-boy. So, delete him, fail the quest, then place him back down.
---
No objectively out of all the thrid perks it is the worst because it dosent always work
---
but but but... GAUSS WEAPONS
---
It's one of the reasons I took a loooong break a while back. The only thing I have left is just grinding for good legendary dropsI used to run a PA build but swapped to a bloodied build after about 300 levels so tue grind for good weapons is more difficult than ever. After I've done the dailies I just go about my day. FO76 has become like a mobile game tbh. 
---
At least now that wastelanders is out they can focus on better events, fixes more content in general.
---
I was bored even at level 60 with Excavator Armor. I can almost one shot everything with my Gatling Gun. I even don't know why to bother getting better power armor like T 60, it's pointless. 
---
The game is certainly lacking a content for veteran players, although we purchase large sums of Atoms in Atomic Shop. At least Bethesda could try to keep its best customers with some fresh content for seasoned players.
---
Now I'm playing my third chacacter at level 19 because when I hit levels above 60-70 I really don't know what to do, there is no challenge at all, and no fresh content.
---
Bethesda should add some new story contents, new locations, new weapons and stuff, harder enemies etc.
---
Well, underneath it.
---
but but but... FARMABLE DIRT SQUARES
---
Hey, it's Lewis!! Biv asks about you ALL THE TIME.
---
I've had a about 10 hours play time since Wastelanders dropped (thanks covid homeschooling!) and wtf happened to vats of rifles?  
---
West-Tec, instigating fire rate Gauss rifle, 95% torso hit chance, EIGHT shots from 10-15m before I make contact?
---
No, I had about a 15000c buffer which usually gives me enough time to make vendor adjustments, cut power or just leave the server. But I was busy helping my boy level up and a buyer blasted waaaaaay past the upper cap limit, in a matter of seconds, before I could do any of the aforementioned fixes. No one is going to turn\leave their vendor on at max caps. It would be easier to just drop the items or script them at that point as you are at least getting some script (if that isn't maxed also) or helping out another player
---
Wow!!!! I'm in love, that looks amazing.
---
Hmmm.
---
That's why me and beckett are such a great couple. We're so close and would never cheat on each other.
---
Just chiming in to confirm, this has also happened to me twice.
---
Buttface the scorched mega sloth keeps attacking the scraptron in a jealous frenzy because I collect things from it. Actually Buttface is just a real turd no matter what.
---
I walked in on her and Emerson one too many times like that.
---
Honestly, I don’t blame her. Being cooped up for years is sure to get the juices flowing but I could tell she hated him.
---
Maybe that’s why it was so good though.
---
Moving my camp and build it all is not an option xD might wait for a fix. Thank you,
---
Good idea, but where would the come from? Brotherhood would be against such use of tech so can't be added with steel dawn.
---
Maybe enclave? Or it could be the form of a new vault, where the experiment is to get humans to successfully bond with cybernetics? 
---
Spoiler, they would all have died due to some sort of catastrophic failure of the experiment, in usual vault Tec style.
---
Ooh. Damn I gotta check that out. Tha is for the correction.
---
Something is going on with the internet all over the place, just give it time
---
The endgame is boring, but the greed for more power keeps me going. And I love fallout in general, sometimes I think I would enjoy a second playthrough of FO4 more.

Berry Mentats

It's on the Roadmap for this year - One Wasteland

I haven't consumed any, and its only on some enemies, not all of them, i was like wtf 😂
---
It means take out your camera and look around until the name of the dead enemy you are looking for appears.
---
The end game to me is making your own adventure, whatever that may be. For me personally, it’s building unique camps. It keeps me busy always collecting plans, having to trade for them at times, grinding gold for unique camp items (turbo fertilizer, the well, ammo machine), playing NW for camp items, interacting with others, visiting camps for ideas, buying and selling plans in my shop, farming world plans to sell, watching camp showcases for ideas, and hosting tours of my camp for hours at a time. I’ve always found most of the fallout games to hold more value after beating them if you are creative and can make your own adventures. Just being spoon fed boss fights and collecting OP gear to make those boss fights super easy doesn’t sound like a fun endgame to me at all.
---
Flatwoods Monster probably?
---
Also, it’s a fucking **sealed environment**.  Power armor and fusion cores are a fucking joke in this game.
---
You’re thinking of the robot helmets. The first time you loot the junk from their bodies it unlocks the ability to craft that respective bot’s helmet. 
---
The marine tactical helmet is a plan you can find in various locations in the cranberry bog. There are multiple locations so you can just server hop at those locations until you find it.
---
If they are solid pink, its probably because the textures haven’t loaded properly. If its some sort of particle effect, then i have no idea. I can hazard a guess it’d be a bug though.
---
you know that's a girl robot right? Throwing a great opportunity away over some toxic masculinity.
---
I'd rather have it over +1 agility or perception. Even faster movement while aiming is worse.
---
Buffout
---
I feel the same way, even though I haven't done much nuclear winter, getting power armor paints for the main game would be a huge incentive for me to play more
---
Yeah we definitely don't use it for its original purpose haha

They should fix Explosive weapons because nobody use them. It's very annoying that everybody is droping grenades and mininukes because they are useless. Explosives should be the most powerful weapons in the game! It's hard to understand Bethesda's logic (if there is any).
---
And the same is with Laser rifles which break after 5 shots. Absurd.
---
Kaidan Alenko knows
---
The thing is that they always work though so again objectively it is the worst subjectivity
---
And the Captain Obvious award goes to...
---
Berry Mentats or the Targeting Mod on a PA Helmet produce similar but slightly different effects - BMs do an all over glow, the Targeting is more edge based and imo both looks nicer and works better. I find the glow is most useful in heavily wooded areas and when tracking Scorchbeasts as they circle around. It also makes for some great pictures.
---
This is how all online rpg are since they exist.  
---
The "end" game is a repetition of the same thing over and over, and eventually you get bored.  
---
But, however , some games have more end game content, and unfortunately, Fallout76 has one of the smallest...

Cyber Sex-The Next Level.

I like him in full fisherman gear

Idfk 😂 i was at westek making an xp run, the supermutants ouside were normal, but as soon as i entered the super mutants inside were glowing in bright pink, and the protectrons on their pod too, haven't consumed any berry mentants or any other chem, maybe is a bug
---
I try to convey this by using the camp emote quickly followed by a thumbs up, most people usually understand what I mean and heart emote back, but yeah a dedicated “this camp is awesome!” Emote would be appreciated.
---
You call it cheating i call it opurtinity
---
Omg... So, does that mean that all of those creatures that you have to take pictures of (for challenges) can be taken after they’re dead?? If so, I’ve been playing on hard mode.
---
Haha, remember being so confused when I saw the holotapes with my name on as my character is called Lewis.
---
Then there's camp Lewis in the game, which is what led me to be allied with the pioneer scouts.
---
yeah i didn't know about cap too, sold like 20k weapon when i was at 28 ughhh (but to be fair bought it for 1,5k so i wasnt so pissed)
---
100%

Lod meshes are used to display objects at a distance without all the details. You’re probably walking up on the lod mesh before it converts to the proper mesh.The purpose of the lod mesh is show distant objects without having to waste all the resources rendering the high detail mesh, as high detail as meshes in the Creation Engine get, anyway.
---
Think of it as you *did* help another player and the economy. You maxed out your caps and someone else got gear/items they wanted. Removed some caps from the maximum pool. 
---
Quite a few high level players simply have nothing left to spend caps on. Any God Mode gear is likely to be traded for other gear rather than sold for caps. I’m frequently capped but leave my machines on with cheap plans, chems, water and so-so legendaries as a service to my fellow players. Most people appreciate a good bargain and have no clue I’m capped, so think they’re giving me caps. It’s feel-good, all around 😊
---
So the bottom slanted bits are roof pieces? How'd you get those at the  bottom like that? Did you start with foundations below the water?
---
  You can deal with the clubhouse and the other large crowd of ghouls areas of WS as a sniper, but it may be tedious...and not necessarily sneaky.
---
The ghouls like to stay inside the buildings, so you will need marsupial, fireproof, a few mines or grenades, and some patience.
---
  Walk to the door, step in, and wait.  When the ghouls start to come to you, back up and jump up on the canopy over the door.   Roll grenades or mines off on their heads, and shoot as needed.
---
They will go back inside if they can't find you.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  
---
Also works for the laundry building and the Presidential cottage (run back and jump on the roof of the fire station, roll grenades and shoot.)
---
In New Vegas they were sold by Doctor Usanagi, who is as far as I know not affiliated to any large faction. (Not a lore expert so probably wrong here)
---
I would like to have it presented as an underground illegal method of improving your physical capabilities, so if they at some point decide to introduce a fighting arena, then it would be a good move to have someone try and sell you these implants just as they try and sell PED's in gyms. These implants will act as the current serums, and can be stashed and sold. However, the person or group that is able to perform surgery will have to be found. More quest potential here.
---
I genuinely didn't know about the burrows until about a week ago. I heard about ut but didn't read anything about it. Came across the manhole cover and got excited. I breezed through it but I didn't really... get it? If that makes sense. Still a pretty cool spot though

---
Someone made a post on here yesterday about how bored they were they decided to Roleplay as a Brotherhood of Steel Scribe.
---
So what I'm getting at: True roleplaying in character? Maybe be a Responder, Enclave soldier? Something.
---
That's what I'm going to be doing: Roleplaying it out. Plus it makes it more fun.
---
This could be useful, but i have a feeling you’d see stuff like “Awesome museum of mystery” or some shit like that all the time and it’s just a 2x2 wood hut with crafting benches, a bed, and some mr fuzzys in a display.
---
There's events that are good for ants. The Sweetwater one and Campfire Tales.
---
Thanks
---
Ok
---
Flatwoods monster inside westek happens from time to time.  I'd call it more of a purple.
---
Doesnt help when that endgame boss you spent the past hour getting a nuclear card, 'waking' it up and then using 1000s of round on goes ahead and drops a nocturnal lead pipe and either the 20 th copy of ultracite jetpack or a useless pa plan which you can get a copy of the whole set for at the bos building.
---
OP is talking about the marine tactical helmet, not the marine armor helmet. The tactical helmet plan can be found at locations in the bog, costs less materials to craft and is worth more caps at vendor bots than the marine armor helmet.
---
Obvious to us yes, but apparently not to bethesda and the devs. And yes as a result its a struggle we deal with to date. Thats why this post in hopes to make it so the devs would give this a second thought, who knows yknow🤷🏻‍♂️
---
once you have enough powered pieces for dodgy and enough pieces of Sentinel you dont really have to sneak. I have a fixer for when I want to sneak and a bunch of other weapons for when I dont. eventually you get to a point where it doesnt matter.
---
What? A basic QOL feature that is generally in every MMO? No. No one wishes for that here.
---
She sucks anyway, get rid of her. She just complains.
---
The Burrows is a great area but Bethesda really screwed up adding it. They advertised it as a new dungeon for higher level players so naturally everyone assumed it was a raid, which it isn't. Also, while it is difficult for non PA characters around level 50 most people were 4 times that and just stomped through it in minutes. Disappointment all round. Furthermore there was only one quest for there. 
---
 At the time of release most players had done everything to death and were content starved so everyone was going as soon as it opened meaning most people weren't getting to do the quest because first in was already doing it and if you had real bad timing it would complete on entry as someone killed the last boss. 
---
 If they had have either put it in at launch or just added it with some other content without putting a spotlight on it that area would have been really well received.
---
I can't even get her in my camp because the quest to get her has glitched and won't progress.
---
how many pieces of powered armor do you have?
---
also serendipity doesnt cost ap
---
That’s fun. Do you farm legendary’s that white spring after knocking or just regular?
---
How about stop playing the game for a while? Play some other games and come back to this when patch 20 drops or the next DLC drops.
---
What's the point of grinding out the game when it's not fun?
---
That’s something I’ve never understood about 76 the enemy balancing, I can easily withstand attacks from a large mutated bat which is a threat to all of human kind but I’m back peddling and playing the matrix when against an overgrown fish or battling one mr.Gutsy when I think about it I think of a designer saying “we’ll make the over powered enemies common so we can throw 15 at a time at a player and make the end game enemies weak and throw 1 at a time but that’s ok cause they’re endgame. I ran excavator for so long I ended up carrying on average 400wg at all times (primarily cause of the hundreds of stimpacks I had) but any of the other armours are kind of pointless when you look at it.
---
I use it for close ups of ghouls, they look so suspicious all the time.
---
that armor doesnt stop rads like the endurance perk
---
Using asbestos roofs:
---
Start with a foundation
---
Have the side that you want the wall facing outward built on the foundation where you need it height wise.
---
Build a flat roof onto that wall from the foundation (make sure you have the lines facing the way you want a diagonal slanted roof to go if going to use a diagnol slanted roof) 
---
Build a second roof behind the roof that you have started.
---
Now build a third roof behind the second.
---
Select roofs 1 &amp; 2 and **"change"** them to a slightly slanted roof (this will unclip whatever roof that you've changed to whatever it's connected to) *unclip one at a time.
---
Now that the roof is unclipped delete them the walls and the foundation.
---
you now have one floating flat roof (roof#3) use this to add a diagonal slanted roof not to be confused with the slightly slanted roof and add your wall whether it be for half it should be facing outward.
---
**if you do not want roof #3 connected to the diagonal slanted roof simply change the flat roof to a slightly slanted roof and it will run clip from the diagonal slanted roof and therefore leaving a floating diagonal slanted roof in a wall facing outward**
---
Just found it there! Thanks!
---
I only buy things for my CAMP, and whenever I check that tab in the shop, I see I own pretty much everything. Do they want our money or not?
---
I hit 150 today and.. yhea I feel that way honestly as well. There really isn't enough engaging content to support the game once you finish the story... it's just grinding tedious level after tedious level for a new perk card or moving a special point to try and fix/finish your build... Especially as if like me you knew next to nothing about the perk system; your build by level 50 was so fucked up it was painful and useless x.x  
---
(I'm STILL trying to finish my assault rifle build after having spent so many levels moving special points and buying new perk cards -.-)  
---
They really need to rethink things, especially "SPECIAL" and how that works.. have level ups be only for perk cards, let us use... I dunno.. Caps or Script or even Atoms to reset our stats.
---
I heard you get better chances of getting it if you do responders evens
---
I'm waiting for it to be half off, because the dome is literally the only part of it I want.
---
I remember when I was younger and used to play new Vegas and fallout 3 I always used to make my own adventures just walking around pretending to be a freelance or something those were good times, unfortunately maturity and anxiety have taken effect so I don’t do stuff like that anymore haha
---
Not to mention the outfit you get for siding with Foundation is god-awful. It’s so hideous compared to the Raider fashionable outfit.
---
Nah you're not a dummy. 
---
If you join a world and it can't place you camp, it'll tell you and offer to switch to another world where you can or let yoy stay on that current world without your camp there and active. 
---
Generally the only way you'll lose you camp is if you move it.
---
Haha yeah
---
You actually need to find the dead tourist first to be able to craft the camera! You can find him through the terminal I think...
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's obvious to them too. They've brought it up in numerous ItV posts and interviews.
---
The game is the way it is because Bethesda wants it to be this way. They're a multi-billion dollar company, if they wanted to spend the resources to get more people to work on the game they could eventually. If they wanted to remove or increase a lot of these limits, they could have already. 
---
The game is the way it is by choice. That feeling of stash being too small pushing some people to complain and others to pay for Fallout 1st, yup, by design. Scrip limits both in terms of overall total and daily limits, you guessed it, by design.
---
NONE of this is lost on Bethesda. They're just choosing not to do anything about it for now. That could eventually change in the future (LOL) but right now they know. They didn't need it summarised for them.
---
You have any instigating lever actions (2 or 3 star?) you feel like trading? Any weapons/material you need?
---
*Helpful tip never build your walls to the very last
---
😅 save yourself a lot of frustration
---
Care to explain the deal with white springs? Every so often I see a nuke zone there and a bunch of players but when I go there everything seems normal aside from the radiation, does a colossus spawn or something?
---
Ah, gotcha. I should probably get rid of my vaulted ceilings to regain budget. LOL
---
PS4 pro doesn't seem to have issues at its current setting.
---
You also need to know the flamethrower trick to fuse the roofs together or build them into each other
---
Can also confirm. I have a instigating ffr combat shotgun and the damage numbers range from 400 per pellet to over 2k
---
Yeah that’s true it would be a great incentive if there were more in game paints, i made some raider power armour for fun and cause I kind of like it’s appearance and I thought why can’t we get the blood eagle power armour paint? It’s only splashes of red but it would still be nice or what about some trials for new excavator paints? Fire breather trials or something like that.
---
3000 hour player here, been playing since launch, had fallout 1st since launch, and I cancelled it last month and its finally fully expired now and I dont miss it. private worlds arent useful anymore, unlimited junk storage is unnecessary when I can only craft 3 SS pieces a day. 
---
Wastelanders absolutely killed the fun for me. the game isnt a looter shooter anymore, its  "daily grind and try to get lucky at the ~~slot machine~~ armor bench"
---
I barely do any looting or shooting in this game anymore and thats the only reason I like to play, so im pretty much done.
---
I think it's a additional monolog to Davie's loud thinking if Sunny got ice by now as he got a refrigerated closet
---
I’m always amazed by how many “non-gamer” types this game brings in. Definitely one of the reasons I love this game so much. Never in my life have I played with so many actual grandpas, quite a learning experience. 
---
Glad you’re enjoying the game!
---
I’m 277 and not bored yet. Then again, grinding isn’t my thing...just aimlessly walking around it. And as long as my character can walk, I’ll be able to have fun with this game. Oh, and roleplaying is nice too.
---
Might try it to be honest got a cosplay going so why not.
---
I don't think it's wrong to take or keep these found items, but to put this to bed, there's no way anyone with legit presents is still opening them in bursts like that. It's all duped.
---
As a bootleg Talon Company merc, I can agree.
---
To denigrate those who, justifiably, expect a deeper endgame as wanting to be 'spoon fed' is ridiculous. Creating your own fun is fine, but it should be one possible path. For it to be the only path is a failure of the game itself, not of the imagination of those who aren't interested in following it.
---
That this *still* isn't cared for is mind blowing and unbelievably lazy/sloppy.
---
Rifle gaming made a video on this a while ago, he made a ship and had a little roleplaying cutscene based around it
---
Did you try going back to the keypad at Hornwright and punch the code in again? If so, what specifically is the quest asking you to do?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Not really, unless you really have tons of spare points.
---
I just checked on my BE Gatling and went from 459 to 505.  Pre-nerf when the explosion equaled the round's damage than ya, that was some good bang for your buck.
---
That's why I've been getting naked and going to people's camps to steal their crops and turn off their lights
---
This happened to me a few times too. I found that not skipping any dialogue each time got through it normally again. Maxed it out on Sunday and glad I’m finally done playing fetch for Ward!
---
Watoga
---
You can’t beat the machine
---
CSS, for sure. I run a full sneak rifleman build, and with the CSS I can crouch through an entire silo without firing a shot until the missile prep.
---
Yeah, the whole thing sits on line if foundation pieces that just barely breach the water surface. The roofs to the sides are tricky though. You need to get the slanted wall pieces to fit at the right height, then snap the roof pieces onto those. Once you got that you can just keep snapping roof pieces to roof pieces :)
---
I need to make work of those badges and then get that elusive revive, adding people that want to help on pc has proven extremely buggy. I'm not in a rush though and i'm sure i'll knock it out eventually
---
No idea. I also don't know why we can't change *our* character names
---
I don’t actually think there going to raise it. Generally just saying if your going to start storing caps in the vendor like the op says would be a good idea I’m saying you might aswell just do that
---
Who's Beth? Does she work for Bethesda?
---
Thanks, I worked my ass off on it lol
---
I’d actually be able to advertise the HQ of our little raider mercenary group...it’d be so nice.
---
If you have the perk points to spare, sure. Otherwise no. Personally, I think that anything that gives less than 5% damage bonus per perk point isn't worth it. And seeing as Demolition Expert only raises the explosive bonus damage from 20% to 32%, it's not worth it in my eyes.
---
It seems most guns in Fallout are left handed, bugs me but apparently they want to show off their animations more or whatever
---
Yeah, I think it would be awesome if you get max reputation with both the raiders and settlers you could get a new paint for all the power armors, like for raiders you get that cobbled together look with the random bits of welded on metal and rebar, and for settlers you get a light blue with some black accents and probably something extra like bits for technology put around the armor to make it look high tech
---
Oh that one yeah I've got that one sorry for the misunderstanding I make them for people all the time alone with the marine wet suit
---
yup, because of the bug where small critters didn't spawn there was a common tip to go to some location where a dead chicken was a static spawn to take the pic of it.
---
Beth is Bethesda herself
---
I’ve done that quest I think. Is it the one where you have to take pictures of certain locations?
---
Posting nothing right now so I can remember to gather pictures later.
---
you can also use toxic goo from west tek for +125 rads per
---
Any particular reason you wanna do this?? Nobody ever sees your character name to begin with as far as I know.
---
Welcome to the endgame
---
The water revive is probably the hardest unless you have friends. I got the regular revive at either a SBQ or encrypted. They don't have to be in team just another player.
---
Then i guess they dug their own grave. I mean i love the game, its good and i just think that if these changes are made id love it even more. But not everyone is me and people are giving up on this game cause of the things mentioned in this post being too much of a “chore” and this game full of micro managing every aspect of the game. But well all we can do is hope for the best. All in all its a game i can appreciate and with what they showed in the road map,looks quite promising.
---
They desperately need to buff her rewards then I might actually run silos more I don’t have any need for flux right now, there’s no incentive to fight her so why would I bother with a silo? Talking about ammo what about whole guns? I lost my last word to that event (didn’t have much ammo in any guns at the time) took my last word out of my stash, spent the few rounds I had, put it back in my stash and when I next checked it was gone. They should maybe add a thing where you can select a specific weapon you want as a legendary or pay for it with script so you spend 100 scrip so that the next legendary you get in the world is guaranteed to be that specific gun and maybe pay more or less for how many stars it will be.
---
Except he can’t survive a nuclear blast
---
That's a great spot. I was only attacked by mole rats in that spot. The only problem being that 1/4 of the time my camp wouldn't spawn because it already had a camp.
---
If it's true that you're on a first-name basis with this multinational gaming company you'd make much better work of this initiative by bringing it to a company representative rather than by presenting it on a public forum
---
Don't know the actual reason but my reason is that it's the simplest and most efficient way of doing it.
---
Think of the alternative.
---
To make the animation the most readable i.e. easy to know what is happening, you'd have to swing the rifle into frame so the handle is somewhere near the centre, you do the animation for the right hand reloading, then you move the right hand back to the grip and the move the rifle back to the right to its starting position.
---
As it is right now, weapon stays mostly in the same spot on the right, left hand does all the reloading actions and then weapon repositions a little back to its starting point.
---
Few animations -&gt; less time and processing power required -&gt; quicker reload cycle
---
If you just kept the weapon on the right and did a proper reload animation, your right hand would be at least partially off the screen and on the far end, away from where your eyes tend to be, which is focused at the centre of the screen.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
I totally forgot about this possibility, I had one in there yesterday for the first time. Caught me off guard too!
---
Yup! So you should have a camera already, and if you do not try to craft it again on a tinker’s workbench. You just need a broken snap deluxe camera (or something like that) which you can find in many tool chases. It goes under the category of Misc in your Pip-Boy and it’s weightless!
---
Every NPC in the game ???? Says your name in the top left plus the say it in Dialogue 
---
Everyone calls me “STORAGE” sense I made the mistake of naming my 2nd character that
---
Nope.  Games never been more fun for exploration
---
Can't remember all the details but I read on here that melee doesn't really need additional anti armor, you're better off going for a different legendary effect.
---
Diner but its all just radiation traps and a level 3 locked door
---
Alright I will try to get good melee effects from the bitch pruruephn
---
power armor should be SO much more, but the games mechanics are just horrible. a PA should absorb everything below a certain damagelevel without giving a F\*\*K. it should allow just to STOMP on vermin like mole rats and radroachs, just squishing them to pulp. etc.etc. but for the damage modell its just a layer of filters with certain qualitys like every other armortype. with the ridiculous result of getting gutted by finger nails if youre unlucky...
---
A comparison of explosive weapons without Demo Expert, what’s the point lol. Demo expert buff both bullets from a TSE weapon that’s what makes the two-shot valuable. It’s like saying an explosive laser w beam splitter is weak based on the numbers on paper.
---
I think that it is a she? I am not sure.
---
You nullify addictions temporarily by taking the chem you are addicted to.
---
[](/flutterwink)
---
Edited the Beth part away. Any idea on weapon/armor level alteration?
---
Except for those china bots right next to tge door
---
It's quite possible you haven't done all side quests. That's the real strength of this game, not grinding stuff, but following stories by reading terminals and listening to holotapes. 
---
I can recommend Order of Mistress of Mystery if you haven't done it yet. Or just look up some side quests on a wiki.
---
I guess I got lucky I don’t have a real build I just have what I invested in (primarily intelligence for crafting) and I’ve been doing fine in the game against well...everything, I’ve been on and off the thought of a bloodied build not sure what it’s like trying to reallocate stats but I’ve got about 30 levels I think in the bank but I’m gonna guess I’ll need more if you’re level 150 now haha
---
There was four people shooting him too
---
100% agree with you, I definitely think the game will be dead by Christmas with all the new titles coming out, all the future has for the game is cosmetics which is so repetitive and boring plus absolutely no challenge, i solo killed the wendigo boss in like 3 mins with my junkies build which isn’t even that good, just very boring indeed
---
Ah, got it! Thanks, I didn't realize the effect wasn't 20% on the legacy weps.
---
Change it to 800lbs 😁
---
And then make them have a super large splash damage area so you cant escape their attack
---
just saw picture of a three foot mosquito welded together from machine and tool parts with a 10 inch drill as stinger... \*gulp\*
---
How ? Lol
---
My PA build with my vampire gatling plasma is pretty much invincible. I only die if I look away from my screen and didnt realize my gun was not hitting the enemy anymore. Very very strong build
---
&gt; Then i guess they dug their own grave. 
---
Maybe. Their reputation is already in the shitter. I went from being a massive fanboy of both the company and their two major franchises who would preorder to someone that won't even consider purchasing the game without seeing the reviews and only ever on sale. 
---
That's a pretty consistent story with a lot of people, both just us regular fans as well as higher profile personalities on Youtube.
---
Unless there are MAJOR changes to management and how they run their studio, I'll never pay full price for a Bethesda game, if I spend any money on them at all. They've taught us that to do anything less is moronic and irrational.
---
Why do you regret going for t-65? I'm currently going for it I have 3 pieces so far.
---
There  are things called 'strap ons'.......
---
You would need to email beth support.
---
There's nothing special about it. Think you get ported when you got aligned barrel or something
---
I see. But that only works on a 1 by 1 addiction basis then since only 1 chem at a time?
---
yes exactly. You probably would have spent the atoms if it was available. So Idk if this FOMO thing work quite as they expect tbh..
---
I'm online now and sent you a pan request
---
Hello, I’m on PS4, come join me on exploring!
---
I play casually, not every day, most of times alone, but would to join you for some quests, I like to do some dailies, and events like back to the beat, the giant teapot :)

Mostly agree. Check out Angry Turtle's youtube. You can wander around practically invisible and one shot everything with the right build. Doesn't look like fun so I don't do that. I like plunging into hoards and mowing them down with my collection of non-bloodied miniguns. I don't need Bethesda to buff all my armors and guns to have fun. People keep on asking to make the game easier and will miss that sense of accomplishment that current high level players have from earning their status.
---
I’ve been running Fort Defiance (just the ghoul side) and have been doing pretty well.  On average at least 1 3\* legendary.  (Some runs have non, some have upwards of 3).  
---
West Tek has been just as good, I have noticed a stark decrease in legendaries at Whitesprings, but I find that area less lucrative in general anyways
---
Aw man I like No Mans Sky and I tried to play a couple days ago but I have some weird phobia of deep water (and I guess deep space) to where every time I need to fly to a new planet, I get anxious/scared and have to exit the game. So fucking weird that I can’t get over it. 
---
Emerald Weapon from FFVI really messed me up as a kid.
---
and everything I DO find is Nocturnal.
---
im with you there
---
Make that good boi a suit of PA to play with!
---
I don't go to west tek as much as I should but I haven't had any luck there recently. Might try again later
---
yeah couldn't they at least keep the tabs of all previous items or something? maybe with a return date on or something? its sooooo empty when everything is greyed out because you already own it.
---
True the plan is fairly rare, keep server hopping and checking the bombed out building in harpers ferry, the one with the display cases, that's where I got all my marine plans I think.
---
I still can't find the plan for this. Still can only craft the suit!
---
You got me right lol Those near perfect items are too good to be stashed away or be scripted
---
Yes I have. I’ve tried the redo the entire quest line with no luck. I try the code and it says something along the line of “requisition limit reached”. I go downstairs to place it the tube or whatever but the prompt never comes up. The quest line is still saying “search Hornwright HQ”.
---
If you're on PC I'll happily make you a new one
---
You know what? I feel this but with hunter's/ghoul slayer stuff. I've had hunter's hunting rifles just to rub it in
---
I hand an Instigating vats critical limb damage hunting rifle, it was lvl 25 I'm level 70
---
Oh that’s the very first quest item! I’d start by looking through every entry on the terminal in the lobby. Just like you did the last time you started the quest.
---
Yep, I'm just waiting for Dying Light 2
---
Ah cheers thank you
---
That’s unfortunate to hear, I bought the SS chest piece before I started skipping days and crafted about 7 the best thing I got was a 1 star bolstering. I was thinking about getting fo1st for a month just for the outfits. I’m the same really I rarely if ever pick up the common guns enemies drop cause I’ve learnt all the mods for them, they never drop anything special only unique stuff I can think is marine armour that blood eagles sometimes drop but I’ve scrapped so much of that one armour and got about 2 mods for it (should check to see how many I have) but that’s it and if I had the mods for that I’d never be picking corpses for new stuff to either equip or to improve what I have already. At the start it was nice to find a leather piece to put on or something like that but end game isn’t anything when you have all you want.
---
Uhuh. Most people get there after some time if they're not absolutely delusional. People eventually realise how shallow the pond is.
---
Sadly, this is all you can expect from Bethesda. This is the kind of company they are. Focus most of their attention of monetisation schemes (soon we'll be up to 4) and not as seriously on bug fixes and content that doesn't directly give them a return on investment.
---
You can but do it at your own risk.   I lost 1800 gunpowder once because the game crashed on me and it was gone when I got back and went into private again.  I only use it for stuff I don't care if I lose like mats, ammo, or scrip.
---
You do realize there are different spawn points for the camp owner (even multiple if you teleport to camp while at camp) and visitors?
---
You'll need to purchase fallout 2nd for that
---
I mean I haven't attempted this at all and if u want to try this u should try it with useless junk 1st
---
Thanks, how’s the combat? I played the game a bit when it first came out is it still that basic and emphasis on exploration?
---
Gold bullion grind is about the only thing left to do.  
---
I crafted 25 SS left arms last night in a row and didn't get a single Unyielding that I was looking for.  Eff this game, lol...
---
It's probably just you. I haven't noticed that much of a difference.
---
Did you happen to try to build in the pond near Thunder Mt.? That's where I'd like to try.
---
Been doing that for a while, now I'm to the point where I'm out of rubber.
---
Anybody know a good source of rubber?
---
To be honest that does sound kind of entertaining, would definitely be better if your victim was in voice chat and they get confused.
---
I noticed something after fasnacht ended. Just seems weird
---
Pretty much any type of headgear that is on sale in the Shop is a buy for me, and there are other like me out there most likely, that love our headgear lol.
---
If we can make beds out of cigarettes and old money...
---
This can be done if you use world containers... however you will never be protected against servercrash...
---
Best of luck lol.
---
The messenger event shares the same awards as the savage divide events so you can get it from there too, along with the BOS jumpsuit and white powder jumpsuit.
---
Yes, couple of things to note though:
---
make sure you go directly back into your private from private don’t go into Adventure as you will lose everything ( happened to me cause I was talking to the wife and not paying attention🤪
---
🤪) 
---
Use container (for example suitcases at train stations) when transferring don’t just drop your times in a bag in the floor(although some do)
---
These are the two things I feel you should know
---
Hopes this helps
---
Yep
---
The one time I followed it led me to a Yao Guai.
---
With the Thru-Hiker perk, which I use, they weigh slightly more then purified water. But yeah I use these instead of purified water. But with people dropping it all the time I didn’t think people would pay it from like your camp vendor.
---
I think I have seen more recently.  I did a WS run over the weekend and I think I got around 6.
---
I have considered it. One of these days I might.
---
At the moment all my ships are anchored by the waterway at Harper‘s Ferry.
---
Yes! I got that one too. The 2 bears at the chem station with gas masks on, the one at a bbq with a spatula &amp; cigarette. Jangles playing golf looking like he needs the bathroom LOL. The all important easter egg at Seneca with Jangles &amp; Imported Panda...
---
Aye. It's mostly for junk legendaries and excess aid and ammo.
---
I'll keep a hold of the good legendaries until someone comes on
---
Got 1st for a month and it's nearly up. The private servers aren't really worth it tbh. All the good drops and rarer apparel I got from public world's. I have enough scrap now to last a long time, have my bloodied HM and full set of unyeilding. One shotting almost every enemy and it is tedious as fuck. 
---
I don't think I'll play it much longer at all. I'll still do a run of scrip and cash it in but my stash is already full of weapons to scrip, plus nobody wants half the weapons unless they're bloodied or junkie.... Maybe vamp. 
---
It was a good few months, but I'm pretty much done.
---
Do i need the fallout gold account as well?
---
Personally I move everything in lot a suitcase or cigarette machine gonto main menu and rejoin on different guy u want it on . But only for stuff I’m not fussed about lossing touch wood havnt lost anything and been doing it since first came out . But for high end stuff safer player to player
---
I like running riding shotgun because you’re practically guaranteed 1 to 3 legendary enemies, always max level as well.
---
These are awesome!! I have been scouring the wasteland for a big cave to build in and had only found one of these myself.  Thanks for posting.  Would love to know if you've found any more
---
I don't either. I also don't know why we can't change our character's names.
---
Nice! I consider myself lucky when I get 2 at a time. Now and then I'll see spikes and I've seen 3 legendaries in one room at the golf club
---
Just like 99% of drops. Nocturnal, troubleshooters, zealot... I've had one good drop and it was a 2 star BE HM. That's it.
---
If you're level 200, I'm assuming you put wayyy more than 200 hours into the game, so this makes sense.
---
It's not this game's (or any game's) fault for not keeping you consistently engaged for hundreds and hundreds of hours. I would say you got your money's worth, and like all MMOs, it's time to step away until the latest content patch.
---
A post like this would've made sense if you were a brand new player, but a veteran of this degree and for this many hours? Come on
---
I know that aubry dies if you pick the weong choice but thats all i know
---
Depending on your special debuff distribution, you could always take an X-Cell.
---
My advice for you is to engage with the thing that gives you anxiety. That is the only thing that will make things better and help you grow stronger. Hiding from it only strengthens the hold the anxiety has over you by reinforcing the habits.
---
It's painful and horrifying at first, but it gets better slowly, until one day you aren't reacting to things the way you once did.
---
Yea it is really funny especially when you do it as a team, hilarity ensues
---
Depends, sometimes I find "lucky" servers, 3 legendary ghouls , a fridge full of nuka cola and a perfectly preserved pie.
---
However today I was clearing out whitesprings because I hate ghouls and got 6 legendaries, great if you're wanting tire irons, boxing gloves and wooden armour...
---
Just Bethesda being Bethesda, it was perfect in fo3, NV. For some reason they changed it with fo4. Very annoying change that was unnecessary.
---
Congrats that’s a very low chance drop! 👍
---
My wife and I recently finished watching the Netflix series House of Cards,  my wife cringed when she saw one of the main characters (a congressman) playing on his video game console lol
---
Really? I'll give that a go later
---
Ohohoho you fool! You have to pay for such treats! In all seriousness that foundation paint idea sounds absolutely wonderful I’d love to see that I’m thinking something like the Tesla gauntlet on the arm purely decorative though of course or maybe it could add energy damage to bash attacks and the raider adds bleeding just to make power armour a little more useful although I’d imagine we’d have the same issue as the legendary mask that was added accidentally and people wouldn’t use anything else.
---
Aye. My alt camp is at charleston and i usually use the icebox out back.
---
Yeah, I'd notice a chance in the number of legendaries too if an event that gave you 1-3 legendaries on the hour every hour was no longer around...
---
That's..  that's kinda hot ?
---
Just fast travel to each fissure site....you’ll get at least one SB per Fissure.
---
Helped a guy finish in less than 15 minutes.
---
Oh yeah it’s a great event in my opinion.
---
Instigating 50 cal was my primary for a long time. It's a beast and uses very little ammo. I could pull 3k damage from it.
---
I've never had problems doing it. Just use world containers, don't just drop from inventory.
---
Good is a stretch imo. From my experience neither event spawns more ants than Defiance (maybe campfire tales with the bug waves and really lucky wet kindling spawns, haven't seen that one in some time) and you need to one-shot the ants before someone else does. Also you need to be around when the event actually happens and mostly finish it :D
---
Tales is okay if it happens with few players and you get to pick up a lot of wet kindling, I'd agree, but for really farming ants it doesn't really work. There is also a random settler (and raider?) event with ants that's quite good when it comes to the amount of ants, but the randomness makes that kind of meh as well for me.
---
She's her closest friend, throw in some Stockholm syndrome... And voila! They are each other's girlfriends...
---
Just one detail - is it homosexualism, xenofilia... Or both?
---
:-)
---
Lol! Or worse: flying doom boxes
---
You mean while you're out fighting monsters all day while he sits at home getting drunk with a bunch of his friends he wont introduce you to?
---
..maybe that's just me..
---
I’d have to look up to see if there’s any I’ve missed but I’m pretty sure I’ve done them all, I suspect they’ll be tiring fetch quests though like the majority of quests in the game.
---
Ouch! Sorry to hear that! It must have elapsed past the reset time. It to me twice and I was fortunate I logged in quickly afterwards. They do really need an intra- account system for this others than playing the Yo/yo with private worlds.
---
It's probably a glitch in the matrix. Be wary of anyone in a suit and wearing sunglasses coming your way.
---
Well that's kinda what I was talking about for example full set of raider adds damage buff xo1 gets energy resistance maybe add one for poison if you have a full set things like that or they may even add in more legendary perks with new dlc like they did with bow cards and wastlanders
---
Nope. You have to take the drug for temporary relief and most drugs don't stack.  That's the price of Junkies.
---
I'm not disagreeing with the end game content is lacking but the way you talk about a company trying to make money confuses me.  They have a game that requires alot of upkeep with free dlc(no matter how tou feel about it).  Do you expect them to still be living off the 60 dollars or alot less in most cases from almost 2 years ago.  What you call a scheme i call l finding a way to leave the lights on without requiring everyone to pay a subscription.  Do you have a better business plan for then besides the current industry standard?
---
Well, well... TIL!
---
Same. I'm level 105 on my main and 19 on my second character but I'm just bored. I really don't get how there are people between level 300-500. 105 already felt like much. Do they just do dailies and events over and over? Go all over the map multiple times?
---
I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually. I mean, he killed his brother, left the blood eagles, and in his voice lines he says he never really had anyone who cared for him (if you're in a relationship with of course). But, alternatively, if he does have friends I'm burning them with my flamer and using them as seasoning on my grilled radstag for him to eat.
---
Dont forget the now invisible truck in the yard next to the laundry house. And the now invisible car in the carpark by the train station where you can gather pans wood and vegetarian ham
---
Same here. For the last couple of weeks, I logged in to get my daily gold and exchange legendaries for scrip and then log out again. But for the last couple of days, I couldn’t even bring myself to do that. I‘ll spend my last 40 legendary modules today, if I don’t get something useful out of it, I‘m done. This is because the only thing to do right now is grinding for the new armors. But I won’t collect stupid scrip again and again to trade it for modules, just to get my 28745th zealot piece...
---
Unfortunately I have had this weird bug lately that when I crash, upon loading back into a world on the next log in, my load screen will freeze on the black screen with the vault tec logo in the corner once or twice delaying me from getting back into a world quickly.  Really don't know why but it started happening with wastelanders.  I have also been crashing a lot more since then.
---
That this is what we have to resort to in order to move stuff between characters in a MORPG in the year 2020 is honestly absurd.
---
I would settle for something to indicate on the map if a camp has plans for sale that I don't have.
---
Jeez big flex haha the cosmetics are tiring though they’re adding all the old skins back for limited times but I find it’s only half assed given you can’t apply them to any of the new power armour sets, armour sets or guns, I don’t see why any of the newly made camo skins aren’t available for the ultracite set it’s just lazy especially since ultracite was originally the best power armour in the game why is it always forgotten about? I know no one wears it but I would if there were some nice skins.
---
😂😂 I’ve plonked mine at Whitespring Train station close to vendors to top up my alts caps and near script machine to top up in scrip when I have too much scrip on my main!
---
I dont want spoiler anything but no there is nothing deep you can just decide at the end about the gold and if u side with the raiders and give rara Food she will open a door in the raid so u get a legendary
---
Roof top of watoga, there's one bent over a toilet with a ceramic gnome with a roll of toilet paper and an evil glint in its eye
---
I've actually had people suggest this. Like yeah give your shit away for little to zero caps. Problem solved. Wow
---
I wouldn’t say “SAFELY” 
---
But yes you can move stuff between characters. But things can happen and you could lose it
---
Other people have confirmed that this helmet USED to be able to be learned from scrapping it, but this is no longer the case.  You do have to read the plans now.
---
Don't skip any of the dialog and you'll get your rep. I had the same problem and I came here for it and thats what worked for me
---
My favorite glitch is when I run into a scorched or Supermutant with both arms stuck in the air but still manage to point their gun at you to attack.
---
Armor penetration has diminishing returns. So if you've got 75% reduction from Incisor, Anti-Armor will only halve the remaining 25% armor (for a total of 87.5% armor ignore). Additionally, since the damage formula is based on a ratio of damage-to-armor, high enough damage can bypass most armor completely on its own. This is mostly relevant in the extreme ranges of damage, like Bloodied/Unyielding builds with melee or stealth crits; at that point any armor penetration at all isn't doing you much.
---
At this point I’m just working up enough gold to buy the SS armor and jet pack.  I blew a bunch of gold on the stupid plasma caster weapon (ugh) but have almost enough now to cash it in.
---
No you are like the others in this thread your racism is easy to see.
---
See that's what I mean about preference some like the sneaky stuff(that's me) and others just wanna walk through and kill everything that moves and that's ok to I'm just sick of hearing people complaining that one biuld or another is stronger, the game is super easy no matter what (PvE) so just play the way it's fun for you
---
Well you have seriously inspired me nonetheless. Thank you!
---
Have tried deleting your stored managed data and hard reset your Console? I did that and it stopped that issue for me.
---
It’s not that the armours bad it’s just that the  regular secret service is better in all ways, (this is all from what I’ve heard) you can get to about the same carry weight as calibrated power armour, regular armour is more useful for builds (especially melee) more cosmetic options and less management, I know power armour doesn’t take much but it’s less work than regular armour.
---
Same here. I tried to login last night and was like,
---
“Why the fuck am I even doing this?” Was probably on for like 5 minutes tops. Meh. It’s summertime I’ll stay outside until they release something worth a shit.
---
&lt;voyeuristic “moo”&gt;
---
That Tesla gauntlet idea sounds fantastic, I kinda wish that the paints you get in game (like the quantum X0-1) would still give you bonuses with the full set painted since it's a bit of a pain to get them, itd be a nice reward to go along with the awesome paint instead of just a neat little reference and cosmetic, and maybe as a little reward for getting max reputation with both factions and getting full t-65, the secret service guys give you a paint for it, like a mat black, or even something funny, like a tie painted on the front of the chest piece, or maybe some kind of reference to Frank Horrigan
---
Yes. There's basically nothing to do.
---
After 350 hours I've basically done everything there is to do. I'm not the sort of person to go looking for godroll weapons either so that's not something I'll do.
---
I get on, look at my camp for 5 minutes and then get off.
---
When you get above 20k, convert some of your caps to an item that holds value and is easy to sell.  Like 5.56 ammo or something.
---
I’ve been an auto rifle build for over a year and now at lvl 337 I’m thinking of switching to heavy gunner as I have collected a few decent weapons over the months.  
---
Would have to figure out what to do with my 100K in 556 ammo lol
---
&gt;e tried deleting your stored managed data and hard reset your Console? I did that and it stopped that issue for me.
---
So i did do a hard reset.  For the stored managed data are you referring to the local saved data on the xbox?  I used to do this with ESO regularly but I did it with fallout once and it deleted all of the pictures I had saved so I am loathe to do this again.
---
Yeah, I got an instigating explosive one once that was level 5.  My alt vendor mule has it now for when his shop gets attacked.  I don't have any plans to actually level a new character though so the handmade I just dropped for a random level appropriate player when I found it.  I know people would have actually paid for it as a leveling weapon but it wasn't worth the hassle for me.
---
I sincerely hope the person I dropped it for realized it was a really good weapon and didn't scrip it or sell it to a robot vendor but I'll never know lol.
---
I bought a fixer plan just for my alt just so there's a slight chance i'll get that godly fixer when trading all these crap legendaries. I hit cap everyday for scrip on both.
---
Couple weird things, the more damage you do the less effective DR is. My heavy melee have far less taken out then equivalent explosive damage.  The 40mm is an odd thing does not seem to take that extra reduction, seem to be treated like a rifle/heavy instead and gets less taken out.
---
May I ask what the 3rd and 4th monetization schemes are?
---
Not disagreeing but Atomic shop and FO1st are the only ones unless you're counting the raider and settler packs
---
Oof that hurts to even hear, that’s gonna take so much time to even start building more again if you try and scrip them all unless you’re ok with destroying them (which is a complete waste)
---
I'm sure 4 is the season pass.
---
Oooo, also there's a workshop at Watoga, can't recall exactly where but near a red rocket if I remember correctly... on the roof, teddy bears playing 10 pin bowling :)
---
Due to the nature of the game—being an online shared world—the quest ending can’t be drastically different for anyone, so your choices don’t really affect the big picture. With that said, your choices do have impacts along the way, specifically on the characters you meet. They will engage in different behaviors, dialogue, give or block access to items, die, be killed by you or even backstab you and leave town. 
---
I ran the main WL quest 3 different ways and was really surprised just how impactful my choices could be and just how many characters can be erased from existence. It will be interesting to see how they handle it going forward. I really hope that those choices can have impacts on future content.
---
Funny you ask, I have IE versions of every rifle and pistol in the game.  For some reason I decided to start collecting those. The IE Lever action was my go to rifle until I discovered my IE Pipe revolver rifle.
---
 If I have more than one I would be more than happy to trade since I collect them. I'd be hard pressed to get rid of my only one.
---
As for materials and weapons I really don't need anything, I have everything I could ever want.
---
They did some weird wipe with Wastelanders, removing most of the items from the Atomic Shop. No idea why since they haven't really dont much to fill it back up. The past 2 months have just been them cycling the same featured BS. (Like we wanna see the communist pack for the 6th/7th week)
---
I just like wandering around looking at areas I haven’t truly explored and chatting with pals. Plenty of times I just run my diner and sometimes drop food for players that are nice enough to give me a heart or thumbs up or message me about my camp. I’m more of a casual player but have done most everything too, all that’s for me is Settler rep really and the atomic challenges. But I don’t know every area of the map well as for a long time I felt I couldn’t handle it, but last night I was finally fully exploring all the stuff around the pumpkin house (great playground, cool pumpkin fair thing going on) and killed the scorchbeast by myself (done many times so nbd) and the other scorched that were there and was just kinda like, huh, I guess I can handle myself by myself always. So I’m gonna walk around the mire and that northern area of the map and the cranberry bog some more. I think the most entertainment in 76 is camp building, but without others that can be lackluster.
---
Mate! I have had more luck getting fixers from my mules who have deliberately not learned many weapons plans and are above level 50 than my two main alts.. loot pool is too vast for them. Good luck though!
---
They already confirmed that all season passes are free
---
I did lvl 1-50 not knowing what was good/bad n stupidly spending every level when I got it so ended up with perks all over the joint n mish-mashed stats... the nI tried making a Shotgunner build so had to buy dozens of perks for that.. and found it boring since I just one shot bloody everything.. so I started making a VATS lever action bloody build.. I still havent finished getting all the perks/special sorted.
---
Well in the game in german localization Davie keeps calling that Sunny 'he'
---
Keep your chin up king your crown fell off
---
“It just works” 😂😂
---
Good ol' Immersion Emerson
---
This can result in having to do a complete reinventory\pricing. I've done it, just wanted anyone thinking of trying this to know what can happen
---
"Not a trap camp"
---
my mule alt used to be my main and is like 118 or something and unfortunately already knows many many weapon plans. I didn't think of that D:
---
I do have a 31 which has barely done anything in the game. I could level that one.
---
yeah :/ You could say I am EAGERLY awaiting the next patch hoping it will alleviate some of my issues..
---
Since you are clearly also slightly challenged when it comes to basic math, i will make the *pointless* calculations with demo expert rank 5. Here you do.
---
BE  **372.22** \-  **3387.19** \-  **2280.98**

WOW! YOU WERE RIGHT! TSE TOTALLY WENT AND BEAT OTHER COMBOS!!!!

As you can see, nothing changed. All numbers got a bit higher. But the AA is still better than TSE in real game situations.
---
I dresses him in full cowboy gear
---
I forgot to mention over half of them were 1 star...  Which helped with weight since I could scrip most of them immediately.
---
This is fisto's sister bot.

---
There is no option gold is unlocked after wastelanders is completed
---
Yeah get them 50 level first and see what happens .. my golden drops came from that one.
---
That’s sad to hear we might lose someone who’s hardcore by the sounds of it. I hear most people are bloodied is that true? If so I’m sure you can find buyers for those but yeah it’s real trashy that the scrip limit is so minor and the game is a complete cake walk with the right builds, I’ve been playing a while now without any real build so difficulty has been a mix for me but primarily easy cause of how poorly balanced all the enemies are in the game, like I said I was thinking about a bloodied build not sure how it’ll go as my patience runs thin if I’m dying all the time but hey no need to worry about that if everything’s already dead right? Haha
---
Oh you're surrendering? *BANG* OWW Ffuck... You bastard!
---
So do I get it from the quests ?
---
I did start to once, as it seemed it must go somewhere, but I was taking too many Rads and didn't have the right equipment on me to continue...never jumped in there again.
---
Guess I will now.
---
Completely agree, the locations don’t give you the same feeling as they do in past FOs. I loved being able to have a house in the Dugout. You felt like part of the community.
---
I know it my sound silly but try deleting the persistent storage on you Blu-ray device too. I have found this works too ... it’s like the bootleg neck effect.
---
Also u cant buy it right when u join the raiders u need to grind about 1-2 months to be allied with them to sell you the plan
---
Look how long ago the horse armor incident was. They're not going to change.
---
It’s sooo true I really wish my friend still played cause then the game would definitely be better.
---
Mabye I can help alittle with your issues.  I am a massive hoarder from every bethesda game.  Couldn't leave a short iron sword behind if I wanted to in my 9th play thru of skyrim. Even in prey I was always at that damn remodulator machine.  If you dont want to pay for first(I do for disclosure) you will need to break the habit of being a vacuum.  The general number I have seen is hold on to 50 of each material and bulk and sell the rest in your vendors or to vendotrons at the stations.  Caps suck and this game lacks any viable cap sink.  I buy recall card and treasure maps.  It needs a much better system.  Instead of unloading your vendors consider putting a switch to turn them off as your camp wont show anymore(people can still use them if they find your camp) or put them in a room with no windows and lockable door.  Dont keep ammo that doesn't sell .38, .44, missiles, 40mm, or mini nukes it add up in the stash box.  Seriously look at weapons and armor in your stash.  Will you ever use that troubleshooters bash damage 15vatsfill lvl 15 pistol...prolly not scrip it.  Last thing....take all mods of stashes guns and us the ultralight nod on all stored armor.  Hope this helps.

When you get to 20k caps, go buy a new serum recipe. It takes over 300k caps to get 'em all. Buy all the plans in whitesprings etc, that's what I'm doing atm. Caps are useless really, may as well spend them.
---
I know, right? This isn’t even industry standard. Industry standard makes you pay for DLC, this is all just optional cosmetic stuff or utility items that are so minor I still can’t believe people complain about. 
---
Note: I do not like the scrap box. I don’t think it should exist for anyone but since it does I do not think it should be paywalled.
---
OK if you know if I could save up to get it faster
---
Oh yeah that's huge part of the equation, at least for me, and it saves having to farm mats for ammo. But it requires time and available ammo to buy. I just ran out of wiggle room
---
While I highly doubt server stability would take much of a hit or some at all I think Bethesda just didn't find a way to advertize the PA displays yet. We got the stein display early and 'without all the steins compatible' because its meant as a way of advertising for the upcoming Season 1 that's going to reward various steins. I mean we already got various people if not the whole server in PA fighting at the SBQ and the servers are mostly fine still so loading a PA chassis won't be the issue.
---
For this guy it would be because you know something, something, something,....bUGTHesda Bad mAn!!!!!
---
So true. Now I finally decided to move my camp after 1 year. And now I wanna try something totally different. I went in looking for the nice baby-blue-ish building set (you know the most recent one, can't remember the name) and its nowhere to be found. I could potentially have spend 1200 atoms right there or whatever it costed
---
You say that the NPCs have nothing new to do or say after the first visit but isn't that like kind of a given with NPCs?  I mean, I don't think I've ever found an NPC settlement/town/village or whatever to be interesting or engaging once I have finished all of the content in that specific area.
---
No first complete wastelanders after that every day dailies and 200 gold and every sunday 300 gold
---
Not making 76 at all, for a start. The whole game is designed around it's monetization. 
---
They didn't make a game and provide fee content out of the goodness of their hearts, only charging money to keep the lights on, as you allude . 
---
They picked up a few tried and true monetization methods that are proven to be effective over a number of years and capitalize on a number of whales, and are doing what is necessary to keep those profit methods alive. These are clear design choices.
---
And it's not like they don't know how to make and sell games that aren't based entirely on long term monetization models. Or even that their fans are unfamiliar with such games. Their primary model for the last 2 decades in fact is proof of that. Almost all of 76s problems stem from the way it's monetized, and it's unnecessary because they already proven they can generate wealth without using these methods that cause so many problems with game design.
---
Heck ill give it a try.  Couldn't possibly make things worse.  Thanks for the advice!
---
I change Sophia around in the Unstoppables costumes. Right now she is the Silver Shroud. Figured she would appreciate the sentiment.
---
Pacifist mode in the menu helps with not getting tricked into pvp, also, welcome to the community
---
If they made scrap box for everyone I couldn't brag about my 75k organically farmed steel to all the poor people.
---
Yeah my guess is that i'll pick it up like that eventually. Working on the faction quests before the vault now first anyway so I can at least passively gain some notes during my normal play.
---
If it wasn’t for the fact that Foundation has one less loading screen than Crater for the gold press, I’d never go there. Even the Raiders *feel* more welcoming, at least to me somehow. Enough to where I switched from being pro-settler to being a raider mercenary for roleplay purposes.
---
I think there needs to be a series of events in both Crater and Foundation. A riff of the Fasnacht tasks and some of the other quests we already have. Something like:
---
* **Party Night**: Deliver 200 bottles of beer to the cooler in Crater for the party.
---
* **Cook-Out**: Cook 200 pieces of meat at the Cooking Spit in Foundation.
---
* **Shooting Match**: Players need to get 100 Bulls-Eyes on the targets below Foundation.
---
* **Raider Games**: Defeat three waves of ghouls with only bare fists.
---
...etc.
---
It's weird that the raiders in Crater are so interesting and unique, but the settlers are not. It almost feels like Bethesda did the raider part first then threw together the settlers at the last minute. There are various subplots in crater, three different dailies multiple interesting unique characters. They even have a more interesting character to turn in Davenport's photos to. For settlers we have Ward, the fake vault dweller, a single family and a bunch of robots that are just there for laughs. The most interesting settlers are the ones you do the vault raid with but they just hide out in the basement.
---
Shame i missed the double XP weekend D:
---
Yea... Challenges, few events for gold, maybe check the odd player camp out. I really think the factions should have been much more in depth for the end game content. Give me an instanced home in the settlement at full rep and let me run daily quests for each key player there. How bout an ammo run for the  vendors, how about you follow a group of AI out for a hunt, how about you go break into a toy shop somewhere for Rara? Annnnnything to make it feel like your part of the group rather than a stranger that drops in for one thing a day. I dunno the actual wastelanders questline was fun and interesting but once it's done your back to the same few events.
---
Not really, The Crater feels like a location that progresses. NPCs reacted differently to me as the reputation got higher. It actually felt like I was building a rep with them. Foundation has always had this same attitude with me despite increasing rep
---
all other rubber ducks are now less
---
Yeah, this train car. I've gotten the helmet, wetsuit, marine armor, and bos underarmors there. And no enemies if you're careful or have done mayor for a day)
---
&gt; Do you have a better business plan for then besides the current industry standard? 
---
This is just straight up BS. How many games do you know that:
---
1. Charge you upfront to even get access to the game (full price AAA price at launch), let alone Special Edition versions
---
2. Have a microtransaction store (Atomic Shop)
---
3. Have a monthly/yearly subscription (Fallout 1st)
---
4. Will soon have a catch-up payment for their season pass (Score rewards)
---
It's laughable to call Bethesda's monetisation practices the "current industry standard". This isn't even factoring in the cynical merchandising involved with the game too!
---
Look, I've never been against any company monetising their game. However, there is a clear difference between fair payment for a fair product vs a lazy, low effort cynical cash grab. 
---
I like most people people would be more than happy to pay a fair price for a fair product but this just isn't what we have here. That's why I was content paying a massive discount to get access to the game and will likely never pay a cent more. 
---
If Bethesda ever provides a good product worth paying for, I'd be more than happy to pay. However, this is Bethesda we're talking about. Without a significant change in management, that's never happening. Not with the game at the very least. Maybe with none of Bethesda's future games.
---
Ah, I only started about 3 or 4 months ago. Bought it last year and never played it. Bloodied is the most popular for sure. I don't die all that often at all as my character is pure stealth and I can walk right in front of enemies, but the AI is dumb as fuck too... Well, apart from being able to hit you from a mile away lol. Bloodied is like very easy mode. It's fun for a while, but I got bored of it after a couple of weeks. Gave away top tier bloodied weapons for free too.
---
'We' are but you also have to think about that there are people that buy simply for the action of 'buying' regardless of anything so those are the ones that Bethesda 'listens' too as they don't ask for anything but keep on giving money
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=U2elfmoa0fc
---
😂😂😂yeah I went from 30-55 that weekend. Kept hitting whitespring sleeping and guzzling nuka cranberry! In between😀😀😀
---
I still hear some new idle chatter if I stand in one place long enough; some of it, when it's directed at me, is surprising. but generally I agree with you, there's just something missing in Foundation..Crater too for that matter.
---
I wonder if it's the reputation grind that is tainting it for me. Normally I just want to get in and out as quickly as possible without any interaction or interest whatsoever..
---
I think I checked around last Christmas I had more than 300 hours and you make a fair point I certainly got my money’s worth, I think most of those hours if not all of those hours came from before wastelanders though and we all waited a long time for the dlc only for it to offer surface level content really.
---
&gt;...The idea is great, the execution was terrible...
---
this sums up so many things in the modern gaming industry. and yes, now you mentioned it, i can tell you i feel the same in relation to Foundation and the great green diamond.
---
They should open vault 76 and make it a player hub with traders.
---
Caps, Scrip,Gold all reset for every player different
---
I found this in another post. 
---
&gt;The masks do NOT drop from Enclave events (although I agree that they  should). They only drop with a 0.01% chance from events in the Savage  Divide (Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Messenger, Meditation, ...) 
---
So, yeah, you're best bet is either player vending machines or to do all of the public events in the Savage Divide.
---
H: legendaries W:croc backpack plan
---
Hmm I didn't really notice that but maybe I need to talk to more people.  I'm not a big "NPC" guy anyways and I don't think they bring anymore to the table than the robots we had before.  Although perhaps that is because of how they are implemented like you said.  Interesting discussion that I have never thought about before.
---
Would be a nice addition yea, I'd really like them to add some more engagement with camps too like maybe allow us to give a thumbs up rating to good camps. If I saw a camp with lots of 👍I'd probably want to go take a look. Might be great items for sale or a cool build, maybe just a rare tame animal or something? Atm your just hoping the 3k ammo for sale isn't all 38 or 5.56 at 50caps a round ha ha
---
All dailies (Except Ally) reset at 8pm EST.  Ally is 24 hours from last time you did it.
---
Scrip, Bullion &amp; Caps are 20 hours from your first purchase.  I skipped a day to get all of mine synced up.
---
Smiley reset at 8pm EST on Saturday.
---
I do this all the time as well. I've only lost stuff a few times and mostly because of my error. It's really easy to accidentally go in to adventure. Or forget you're on a public world and drop some stuff to pick up, log out and realize I forgot to switch to a private world. I did have one time where the suitcase I put stuff in refused to load and I lost everything. So, in other words, probably best not to swap your B2525 handmade between characters, but giving plans and legendaries to your alts is pretty easy.
---
I hit this point a week or so ago. I'm level 90ish and I can't find anything new to do. It's dailies, events, and SBQ battles when they pop up. The only time I die is if I'm caught off guard by something powerful. Even a 3\* scorchbeast isn't challenging. My build needs tweaked still (shotgun primary, rifle secondary) but given I rarely die, it's not that important. The scrip and gold grind has minimal upside compared to the time.
---
He’s even giving a little thumbs up it’s adorable
---
okay
---
I would have been happy to accept that as a misstep. 
---
However, between the increased season pass cost of Fallout 4's DLC with zero added content, embarrassing failure of Steam paid mods with Bethesda championed, Creation Club and all the truly flabbergasting monetisation decisions and failures associated with Fallout 76, this is just how Bethesda is.
---
You would have to be delusional or a moron to believe that Bethesda is going to change.
---
I find that it's somewhat impractical to *just* be melee, anymore.  My main used to be, but there are just too many instances where having a gun came in handy.  Not to mention the time-to-kill rate of melee is poor, because you have to physically go running up to each enemy.
---
Now, I mostly use melee for the Queen and little else.
---
Leather daddy, you mean?
---
I do have a level 13 as well. And i have the time at the moment to play a lot. HMMM!
---
We don’t die as easily as you think. Against regular enemies, even if there are more than 10, we can usually maneuver around them, jumping or running and killing them all.  I’m an unarmed, bloodied, unyielding build (how special and unique right?)
---
So I pretty much kill everything in one punch. The only exceptions being:
---
Behemoth =2 punches. 
---
Miurlurk Queen= 3 punches. 
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch= 8-9 punches
---
Sheepsquatch = 3-4 punches.  
---
Scorchebeast Queen =No idea how many. 
---
I honestly find myself falling to my death a lot more often than being killed by an enemy.
---
I just notice stuff I never really thought about when playing other games. It was something I noticed during the Wastelanders story. I'd go there and talk to specifically who I had to and the one time I actually looked around i found 2 or 3 sunny bots that I believe all sold the same thing and a family of named NPCs that don't really say anything. It just feels empty compared to other locations in BGS games
---
It’s not cheating if they aren’t alive. Everybody’s gotta indulge in a little Fisto every once in awhile.
---
You pick a side (Raiders/Settlers) to raid vault 79 with. (Note: you can still gain rep with the other faction afterwards.)
---
After the raid is done, you'll be able to buy the Gauss Minigun plans, with gold bouillion(750 i think), from the Raiders after reaching the Ally reputation with them (requires Lots of repeated quests, over days/weeks, to gain enough rep).
---
You can't get gold bouillion until after the Vault Raid quest is done, then Bouillion is limited to a per-day cap from treasury note turn ins and per-week cap buying it with caps from from Smiley in the Wayward (Guy wearing american flag cowboy attire, up the stairs from the bar).
---
I’m only close to level 200 cause of 2 double xp events I took part in (one before wastelanders and the one around the ghillie suit event) although if you’re just doing the dailies and stuff it does tick up without noticing really, there is a spot in the glassed cavern were you can get enemies to infinitely spawn with 2 people but I can’t imagine anyone doing that unless they’re looking for levels to reallocate stats or make a build, I also heard there was a bug to gain tons and tons of xp (this was a while ago) overall after level 50 levels don’t matter unless you’re making a build and need cards or need to reallocate. Personally I don’t know how people have reached that haha we all wish there was more content wastelanders was pretty lacklustre.
---
Now, that’s a good amount of caps right there. I got that same drop a few weeks ago, but didn’t know any of that stuff was rare. Almost just dropped it right there but decided to hang on to them. Found out here the next day that the masks themselves go for over 10k.
---
In two weeks you'll be making a post here about how someone scammed out in a trade.  Unfortunate yet true :\
---
And welcome!
---
very confusing but thanks! Will make sure I do everything at the exact same time to make it easier.
---
1. Upfront payment
---
2. Atomic Shop
---
3. Fallout 1st subscription
---
4. Catch-up payments for Score rewards (coming soon)
---
Also, have not factored in the various merchandising schemes, which are kind of separate to the game itself. However if you were to, the bigger ones are:
---
1. Special Editions of the game
---
2. Nuka Dark Run
---
3. That trashy blue 76 jacket
---
4. Probably a bunch more other licensing deals e.g. the mouldy power armor helmet edition of the game.
---
This works great. If you drop everything and get there in time. I had an almost 15000 cap buffer if that gives you an idea on how fast this can happen. I'm still amazed when I see multiple &gt;15000 items in a vendor. I mean the most anyone could potentially spend is 30000c but depending on the caps you're packing at that moment it could be quite a hit
---
Shes not worth it make time to go find you your settler wanderer shell have more appreciation for you and your camp and give you a daily side mission for legendaries lol
---
Again. This sort of stuff, just like the "camp photoframes" gets suggested every month or so, but is impossible and easily abused. You think people will use the feature responsibly, but imagine how many "gamer-word" or genitalia get featured in those descriptions. The easy defense to this is "JUST USE A FILTER LOL", but no filter is abuse proof. User generated content in-game is a huge risk and not worth the pay-off.
---
It's a shame how things don't change with your rep status that should almost be a mandatory thing if you implement a reputation system??
---
Pacifist is extra helpful once you start racking up mutations. Some PvP goads used to melee me to get one of the AoE damage mutations to hit them, opening up PvP.
---
I hear your. I'm not an expert on this topic, but I can't imagine it being impossible to focus a little more on different types of buyers? I mean after all we also fill up a lot of player base.
---
Yeah, you get Treasury Notes from doing Public Events or quests for the Raiders, Settlers &amp; Davenport (the Overseer's Bot) - you also get notes from the Riding Shotgun event.
---
Unfortunately, you'll only be able to turn in 20 notes per day (for 200 Gold) &amp; purchase an additional 300 Gold (for 6k caps) from Smiley at the Wayward each Saturday night (he resets at 8pm EST)
---
I currently have 880 notes, so it will be 44 days for me to turn them all in, if I don't get any additional ones.
---
How convenient that they have a lovely Scrapbox they'd love to sell you!
---
But really, you've seen through the veil.  Yes, the grind is onerous.  Yes, there are many systems built deliberately to slow you down.  That is, unfortunately, what it is beyond a certain point.
---
"Please assume the position"
---
If you glitch into them using the PA trick, they are empty inside.  The walls are transparent too.
---
Better be careful with that “glass” mini😂
---
Kinda hard to argue with the game shoulda never been made crowd.  But I respect your opinion.
---
What is boils down to is that the game has a dwindling player base and it’s not financially in there interest to fix numerous bugs and things like no skins for ultracite and secret service power armour, they want to appeal to people who build camps and how much they can customise their appearance in game with costumes etc, but that doesn’t add any meaningful content and what I’ve seen on the roadmap is trash, legendary perks which one one asked for, no quality of life improvements, more customisation options( like there wasn’t already enough of that) and like a few new fetch quests...kinda glad I’ve cancelled my f1st subscription because WOW that is garbage, time to go to a game where there are actually a proper dev team who don’t let bugs, hackers and micro transactions dominate the landscape of a game
---
Log in, check challenges, do the easy ones, 30 atoms, log out. Level 250. Bored as fuck. Stopped collecting bullions. *\*Sigh\**
---
The Burrows was their first attempt at a 'high level dungeon', which failed as it wasn't really instanced and cleared out most of the time in the early days and because of the single short quest there didn't add much to get there. Their second attempt where the raids which failed too....so now we know why they didn't add much more there.
---
Wouldn't be too surprised if I encountered a glitch one with this attribute 
---
Already encountered a scorch with acid rounds that 2 shotted me and I'm a lvl 287 vanguard build
---
just like to share that be carefull eating omelettes (I think radscorpion) because they can cure addiction.

Sophia in a harness is pretty good.

Not if I just don’t trade with anyone outside of vending machines.

I put him in a civil war dress and a Fasnacht jester mask.  
---
No one comes to my camp anymore .
---
Sounds like you need a break. It's okay, nobody will be mad.
---
Got a 1\* Hunters walking cane last night so I feel your pain.
---
I read a similar post months ago where some users referred the lady to discord. Apparantly all female discord groups do exist.
---
I haven't seen that one yet but I have to go to the caves soon to try for materials so I will keep my eye out.
---
It was just a baseline so peoe would understand. We need some sort of chargeable ammo for the gauss minigun
---
I've not long got myself a second character. made him a bloodied sneak commando. The only gold item I want is the ammo machine for either character.  
---
That build has made my main boring to play now.  
---
Also, if you feel upto it, try joining a RP group. That adds abit more spice back into the game too.
---

It really is ridiculous what you have to do to “earn” your gear it’s so time consuming and god help those who can barely find the time to play, that’s really sad to hear you may leave will you leave temporarily or for good? I was thinking about playing yesterday but ended up playing Star Wars all day cause I feel the progression and it has chaotic fun that I would have expected from 76 given its multiplayer in a wasteland I know someone could criticise me about “instant gratification” and blah blah blah but the thing about 76’s endgame progression is it isn’t rewarding, gratifying or anything but a grind, a simple one at that. Good luck today with your crafting hope you get your dream roll.
---
The two girls at the start of the game are from Virginia which they describe as worse than West Virginia. Although going there feels a bit repetitive, I'm curious about how it possibly could be worse than a place where everyone died.
---
“I’ve got my eye on you”
---
I'd tell you since I just did this. But I don't know how to hide spoilers. You have to use a terminal to open a door then go into that room and the key is in there. It's hidden. so you have to search quite a bit.
---
I'm thoroughly pissed off right now because I fought all the supermutants in the damn building and almost ran out of stimpaks and ammo. Now the game says I need to get the serum even though I HAD it before my PC crashed. I made it all the way back to my camp before the game crashed. When it crashed it threw away the serum. Had to get into the game a couple of times before I could get out from under my camp. (stupid damn game put me UNDER my camp) Then when I tried to talk to Sophia she was bugged and kept calling me a visitor. So, I had to scrap her console and add it back. AGAIN (this is about the 8th or 9th time I've had to so this. That's getting really old.
---
Bethesda. PLEASE create a QA department and you know, actually TEST the game before you release updates.)
---
Anyway, now I have to go BACK to West Tek, fight my way back inside the building, then fight my way to the lab (I still have the key at least) and get the serum AGAIN. Sometimes I really hate this game.
---
Hope you can get the rolls you’re looking for (then it’ll shorten the time before you can play with it all) have you had any fun with that gun? Forgot it was added tbh.
---
Ok good to know.  I do pick up a lot of launchers and scrape them all.  I compulsively pick up and scrape everything (hence the fear of scrapping the wrong item).  I will have to hang on to one because I really want it to rain teddy bears!
---
We do in a number of cases. You just have to buy the clean ones from the Atomic Shop when they're available.
---
Like a don't touch option.
---
The NPCs are a good addition - it took a little bit to get used to again, after being in an empty world for so long.
---
I'm still finding interesting random encounters all over the map.
---
yes we fill up a lot of 'player base' but might not be the large number of 'cash cows' or 'whales' that some modern companies cater to. While we could be 75k players as the majority that net Bethesda $75 dollar as a daily revenue as a whole there could also be one player that dumps $75k a week simply to get a satisfaction of having something regardless of cost. I'm not going into the specifics as this topic has been disassembled multiple times here and other places but it's a thing that shouldn't be underestimated especially with greedy companies like Bethesda.
---
Mine would definitely be “AFK safe! Cheap fixers and explosive bows for your level”
---
Hmmmm.  I don't think I found that one yet.  I definitely want one now.
---
Yea there's some enemies that don't seem to follow the rules of damage resistance. =/
---
some days they are plentiful, others not so much. Like 2 days ago after a SBQ I decided to farm some raw flux, encountered a pack of 3 legendary glowing ones, then went to west tek and there were 2 legendary muties. but yesterday the only legendary I saw was a Scorchbeast during a SBQ.
---
But have you guys seen the Atomic shop ?? Is updated on a weekly basis to keep you entertained and engaged.
---
Thank you! I love just exploring. And I’m gonna start back up with my cousin and I feel like it will be way more fun with someone to explore with.
---
I just see a bunch of Wards, meh settlers, all of them.
---
Get out your pitch forks and your downvotes someone doesn't agree with the mob.....this will not be tolerated!!!!!!!!!!!
---
&gt; I haven’t played since early 2020. 
---
That's a weird way of saying several months ago.
---
Wastelanders has added a somewhat interesting layer to the game. However, remember that same game that made you feel like not playing the game anymore is still the foundation of the game.
---
It's like building a nice house in a garbage dump. I mean the house is nice and all but it's on a garbage dump.
---
I started playing no man's sky on my phone via GeForce now. It's a good bit of fun as a mobile game!
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Oof, too soon
---
I’ve had this issue with nearly every ally. I finally got a daily quest with Daguerre after scrapping and rotating allies several times. I’d say just keep trying. Also, any ally won’t give you a daily until you’ve had them placed in your camp like 20-24 hours. I’m not sure the exact number, however many hours it takes for the reset.
---
I’ve only had that about once in every ten.
---
It's a cracking community from my experience after joining when Wastelanders dropped.  
---
Alot of folks had the same experience you're having of being dropped stimpacks and items to help you get by, myself included. It's partly why we do it now. Passing on the buck as it were.  
---
Alot of the time, those of us in the 'end game' as it were just end up with so much shit we can't use or vendor, it just makes sense to toss it to newer players who could use it or just don't have much yet.
---
Have you used the keycard in the slot? Have you got the keycard on you?
---
I know it isn’t the best solution, but try to find pre-built places to set up your camp. There’s a few in both the Mire and Savage Divide that I’ve done, and while I’m extremely limited with how I can decorate, everything *is* dirty already. Plus, with the structure being built already, you can save on a lot of budget. Like my place right now, I’ve put down as many things as I can without it just being a cluttered mess, and I still have a about half of my budget left. Those walls and foundations really add up.
---
Privates are broken for me. I can join other people's worlds, but no one can join mine for some reason. Server disconnect message every time.
---
They actually sell for 31 with max charisma, get yourself some charisma gear!
---
You can get fives pieces of charisma armor and casual wear can have a lining that gives up to 3 charisma. Hard Bargain 3 gives effectively 9 charisma. 
---
So max sell prices require an effective character charisma of 11 for selling and 16 for buying plans. (20 for selling, 25 for buying is the cap)
---
I totally hear you. And yes I think we’ve all talked about this at some point. Lol. 
---
But would they really know if another tactic regarding the shop is working or not before they’ve even tried to? Just saying there’s a looot of ways to make a shit load of money. But yeah you seem like you get it as well
---
The finger pointing one is the default free one.
---
The new main story is actually Great! It might be the best story bethesda has made in recent titles. I think it adds quite a bit to The immersion but it is wierd sometimes since the story revolves around you like a single player game, but at The same time it online. But IF you can block out the plotholes i think you will enjoy it quite alot
---
And? games rated mature anyway. Would still be fun and useful for those that don't want act like children. Happens anyways with Letter and Neons.
---
Truly one of the friendliest online gaming communities on the whole.
---
I see that a lot, one person hides and one melees
---
I scrap all mine too. The only use I ever found for one was to get Teddys out of tight spots. Otherwise as a weapon I think theyre utterly useless
---
Instead of taking the stuff out your vendors, store them or put them behind a locked or better yet, a shutter door you can remove the power from in build mode.
---
I dont want to see bawb every time someone says my name
---
We are halfway through the year... 
---
Anyway, thanks for the analogy. I don’t think it’s a garbage dump, though. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I don't know if you know this man, she falls for everybody.

After you finish the wastelanders quest line you get notes from running events that you can exchange for gold, to the tune of 20 a day, giving 200 gold per day. You can also get up to 600 gold a week for caps from smiley in the wayward.
---
Yeah that would be real nice I really miss my winterised T-51, it would also allow power armour to be just a little better although the bonuses could maybe be done like you pick a preset set of skills and they have a set lot of paints or you simply pick a bonus +1 strength, agility etc. Then the paints you have won’t be locked off between appearance and bonuses like in fallout 4.
---
When it happen, it actually happen.
---
Raiders really only have one because you can only do one of them per day. So if you log in every day it’s only 1 quest each.
---
That said, raiders also have the mirelurk meat you can donate which makes a big difference.
---
You could make the same comparison to a game like Call of Duty.
---
1. Initial game ($60)
---
2. Item shop
---
3. PAID battle pass ($10 version or $20 version) 
---
4. Ability to buy tiers in said battle pass
---
5. Several different purchasable cosmetic packs (separate from item shop)
---
This isn't including any merchandising, or different versions of the game or any collector editions etc. 
---
I'm by no means defending Bethesda (because the stuff in Fallout 1st should be free and their prices can be way too high in the atomic shop) but I do think their implementation of the season pass is a positive for the game. Whereas most are paid passes, they opted for free ones (maybe due to backlash but who knows)
---
&gt; I was thinking about joining the Raiders to get a glass mini gun 
---
When you're done with that, you should try to get a glass broadsider and play a bloodied build. Would be a hell of a statement.
---
Thats why Settlers will always be the best for me. Not much, but still plenty of interesting dialogue and callouts. When i walk through the Crater, its always endless complaining and whining left and right. Bunch of babies.
---
Haha so true.  If you're on PS4 and need anything, lemme know.  I'm sure I've stored some low level weapons and ammo in my stash that are just sitting there, wasting away.
---
What brought salt to the wound is the scorch was in ash heap, it 2 shot me a sizzle sound and green glow occured and no matter how many stims I was doing my health went down rapidly.
---
I always thought that the world was the main character of the game because it influenced my journey. It never ceased to impress me with new locations to explore and more secrets to discover. Thank you!
---
Epic scene, btw.
---
I don’t think Bethesda is done with the settlements, at least I hope not. I am hopeful we are only experiencing settlement 1.0, and more is on the way. If you think about it, Foundation construction should be visibly progressing each month. The settlement should be expanding over time. The population should be growing. If we convince NPCs to migrate to Foundation or Crater, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to encounter them on our visits and they have something to tell us about it. It wouldn’t be out of bounds to expect Meg and Paige to have more missions for us down the line. So I guess I agree with you about missed opportunities, OP, but hoping these aren’t really misses but just things we haven’t seen in the game yet.
---
Oh, you sweet summer child! 
---
Nah, while it's a generally welcoming and helpful community there are some real vultures knocking about so keep your wits about you.
---
We'll see how it pans out. Remember, only a year has passed so it's a little much for a newly settled location to be fully fleshed out.
---
Hopefully Bethesda builds on Foundation and the Crater year after year and we can see it grow into a decent sized settlement.

Equip a weapon without the junkies effect and all the stats will go back to normal when you hover over the junkies weapon in the pip boy.
---
I'm on Pc, an asocial veteran gal who  will chatter on your terms (might hear cursing every now and again). If you find you wanna travel with a bud, I'm Elizabeth.McKinley . I can help with quests and leveling, and I got a private server if you feel overwhelmed.
---
I'm at the point where I don't even get the max bullion every day. I just can't be bothered to do the events. Probably shouldn't admit it but I'm hoping for a settlers rep glitch to come out because I just can't do the dailies every day
---
Yea end game is pathetic. Still basically one boss and that boss can still drop 1 star items. Also the fact that you can only craft an average of 1.5 legendary weapons a day is terrible.
---
Yeah I do I just fully closed the game and everything fixed it self
---
Or instead of this annoyance i could be doing some fun event. Yet I'm stuck counting screws so i would find space to put that cool looking 50cal to display... And thats problem with this game: Here is some fun thing and with that comes some artificial limit that makes dealing with it annoying. For example daily scrip and bullion limit. Low camp budget and stash. Display cases require both stash and camp budget. Resources producers can hold few items. Fridge holds 15 items. Supply drop gives trash...
---
Well, the non-addiction version would just be the base weapon so look that up
---
Basically I always keep at least a 5000 to 15000, below the 30000c limit, buffer. This depends on what you have up for sale. You're all good until you hit 30000 limit at which point the buyer can keep buying but you're not gonna see any caps for your items. Whoever was at my camp definitely had some disposable income and "I definitely went over" 30000c. I didn't even bother trying to figure out by how much but it wasn't a few caps over it was 1000's .My only option was to shut down the ol Xbox until I had time to spend some caps or pull the power on my vendors. This particular instance sucked a bit more because I was helping my son level up at the time. It's not the end of the world to lose out on some make believe items. It just annoying and seems like an easy fix
---
I think we should have gained instanced player homes in foundation and crater upon reaching allied status with the factions. Use the same sort of instance as the overseers home or the wayward. Essentially everyone would end up with the same home but we could customize it how we want. Not that we necessarily need them but it’s be something to do once those grinds are over.
---
And i want desperatly imho a real fallout
---
I've rebuilt my raider punk radio ar least 5 times... I even tried deleting it, logged off and back in, and then rebuilt it...
---
I'm with you. As the jet pack is a power armor mod and not a separate item one would be under the impression that it should be included when you bought the power armor skin and it should be expressively stated that it isn't.
---
The best legendary I’ve probs ever gotten was a two star two shot explosive mini gun after all the nerfs. I often just cash in legendaries till I get around 200 scrip then buy a couple guns and just hope I get something good. I would just log on, do my dailies for gold, scrip and caps till I felt satisfied then just wander aimlessly till I think of something to do or just hope an event shows up that I enjoy.
---
You dont have to worry about that as you can get about  90% of mods from scrapping the rest come from plans
---
So, nothing shows up in the upper right hand corner? It should tell you to find a way to get past the laser grid.
---
Yeah and maybe have it trigger the vending icon to turn off when the limit is reached. I know we've all traveled to a vendor only to find it locked up because the seller is at max caps
---
So after you leave the lift, look around the first area for a blue keycard. There’s several that could spawn; try looking in the weight room, the bedroom, and the room with the bio scanners. That’s where they usually are for me. Then, go into one of the bio scanners, the same type that went into for the scorched vaccine early in the game. In another room there’s going to be an upright terminal with a keycard swipe next to it. Interact with the card swipe, and then get on the terminal to fabricate a new biometric ID card. From there, go into the room in front of the laser grid and swipe the card next to the two terminals. After that, the laser god should let you in.
---
I tend to have 3-5 points in Int for crafting, if I am running an explosive weapon I will put some in Demo Expert, but I would not commit SPECIAL points just to run it.
---
"The numbers are a lie". Power armor has a set passive DR and RR as a fixed % on top of what the armor pieces add. Stacking the defenses from standard armor onto PA's stats would be like peeing in the ocean.  
---
No matter what an armor has, PA will always stand miles above in basic protection just because of the hidden % alone.
---
For carry weight... yeah. Getting into one should *not* crush us like a tin can. I blame the addition of the backpack gimmick for that. Well, not the addition of it it's self, but how it was implemented along side power armor. Sure, we can throw on a pair of leg shocks to increase carry weight by 100, but that existed before the backpack.  
---
Maybe they should have increased the shocks to add 75 each for 150 total to even them out.  
---
Er.. sorry.. rambling thought &gt;.&lt;
---
Also, I saw you're on PC. I would love to come check the  boat(s) out in person, and I'd be happy to show off my satellite camp for a fellow build enthusiast. 
---
IGN: LastThingYouNeverSaw. I'll be online probably 11 hours from this post give or take.
---
Next to the tiny museum with lots of displays is an entrance on the middle of the street.
---
Back during the Santa Scorched event, that’s exactly what I did. Dropped a blueprinted defense/workstation with four turrets, a fast travel mat and a Santa Collectron. 
---
Don’t try to do the Defense missions. Let them get taken and then do the Retake mission. Fewer enemies. 
---
Plus if you have a good defense layout, some of the defense missions will complete automatically while you’re away. 
---
About once an hour I’d cycle through all the shops, collect my gifts, and then go back hunting for Santa Scorched.
---
Yeah but at least it breaks up the monotony a little bit. There is no mirelurk meat equivalent with the settlers? I know you can help either one when you come across a scuffle but it’s pretty random. I guess there are spots where they happen but it’s too expensive and time consuming to rely on. Also, and perhaps this is as intended but when I do a daily for raiders I literally get 3 pixels of the bar filled but the daily for settlers gives like 5%. I helped the raiders with the heist and kept all the gold for myself so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
Sure they *could* use another tactic to make money with the shop but it seems for their purposes they make enough and from their view why should they switch from a tactic that generates huge amounts of money (throughout the industry in general) without action to a tactic where they would need to be active and take action according to people's demands?
---
Hey, I’ve seen some people make Charleston Landfill look pretty nice before.
---
I’m so sorry
---
Followed one yesterday, got a decent plan and some good loot. Sucks that it tries to fight everything in its path though. Had to off a couple settlers to keep him from dying.
---
You may be right. I think I had false expectations that growing faction allegiance would open and expand dialogue with NPCs, maybe even minor side quests from lesser characters. I think Bethesda focused too much on metering the gold bullion rewards without considering how to keep the rest of the faction experience fresh and engaging.
---
I did it with two friends and it was mildly annoying but a good challenge . You are constantly defending one of them once you have all . The swarms start getting intense at some of them.
---
I tried this once. I got the last one captured after a few hours, this ling because I was jumpin back to previous to defend them, and not more than 3 min after capturing last one I crashed. Said never again.
---
I'm just worried that their focus will just be on the next big expansion. Rather than a fully evolving world
---
I like cooking vegetable medley soup.
---
I just run around and help people with their quests.
---
Yeah why should we ever try to change some of the old methods?? Maybe that’s healthy sometimes. ;))) 
---
That’s maybe my problem.
---
But imma stop it here. I get your point. I just don’t agree. 
---
But thanks for your inputs man.
---
Any event in the Forest has a chance to drop the outfit and helmet.
---
I'm nearly 1200 hours in and the only 2 I have were traded for.
---
It’s the sound that’s giving you away, try muffling your leg pieces especially if your armor is heavy. The wood porches at white springs for all the houses etc give off massive detection sound when you walk on them that is ridiculous. As far as wes tek goes its also sound detection from the metal flooring from enemies above and below hearing you. Like I said Footstep sound goes out in a big bubble all around you and the game engine doesn’t seem to take into account different floors or levels in an area. Muffling leg armor seems to be the only way to counter it.
---
I’ve discovered I think most if maybe not all fast travel locations (there’s unmarked stuff of course) so there isn’t much in terms of area exploration, I did buy a couple of the camo power armour skins and begin taking screenshots in their respective areas which was kind of fun (still need some with my outfit also real shame there’s nowhere snowy else I’d have probs bought the winter skins) but that’s about it really.
---
The problem is Bethesda didn’t really do much with fleshing them out.  We have the raiders who talk a lot about being bad guys but frankly aren’t that bad, and the settlers who are pure as the driven snow.  When do we see them really doing things in the wild?  Well, raiders are making a living killing mirelurks for food, and up to something at that spot in the TV west of crater.  It’s be awesome to see their areas updated each major patch along with seasons, adding a daily quest or two, but frankly I think if that was occurring we would have heard about it already from the test realm.
---
The settlers just aren’t boring because of their settlement, they are boring all around.  Would make a lot of sense for the settlers to be almost a bit BoS like:  they are super protective of equipment, sorta like wards quest but that is their thing.  They value the tools to rebuild society as much as people.  Wouldn’t hurt if their fusion generator was in almost a holy place, where that old tech was protected more than people.  Exiling people for fucking up their tech, things like that.
---
It would also help putting them at odds with the BoS, who wants tech to keep it from falling into the wrong hands.  Would help to focus a hoarde tech versus use tech angle, a reason for faction opposition versus “we good, they mean”.
---
Did you get those numbers out of your pipboy or you’re just a proud owner of a calculator? I don’t have many weapons with me but I’m looking at the numbers of my Gauss minigun in pipboy, the numbers are
---
B: 312, TS: 258, J: 253, F: 169, Junkies is with five addictions. Furious of course needs to multiply base damage by 1.5. AA is much lower than those so I scripped it after doing some tests. The tests were done mainly using the behemoth in Solomon pond. Those numbers are very similar to the Gatling gun numbers.
---
I was using voice type. Damn you AutoCorrect damn you
---
You want sheepsquatch?? This is how you get sheepsquatch!!
---
&gt; I do think their implementation of the season pass is a positive for the game 
---
Eh. I'm not 100% convinced. 
---
Don't forget, it took Bethesda 3 weeks and a crap ton of pressure from the community and media before they made the decision to make all future Seasons to be free to get it to this "positive" state.
---
On top of that, we're guaranteed to get fewer Atoms now that challenges don't directly reward them. 
---
So you have to work towards getting a bunch of things you may not want for the things you do while at the same time making it harder for you to get the things you want to get from the Atomic Shop for free, pushing people even further into purchasing Atoms to get all the items they want from the store. 
---
Yes, we get atoms from Seasons but if they're heavily backloaded, then we'll get even fewer atoms than the already fewer atoms we're already expecting to get.
---
I mean it could be all ok but specific implementation matters. We'll see soon enough I guess.
---
Ah phew lucky haha
---
Firstly, complete the Wastelanders quest line, side with the Raiders if you wish to get a Gauss (not glass) mini gun.  
---
Once the Wastelanders story is finished, you'll accumulate treasure notes from completing events and daily quests. You can trade in 20 treasure notes for 200 bullion a day at a machine in Crater or Foundation.  
---
Now start doing the daily quests for Raider reputation.
---
It will take time, likely about a month to get the required reputation, by which time you should have enough bullion if you've kept on top of things.
---
I also played the fallouts and Skyrim as a sneaky lady build. I always play games solo because I’m such an anxious person in a lot of what I do. I am generally anxious to join in a party chat. That is until recently. I actually joined a chat &amp; met a group of gentlemen who helped my build significantly. I am now confident in saying I am a bloodied melee lady trying to slap the SBQ. So far I only hit it for a 1500 per hit if I successfully sneak. It took awhile to be confident enough when people would ask me my build I would get flustered. One day I’ll hit her for 5000. 🤓 
---
Keep sending it woman 💕
---
What’s the fridge fiasco? I’m curious.
---
Just do a loop around cranberry bog. I did that last night for a few hours and got 25 legendaries.  Nothing good of course, but quantity.
---
Stop telling people this, I sell a lot of Vanguards/Blostering armor. /s
---
Well, I got the game just with the release of Wastelanders. I hesistated buying the game bc  of all the problems and its mmo-style. (I‘m a fallout-veteran) But i liked wastelanders with all the npc, crafting, a.s.o. But then i experienced the endgame. Oh boy, its underwhelming and boring. Now: i just do the atom dailies. Its sad bc its a sort of fallout-game with potential not used
---
Could just modify the assaultron ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I hear ya, and yep I'm definitely and active member in the "economy". I've got all the serums and now I'm working through any outstanding plans I stumble upon at player vendors. I really enjoy the buying\selling aspect of this game way more than I would've thought. And in the current scheme I know people are holding back items to avoid going over limit which sucks for the buyers as well
---
I'll give it a go. Thanks for the heads up!
---
with the upcoming update, you  basically get punished for leaving the server
---
Yeah, I know what you mean. I absolutely hate autocorrelation!
---
Peggie?
---
I'm getting real tired of those thorn bushes...
---
There are tons of random spawns,  SB's, and locations that have max level enemies. 
---
I have good luck capturing bog town and doing defense events along with mr. Messenger
---
Oh, I don't see Foundation changing for at least a year. I'm not expecting anything fundamentally changing aside from the new location(s) relevant for the upcoming DLC.
---
I've done a few but not all. You soon realise the rate defense events pop up is ridiculous. It's bad enough holding 3 for a while, which is what I usually do.
---
Not really I find, bashing with a weapon wrecks it's durability fairly quickly. I mean sure it will work, as long as you bear that in mind.
---
That is exactly what Operation hOpe4FUTURE did. We're a group of vault dwellers that found the remains of the BoS, saw the scorchbeasts, and decided we needed to pick up the BoS banner and rebuild.    
---
It has really worked out for us and has been a blast.
---
Ace!  Thanks!
---
I don't think that has happened to me yet...but now I'm worried.  I planned on totally deconstructing my place and rebuilding.  I have new ideas on camp layout...plus the XP and Atom points don't hurt.  But I had hoped that displayed items would be kept safe and used last (planned on just moving displays until I built to prevent that). 
---
Have you found a way to prevent that while building?  If I unbulk all my materials and keep those items displayed will that at least lessen it's chance?
---
Are there any particular spots I should try or just do loops?
---
Yes there is no content on this game, and next update is more monetization/ new chore list. I'm taking a break.
---
I don't doubt that for a moment! We wouldn't be players of the game if we didn't have a certain amount of tolerance for crap :)
---
&gt;Why do we have to beg Bethesda to tweak or fix basic MMO game mechanics
---
Bad design.  Bad design.  Bad design.
---
Went over my scrip cap today by accident too.  So much stupid in the game.
---
So *that’s* why my Bloodied Fatman with 12900 damage did exactly zero to the Queen!
---
Don't look up pegging.
---
If you know what it is, that's what I was referencing
---
Yes, I experience all those symptoms too.
---
That's what I'm saying. There's no response at all, no surprise no rage. It's like they don't care. They dont even acknowledge his existence. At the very least they could be a little happy that their god is there fighting their enemy.
---
Ah, the entrance to the underworld
---
Then fix the engine.  There is no excuse.
---
I just run the outer edge and go to all the locations. Like I said, there are lots of random battle locations in the Bog, so you will run into lots of stuff.  Always SB's flying around too that seem to be legendary pretty often.
---
I was just thinking the biggest draw back with a bow is close in. Thought that might help. Maybe I'll put it on one of my high health characters and go bashing tonight to try it out.
---
I might just see it differently from others I guess. 
---
If you were a dedicated player (since the beta) playing almost every day or at least completing your weekly challenges then you've earned well over 20k atoms. That's not counting daily ones. The way I see it is, if you're in that position (I know a lot of people probably aren't though) you've got your moneys worth and can't keep expecting loads of atoms. Most AAA games won't even give you the chance to earn the premium currency.
---
My main concern with the pass system is how we will progress through it. They said we will earn score by just playing normally but the thing is, by the time the pass is implemented most players have done everything and it'll just be another forcing themselves to play the events we've been doing since Wastelanders, this time for yet another grind.
---
Unless substantial DIFFERENT content is added alongside the pass, its just gonna be yet another chore. Instead of being something that could be fun to progress though alongside new content
---
I might make a day of it at some point then. Thanks!
---
I’ve done this too. Try with another ally maybe? I think most of them are still bugged for me. I have an alt character that got a daily from the guitar lady no problem. On my main I only got Daguerre to work after a few weeks. It’s very frustrating. I empathize. You might want to put in a ticket to Bethesda if you can’t get it to work.
---
Haha, I’m not trying to diminish anyone’s expectations of the game. I was just explaining how I’ve stayed addicted to the game at 1900hrs in, and that it took looking at the game as more than just “kill tough enemies, get good gear”. But shit, if that’s what people are into, that’s fine. It’s just that kind of end game goal is so limited, once you have the drops form whatever the new content is, you’re just waiting on the next new content. And once again, that’s fine, but you gotta realize there’s a wall that you’ll keep hitting until the next drop. Good news, there’s new content coming. Bad news, people will burn through it and go right back to complaining. You gotta change up your end game goals some or just move on to something else imo.
---
The endgame of 76 is realizing there is no endgame and you can go play something else for several months until new content comes out.
---
If you’re starting an Xbox Ladies of Fo76 clan I am so down! I enjoy puts’n around hitting up pristine pie claw machines. 
---
If you want any pies I have too many to display at the moment lol
---
I'm wondering about the timeline. Since Wastelanders was supposed to be released last year, I wonder if the Fractured Steel story will skip another year forward or if it'll just be a few months
---
This makes sense, in fact the best legendary perk suggestion I’ve seen, but I don’t see them reducing rifle weight as it is the only drawback to the class. At that point they might as well either eliminate everything else, or make everything equivalent to a fixer.
---
I thought about something like about giving the player a home at the settlements, I thought what if they added a bunch of flat open ground with a concrete base and the player is forced to put their camp directly in the middle of it then it presets their area of building to the square imagine walking through a shanty town of player homes how great or cool could that be? I really like that shop idea for a quest. Unrelated but if the enclave were developed I’d have liked a checkpoint event were you frisk people and search caravans for bombs or something like that (bit like the van grafs mission in view Vegas) before you let them into a settlement or something, you could maybe silently steal from the caravans and they can send assassins or collectors to take the items back.
---
Bitch just always has a headache anyway
---
I've found that in general most people are quite friendly, and most have stories of friendly high levels helping them out when they first started.
---
New player tip for those that aren't aware, check the suitcases in train stations when you go in one, it's the unspoken place that everyone dumps stuff they don't want, or to help out lower levels. 
---
I leave water, radaway, stims and ammo in there regularly also legendaries as well.
---
It's on the right side in the final hall, a little bit behind the spire that has some nodes on it.
---
I’m feeling the same. I enjoyed wastelanders a lot and was enjoying the endgame for a while. But doing the same 3 dailies and only being able to get 200 gold a day, it’s started to wear on me as of late. The events and survivor challenge kept me engaged, but now that nothing’s going on, I realize how shallow the endgame still is. So I decided to slow down a bit. I’ll come back once the new season starts and when the new quest line starts but I’m gonna take a break for now. Which sucks because I really wanna play. But everytime I turn on the game now, excited to play, I sit in my camp for 5 minutes, get upset that I’ll have to do those same dailies, turn of the game and play something different.
---
Let us know how it works out, I haven't got any of the bashing perks myself.
---
Got a full set of 3star Vanguards SS armor, Junkies Gauss Gatling, Junkies Gauss Shotgun. Last thing I got was the secret service jetpack two weeks ago. However I didn’t even bother crafting it. I was just done with what I played towards. Nothing left. Will come back when seasons are introduced. Hope it will last longer
---
I love my Strangler suit, but as more players start building them, the price of calibrated shock and emergency protocol plans is likely going to skyrocket.  Getting those to drop off the SBQ is about as likely as seeing a unicorn.
---
As a " thing " to do it's a bit of fun. It can take some time tonset up and first defence. But you become quite adept at it once you decide to also drop extractors on everything. 
---
As above I ignore the defend and do the retakes. Also as said before,  the retakes usually finish just after you arrive and its easier xp when free travelling to each workshop.
---
For me I kept  looping but always 20 to 30 minutes I go to Poseidon to grab the cores as they stop at 3 per 20 minutes ish ? Then off to another retake event.
---
Seriously though, the fun wears off. Ive not done the figures but I believe I can get more loot and xp doing materials runs. 
---
Lead plastic steel etc etc while jumping in and out of Poseidon for those cores and maybe the lead there as well since it can be connected power from the station and not a generator.
---
But give it a shot. Consider it a personal challenge. Some thing to pass the hours in the wasteland.
---
Also i have ps4 Spotify running in the background to catch up on new music so double win for me.
---
Oh don't get me wrong I'm completely with you and want something to change as the shop could need some change in tactic and offers but the issue is as long as companies like Bethesda only listen to money there won't be much change sadly as long as whales buy everything each update only to be able to say they have everything.
---
It’s sooo fucking annoying man just make it all 8 for gods sake
---
Basic functionality working as intended, yes.
---
The fucking menus don't even work properly, I have to use the keyboard in the perk cards because the mouse doesn't work properly there.  Basic basic basic functionality. 
---
And yes, I had TWO main story quests that didn't work so I couldn't even complete the main story until over a year after launch.
---
&gt;Unless substantial DIFFERENT content is added alongside the pass, its just gonna be yet another chore. Instead of being something that could be fun to progress though alongside new content
---
This is Bethesda we're talking about here. Given their track record, do you honestly expect any different.
---
I mean they could change but you know how that famous saying goes:
---
“There's an old saying in Tennessee — I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee — that says, fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.” ― George W. Bush
---
I vote for a respec feature also!
---
When nuked, it is a good spot for farming nuked floras and nuclear liquid (don’t remember the exact name). 
---
And even without nuke, the ghouls run in the houses area is good for a quick xp boost. 
---
When you add the shopping area to the equation, it is a popular spot for many players (which explains all the murdeours lvl60+ ghouls).
---
Is she still there?
---
I'm very aware. I was suggesting an alternate name relating to it :I

Here I robbed a super mutant.

---
I'd love to have raid/defense events. Man the walls against attacks, like Line in the Sand. Hell, i watched one of the guards stand there getting his face chewed off and he never reacted. I finally put the bear fown for him, and not even a thank you.
---
I will I don't have any either but I have plenty of saved levels lol so I'll probably perk a couple points in it.
---
Oh and don’t get me wrong either. 
---
Too much business talk just short circuits my brain lol. 
---
Business is what took me down with stress multiple times. 
---
So sorry if I sounded annoyed at any point man. 
---
But yeah it’s just sad to see how transparent it has become. 
---
We can clearly see these “tactics” and people feel used or manipulated sometimes/maybe often. 
---
But yeah that’s business and sales I guess lol.
---
Cool!  Sounds like another photo op.  I will totally look for that.  I love those little details they put in there.  The devs had some fun!
---
I’m learning to cycle in and out on this game. I came back from a long break for Wastelanders, and really enjoyed seeing all the changes around Appalachia. I think I am one fetch quest away from earning max Settler rep and the last trophy I need for the game. I’ll probably celebrate by diving into a single player game in my backlog for a while. Then report back to Fallout 76 duty when season grinding starts up.
---
Never thought about how much there is for camps and outfits compared to everything, no tattoos or hairstyles added since release still nothing new for ultracite since release, I’ve never encountered many bugs playing the game (nothing game breaking or anything like that) fortunately. Some of the stuff in the battlepass does look terrible and they’ll never or it’s incredibly unlikely they’ll add older skins to new suits etc.
---
If you side with the foundation it locks you out of a possible legendary plasma rifle drop, which you can get by assaulting the vault with the raiders. With regards to what happens after it doesn't really matter I don't think as you can max rep with both factions. There are few consequences for choosing one over the other.
---
Personally I would have preferred actual downsides with real ramifications, but hey.
---
&gt;Problem is they are all game breaking bugs
---
Keyword is 'all'. I know there are some bugs that make you throw the mouse through the monitor when playing, but saying that all the 'pls bethesda give us X' posts on this sub are game-breaking things is exaggerating and not true at all.
---
Yup. I had a 10 month hiatus from the game until Wastelanders launched.
---
Not there yet with the current game since I haven't had much time to play but it'll be the same again once that time comes if there is no new content to hit up or worth hitting up.
---
The "DLC" as we describe was enough to make me thing the game had reached an acceptable quality level. If the game had launched with Wastelanders, I might not have been so miffed to begin with. 
---
But they frame it as a free thing you get, rather than a chunk of the game that wasn't included at launch. Literal NPC's *in a Fallout game* are added as DLC.
---
Or you know, they could have given it for free. It was one of the most requested items. Yet they decided to make it for money and after you buy it you find out it sucks dick... And the big cryout was mainly because community didn't want to p2w features to be introduced in game.
---
Fuck ever since first expired for me I've lost motivation to play. The inventory sim game got so boring.
---
I think the game would crash immediately if we had a settlement and player homes all set up together heh I like the checkpoint idea though, stuff like that where your working as part of the team would be more fun than run off across the map shoot some random n come back.... We'll see what the next BOS quest thing will be like I guess. I imagine it'll be very small scale though
---
Thanks for the recommendation I’ll definitely check out those rp groups, didn’t know there were groups like that.
---
Couldn't agree more. We're supposed to be rebuilding Appalachia yet nearly everything we build is dirty or broken. If my character knows how to make a freakin' toilet from scratch then why in God's name would they make it all cracked and useless? Same goes for the large rugs. Why would I sew a rug together full of holes and rips? lmao
---
Grafton High School
---
Very nice mate, congrats. I'm still waiting on my main for that drop.
---
I got lucky with my laser rifle. It almost never breaks.
---
Lol I did actually look forward to the shop updating cause it was the only fresh content that would come.
---
Ah. She's gone now. I wonder if it's because i left the area.
---
What's missing is hookers.
---
That sounds great! I will message you my psn.
---
I was thinking about maybe forcing myself to do the dailies then that’s it for a day along with atom challenges but that’d be it.
---
I don’t think I‘ll completely stop playing but as it is right now, I just don’t really enjoy it. It feels like a obligation, not a fun hobby. I took a longer brake before, which really was good. After the break, I enjoyed it again (Wastelanders) and played every night for multiple hours. But that changed again. And that’s too bad, because the concept of the game itself, meaning a postapocalyptic online multiplayer game, is 100% my taste.
---
I bet it sinks.
---
I made a low level toon for storing, i give the things i want to scrip to him through a friend and now i actually have room to spare in my stash box, as for the vedors you can always store them or cut access to them when you are around the cap limit.
---
Awesome!  Thanks I probably only picked up a couple early game and missed the rest.  I do think I found a couple there but was unaware that there was most bears found in a single location.  That's great!  I'm still missing a few for the colector badge too.  But bears aren't the only thing I'm missing to complete that one.
---
Yeah it felt like wastelanders was how the game should of been released . I didn’t even finish the rep grind because it’s so fking boring , long and repetitive
---
Oh I knew there would be. I’ve played enough ARK to know how scummy people can be lmao.
---
Currently, I use 2 melee weapons, a combat knife, and the Black Diamond ski sword. Both are pretty decent, my only problem is they break super fast. I have I think the lowest tier of the Makeshift weapons perk but they still break fast.
---
In the words of Todd Howard "It Just Works"
---
I buy assaultron key cards if I have to spend caps.
---
Cool thanks!  I want to rebuild my camp and I'm affraid they will get scrapped by mistake.
---
Suitcases at train stations? Had no idea that was a thing! Thanks for the tip! :D
---
I swear to God people only buy your high value items when you're close to your max caps. I've lost thousands of caps to this. Why hasn't the max cap been raised to like 50K yet? This literally just happened to me this morning.  
---
Honestly, if there was an option to prevent people from buying so I didn't go over my caps limit I'd put it on in a heartbeat. Sale be damned there's always potentially another buyer, but wasting resources for no reason, even one as easy to get as caps, feels terrible.
---
Yo she needs to talk to the one settler in watago, she is all about that machine love
---
For a but when i spawn in the world is pink. I think i took a picture
---
personnally I just would like being able to press the button stimpak once, and being healed as intended... instead I have to smash the button 10 times, and sometimes I get healed....
---
I mean it should have never been made the way it was. Not necessarily that a multiplayer fallout shouldn't exist.
---
It was built from the ground up with these monetization models in mind. They marketed specifically on not being anti-consumer, touting a cosmetic only cash shop, only to walk that back because Hines spoke out of turn without consulting the people in charge of monetization. They always intended to sell utility items because the game is clearly designed that way. And almost everything wrong with the way the game is designed stems from these monetization goals.
---
ESO is a good example of "making a BGS game multiplayer". It isn't a retrofitting of the existing engine, it's a standard themepark MMO with the trappings of the elder scrolls. It's got some pretty silly monetization, but it's modeled on standard MMO fare and it doesn't really get in the way of game design. Multiplayer fallout could have been made many other ways. An MMO like ESO, an isometric throwback like FOnline, a reimagining of the Project V13 game that interplay had to abandon. 
---
Hell, even a game almost exactly the same as 76 would work better if it wasn't built entirely around monetization. Everything drives monetization. The grind. The artificial limits imposed on the player. Gameplay design that is intentionally irritating so that utility solutions can be sold. A subscription service that reduces the artificial limitations on the player as well as gates off private servers, and mods as well if that ever happens. And now the same live service seasons we see all over the industry, of course with the option of just buying all the goodies inside when the previously mentioned grind becomes too tedious and annoying.
---
Yeah that makes sense. I’ve had to try and politely decline a few offers just because I don’t want TOO much of a boost. Still, it’s nice to see how generous some people can be!
---
That may not count other damage modifiers( I’m not sure if the pop boy damage does) so you may just want to craft a non legendary gun of the same lvl and equip that
---
There are other spawns even better than that where ants spawn fighting a large enemy, but I'll leave that one a mystery here.
---
Agreed.   I remember thinking "this has got to be a joke".  Lol
---
I'm a fallout first member, so might be easier for me to get atoms, but I wait for sales on repair things in the atom store and buy them lmfao. I don't know a good way to get them other than that
---
No problem, lots of people still don't realise this is the case. I've had level 40/50 players get really excited when they find loads of goodies just sitting there to be taken by anyone. I sometimes leave full sets of power armour in stations as well, the raider and T45 at least. They can be a pain to farm at low levels if you don' know here to find them.
---
They’re easy to make.
---
As a previous comment said: The Weapons mostly stay in the same position.
---
Another thing is that most Animations are repeated over and over again, they’re only a few Unique ones.
---
Personally I find it a shame, the current animations are just so boring and static, they have no weight behind them.
---
You can generate 2k in 1 hour per day doing a few events and selling the crap you get to the vendor.  So 15 hours spread over 15 days.  This assumes a leveled character who can carry 1400 caps worth of vendor bait, craft effectively and kill things with minimal effort.
---
Because of vendor limits, to generate caps faster than 2k/day you need to either be using alternate characters/accounts to do the same thing, large amounts of grinding, or selling stuff to other players.
---
Since the start of Fasnacht I've averaged about 10k/day with minimal effort, although that has tailed off considerably in the last week as there have been a lot fewer people buying stuff.
---
I know atom shop sells clean stuff, which is why I didn’t include it. I mean for situations like the American flag you place on the wall. It’s dirty and worn out with holes, but you can also buy the American flag with tadpole badges and you can place a brand new shiny American flag on the wall instead.
---
Lyon's wasn't a nice guy either, he ordered any ghoul to be shot on sight, Maxson's brotherhood is arguably more moral on that front, if you shoot an unarmed civilian, (non feral ghoul or human), Danse will get pissed and say it is against their code of conduct.
---
For a few weeks I was basically signing in just to hit all the daily caps (gold, caps, scrip). I'd do a settler daily every other day when I felt like it but it's all just so hollow and unrewarding. I fell off the wagon a week or so ago and just don't care to start it up again. This endgame is laughable.
---
Yeah I just skipped one day and now every morning that I get up I buy bullion, Scrip and caps out so that they all reset about 2am and I am buying them around 6am.
---
I’ll keep that in mind. Ty.
---
Ya that's my thought as well, it's keeping out radiation, when I go underwater I can last for a few minutes on its air supply.  It really should make me functionally immune to poison.
---
Ever since they released the mechanist I’ve wanted the antagonizer.
---
I stopped receiving ally quests about the time fasnacht came around.
---
This is exactly it, how I often feel myself I log in, load into my camp and stand around thinking “what am I doing again?” Then remember I have my dailies to do and let out a sigh. I really want to keep playing so I don’t miss out on any atom shop stuff (congrats Bethesda you got me) i missed out on the horseman skins before and I want the T-51 version, I’ve only got just over 600 atoms only way to get more is to play unless I pay.
---
Nothing major , some non-essentials can die but Beth didn’t have the nuts to do anything meaningful
---
Shit. I m a hogger. I got 20K .45 n 16K 5.56 n other ammos... and i got lots of junks too. Hahaha
---
It’s so tiring.
---
I took a break for three months, did Wastelanders stuff and Faschnat and now I’m on another break. I know three some cool stuff coming that will get me back for a while. Nice to change things up and play other games too.
---
Was hoping they’d finally take this piece of oft repeated feedback for the new flare items but sadly they do nothing and the colour can’t be customized.
---
Ah bummer, I'm sure you'll find a group though bro
---
Only need one piece with the effect.
---
"it just works"
---
I was really looking forward to making the strangler set but of course decided against it, I’d probs get it after I get all the SS pieces and the mods. I don’t have any friends like that unfortunately could try to find some but I’m not a very social kind of guy haha
---
the perk is 1 card. and stops the rads while swimming too
---
PLAY SOMETHING ELSE IF YOUR THAT BORED!
---
We have the flag one? You look around and knod approvingly ?
---
The HOA exists
---
...bruh....why is my space chick at your base??? She and I are going to have words , AGAIN!...every time I go to someone's base....ugh...guess I'll boo up the dirty hippy chick...😏
---
I'm basically just logging in and screwing around. I'm just wandering the map and doing what I feel like. I spent about 3 weeks maxing everything every day and it completely ruined my enjoyment of the game. So now I just do what I feel like doing at the time. About the only quest I'll do every day is the ally quest because it's quick and gives good rewards.
---
thats nothing if u play since beta, look out for the 3000+ ones
---
And it has built in WiFi! Look at that signal strength!
---
Level 200.. yeah no wonder you’re bored. That’s like saying ”i’ve played the witcher 3 for 800hours and I’m bored”
---
Yeah, you’ve beaten it. Done it all. Gotten what’s in the game. 
---
What more do you want from the game?
---
Huh, good to know. I’ve pretty much only been using the capital building as an xp farm, I’ll have to give whitesprings a try
---
they leveled up 1283 times
---
Try server hopping. that kinda fixed it for me.
---
I like your idea but... that wouldn't work. no one could visit your customized home or check your vending machines.
---
This is madness
---
Responder fireman outfit and hat 
---
Forest camo jumpsuit 
---
Tattered field jacket 
---
VTU cap 
---
BoS jumpsuit 
---
Whitesprings jumpsuit 
---
there’s more but all I can think of right now
---
Yeah, if you’re low level most people have so much materials they can just craft weapons and ammo and it’s like nothing to them
---
Hahaha that wouldn’t surprise me. My hopes aren’t too high for the brotherhood the thing I’m hoping for most with them is that they’ll be rocking T-51 like they used to maybe with some new brotherhood paints too but looking at the roadmap that might not happen go figure.
---
I prefer dirty items, I like my camp to blend in with the rest of the world and look like it’s made of found materials. I was so excited when I heard we were getting the pop up camper thing, then so bummed when it looked like it’s made of freshly waxed chrome. Thing sticks out like a sore thumb.
---
For a lot of heavy veteran players after a year more or less the available atom shop is 60-70% owned and if we didn’t get it before likely won’t ever (looking at you kiddie time paints). 
---
So yeah it’s a little bare for some
---
I’ve switched servers, power cycled my ps4, and gone through a couple patches. She says the same thing, and my ticket’s last update on their support site is basically “yeah, a lot of people have this bug, we are looking into it.”
---
agreed and so many feel this way too
---
Rumble:  radiation barrel, emmet mtn disposal suit (blue hazmat)
---
Project paradise has a few:  bear arm plan, 2 bear arm mod plans, stimpack diffuser plan
---
And there are regional rare outfits for each region that can drop from quests and events, but toxic valley outfits are now considered uncommon.
---
Gonna add you, but I can promise that I’ll be asleep 11 hrs from now lol
---
Yeah I do both of those things, although I use the suitcase transfer trick. I just ran out of time this time
---
Assume the position
---
Red ranger power armor is cool but effectively use less without any sort of display for the damn thing.
---
I'm not sure if it's the same problem, but I had a hard time getting the prompt to appear at the end also. I thought it was a glitch, but it was just a very narrow position that finally worked in first person view.
---
It would be cool if they added implants, but only for people who are mutation free. Added bonus if you actually get robot arms and whatnot .
---
It seems people have conflicting experiences with which faction have “better” humans.
---
I’ve been the same I really enjoyed coming back to wastelanders but it didn’t last long especially after hitting endgame can only hope the next big dlc will fix it all but I think that’s a big hope.
---
Haha, well. What's nice about photomode in open world games is you can use it however you want ;)
---
I especially like that Vault Boy is pointing at them lol
---
I finished making my fifth character maybe five or six months ago, I play a lot. Video games are where I go. Always has been. Not to compete , not to keep up, not to acquire, but to simply be, in some form of peace, a retreat from reality for some hours in the evening. I have fun running a shop, all of my characters contribute to one store, always hunting across the map for any weapons or armor that stand out as" good" , then I transfer them all to the swamp shop, my camp in the mire. No stupid scrip weapons. The hardest thing to find right now is anything to spend caps on. I personally need nothing. After 4100 hours I've collected all the gear that all my characters use , without trading , most of my characters had all their gear before they were created. Saving all the good drops that my builds at the time didn't use, knowing I always use all of my character slots in any game. I buy scrip, when it's priced appropriately, so that I can try to get more wares for the swampshop.
---
Riding Shotgun - Blue Ridge Caravan Flag (plan), Backpack (plan), Outfit &amp; Gas Mask
---
I don’t understand the rewards the raiders rewards are terrible, I’m higher than level 50 but get given level 20 combat armour it’s like what???
---
Madness? THIS. IS. APPALACHIA!!
---
Almost 1300 is nuts even for day 1 players.
---
HAHAHAHAHA!
---
I'm level 502 - it's never socially acceptable to grief new players. (although I know you're kidding)
---
Oof, sucks man
---
There's not much to do in the game once you've completed the main quest line and such. The only thing left to do really is just grind towards the DPS Meta right now.
---
The game is definitely suffering in this pseudo limbo of content and boredom. Due to the fact that the game was launched with very little content, a majority of the players have already reached the "end-game". Now while Wastelanders did provide a sizable chunk of things to do, it's easy to see that we all blew through it rather quickly due to being in the "end-game" zone. The same is going to happen once the Seasons get released. We blow through it quickly, and end up in the limbo of Login/Logout for Dailies. Getting boring and stale waiting for the next season to release.
---
For new players, this doesn't affect them as much as they see all this content for the first time and it will take them longer to progress (in a manner of speaking). 
---
Something has to be done to lessen the impact of the "limbo". Whether it be a stream of automated special events or other similar aspects. Something to at least entertain players enough for a 1.5 - 2 hour session a day.
---
Ah ok. Good name.
---
I couldn’t see that what you were getting at, sorry
---
Is the forest jumpsuit that rare? Got it as a reward from the feed the people event and either put in my vendor for cheap or put it in my stash box.
---
This is going to get buried and to be fair, I haven't played much if Wastelanders other than Beckett's and Sofia's quest lines. Even then I could tell that once I ran out of new Wastelanders content, it would literally be a case of going back to the ol' grind. That being said,  I think the delay of Patch 20 and the boardgame theme really put a damper on things. I would rather wait for the "least" buggy experience instead of it being rushed out but it does leave a wider gap between the initial Wastelanders content than initially intended.
---
Oh, the top secret power station? whew
---
I didn’t really have vending in mind for this, but more like a customizable free fast travel location, and maybe a secondary place for your camp allies, so you could have two or three active at one time in different areas of the map. Something similar to the dugout in diamond city. Nothing with the budget size of a CAMP, but just a preformed home that you can add lights and decor to.
---
Ah, Fisto!
---
yeah don’t really see that many people running around with it
---
How did they get Fisto's programming all the way to Appalachia before it was even MADE?
---
Anything over 1 point faces diminishing returns where points would be better spent elsewhere.
---
It’s funny as their rewards are a far sight better than what you’re given from the LEADERS OF SETTLEMENTS one of them was a prisoner and the other fell from space with no knowledge of the current world how do they have better stuff?
---
Hopefully you put it in your stash box.  Could get max caps from the right buyer.
---
I've come to conclusion that Bethesda are clueless to what players actually want. Either that or they just don't care. So many simple things they could implement to keep the community happy.
---
I love nuking it and shotgunning the hordes ...it probably took me 5 times to actually figure out in my head how to properly run it ...
---
This is... (Fallout equivalent of Sparta? Caeser's Legion? BoS?)... 
---
Wait... got it...
---
This is Tunnel Snakes! 
---
(Banished from r/Fo76)
---
Well Fed and Well Hydrated give +25 HP and +25 AP Regen, respectively, in addition to a +25% disease resistance.  That's a pretty solid boost, FWIW.  Well Tuned only gives +5 AP regen, while the various lighter build mods are all single-digits as well.  
---
Then there are the positive food bonuses that are that much more expensive to maintain.  Given that only one food and drink bonus can function at a time, you still have to keep eating the same food to keep the same bonus.  Otherwise, you overwrite the bonuses even if they have time left.
---
That said, the Speed Demon boosts aren't that amazing, either:  +20% move speed and reload speed.  It's nice but not all that game changing.  I don't see much of a balance issue with leaving it as-is, even if the negative food/drink penalties go away.   It's still harder to keep the positive bonuses related to food/drink maintained.
---
Aside: Can anyone tell me how AP Regen and the AP Regen rate bonuses actually work in FO76?  Are those numbers percentages, or flat adds per tick?  What is the normal regen rate per time, anyway?
---
Shes creepy as hell anyways. "You smell is like a drug to me." Um ok I've known you for like a week, relax.
---
Games been out since 2018
---
Yeah I'm with you. I'm good on missing out on a sale or 9 until I've sorted out my cap limit. At the very least just trigger my vendor icon off and stop allowing sales to continue after 30000
---
I have also been having this bug ever since I got to this quest a few weeks ago. Multiple server switches, and power cycles of my PS4 have not changed it. I have an open ticket and the last response seems to just be “this is a bug and we are working on it.”
---
More than max caps
---
Pipboy numbers are complete rubbish and bugged as hell. The calculations i have linked are done using actual datamined numbers and with an calculator build using them.
---
Exactly...
---
I mean, Toxic Valley is “snowy,”
---
I think at that point all that’s left is catering to the community and doing really ridiculous stuff
---
Have a player on my friendslist who is 2300. He picked up 79 lvls on 2xexp week
---
I need those 300 radaways... NEED THEM
---
That was enough to convince me😂😂
---
I've been playing since the 1st day of B.E.T.A. and was a lucky 1st try download so I didn't have to redownload later that day like most. My main is 846, my alt is 492, and my mules are between 200-400. Its not hard if you know where to go, how to farm, and know all the benefits of all the aid items and perk cards. Double XP and Triple XP weekends are your friends too.
---
I could sell you some of my missile turrets and turrets for real cheap. They will never let any NPC especially A.T.H.E.N.A  Even remotely close to your base. Although the drawback is that they constantly just attack your base all the time without provocation. But the last time A.T.H.E.A visited they blew the crap out of her even while I was in the trade menu with it.
---
With them just trying to set up it'd make sense to be in the older T51, maybe just have a captain in T60? I don't really know what they'll do with the BOS tbh but fingers crossed it's good🤞
---
Nah, not bored. I own more than one game. And a TV. And a computer. And comic books. And music. And blurays. And...  
---
I don't get these posts. You're not intended to blow through everything as fast as possible, and no one is forcing you to play it if you're bored.
---
Yeah. You can build a fusion generator and rocket turrets... but no fridge for you.
---
Nothing to even consider here. Settlers want to build themselves up and create better life for survivors. Raiders want to rule by power and steal and kill for themselves, repeating past mistakes that brought humanity into borderline extinction in the first place. 
---
All fine if you see yourself joining with Raiders to be some kind of "badass", but dont you for one second BS to yourself about being a "better human".
---
spoiled food and .38 ammo
---
Only 300?? Im at over 1k diluted lol i go through them fast in nuked zones lol
---
No,
---
It isn't
---
Check for ore, large amounts of gunpowder, spoiled meats and veggies, missiles, mini nukes, holiday gifts, large amounts of unused ammo, food/drink items not needed.
---
I know what’s weighing me down, the god awful rolls mumbles gives me. Wait no, it’s the 1* exterminators pipe wrench from the SBQ.
---
Mine had an issue where the questline wouldn't prompt whenever I started the game. I figure some bug had her treating me as a visitor. Fixed this by scrapping and placing her console again. You maybe tried this but also you didn't mention that in your reply, so i hope it works for you.
---
Oh the Capitol is also a good place to farm! ... If you don’t have PTSD from the ID card quest bureaucracy hahaha. 
---
Only problem with Whitespring is that another player might have already done the run so you’ll have to wait for respawn or change server
---
hell ya! let'um know what they are in for!
---
Spoiled food. Gunpowder. The 10 random purified waters (more) I got from doing that event. The random fusion cores and plasma cores I got doing that other event.
---
Instead of big updates once a quarter, year or whatever, give us some new little stuff regularly.  Like that small family in Foundation, when you enter, they are in the cabin on the left.  Give us a small side quest line, it can be short, that gives us some storyline on them.  Give us a little gold, maybe a legendary for completing it.  I think giving us a trickle of new content is better than big dumps all at once.  Still occasionally give us bigger content events or whatever, but you get the point.
---
It's not really a 76 exclusive problem. I don't any game that can support that long of a grind without feeling like a chore. Sounds like you need a palette cleanser. 
---
I'd say play another game for a bit, then come back when new content drops. I'm on Xbox with Game Pass, and that's been a life saver. If I feel burnt out, I'll go play something completely different, usually an indie, or even (*gasp*) Fortnite with my kids for a bit, then coming back to Fallout feels like a homecoming.
---
I understand being scared of talking to others in online games ( i am myself) but being scared of other people presence? Man, that must suck, i hope you get over it
---
With heavy use and abuse of xp glitches when they were around.
---
Theyre almost all covers. Ernie fords songs are all covers too.most of the ones that arent were already licensed to them from other games

Whats a good "defense layout"? I've yet to see a workshop automatically defend itself even ONCE. Even with rocket/mk2 laser/shotgun turrets all over the place... against stray dogs or moles.
---
Honest response
---
Gunpowder?
---
I got my SS armor and some of the things like the dirt tiles that I wanted.  
---
I finished up all the rooms of my CAMP so they're looking great.
---
Now there's nothing to do but pointless dailies, so until the next content update, I'm done.
---
Hey! We are grind crafting the same arm and stat! Mutants, Sentinel, bolstering, everything but unyielding :D
---
Like I said, I can’t even get her in my camp, the quest line is stalled in the part where I bring the flight recorder back to her in the bunker. She just repeats a line about her back hurting rather than progressing the quest. Her console is likely something I will get to build once I finish this quest.
---
Also, could be a way to lose rep with the factions too.
---
LOL this has to be a joke right
---
Damn just the idea of a captain in T-60 sounds cool and makes me excited, I’m just thinking of a guy in a red cape or something with a sword leading a team of power armour users into battle.
---
Also, if you do "lode baring", those coins/tokens have weight as well.
---
I haven't been to one yet and actually still hide whenever I see a scorchbeast. It's good to be reminded that I'll get to that level eventually!
---
Here's what I do. Farm legendaries and scrap, then drop almost all of it on the ground. It isn't the most fun thing to do, but with so many limits in place, it's all I got. 😂
---
Some of the best drops in my 1000+ hours have been from them.
---
This is the sentence that says everything. Let's not even mention how Foundation has no 2nd daily quest that would mix things up a little; the fact that that dingus still says *this* line after finishing both the story AND completing the reputation grind is as good as a slap in the face, and just... yeah, it just says everything about Foundation, tbh.
---
Yea that’s what I mean. I’m living in a wasteland where building are destroyed. Constant gunfire and explosions, along with the fact that there are no cleaning services available.  I don’t want my camp to look like a brand new house.  Which is why I avoid using wallpapers.  Don’t get me wrong. Every now and then I’ll say fuck it and make a shiny new camp and all. But I like role playing I guess.
---
Along these lines, one of the things I like in the game is idle browsing at people's shops.  But that's basically pointless now.  
---
Armor is worthless - I made my SS pieces, so this entire branch of vending is meaningless.
---
Plans - There's very few I don't have.  No one carries them, so it's just endless mounted bloodbugs
---
Weapons - I'm basically fine.  The only upgrades I could make would be minor, and again, no one has them.
---
So there's nothing to loot, and nothing to buy.  Woop.
---
I’m not complaining that I’ve blown through it that’s my fault, I’m complaining cause it’s a shallow and lazy way to keep people coming back. No I’m not forced to play the game but I want to play the game because I enjoy the game when there is content that isn’t sloppy and uninspired.
---
" Good you're not a flake, I'm impressed."
---
Saw someone wearing it during Faschnacht. It’s not bad. I’m mostly working on it because I’m a completer and if it’s in the game I’ve gotta get it 😁
---
Could be fun...
---
Could be Synth mind control...
---
we'll see...
---
There were several glitches early on that would allowed you to make a keyboard macro that would spam one button to disarm traps endlessly, giving automatic xp in the hoodles. If you see people above 1000 that is what they did. 99.99% of them.
---
For real, though.  I've never had my CAMP invaded by enemy assaultrons, is that even possible?  You can't tame them, right?
---
My wife was so hyped to play this game, she created her character first, I was just watching. The first few hours were ok, then some players with cultist daggers followed her around killing her over and over( when the game first came out you could be killed with slap damage outside of pvp) that aggravated her , but she was cool, then she built a camp. The size of the green boundary made her grunt, when she saw a limit on the stash box she noped the fuck out , never touched it again. She sees me playing every day, every now and then she'll ask, how are you still playing this trash, I laugh, it's not that bad my love lol. I've tried to get her back into it, but she said 800 is not enough of an increase for her.
---
LOL. They couldn't (or didn't) even bother to make the settlements free fast travel locations upon completing the reputation grinds... I mean, I do like your idea, but even this most basic detail of it is missing. Should tell you how much thought went into it, sadly.
---
Against the enclave robots maybe? That'd could make a fun event
---
Gunpowder
---
Then spend those caps faster then you sell. Or don't give a shit and do it anyways. Hell when I hit max caps I go though and lower the price of everything. It takes like 2 minutes.
---
Wastelanders was more than just adding human NPCs, and it’s also not all of the DLC we have received over the past year and a half. 
---
The van lowe questline and related side quests alone were more content than some of the FO4 DLCs (obviously not talking about nukes world or far harbor here).
---
What is with all the cap and script limits? Never played a game like that before. I even got fallout 1st hoping there was a reprieve.. nope.
---
Wanna know a secret about that area that most don’t know? There’s also an underground lake under the wayward that you can swim in and get to Flatwoods
---
I’m the same I’ve got a full set of all power armours except strangler although I more account my collection as complete if I have all the crafting plans I only need that T-60 plan set and I’m done.
---
Photos of dead creatures still count towards the tadpole challenges. I didn't realise this for an embarrassingly long time.
---
Ps4? I’ve got extras of most of the T60 plans.
---
For myself, any unyielding armor with plus 1 in an attributes and weight reduction is priority. Then I can run with an armored backpack.
---
My tank build has this setup. I find anything else is a compromise.
---
I was going through the same thing. Then I realized I have over 600 inert flux in my aid. And I have over 200 plans on me.
---
U can’t touch them until level 5 anyway not that I condone such actions
---
Damn really!? You selling them? I’m a bit broke after buying bullion but I might have a couple things to trade. Yeah I’m ps4
---
You can have any of them that I have multiples of.

---
great tips thanks!
---
Oh damn thank you so much you mean for crafting the actual limbs? Not mods?
---
How do you figure the whole game is designed around monetization? I guess I must be playing the game wrong since I only payed original purchase price.
---
There are instances of that, like letting raiders keep the stuff they stole. Convincing one of the hunters looking for the defector to hit up Foundation instead.
---
I have the scrapbox and still have these problems.
---
I totally agree with you there. For all the development that went into it and delays for development (which I have to say I’m glad they delayed it for development) there were just a lot of missing points along the way. Who’s to say it can’t be added down the line? But as with all things being added... way way way way way down the line after server stability patch number 1,064.
---
that's what I was afraid of, that it would be more stress than fun
---
I wonder if that Assaultron sonificated?
---
OooooOOOooooOooooOooo
---
Yes. Actual pieces. Someone dropped me 11,000 treasure maps and after going through all of them I wound up with several full sets of T60 plans. I only have one left arm currently but I have multiples of all the other pieces.
---
ha! a few hours..? whew..not sure if I have that dedication
---
I actually like the atmosphere and vibe at Foundation but that worker outfit makes me look like a gulag prisoner. The one decent looking settler outfit you can only get by [spending actual money.](https://bethesda.net/de/store/product/FAODU3PCBG01BASE)
---
Rubber ducky, you're the one. You make nuke time so much fun.
---
Thanks man.
---
Some of the numbers arent great, but explosives and gamma and plasma arent bad.
---
ah, with friends would be more fun, I can see that
---
If you need them keep them, just use the perk that reduces their weight, Î’m saying to dump some of the ammos you won’t need in the near future (oh and if you’re going to throw them put them at sell for 1 caps/ammo, 5,56 a lot of people need them
---
I think the problem would be that the radios have to be synced.  What you hear on your Pip-Boy has to match what is heard from a public radio, for you and all other players in audio range.  You couldn't have a custom audio stream with added content for individual players as they bring in music holos or whatnot.  Might work as a worldwide questline somehow, with a fixed end date/goal.  Seems kind of small-scale for a global event, though.
---
However, Rose's Raider Radio is individualized, since it's locked behind a quest goal and accessible only by Pip-Boy.  So her audio stream could be customized on the fly, giving more music to players who have provided her with more holotapes or whatnot.  Or providing a new stream when the quest is completed, if one-at-a-time adds are too complicated to implement.  
---
Story-wise, seems like that would be workable.  Rose wants more listeners, and the muzak she harvested from the Top of the World elevators just isn't bringing in the audience.
---
Yes, they changed that quest to a different location.

Maybe we can meet up on a weekend or something! Work days are hard haha.
---
I should be on in an hour or so.
---
Thank you. I play on Xbox so I didn’t now
---
that's exactly right. minimal effort to keep us playing every day for as long as possible.
---
I would prefer the Uny cav with +1 str would be God roll for my melee build. Otherwise weapon weight reduction is a must have in end game, especially when you start to collect everything that looks weird or nice lol
---
Scam links, pornography, griefing, scamming and racism are way easier with plain text and open for the whole server to see on the map, instead of being limited to building material at bases. Again, fun idea, but very unnecessary (in contrary to new content and bug fixes) and easily abusable.
---
Damn that’s lucky thank you, I’ll add you now I have a chest and leg but that’s it.
---
I haven’t experienced this (Xbox though). How do you get to display FPS by the way?
---
Is this a King of the Hill reference?
---
I see everyone say they get 800-1000 lead in LHM. I run full excavator and always only get ~300-400. I check every nook and cranny and know almost all the spawns by heart (heavy gunner with a trigger finger). Am I doing something wrong?
---
Pretty much not playing fully until new content arrives. I'll pop in for a few minutes to stress relief by popping some heads, but other than that nothing close to serious.
---
Are you running the super duper perk when smelting the lead?
---
2-3 weeks based on other users' experience shared on this sub. Wouldn't hold my breath for a rollback if I was you. They've only ever done that for people whose characters got wiped out from serious bugs and exploits. I am curious what the resolution will be though, so feel free to reply here if / when you get a reply.

Just took a video. Gona upload it now to show people how shit Bethesda is and how shady a company they are for this fucking bullshit.
---
I came back after wastelanders for like 2 days and got bored. Yeah it was cool to see actual human NPCs again, but one can only do so many fetch quests before getting bored. I've got much more entertaining games on my plate right now.
---
Yup. Just got my SS jetpack and now I feel like I'm done until seasons.
---
You happen to know what the gas masks sell for?
---
Im sorry what?
---
yeah, unfortunately not. Nothing showed up.
---
It’s more than it was, but FPS/3PS combat is still nowhere near as in-depth as an actual shooter. Likewise space combat is nowhere near as extensive as a true space combat sim. 
---
I would say most of the combat  growth has come in terms of:
---
1.) Multitool and ship weapons - they’ve added a lot of “mods” that you can add to your multitools and ships to change what type of projectiles you fire and how you will engage your enemies. 
---
2.)  Activities - there are now quests, events, etc that require you to engage in space and/or ground combat. 
---
Note: pretty much any quest, event, activity in the game - and there is A LOT to do now - can be avoided completely. Or not, as you see fit. NMS really is a giant sandbox.
---
I want to follow this post cause i'm out and wanna know what's know in the Atom shop too
---
Okay don't worry it's not actually happening. Just an idea from a member of the community that tends to look at posts with a more posistive light rather than the negative in everything :)
---
You ever play NW? Intense bush spying
---
Totally not a Trap Camp!
---
Not sure if you know this, but the blade of bastet gets 100% armor penetration if you wear the mistress outfit + eye of ra. It's not as strong as a Junkies/Bloodied wep + incisor, but it's kinda cool to actually use the canon weapon. My MoM character only uses the BoB and VoS + Regalia.
---
I don’t know if the pipboy numbers are complete rubbish. Whacky or buggy at times but in most cases it does reflect actual comparative value. I drew my conclusions also based on my tests, not others’ posts. I have most of the prefixes with different effects, that’s how I could compare them side by side. What I’ve found out is that pipboy sometimes undervalue certain weapons while in actual use they are more powerful, whether due to hidden algo or server latency.
---
At this point you’ve likely been overwhelmed by too many people to play with, but my IGN is the same as reddit if you want one more.  My main is definitely high level but I can still provide aid, repairs, advice, etc. or switch over to my low level character potentially.
---
I couldn’t find where the comment went to respond directly so this could have been addressed but in regards to the “wanted” system, since overworld pvp is impossible to engage in on accident in the games current iteration the only other way you could accidentally gain a bounty on your head is by picking a lock that is owned by another player (which are usually pretty obvious). It can sneak up on you though when you pick a lock that’s part of the world that is too close to someone’s owned workshop, which then treats that lock as belonging to the person even though they didn’t put the container or the loot there, and would give you a small bounty.
---
Yeah. Me too. No Man's Sky is really fun!

It updates in an hour, so we'll know then.

Wtf can't even upload videos on this shit page? How am I meant to prove that fallout 1st is a fucking rip off if I can't share my video of me alone in a private world fight 1 fucking mob getting 1 fps. Like Bethesda, suck my dick for real

I’ll add you next time I’m on, thanks!!
---
but everyone wants a cap sink, and traveling to someones camp to find the trash you leave on the ground for sale in there vendor is a big cap sink to the game.
---
Before Wastelanders I used to perch atop the building by the pool and lure them out with grenades and they would ALL come out and I'd sit there and just pop each one off but they don't do that for some reason anymore. I'd be lucky to get one or two to come out. I'd even get the windigo to show up but yea it's tough to get it done.
---
I do wish they would do random nuke drops on the private servers so I have the potential to get some good legendary weapons.
---
That's why I lock them behind a garage door. The plans are like 150 caps. Worth it IMO.
---
Radio Raider in a tinfoil hat is the best one I've seen.  Perfect fit.
---
The Settler Wanderer is absolutely filthy by default.  A few times I've seen variants of her in tattered clothes or nothing at all, locked in cages or basements.  Both convincing and distressing.

I prefer the Carnivore mutation which let's you eat raw meat with no disease chance and raw foods tend to have more rads.

I think certain times zones have it better than others. My daily reset is 4pm which is kind of late in the day..

My apologies for reviving an old post, but the reason this is happening is your friend's minigun is "Magic" because it has Bash Damage. Bash is one of 7 effects that glitches server lag and causes extra bullets to register. I've been playing with magic effects and I have a few new theories that could be very impressive. Further testing is required before in publish my findings.

Ahhh wow that is lit! I had no idea! I usually run my VSS so that I can keep my health up, and it doubles well with my Vanguard armor, but that's awesome! I'll have to give it a whirl! But ai your also saying that junkies is the way to go over AA? All my other builds are Bloodied so I'm looking to switch it up!

Not sure if it’s bumped to a specialist. I put in a ticket for the “kill 13 dangerous creatures” challenge yesterday and got a response and my atoms today. But my last atomic shop issue took the longest so far, a little over a week before I heard anything

You can double stack the brick walls too. I've managed to get both the slants and half walls layered that way, although it can be a bit finicky.
---
How about you try new builds? It might be fun
---
It's like COD mobile. You get the free season pass with some rewards to keep you playing but if you buy the,season pass you get tons of rewards and an easier time moving up tiers. I'm guessing that's what will eventually happen here. I also think it'll get worse as more long time players leave. I've been playing since release and I'm about ready to move on. There's just not much left to interest me anymore.
---
I've been drinking a lot of nukashine lately and trying to get back to my camp by foot without looking at the map, just street signs and landmarks. It pretty cool if you like to explore, but besides that I'm like you, nothing to do.
---
Yeah. Google how to change your PSNID
---
Hmm Synthetic Safire weapons.
---
Yeah, melee has incisor which is 75%. Even if you cut 3 levels of gladiator to slow it, that's 15% damage vs 50% youd get from junkies AND youd get more armor pen than an AA wep. Definitely a better option.
---
Been thinking about a bloodied build but then I’d want SS which will need more gold.
---
Are the plans like the beer stein display, once you’ve learned it it’ll never drop again?
---
Yeah, but they don’t really make much difference, but like launching a raid on a camp for either side for example could lose rep with the target faction.
---
So yeah with Grindlanders dlc came a bit more management but you’ll get used to it, becomes the norm.. 👍🏼
---
Awesome! Any recommendations on the pistols? I was thinking of just hunting to replace all of them with JE25lvc versions.
---
Yeah, I've got all the CS mods unlocked on it, that's why the prefix was a head scratcher. Thought it was something like the Fixer, but I  found a big fat zero online. And we all (should) know, when all else fails, go to reddit!  (In a sixties super hero voice)
---
lol don't link to that guy, his "testing" is far from scientific. I like how he opened up Notepad and just typed a couple of numbers in there like he was jotting down some data.
---
The only cap sink i've found is the plans. (Serum, Some weapons/mods, chems) But that is few and far between for reclaiming.
---
I got real lucky with the windigo colossus. I was on the public server doing the Scorched Earth event and I did not know there was a chance of it appearing. Everyone went into the blast zone (which I don't do LOL) and they all came running out being chased by one. It was amazing.
---
Keep an eye out for the secret service lining coming next patch. It's a direct upgrade to the enclave underarmor with +4 str as well as per and end

World of Warcraft

Rotate them on ally
---
As someone who regularly tours the endgame areas with T65 I can tell you it’s like Godmode. Colonel Gutsies can swarm me 6 at a time and include a legendary. No biggy. Scorchbeasts don’t hurt me, aside from SBQ. I can stand in front of a Squatchbeast and fill it with .50cal as laugh as it hardly touches me. Westtek is a nonstop slaughter for me, and I may use 1 stim if run though it. Yao Guai? Sure they have a great maul animation, but they’re a joke too.

I had previously rocked the non PA armors and I can tell you that there is a *huge* difference in them.

Keep an eye out for SageAZ's post. He usually posts updates on tuesdays.

It's on game pass right now. I've been playing on the customization mode just to travel around and chill. It's a pretty game but I dont need another inventory simulator.

alot of Fallout games do require grind and scavenging. The best thing you could probably do is wait for the public events to 1: get gold bullion and 2: get legendaries. personally I go to uranium fever, then jump fown to the whitesprings train station to turn in chems and legendaries.
---
Finally a replacement for F.I.S.T.O
---
That would work. Although personally, I felt like it was hard to reconcile melee and Pistol perks. Pistol just didnt feel worth investing in for me.
---
I’m keeping mine, probably put them up for free in my vendors at Xmas or something
---
So you have 5 mutations and don't need one of them how do you get rid of it?  Or is that even possible without doing away with all of them and starting over?

I have a lot of social anxiety and its why I gravitated to the FO worlds long ago. Feel free to add me on PC if you want/ever need a hand because I know what it's like. My username is the same as my reddit name.

Got another half hour to go as yet. Fingers crossed for the RR Prefab garage

Doesnt matter rly in the end they change the legendary perks anyways
---
Nahhh fingers crossed for the wood wallpaper or succulents
---
Can you explain how the grind drives monetization? What grind can you avoid by paying $?
---
Selling em for a cap each.
---
Sold them all to a trainstation vendor for 2 caps each. Having it last a week means theres thousands in circulation. No need to hold onto the extras.
---
The only one I've ever found jumped off a cliff and killed itself.
---
The two toons that completed the Foundation reputation grind, which couldn't have been over soon enough, really haven't been in Foundation since.  Can't stand the place.
---
There was a point after many months of 76 where I went back to 4.  I had left off in the Railroad HQ.  And from the moment I loaded, I was immediately reminded why I didn't miss human NPCs.  You're just bombarded with the same one-liners, the same commentary, the same demands for loyalty, the same inane Radiant quests.
---
And they brought all of that directly into 76.
---
Foundation is little more than Railroad HQ on steroids.  No one ever shuts up, or stops volunteering their thoughts when you walk by.  No one has anything interesting to say.  Ward is a horribly unlikable NPC clad in the finest of quest armor.
---
And frankly, I don't want to have anything more to do with these people.
---
Yeah I’m about to delete Raider punk. He’s now started saying, ‘hope you got something from that lead’ what lead punk I had nothing from you.. too be honest, they all annoy me in one way or another.. 😀
---
Of course people are! What game can you realistically play for hundreds of hours and not occasionally get bored of? The Resident Evil 2 remake might be one of my favorite games of all time, totally unjustified it's not _that_ great if I'm honest but fucking hell I love that game. I've put 300 hours into it. A normal run from start to finish on that game is ~60 minutes for me. I have played the ever living shit out of it. 
---
But, I shelved it months ago because there's just nothing left of it. I've done everything except try to challenge the world record because that person is _clearly_ better than me. It's okay! There are _so many_ games out there. Go play them, enjoy them! After awhile you might get the hankering for FO76 again, but you might find something you like even more. 
---
Games should be played for fun. The way you describe your time with FO76 it sounds like a _job_ that you choose to do for no pay. Take a break from the game, it's okay! I've taken a couple myself and I've inevitably came back. Some day I won't, but that probably just means I found something I enjoy even more and what's to hate about that?
---
Thank you for using ' BAHHHTT STOOOHHP'
---
I had to vendor about 15 of them so far as they’re taking up way too much of my stash space. 
---
Player vendor pricing is all over the place, so I can’t imagine getting more than 5-10 caps per Common or Uncommon mask right now. Not enough of a markup to warrant taking up the space. I’m probably going to vendor all but 2 of each. 
---
Due to the extended event it seems like a ton of people acquired a ton of masks. I don’t really think there will be much of a market for anything other than the Rare tier even a year from now. Just my opinion anyway.
---
Can’t say no to some extra plants!

The endgame is starting another character until you get to the endgame. Rinse and repeat.

---
I already had the plans for the chest and an arm from V94, so it was immediately obvious to me as to which armor to build.  That and the diminishing returns of high DR further steered me away from T65.  I’d rather do an extra 50 damage with the Strangler set bonus, plus an aura that behaves like a free Tesla coil mod, than take 1-2% less damage than I would in a T51 suit.  In my opinion, it’s clearly the best power armor.  If T65 had a set bonus, I might have considered it.
---
The only problem with Strangler is getting ahold of the rare plans.  I was browsing the three biggest trading outlets constantly for about two weeks before I worked out a deal for the calibrated shock plan.  It wasn’t cheap.  I’ve done 100s of SBQ with two friends and none of us have ever gotten it.
---
Exactly, next patch will have zero content, and more monetization and a new daily chore list!
---
No mans sky was cool until I got all the ships I wanted. Then I suddenly realized that it was over. There was no reason to play anymore. Even more infuriating when you beat the game and realize what happens. That shit made me quit and uninstall.
---
Skyrim for the PS5. That sums up Bethesda now.
---
Save them for the when it hits gamepass crowd and reap the caps?   
---
I am sure there will be a small influx when they do BoS dlc and have freeplay weekends.
---
Rule 34 peeps work your magic
---
Ah the good old victim role when someone has criticism on your idea. Great. What you proposed has been proposed before and is just the same idea-circlejerking this sub often faces. No Bethesda is not going to add blatant unsafe or barely QOL features.
---
   Thank you so much for taking the time to write this.  I really appreciate it, and it helped me to understand several things about the way the combat works much better.  In addition, it makes sense completely now because I could observe two shot and explosive damage working otherwise, but did not see it translate as expected with certain enemies.  
---
   One exciting thing for me about this game after playing it for a year and a half is knowing tomorrow I will see or learn something new about it.  I am currently trying to see whether having bolstering or vanguard armor is better for me...(or a combination of the two).  And I am also trying to understand how the perk points specifically play a role in doing damage outside of strength for melee.  I have an unyielded set of armor I have basically just used to scrap, (for intelligence to get mods), and craft, (for luck to get super duper).  Then the next thing for me is to see whether resisting the damage done by an enemy is more favorable over suppressing their damage.  The one thing I know for sure is that going all in on one directions is better than dividing it all up it seems.
---
I'll buy them for 1 or 2 caps if I'm being lazy but it so easy to get I wouldn't pay more than that
---
The lack of stuff to grind is my complain, all you have are dailies that you finish in 30 minutes, after that there's nothing.
---
I'm pretty sure I'll be fairly excited for my first CAMP compliment. I've spent a lot of time on the two I've built. :)
---
I kept one of each one.  I put one of each duplicate each day in the register in the Rusty Pick along with 1 star weapons and armor that was not worth vending or selling for Scrip.  Hopefully people have found them and been happy.
---
Bullion. I think its 250 for the underarmor and 500 for the shielded lining.
---
It's possible to change your ID on Playstation now, but there are risks associated with it.
---
Sony explains it in more detail here:
---
[https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/change/](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/change/)
---
Are you on now? I can shoot you an invite.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll make sure to keep some bullion aside then, that underarmor looks great
---
I’m using the BoS as it’s Str and End. Much more useful for bloodied melee than perc
---
Mhm, I have never thought about it that way ... I am lonely loner ...but sounds more than fair to be implementet. Post it on official forums, I all upvote there too.
---
Just because this was funny, I'll give you some free .50 ammo if you're on PC. Just add me, same name as here. lol
---
Dropped all of my duplicates except for a full set of spare common/uncommon, if anyone needs anything they are freely available.
---
Oh durrr, you meant 1200 lead, not lead ore! That makes way more sense. That's about how much I get then, thank for clearing it up!
---
Yeah, as long as you have concentrated fire and run headshots it's nice! It gives you a lot of AP which is nice for VATS which I use a lot even with melee.
---
Edit: I'll grab my laptop if you wanna swap build info!
---
Well, thats the "problem" with every oven world game bro. You have all you wanted and consider yourself in a internal finished game, at least until the next update comes out. 
---
I always made big objectives to maintain me at the game. I started grinding for Armco ACA, and then started grinding caps for good high end weapons (and internal grinding for some specific ones). Now im grinding to get ally with foundation and buy the fertilizer machine. And then I can continue talking about my objectives.
---
My final one is get an insane build of any kind of weapons, like those youtubers who have 1k damage on their builds. At that point, I think I consider my game finished.
---
I just got my hands on the plans for The Fixer and am learning all mods for Handmade and testing what's what with those. I am thinking about switching to a stealth commando build but I am not good with aiming. Never have been I rely heavily on VATS and the recoil is bad and I'm trying to find the balance between recoil reduction to damage per shot. I prefer a higher DPS. By brain doesn't accept new concepts easily LOL
---
No. I have multiples of each.
---
I am confused.  You are paying for access to private worlds for 8 people?  You are getting what you paid for?
---
&gt;	one for vending &amp; crafting, and one that uses me weight reductions cards for fast-travel.
---
These are all great tips but why did you suddenly turn into a leprechaun?
---
About 5k, is what I've seen.
---
Mate I tried posting it off my phone and it says 'videos are not aloud on this sub....'
---
I agree with most of what your saying, but the shocks take up a mod slot, the backpack doesn't.
---
He killed him in ur quest? I had him and his brother to make peace. Beckett and I left his brother alive standing there tripping on whatever hard chems he was on.
---
Some Minigun equipped mutants will tear through you as well.
---
So do them earlier in the day.  All the reset means is when it unlocks to do it again. You have 24 hours to complete it before the next reset. 
---
The only time this would be an issue is if you weren’t able to get to play on a particular day and when you were able to log in you were trying to ‘beat the timer’. 
---
If 4pm is ‘kind of late for you’, then you’re in a good position. Just do them daily, either before or  after the reset. If you do them once a day, the timing of the reset is irrelevant.
---
&gt;Edit: Tier purchasing is a thing
---
Actually, it's not - *all* content from the Season will be unlockable just by playing the game, without spending any additional money. There are no separate tracks or tiers, but each of the 100 ranks needs to be unlocked in order, and after the first two weeks, you will be able to buy those unlocks if you'd prefer not to grind the XP for them.
---
Also remember what I call "El Cheapo" from early Price is Right show days (I'm ancient). No one is going to buy plans, etc (except rare) at anything close to face value. Mark everything cheap and you'll soon have lots of buyers.
---
Ex. If I see that you have a lot of junk items for sale, I'll stop by and look. Raw rubber at 4c per piece? Nope! At 1c per piece? I'll buy everything you have (even if you have 1000 listed for sale).
---
Power Armor should have a lot of things :(
---
Next time, ask for our Lube Special!
---
No muss no fuss rear entry service!
---
Nbd thanks for trying
---
Damn I've encountered a few of these but never thought to follow one! :( lol
---
It's hard to say.  I suspect they won't be worth much down the road because Fasnacht ran extra long this year, and unlike last year, there were ways to game the system to have it run almost constantly.  But at the same time, Fasnacht plans were eventually worth something late last year.  It's just finding that right timing where the next Fasnacht is too far away, but the existing supply of Fasnacht stuff is burned out.
---
18 minutes from now.
---
ah crap. different bug then, sorry to hear that. there really should be an abandon quest option as a workaround for these bugs. good luck.
---
Yep pretty bored and it’s making me want to play ark again.
---
You mean recycled Brahmin Skull? lol
---
I convinced Beckett to merc his brother, saying that he was already too far gone and it would've been better if were put out his misery.
---
Never used it, thanks I'll have a look.
---
Before 3 and to the west (north west) of lol.
---
I played 3 (200 hours), NV (300 hours) and 4 (700 hours).  
---
At first I did not think that I was going to like the lack of NPCs but as you got into the story it was really dark and tragic.  I really like it.
---
The addition of NPCs of course makes the game feel more alive but now it feels more like every other fallout game vs. its own thing.
---
I am about 700 hours in 76.
---
Does it work correctly ? I ve read somewhere that endurance bonuses from armor and weapon do not work. Please prove me wrong, it bugs me for a long time.
---
17 minutes from now
---
17....
---
When that flirt stuff started with me, I sent Beckett packing and moved the space slut in. I see Beckett found his way to your CAMP. Glad to know he is happy.
---
This could get fun..or just really creepy.
---
No. After you complete her ally storyline. Then it stops by your CAMP every now and then to trade
---
Correct. This is why you choose your addictions carefully and try to stick with ones that don't hurt your playstyle.
---
You know I’ve never payed attention to it, I just assumed it works... should probably test that out huh..
---
16......
---
Phew aha. I’m grinding it as much as I can, but at this rate, the most I’ll have to show for it is a pepperoni roll restaurant!
---
Wastelanders story was decent. The original main story of Fallout 76, if it can even be called one, is very poor.
---
Fallout 76's strongest point is definitely it's map. All of the locations feel very diverse and there is plenty of lore to find. The map is really interesting, and probably my favourite in a Fallout game so far.
---
The side quests are mostly poor, and not really comparable to older Fallout games. Older Fallout games just have so much more content.
---
Exactly why i stoped playing a year ago. I could get max scripts and money in under 1 hour of game time. Had max caps and nothing else but time to farm but getting limited on my chance at a 3 star from rng  and Bethesda felt like they didn’t want me to play.
---
😂 yeah right?
---
We're both very happy and very much in love.
---
15 minutes from now
---
Used to be, but not anymore since one of the frat houses has a guaranteed spawn
---
Yeah, you have to post a URL instead of a direct video. Theres plenty of sites that let you do this, YouTube just being the big one. An imgur gif would also work I'm sure.
---
Yeah I’m an early morning daily’s before work.. only chance I get.
---
I dunno, just starting a new character completely refreshed the game for me at 500 hours of gameplay. I love doing the things I haven't done yet build and decision wise.
---
It's a fun event - I have 8 or 9 Outfits, 7 - 8 Gas Masks, 5 - 6 Backpack plans &amp; a few flag plans.
---
I really want Eugenie as an ally.....

---
I think there are a few things that made Diamond City better and why I liked to go back.
---
Architecture. The sprawling nature of Diamond City makes it feel large and like there are always a few things that you haven't seen. Plus the way that it invites you down into it. Going into a small jumble of shacks in Foundation is just underwhelming. Particularly considering how small it is compared to White Springs. It's got one cool feature outside and that grotto inside. 
---
Homes/customization. I had a place in Diamond City. I know that's not really feasible in a multi-player game, but even making it a free fast-travel location would be better than nothing. 
---
Central open marketplace. It would be cool if there was a big open plaza with vendors and shops. Then other PCs would add to the bustle. I liked that in Diamond City and in other games like Destiny 2 or No Man's Sky. 
---
I'm really enjoying this game, but I've only gone to Foundation a couple of times. I'm making my own goals outside of the storyline, and there are so many more pretty and interesting things to see!
---
[This is why people at Foundation were asking for Water Ice](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/10/489217423/water-ice-phillys-classic-summer-cooler-gets-hot-across-the-country)
---
A.T.H.E.N.A. (the assaultron) will show up to trade at your camp, once in a while, after you finish Sofia's questline.
---
I assume it only works if you complete the quest in a specific way.
---
Don't want to spoil it.
---
Np. Dont quote me on that shielded lining price. It's on the PTS so I'm not 100%. 500 sounds right though.
---
On one character Sofia gives daily quests pretty consistently.
---
On another, Beckett almost never gives them, Raider Punk has only given his first one and Settler Forager is semi consistent, but it seems Sofia is more consistent on the other (haven't done Sofia's quests on this character).
---
Hope this gets fixed soon.
---
His ask is pretty clear. He wants to have more friends on in his private server. It’s called at 8 for no reason. Not sure why you are confused.
---
Honestly, MMO's have to have time wasting activities considering this is a 24/7 multiplayer game. They need to keep you busy so they keep players logged in.
---
Yeah, I was more asking if they were equivalent in value or if I made a bad deal
---
Roleplaying. Any game is eventually going to leave you in the same state if the only reason you are playing is to acquire gear/money/rep. You have to decide if you love the game enough to look past its systems and make it your own, in your own way, on your own terms.   
---
For me, that is playing the part of a vault dweller that is reviving the ideology of the fallen Brotherhood of Steel in Appalachia, but this is going to be different for everyone.
---
I believe the hat still is but not the outfit.
---
Okay don't worry I don't feel victimised. You just seem so adamant to be negative. I even agreed that this would happen. However the majority of players would put it too good use. There will always be immature players that find some way to be offensive or rude. But systems are already implemented that allow this via sign and letters.
---
"Now stop messing around with my mower, get inside and massage my wife!"
---
I watched only three seasons now, and I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that Dale is aware of what is going on and is just getting satisfaction from it.
---
The way I do it is message the image to myself using multiple accounts on PlayStation and then retrieve the image from the PlayStation website.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to directly share it to a site like Reddit, from PlayStation.
---
hmm.  Never thought about getting on top of that building.  I like it :)
---
Looks like Fallout 76 isn't mentioned at all.    Thank you though.
---
Their weight really adds up, and I doubt I'll ever get many caps for them, so IMO, the extras aren't worth holding onto.
---
I want to see the Blue Ridge spread out further, maybe appear at some stations, or have a roving trader like Grahm
---
i wasted like 2 months of scrip trying to get uny ss pieces. 1-2 star garbage. spent a weeks worth at murgh and got a junkie fixer and be assault rifle. made a bloodied commando build and never considered using scrip on modules again.
---
I’d love to be able to build that, even if one component was a cryolator!
---
Keep em, no I’m not greedy why would you say that xD
---
They are a great faction - I would suspect to see multiple locations in the future, perhaps even a full DLC for it.
---
What ? I never said anything about sirenhead? I was asking why the flatwood monster, a zetan, would attack the regular zetan?
---
Well that depends on your playing style. I have no use for Bloodied or Junkies weapons.
---
Also, any plans you've already learned are worthless to you. Sell them for whatever you want.
---
dumped mine in batches at wayward
---
Hoard events are eternal if you don't kill the hoard boss.
---
Kill all the "gang" members and leave the legendary boss (tag it just in case it dies), you can then wait for the gang to respawn, or mess around in stealth alternating between danger and hidden in order to make  them respawn faster. The respawns have a chance to be legendary, and if done in the divide, bog, or swamp, can lead to max level 3* legendary enemies every 20 min or so. Its still a gamble on if legendaries show, but when they do they are almost always *3, and always max level.
---
Enemies like fog crawlers, super mutants, yao guai, are the best for this, since while you are waiting for legendaries to show, the normal spawns drop very useful junk components.
---
Got 500+ fiber optics and four 3* legendaries from following a fog crawler for an hour, but results will vary.
---
Ghoul slayer gamma gun
---
Looks like it will be risky.  FO76 isn't even mentioned among the games with and without issues
---
I think rent-a-vendor would work in this situation. Have a place at the foundation where you could rent a vendor station and have Sunny manage it for you while you're away. If foundation were to be a high traffic area, you could have a trading place where you can shop multiple player vendors in one place. Same with raiders.
---
Sure, but most of those weapons can be sold for quite a few caps. :)
---
Yeh I though about..just didn't have the heart. Meg is right... people think us, Raiders are bad.You Warpig! Lol!
---
I kinda think that the raiders being better then we're used to and the settlers actually being a bit scummy is on purpose. Blur the lines between "good" and "evil", make choosing a side a bit harder for people. 
---
It's also a little more realistic, as one side rigidly believes they are right even though they are wrong, and the side who claims to be wrong ends up doing better than they say since we as people are neither completely evil or completely good (most of us, at least).
---
Unyielding AP is a godsend for bloodied commando players. Third perk of WWR, sentinel, cavalier, or sneak would make a grown man weep with joy.
---
I'm pretty new, but so far I've seen:
---
Ammo - Missles, .38.. Probably others.
---
Items that are easily obtainable, such as clothing.
---
Because then they'd load them up with just a single exchange of dialog, which you'll hear every single day, until you curse their very existence as quest-spewing automatons.
---
Oh no! The players that go around killing others just to steal are total idiots that ruin the game for other people. I still have experiences like that at level 126. It would be so awesome if you could convince her to play! This game needs more women! There are a ton already but we are outnumbered (just in my experience). Maybe if she wanted to try again, between you and I, we could help her better utilize the storage and protect her as she levels up!
---
Hmm not a bad idea that, but I feel this would quickly become abused by trolls camp hopping and just down voting the camps ... Kinda like Reddit 😂
---
I am sure alot of people with trap camps would complain since they will get constant downvotes. This would also warn others that it is a trap camp to be avoided.
---
If I think about it, I’ve spent my whole time gathering and levelling, after 18 months I dont care about levelling anymore so more exploration is what I mostly do.. since Fasnacht, I feel the game is lonely again, we need a hub or something.
---
Your personal terminal will tell you where it is.
---
Managed to somehow get rid of most of my missiles and nukes att 1c during Fasnacht.
---
Imagine having repeatable or daily courier quests.
---
with the new bullet sponge update coming up i probably wont be playing much longer
---
Not sure about the other 2 npcs, but fuzzy brenda should definitely offer the Camden park dailies. Would love a reworked version of "Mistaken Identity" that incorporates her as well.
---
That's just then system for every single repeatable quest in the game. How else could it work??
---
Have you talked to Davenport? I believe the personal terminal directs you to one also.
---
Kept 3 of each just incase but all my others were dropped at the event or i cleaned out my stash by dropping them in a very secluded spot, guessing they de-spawn or someone found a bag with 30+ masks and Berets in it.
---
IIRC You find broken ones as loot from time to time and need to repair one to use it. You can then add lenses etc like modding a weapon.
---
If you're on PS4 I have several broken ones I've saved and you're welcome to one.
---
brindancall13 on PS4
---
I'm confused. When you're at max caps you lower your prices and presumably sell even more, even faster for no increase in caps to you? Or you store your vendors, go spend and then reinventory\reprice potentially 120 items?  Either way, as you know, a lot of sales above the 30000c limit can happen in 2 minutes
---
It's pretty obvious what faction they put all their work into, and it isn't foundation. That said, ANY game involving NPCs and limited pre-recorded responses is going feel dead once the uncanny valley starts to take hold.
---
if you are trying to do the mission where you get the camera ...go to your personal computer (build one if needed) and there will be  a mission in there about investigating a suspicious individual ...that will lead you to a body with the camera on it
---
Regarding plans, sure I agree. But would probably hade myself for giving away expensive plans just to lager learn that they could have fetched a bit, even though I tend to tell myself that I am set in caps.
---
Edit: My autocorrect gates me
---
I like the locations this game has. The ash area looks incredible imo. The story isn't anything to impressive tho, But I really love the lore you can find (notes/halotapes/terminals).
---
I've been logging in just long enough to collect my daily caps, scrip, and gold, and then firing up No Man's Sky since it just launched on game pass. I never played it when it released, but at this point it's a pretty cool game.
---
In order to combat boredom I've started a new character: Non-VATS Sniper build.
---
It's level . . . 13(?) as of right now, and I refuse to touch the main story until I get to level 20.
---
people are gonna put weird shit on it, but good idea nonetheless
---
Was able to post it directly to the 76 market sub but will upload it to imgur to repost on here
---
Even if it was something as dullard as finding the hidden giant Mr fuzzy teddy. She could give you some extra fuzzy tokens or something.
---
What if you are a children of Atom enthusiast who wants to heal their fellow ghouls?
---
It's doable if you've spent the 18 months since launch forgoing in-person interaction and vitamin D.
---
Weapons: Furious and AA are worth some caps also, Apparrel: Stealth builds look for chameleon or weightless /AP refresh/RWW or sent armors these go for a lot. Junk: just leave some for your crafting or sell off excess. Plans: Mixed bag, cant go into specifics.
---
I plan on trying to sell the decoration plans before Halloween (02) and Christmas (01) guessing there will be a bit of demand for them then.
---
Masks would be good to sell before Halloween as well as people will be looking for costumes for Mischief night.
---
Too bad that they are not in fo76
---
Yeah, I dropped all of my Fplans except one set of spares, assuming they'll be worth something next year. But that's a shitload of inventory to hold for a whole year. What plans were rare? Other then the pelt? What should I hold onto or charge more for?
---
See, this is why I need you guys.
---

---
It's ruined! No, it's on sale!
---
If you give it an honest shot, you'd be  amazed how fun it is to barge into a place and start melting fugly faces with a plasma caster or blowing limbs off with an explosive shotty without a care in the world. Sneaking is fun, but there is something to be said about my skinny girl in a walking tank flexing raw X01 power and just killing everything.
---
Pretty sure it's common these days mate, sorry.
---
Ooo thatd be sweet. Basically a repeatable version of "Find Jangles!"
---
The Personal Terminal you can build in your CAMP tells you exactly where it is. I did my first by server hoping Point Pleasant, and the second time by using the terminal.
---
You can find a bubble gum bear sewing the back side of imported Chinese bear
---
The bigger question here is that - how are able to find 8 friends to join your private world and where can I obtain this power?
---
There is 1 endgame mob and it drops the same loot that random trash all over the place drops.  It's not even really endgame as there are plenty of broken builds that can easily solo it.
---
After you complete the storyline there just isn't content to support players.
---
It's better to think of FO76 as a single player game you can play with your friends than an MMO.
---
Thanks for the help guys! Determined to find one tonight!
---
I am on pc Oceanic
---
Same thing I spent hours looking for one. Then I finally found one now I find them almost every other drop why does the game taunt me
---
While SBQ is punching me, I don't care.
---
Some scorched Mirelurk Queen comes from behind, my HP takes a dive.
---
&gt; you will be able to buy those unlocks
---
So tier purchasing is a thing. 
---
You can buy each tier. Keyword being CAN, you don't need to buy the tiers but you can. So it's still a thing
---
It would encourage exploration of the area aswell. Its small enough that you wouldnt mind searching it, but big enough with plenty of hidey holes.
---
I am
---
I love the early time setting and the map has been the best to date imo even if 76 isn't my favorite FO. I can't deny the effort they went through building a world that wasn't so devastated.
---
Ah! Touché.  You are right.  Now, this is what is interesting though:  Does the Crane quest hint that they might retain some of their humanity creating the dilemma, or (even if they don’t retain any humanity), does the Crane quest ask us why it feels uncomfortable killing something that is not fighting back regardless?
---
I agree that both settlements feel sparse, but keep in mind - Wastelanders was kind of an abrupt about-face regarding the 'every person you see is a real person!' thing, where as Diamond City was like, *the* core city/settlement in Fallout 4. So personally I don't imagine there was ever really a chance of Foundation/Crater having the same sense of scale/life etc.
---
It spawns at the overseers house, VTU and the frat party, with common roll drops in dresser and footlocker loot. So probably not
---
LVL 155 and I'm bored. The grind is too much.
---
Personally, I think it's fugly, and once I discovered that 99% of the paint jobs I own can't be applied to it I lost all interest.
---
I also got sick of wasting tons of mats and legendary modules for SS armor and getting piece after piece of 1 star bullshit, so at this point I don't really have anything left to spend my gold on.
---
It's the wide-spread microtransaction formula: The scarcity gives you a sense of urgency and you feel a higher need to buy since you don't know when it's gonna come next time.
---
"WHY DO I HAVE 24 MISSLES!?"
---
also, 400 gunpowder.....
---
Emailed to myself, thanks for the good tips.
---
This year, all of the plans had equal probability.  In the previous year, the Old Man Winter Effigy was rarer than the others.
---
The thing about Fasnacht stuff is that it doesn't really go out of style.  It's great for generic CAMP decoration.  I've certainly been called upon to decorate CAMPs with it prior to this Fasnacht, since I knew all the plans.  So stuff like the streamers and ribbons would be of interest to a lot of builders a half-year from now, I suspect, if they don't already have them.
---
Serums and 3 stars. It is a challenge not to cap out in a session
---
Listen man, I need those 10000 .38s
---
That’s just the kind of thing a time traveler would say!  I have my eye on you...but...you already knew I was gonna say that depending on...
---
I hope you are actually doing this.
---
Finally I've got plans for the weekend 🙌
---
Also making sure I have some of every category. Really stands out on the map.
---
dump them, except for my three crazy guy's.
---
*Supposedly* the last two Raider underarmor lining plans can drop from events in the Savage Divide... though I have yet to see any of them. :/
---
As mentioned to all the others I totally get that point of view lol. 
---
But now I wanna spend atoms and I ‘cant’?
---
Don’t seems totally right as a plan for Beth imo.
---
Good to know! Thanks!
---
same.   
---
Even my melee character has a stash box full of legendary weapons.
---
I was afraid of that,  
---
sorry to spoil placebo effect :/
---
I am inspired. Thank you
---
I’m guessing they don’t want another duping situation like they had with the display cases. I bet they will come out once they deal with that issue.
---
Because I am familiar enough with the hobby to recognize basic design principles. 76 carries all the design hallmarks of your basic live service product, which are designed for long term monetization. It has further monetization focused design on top of your basic live service model as well. 
---
Would you like a list?
---
An alternative currency for the cash shop. This does 3 things. It dissociates the act of spending from the act of buying, leading to more spending. It obfuscates cost so you have to do a little mental gymnastic to figure out exactly what you are being asked to spend. And the allotments you can buy never match the prices you can pay, so, in combination with the fact that you earn atoms through gameplay, you always have a left over balance. Which again, leads to more spending.
---
The live service grind. Daily and weekly login incentives. Designed to keep players engaged with your product as long as possible as frequently as possible, increasing exposure to the cash shop, and thus increasing the likelihood something will be added that will tempt you to spend.
---
Cash shop focused content releases. The cash shop sees new content regularly, and more frequently than any other form of content.
---
Artificial difficulty and intentional tedium. Gear degradation can be fine in a survival, or simulation sandbox if it's balanced well. In live service games it drives grind to find repair materials, or even better, drives players to the cash shop to grab utility items that negate this artificial difficulty. Spending too much time in your inventory, tediously organizing your limited space? You can buy a solution to that tedium.
---
Upcoming seasons. In combination with the grind and tedium, you can bypass all that with some dosh. And it will reset every few months, so you had better stay engaged year round if this game is one of your top titles and you want all the stuff.
---
Look, if you've been in the hobby a while, if you're an enthusiast who is interested in how games work and why they are designed certain ways and what motivates designers and developers. Then it's pretty clear how 76 is designed and to what ends those choices were made.

Sell serums, legendarys, plans and outfits. Nothing else really sells. keep your inventory stocked if people see your selling a lot they are more likely to stop by. Make your vendor easy to access. All these guys with stupidly designed camps deter people from shopping. Don’t be afraid to sell low. For some reason the FED76 price has been way high compared to what actually sells on PS4. Idk just what I’ve noticed from running my own vendor.
---
I keep telling this. Hope this time it will gain enough attention.
---
This would be really good for raids or possible guild events.
---
loverslab wants a word with you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
First of all, getting PA in this game is way to freaking easy. It should be a little more rare to get. They just throw X01 at you just for becoming an enclave member. WTF? I was surprised. It's very unrealistic in a sense that in the wasteland people would be hacking hacking and modding the ever living shit out of PA. Raider sets are a good example but damn it's ugly.
---
Glad to be of service my good dude, party hats are optional
---
TBH, sell Flux goes for 300c a pop. Always run out of it and I'm almost always at max caps.
---
its mothman stuff, my atoms are safe this week
---
Any moments in 76 that had you feeling like you entered a different game like the alien or anchorage dlc? Or even the Sierra Madre DLC from new vegas?
---
You're right -- they added questlines and items too. But nothing that modders haven't made in the same time or less. I've seen modders convert Fallout 4 into brand new games in the same time period, and they aren't getting paid.
---
Simply put, Bethesda is doing as little work as they can to milk this franchise for what they can get.
---
I was attacked by cultists in the middle of Foundation.
---
Nobody even noticed.
---
I call her Wanda too!
---
Man, I wonder whether the OP will be happy or so pissed off that they could have gotten the camera ages ago without all this effort.
---
Rareish plans are things like marine armor and deep pocketed/ultralight and some of the underarmours and healing salves/disease cures they should be worth selling.
---
Guns worth keeping/selling, Anti armour, instigating, furious, bloodied, junkies, maybe two shot, vampires and quad as well depending on the weapon. 
---
Holo and notes without a quest attached can be safely disposed of, they shouldn't take up weight though.
---
The SOONER you recover our missing equipment the BETTER.
---
2 seconds after giving the quest.
---
Sweet let me finish a quest and I’ll shoot you an invite in the next 10
---
You can get the quest from the dead tourists. Then the random drops are listed in older posts. You get a lens mod at the end as well as a lens mod from the possum scout vendor.
---
What have you got to lose?
---
A single pure flux you can sell for 300?!?
---
Seems top secret when I read your post complaining about an extremely easy mob to find/farm being "painful" but maybe I misinterpreted that somehow!
---
Yeah but mirelurk queen farts kill me.
---
Woo Mothman
---
Easy, make a simple UI that allows/disables comments and remove the dislike option. Not to mention most of the fo76 community is not toxic.
---
Now think that at your side. Do you like to waste a lot of fast traveling going from camp to camp only to see a message like "You cannot buy this item, vendor cap limit is reached"?
---
[MOTHMAN BACKPAAAAAAAAAAAACK](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yBLdQ1a4-JI)
---
Dammit I wanted my Garage prefab!
---
A giant mr fuzzy is actually a death claw that got stuck in a giant one
---
Please can you be more specific?
---
Red rocket prefab outrage in 3..2..1..
---
Bethesda you know what we want. Not paying for nothing till the garage is out.
---
whaat, that's crazy! I haven't seen one of those yet. Do you remember what level you were and where you were at? As a 50+ level, all the enemies I see are the same types usually but I have found lower level ghouls etc with special abilities like poison. Things get more predictable after you hit fifty I think.
---
Let me know if the Mothman  Jetpack has unique effects like the Free States Jetpack or if it is just a skin like the RR One.
---
I can actually build that shed in anyone's camp lol
---
This is a very important thing when selling I think. I'm reluctant to travel to a camp if they don't have a variety.
---
I got a SWTOR burnout, Wastelanders came along and for a month I had a blast. Then I finished getting the lvl 50 Scavengers Power Armor, the Brotherhood Sniper Rifle and the Enclave's Scout Armor. I still had the mods to grind for but by then I realized that there was only grind left so I went back to play SWTOR reinvigorated.
---
I'll wait for the Brotherhood update, that picked my interest.
---
There you go. It’s reset before you start your play session each day.
---
still no red rocket garage
---
another week of spending no atoms sigh
---
Honestly this week is kind of lackluster
---
Bethesda. Updating this game. 10 or so locations. Monthly. HAHAHAHA
---
Thank you for such a good laugh. Really needed that :)
---
been lackluster for about 2 months now
---
Its funntly cause me and my friend joke around that when the traveling merchants come to our camp when we are there, we jokingly say that the merchants are f*cking our girls 😂
---
This is true
---
What the hell is the "paratrooper?"
---
They want you to make the economy flooding. If you dont have cap limit we start to hold them and the economy will enter inflation. And believe me, you dont want to pay 40k caps for a 3* quad barreled black powder rifle.
---
Drop site C2 has a static spawn for it on the shelf to your left in the room full of toxic water. You may have to server hop a few times to find a server where it hasn't already been looted, but it shouldn't take long.
---
I think your missing the point. I feel the same way as op does and this game doesn't have to be boring. 
---
Comparing this game to RE2 is wildly different. Bethesda has just provided a very flawed system to keep people hooked and its a damn shame considering how much money some of us have sunk into this game.
---
yep, I'm always sold out. Violet, Cobalt and Crimson sells like hotcakes to high lvl server jumping players. If you want it out fast 200c.
---
Can't even rescue that poor guy's Nuka Tapper saves.  Which he's told me about now 50+ times at least.  Along with at least 3 other inane voice lines that get vomited out at me every time I run to the bullion machine.
---
MOTHMAN
---
paper bag replacer
---
So they skipped the red rocket pre fab building and jumped to mothman stuff ? wtf....
---
Ah! Thank you.
---
Yeah you are bang on.  This philosophy that a single game should consume hours each day of grinding just to be relevant, endlessly, is a losing proposition.  Especially with so many great games out there.
---
I liked the red rocket and communist bundles. The atom shop hasn’t been that bad.
---
300c Flux? Shiiiiiit I been doing it all wrong. I see serums for that.
---
the one thing ppl wanna spend money on and they won't put it out there
---
Ammo sells good for me. My build is rifleman/commando and I don't use power armor. I sell every ammo aside from .45 and 5.56 and any fusion cells I come across - make most my caps with ammo.
---
Too bad the mothman jetpack can't go on your secret service armor somehow.. :P
---
Ice machine in the tunnels under the rusty pick.  Dumped around 100 masks in there the day after Fasnacht ended.
---
SireBeanBoy
---
New builds used to be my answer, but I can't imagine going through the rep grind again.
---
I'll admit the communist bundle was nice but nothing else has warranted spending my atoms on
---
Plans are tricky. Many are common and easily found in the world, but players tend to price them all as though they are equally rare and desired. I can’t count the number of camps I’ve just walked away from selling mediocre plans for high caps. So I try to sell only the harder to find plans at reasonable prices. I’ll dump the commons at train stations. Similarly, I’ll only sell recipes from limited time events like Fasnacht, and give away all others. If you think about food in this game, how many people will take the time to gather resources to craft specialty food items when they can get by on grilled radroach?
---
The cap limit should be increased to 100000 or the vending machines need to be reworked
---
What's inside those packs? 🤔
---
What’s in the bundle?
---
time traveler...
---
... or a synth...
---
thought it was common knowledge, glad I helped haha
---
One of the best parts of the game is checking out other people's CAMPs and having them check out yours...
---
Set your game settings to "passive" and no one can hurt you.
---
Nah it’s fine. I didn’t even think to check really... so thanks for pointing that out.
---
LMAO
---
Did you downvote me just for pointing that out? Sheesh... by "tiers", I thought you were implying separate tracks like some other games do, where there are some things available to all, and other things *only* available by buying them. Whereas here, there will not be anything that *requires* additional payments.
---
Wish I could see more pictures as to what’s in the bundle or what’s leaving the atom shop.
---
I've seen this on xbox. I've also seen displays of trade only weapons with the stats listed in camp letters.
---
Not play everyday. Just play a few hours on the weekend and maybe once in a while during the week.
---
they're probably waiting for the start of the new season
---
The mole miner scrap contains rubber. Run blackwater mine, scrap everything, and server hop. As a bonus, you get shit loads of steel from their weapons, or you can trudge down the hill and sell them at the vendor to quickly get your daily caps.
---
Will probably start getting the Slocum Joes stuff before we get the prefab garage
---
That's a very good point.
---
Who do you think cares more though? The people camp hopping getting these messages occasionally or the people who lose out on caps occasionally who have been complaining about this for as long as vending has been around?
---
I honestly don't know who would win out.
---
Looks like someone came in and is downvoting abunch of legitimate questions and comments for no reason again.
---
It could say stuff like the name of your camp, then your name below.
---
I want this so much, I want my quaint little mire ***janktown***
---
325 levels and hundreds of dollars of atom shop and fallout 1st  purchases.
---
def disappointed
---
\[pounding on desk\] garage   garage  garage  GARAGE GARAGE GARAGE!!!
---
I'll take any improvement at this point. It's only going to benefit both buyers\sellers
---
What platform you on mate? I would love to buy one copy
---
I found the range absolutely disappeared when putting the extra damage nozzle on
---
You've been reading popular opinion on reddit too much.  People cry hax on me for my heavy weapons dmg on Queen and the reality is bloodied is building a glass canon to absolutely zero additional benefit.  The carry weight and mobility is where you get benefit, but GL in radzones or focused by packs of enemies as bloodied.  Inb4 chinese stealth suit comments since stealth suit doesnt mesh with armor and fucks over the precious unyielding buffs.  - Signed, former bloodied unyielding
---
During Fasnacht, I dropped into a server just as the robots started their march down the road. I was readying up quickly and noticed someone’s audio was on. Then I heard it...Electric Avenue by Eddie Grant started playing. I ran It was AWESOME! I was rocking out killing Radtoads and having a ball.  I jammed on until the song faded out just about to when we got up to the cutouts for the super mutants part. Then,  that’s when I heard it cut through all the explosions, gunfire and mayhem....DOMO ARIGATO MR ROBOTO!!!.  I ran around blasting EVERYTHING I could with my TS AGL while singing along at at the top of my lungs(massive STYX fan)!!!  As that gloriously faded out, the Pretenders Middle Of The Road came on as we lit up the Megasloth! Perfection!  I got a troubleshooter 3* pipe wrench!  Everyone was robot dancing. It was sooo much fun! I ran up to the one playing it and gave them a huge heart emote!  They returned it and minute later they hopped out. The synchronicity of it all was sheer beauty! It was one of the most fun gaming experiences I’ve had!!!
---
Put the standard nozzle back on it. It has the best range even though the stats say otherwise.
---
Only ammo I’ve sold is 5.56, plasma cells, .50BMG, an maybe another. We really need a way to sell like 20ammo for 1c
---
Fair play if you can get it mate. Flux for me is 75-100 a pop or I ain't buying it, I'd rather farm it myself than pay 300c each tbh.
---
Grind is time spent in game, either chasing a goal or maintaining a status. And there are a few ways you can bypass the grind through a monetized method, and thus save time. You can reduce time spent gathering materials for repairs. You can reduce time spent organizing and efficiently maintaining limited inventory space. You can reduce wasted time trying to loot places that have just been picked over.
---
And maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but if your game is designed such that I want to skip portions of it because it isn't fun and it gets in the way of what I want to do, and you offer me paid solutions into that problem, then maybe those particular aspects of the game should exist in that way, because it's pretty clear that they exist to drive me towards that paid solution.
---
This. I get level 400+ coming to my camp and buying teddy bears lol. Having a filled store looks better.
---
I’m using a trap base at the moment (with a fake store), but I used to have a real in game convenience store. It was fun to funnel people through the entire store.
---
By setting up displays before a machine, like a bunch of bears, it’d make them think, “hmm maybe I’d like to have a bear collection”, and voila I have the entire collection right here for a small price lol.
---
It is best to line machines up from the entry and to put the good stuff at the back of the store. That way people need to look at every machine before they leave.
---
For example I put the teddy bears and junk toward the front. The bear displays and magazines were the first thing they’d see. Next was displayed meds and stims. Then weapons and ammo.
---
Mind you I was only a level 30 and I’d still max out my caps.
---
This is as simple as making a hallway, and starting from the entry, line your machines from the entry to the back. The machine with the good stuff like serums should be found furthest toward the end of the hallway.
---
I’d hide one machine that nobody can touch and use it to fill out the rest of the store so it displays good on the map.
---
This way you have one machine for filling out your store, and three more to sell stuff. You might get some hate for this (like people punching or shooting your machines), but most people don’t notice.
---
I'm in Xbox One:)
---
5 bucks says it wont come till fall
---
Meh
---
Damn, another week, another banking of atoms.....not even a paint for the T-65
---
I buy cheap meds from lower level players and sell for twice or sometimes three times as much at my camp.
---
I see they regurgitated the mothman camp bundle again. The RR Prefab would’ve been a better choice I think. However, I might pick up the mothman traveller just for that backpack!
---
Ah dang it. PS4 here. 
---
But thanks anyway
---
If you change your psn Id? Highly unlikely
---
All of your complaints feel like they are coming from someone who just reads about the gle and doesn’t play it.
---
Check my edit
---
Some Mothman bundles. Big item is the Mothmon Plush backpack.
---
Oh it's super ugly. I have the black rider skin so it doesn't bother me.
---
What the hell is the paratrooper? Is that a backpack skin?
---
Also, what's the freebie? The pride icon?
---
Honestly at this point I feel like I should just spend my atoms, been saving them for about 2 months now
---
I suppose that's up to how you define worse. Virginia could be over run with slavers, rapists, and people who make the Blood Eagle's look like the Crater Raiders.
---
Same the only thing i got was the west virginia tables and lamps plans
---
yeah, my regulars are High Level server hopping max capped players. I put in 5 of each in the machine and they but them all.
---
Ya it’s bad like melee range bad.
---
😑😫
---
I didn’t use a middle man, so I dropped first. 
---
First and last time I do it though.
---
More power to you on the trap base, but we should really be able to retaliate. Nothing worse than a trap base who's owner is passive.
---
I can't stop finding them, they appear to be everywhere....I have dozens in my inventory.
---
&gt;I'm confused. When you're at max caps you lower your prices and presumably sell even more, even faster for no increase in caps to you?
---
Yes. It is very simple set up. When I need money I increase my prices to more common pricing on items. And when I don't need money I render them inexpensive. Why would I do anything different? Caps are piss easy to get and it isn't like I spend a lot of them.... Mostly because I'm not an idiot who pays 25k caps for a legendary weapon.   
---
  
---
Shit I've had this game since January 2019 and I've not even got a full legendary armor set yet. Only my chest, left arm and right leg are legendary. Shit it was almost a year before I finally got a legendary weapon I would want to use. And it only cost me 800 caps. And all of my armor have been legendary rolls from the vendor bought with script I've gotten from drops and events.   
---
I've got so much scrip that after I roll armor I scrap all the shittier ones until I run out of my daily scrip limit. Sell a couple of the ones I might get money for  (no more then 700 caps max for 3 star items) and then give away the rest of the shit by dropping it for players I see. 
---
People over complicate this game so fucking much. Half of the shit people do are not actually required to play this game and do all of the content the game has to offer.
---
When im exploring i use pharma farma and sell all The chems i get for cheap. Its not a huge profit but its a Nice bit of change. Junk such as screws spring, adhesive... Sell like butter
---
I changed my psn id a while back and had no problems.
---
You can have temporary dog companion if you build at right location.
---
Gonna see a lot of Mothman backpacks now. That's their moneymaker for the week. Eh, another sad week.
---
People who bought the Mothman PA bundle should be given the jetpack, at least at a discount. Selling the jetpack exclusively separate is scummy. The free states jetpack was bundled with that PA, the red rocket jetpack was too.
---
Well of anything I'm getting the Mothman plushie backpack
---
Yup agree. The napalm mod works and rocks but put off the vaporizer and you ll have a nice range and solid damage. I love to grill a horde of ghouls with my junky flamer 😁
---
Repair kits are less effective than methods of repairing in game (advanced repair kits, repairing at a workbench). Seems to be a disincentive to me. 
---
Do you play the game? Do you feel like you want to skip repairing weapons and need to buy repair kits? Are there other portions of the game you can skip or is this the only one because it seems like a flimsy argument. Your examples of private worlds are equally silly IMO especially since most loot is instanced anyway.
---
Is this really how you feel when you play? That if you don’t pay you are at a disadvantage?
---
Heard it was a new skin for your bag drop.
---
That seems to be most likely, after two weeks of fashnuat people probably stopped playing until patch 20
---
Haha I will probably feel a mixture of both , probably should've asked alot earlier but still grateful for the help!
---
Not even the red rocket prefab? Yikes. They really dont even give a crap about the ATOM Shop anymore. Constant updates of bs an an broken items.
---
Is that paratrooper bag a "dropped loot" bag?
---
I'd be very interested in buying that if you have anything you are looking for.
---
I guess there is no air system because poison, rads and disease all seem to slip right by inch thick tank armor.
---
I dislike how they dont stand for anything, they have no soul, no bigger picture, no political message, they arent like shady sands or a followers of the apocalypse style faction, hell, they dont even have a name, they are just called "settlers".
---
its honestly pretty boring and sad, they could have made them ex responders who came back or pre war politicians trying to help or free state revolutionaries, fucking anything but what we got.
---
Delayed maybe?
---
WHERE MY GARAGE
---
The plan?!
---
It is.
---
I got it.
---
And it's broken.
---
Half of the bag glitch through the ground. Honestly, how can they feel comfortable charging people money for half decent content that is often broken.
---
Hmm. Elder Scrolls Online fits all four and more, yet it isn't that boring.
---
Dropped most of mine during the events, saved maybe one of a few of them.
---
I think I'm done for the time being. I haven't logged in for about a week. I'm not one to stick around a game once my excitement to play it starts to wane; too many other games out there waiting to be enjoyed.
---
The main thing that killed my interest this time was reaching a point where my character's progression seemed to be largely done. Sure, I could respec to another play style slowly over some levels, or start a new character.  But I wasn't going to be much better than I already was with my preferred way of experiencing the game, not without a disproportionate amount of effort.
---
All in all, good game and I enjoyed my time with it. And if my experience with past Bethesda games says anything, I'll likely be back at some point to get my fix again.
---
Hopefully it's larger than the paper bag... so hard to see that.
---
There actually is a world spawn for the hat (well at least used to havent checked the data since Wastelanders released), issue is its setup wrong and doesnt have a preview model/mesh (why it doesnt show a preview in your Pipboy or stash) so its effectively doesn't exist where its suppose to spawn.
---
I think the prefab got delayed or cancelled altogether. There was (or currently?) some sort of glitch going on part of it appears in your Misc Structures in the CAMP menu. Wouldn't be the first time.
---

---
3 star legendaries, serums, 5.56, .308 and .50 round ammo, stimpacks, magazines, addictol, ballistic bock, and copper, aluminum, screws, springs, high dollar outfits.  These are the things I can not keep stocked.  If you wouldn’t buy it at the price you sell it no one else will either, (or rarely they will).  
---
You will max your 1400 cap limit quick at a vendor so selling is the only way to make money beyond that.  I fill the extra space in my vendor with stuff people can walk right over to the  train station and sell for much more.  Why? Because I can’t sell it at the train station.  So spacesuit is 15 maybe 20 caps, same with ranger outfit and things like that.  
---
Don’t hoard your legendaries just to have 10 on sale no one wants.  Having said that there are a lot of things a specific person might want.  You are making caps but also paying people to reduce your stash weight if you think about it that way.  
---
Like another guy said make your vendors easy to get to.  This is a quality of life things as no one will give up looking or remember your camp and never come back specifically but it is nice.  For god’s sake put a damn stash box by the vendors.  Can’t tell you how many times I am looking all over for a stash box because I can’t remember if I have an unyielding left arm or right arm and I need to check before I purchase.  Never used to be an issue, but I see this sometimes now and I wonder if it is like on purpose or what.  
---
And, that’s about it.  I used to make power armor to sell like excavator sets and the like.  I would have thought that would sell well but it never did.  I would mod them and price them at 200 caps a piece so 1200 caps for a maxed out excavator or t-51 or t-60 set with shocks and everything.  Just was doing it for fun to see, but they stayed in there forever so...
---
How does one get pet deathclaw? Can I get a wendigo as a pet?
---
Restart your game, it's updated for me.
---
I mean it’s kind of worth it gauss shotgun, turbo feet bombs , and ammo machine are the best Wtw to spend the gold bullion
---
need that mothman camp bundle for my horror trophy room...pretty happy with whats on sale..
---
I'm aware
---
dropping your starched genes, hoping for the best and taking turbo dips in decon showers.
---
Someone's female character had a glitch that raised the skirt up and hiked the underwear for some reason so I was obligated to take a pic.
---
Probably the same as the cage. Related to budget glitches.
---
I came here for the same question. I have marsupial and electrically charged, but I want to try another one.
---
I've uploaded a few screenshots, check my edit
---
Is it larger than the paper bag? (Assuming they fix the bug).
---
Ah I see. Well I'm glad you got a system that works for you. Thanks for the response
---
Pictures ;-)
---
Are you still available? Thanks.
---
Yeah, it's updated. If you're not a Mothman cultist, you're going to be hugely disappointed.
---
Interesting, however if it's just the garage doors appearing in misc i think it performs similair to the circus trailer and doors.
---
Wouldn't it have made more sense to you know, release the Red Rocket garage since Red Rocket has been the theme for a couple of weeks now?
---
Usually loot bag skins can be either set as dropped, death or both.
---
Its actually bots. They have been around since the creation of this sub.
---
Best bang for your buck game i've ever played besides Everquest. Measly 10$ a month and I could have fun playing literally 24 hours a day every. god. damned. day for YEARS
---
I use a vampiric ffr fr version. I am immortal in Encrypted. Poor robots melts like icecreams and I can pick up 3 pylons and my healthbar is not even moving.
---
Yes, relatively big, but not as big as you imagine. Maybe it will seem bigger after its fixed. I'll post a pic in a sec
---
Not a fix but every time my foundation daily starts it says return to what's his name and it's done, been a week now of not having to retrieve the item. Still get treasury notes. I've left server before in the middle of ally daily and it took days to reset. Lots of little bugs with NPC's and Commander D. Getting stuck in the ground at my camp.
---
Worth a second glance... 
---
Any unarmed or melee weapon that has 40% faster swing speed. 
---
Almost any armor piece that has some item weight reduction in slot 3 (reduced aid, weapon, ammo etc weight)
---
Take into account which legendary perks a multi-star has and how well they play together. Yesterday I got a Quad explosive assault rifle, that’d be a fun one for a full-auto player. Also remember not everyone who plays is a min-maxing redditor with an encyclopedic knowledge of what’s “good”. You’d be surprised some of the things I’ve sold for up to 5k caps.
---
If you have collectron I think you can keep your junk there. And remove things useful or you depend of your choices. I think collectron station doesnt share weight with stash boxes.
---
Wang Dang Atomic Tango
---
Why are people downvoting? You can not like the update, but don't shoot the messenger, it's not their fault this weeks update shat the bed.
---
Hell ya!
---
Speaking of salty PvErs. You just said some of the most stupid shit I’ve ever read on this site. It’s sad that someone clapped you so hard once that you now claim all PvPers are hackers and dupers, and that PvP should be removed and PvPers banned. Why are you so salty and pathetic? Lmao
---
Thanks!  I have the tombstone for my death marker... and want something to replace the paper back for "drops".... I am a fairly new player so I didn't have access to the old skins.
---
Yup. I've made the jump back over to ESO with the recent release of their new DLC.
---
Your wasting your time arguing on here about the quality of product that this game represents. You and I both know its a turd but the fanboys here will defend all the "FREE DLCS" (that arent even worthy of calling a DLC) to death.
---
Don’t throw away weapons that’s just not Bloodied or Junkies, there are many useful prefixes for different builds. I say prioritize weapons then armors then precious junk such as fluxes, then normal junks, then some healing chems.
---
ehhhhhhhh... I'd just get the quest and then fast ravel to my destination.
---
I wish it had better rewards for completing it to incetivise actual doing it, its fun.
---
My suspicion is that they would have released it already, if not for the broken garage door issue, which probably needs a patch a fix.
---
Because in a real combat at the silo, you will not have the time to equip your pip boy, hack a robot and choose an option. 
---
And talkig about terminal vendors, well, I hope your are just refering at npcs...
---
you could just level a ton and switch your perks/perk cards around
---
My combat shotgun already was 1 hitting everything and only getting rep from ward half the time even if I didn’t skip any convo was unbearable . Think ima just wait for cyberpunk unless we get another quarantine
---
Liquor recipes and Mr Fuzzy tokens always sell.  Do bivs daily and the Camden park dailies on the regular.  Been selling quite a bit of nuka cola my bloods in it too lately for people heading down to do the queen.
---
You can make a lot of money off farmed up legendaries but dont sell garbage.  Just cause its 3 stars doesnt make it good.  No one wants bane weapons (zealots is the exception here) or stalkers, you're just wasting stash space trying to sell those and aggravating people who came to your camp looking for weapons.  Good rule of thumb is if you wouldnt use it, don't try selling it.
---
What's with all the Atom Shop confusion today? Nothing has been out of the ordinary, yet lots of people freaking out.
---
Oh my god that is awesome!
---
The skin system for bags is quite new, so there hasn't been much to miss out on. This is the first I've bought because it seems good from roleplaying perspective, but yeah in my mind I imagined it slightly bigger.

Limited items like event items I sell at five times the estimated value. For example the masks from the recent event I sell at 499 caps. I value the masks at 99 caps. Every month until next year I estimate that the masks value will at least double. So I’ve set my masks a little more than two months out, because that will be about the time that people will have likely either kept the mask in their stash or gotten rid of them entirely.
---
I’ve already sold an entire set at 500 a pop. So either that person was just maxed on caps and going on a spending spree or I’ve undervalued them.
---
Instigating is very good for stealth builds, don't sleep on those either.
---
Quad is night and day better on certain weapons as well - harpoons, railway rifles, tesla rifles. Dont scrip those.
---
Two-shot is good on weapons that fire explosive projectiles like fatmen and auto grenade launchers as it actually does do twice as much damage I am pretty sure. - but you wont be able to sell those for much due to how bad their durability is + ammo weight.
---
Why have security when they can literally survive a nuclear explosion?
---
Why no ITV, it's not Thursday yet.
---
No I hate they can dig basically anywhere like when you are on a catwalk they show up or on top of a building and they show up.
---
Sweet! Just shot you a message. I’ve only played with someone else one time but have a mic/headphones and excited to see how it changes the dynamic!
---
Other than the clipping issue you mentioned, it doesn't look half bad.  I'll probably pick it up, I have the atoms.
---
Thanks for the photo, I really appreciate it.  (The paper bag is so hard to see at times).
---
Level 80-something.  I played until I couldn't finish the vault raid mission because of the constant bugging out of the NPCs.  I'm really not one to do a whole lot of daily grinding.  I played for 1-2 months.  Now I'll wait until the next DLC.  I have soooooo many other games to play: SWTOR, BL3, Scrap Mechanic, ARK, Breakpoint, Anthem, RDR2.  Don't get burnt out on any game.  Take a break and go enjoy something else.  Come back when you feel like it.
---
You can see where it glitches into the ground, that's what's normally showing. So currently you lose more than half of the bottom of the bag
---
Oh for sure, especially EQ. omg EQ.
---
There was a ITV article last week, telling us about the Update 20 and the legendaty skill-cards.
---
it went live at shortly after 12 US Eastern
---
Only the garage door is visible, but it rotates as if more is connected to it and takes up a lot of room.
---
That bag plushie is adorable! Only thing I want
---
I sincerely don’t get the Mothman hype. Bethesda *really* wants it to be a thing for 76 though. (I’m aware it’s a popular Urban legend in WV I’m just saying.)
---
That said, I expect to see every other Wastelander with that backpack now though.
---
Lmaoo my bad for some reason I thought it was Tuesday like before 🤣🤣🤣
---
Invite sent, my camp is right across from Pleasant Valley Station.
---
I distinctly remember 1 suicide molerat in FO4 near one of the Arrays in the North part of the map. I think it was something the nearby Raiders had supposedly set up.
---
Nice to hear they're on FO76 too!
---
do any if these mothman bundles contain that weird dance emote?? been waiting for that to come back around...
---
Thanks for the picture, little dissapointed with the size. Looks decent though and a ton better than the paper bag.
---
I think I found a broken or repaired one at Wavy Willards in Tox Valley. Check there!
---
I finally was able to progress on my sixth attempt! I did a couple other quests and then tried again...
---
Ok good to know. Thank you
---
Some "endless dungeons" or something like that, where difficulty scales with your gear-damage-resistance would be nice. Community already shared tons of suggestions on last 1.5 years, but game still lacks of a proper endgame.
---
Week before that there wasn’t. However my mistake for some reason I still thought it was tuesdays like before lmao
---
I'm talking about robot vendors in train stations and terminal vendors in whitespring bunker.
---
The plan, yes. But once you have the plan you can craft to your heart's content. So I usually have one of my vending machines filled with them. Also dropped quite a few during Fasnacht.
---
Yeah, that’s why I didn’t make my own thread, since it seems to be a pretty common issue. I was hoping that it would have gotten fixed in a patch or just through restarts at some point, so I let it be for a while while I went through Beckett’s quests, but now that I’m done with those I kind of want to do hers!
---
Double Shot Auto Grenade Launcher with Explosives Expert maxed out. 😎
---
Resend it
---
Ok, thanks.   Someone else has now said they changed it with no problem.
---
&gt;jetpack
---
Probably, but they didn't start skinning jetpacks until way after. Only 3 skinned jet packs exist (Mothman, RR and FS) with Free States being the only one I know of to have unique effects. Also whatever system they are using for the store doesn't seem to be designed to allow those kind of discounts.
---
Honestly the freebies for nearly 2 months now have just been repeats of previous atomic shop freebies.
---
Thanks Bethesda, you really know how to reward the loyalty of your long term players.
---
Yep, literally the only thing I want.
---
Huh, i guess their in the game now then?
---
The Marine Armor Helmet Plan has currently only dropped during the Mole Miner Treasurer hunter event.  If you didn't get the plan during that time you have to buy either the plan from someone that is selling it, or a helmet made by a player with said plans.  
---
The RNG Gods hate me so I just bought a helmet for 90 caps from a vendor machine when they restored them.
---
I deliberately left my water and collectron stash unlocked, so anyone passing by can grab some stuff. Every little helps, but i guess i should put a sign up so people dont feel bad :)
---
that dance is a fo1 thing
---
Ahem... Some of us have been waiting on the cultist stuff for weeks! All while gritting our teeth through shite Fasnacht and red rocket updates. Some weeks ya win, some ya lose. They can't please everyone.
---
Is the smoke machine only in the bundle...?
---
Like the mothman backpack and maybe the wallpapers.
---
Still no poodle skirt comeback :(
---
And what's the free thing? Because if it is the gay pride flag icon it's no free thing again for veterans and it's been weeks like this bethesda...
---
The charisma perk "Animal Friend" will allow you to tame a beast half your level.  Unfortunately it only works on animals that have spawned as a random solo encounter, which is rare.
---
I don't think it works with Wendigos.
---
There are a lot of problems with the system as it exists now though.  Hopefully it will improve, as it's a neat part of the game.
---
[Many guides online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up97cMP7eSQ) but most of the info is dated, as there have been minor changes over time.
---
It's FO1st.
---
Yawn!  Time to wait another week.  Probably will be disappointed though yet again.
---
It may be time to take a break from the game. As you probably know, new content is coming out.
---
The most common theme I see in posts like this is that the player has everything maxed. I can see how bordom is the case when ScortchQueen is the only "challenge."
---
One solution to this is not to min/max a character. Try Role Playing a character. Besides building a character that may have faults and limitations, such as not using drugs or mutations or maybe you aren't trained in crafting weaponry and armor so you need to buy it and any mods. You can apply other rules. For example: Don't fast travel, Don't deal with a certain faction, etc.
---
I am glad to see people are using 1st. I know this is **controversial** but it is my opinion that, if you can afford it, providing income for additional content is important. That is the difference between a solo offline game and a public online game. This excludes the games that just put a player in your game.
---
Whatever you do, I hope you find enjoyment and remain well. Peace.
---
all of these are good, id also settle for being able to “color down/up” for a 10% fee, to a tradeable currency that would give caps a practical usage
---
Resent
---
What, no parachute? What a gip!
---
*NVM ignore me, misread the title.
---
The plan is fairly rare yeah, if you're on the PC and want one let me know I'll make you one for free. If you want the plan, farm the bombed out building in harpers ferry, the one with the display cases.
---
Yes. Because if they weren’t in the game, they wouldn’t technically be ‘rare’. They’d be ‘non-existent’. ;)
---
The majority of the people will play through the 20-100 hours they're going to play and never see the vast majority of things the shop has to offer.
---
Seems pretty dumb, but I'm sure they know what they're doing and it probably involves keeping the whales happy.
---
hard lemonade and canned coffee is a great combo for AP; hard lemonade can be made or bought at the lemonade stand random, while canned coffee can be found in trashcans at whitesprings with Can Do! equipped
---
In the wise words of Todd Howard "It Just Works"
---
Finally! Couldn't be happier with what's on offer... For a change.
---
Yeah, I’m aware one is coming in the battle, season...*whatever* pass, but I’m shocked we haven’t gotten a single, awful looking skin for it yet that I’d somehow justify buying because the base skin for T-65 is worse.
---
I don't think scarecrows do that. I've used them and found that mobs treat them the same as anything else you put down. They'll run right by a wall of scarecrows to attack a flag sometimes.
---
I’m questing for the crocolossus backpack skin. Never dropped for me during the event. No one so far is selling it
---
I sell all plans except rare plans for bottom barrel prices. Like 9 caps. That dumps them off on noobs and gets me some sort of return.
---
I dont have a mic. Forgot to tell you
---
yup.
---
Battleship Grey only goes so far.....I'd take Matte Black over anything else.
---
I'm guessing Dr. Insano? on xbox, so if wrong platform please ignore.
---
Not anything worth logging in for, but it's nice to see the west virginia paint come back. Only seen it like twice so far, it's pretty cool for what it is
---
Figures. Was just informed that the Jetpack has no unique effects which is weird they only did it for FS and this being a stand alone release.
---
I remember awhile back when they were never in the game, some group found a way to spawn them in, scrap them to learn the plans then pass them around.
---
Same! I spend most of my time camp hoping to hope someone has a plan for sale, no such luck yet but I AM DETERMINED! I will drop 10k caps for it 😂
---
I would downvote peoples camps. I am probably not a good person.
---
Yes, it is.
---
Absolutely, 2000+ hours, level 308, 47 unused level ups.  I had stopped playing for awhile then started again with wastelanders.  The introduction of wastelanders seemed to add about 10 hours of new content followed by mind numbing repetition. I have loved the Fallout brand and really want to love Fallout 76.  Given the number of hours I have invested I obviously do not give up on games easily but it is a struggle to motivate myself to play.  In truth that struggle started long before wastelanders was released.  The only reason I still play is because of some of the friends that I have made within the game but now most of them have moved on to other games.  It is a little sad that many of my favorite memories of fallout 76 are actually bugs and glitches that were never intended to be part of the game at all.
---
On Xbox, grossnickel has an awesome floating ufo camp
---
I'm currently on a break. The toughest part, honestly, was letting go of the idea that I was "missing out" by not logging in and grinding gold/scrip. Once I did I've been enjoying my time away and don't feel much need to log in right now or at any point in the near future. Will probably stay away until the colossus event goes live.
---
You’re probably right. 
---
There’s just something off with this shop that other companies seem to have done nicely. You few me?
---
One of the main reasons I keep fallout 1st is that the atoms you get from it are cheaper than buying them but recently the entire catalogue has been pretty lacklustre
---
Well I have wanted that green map for a while, that’s good I guess.
---
Still in my stash until 5 months from now. Last year after Fasnacht my friends am I saved all our plans a few months after the event an we sold them all for BANK a few months after the event.
---
I just took the duplicates that people gave a away so I can make a small fortune before the event appears again in however many months.
---
Boring, ugly stuff. Gotta keep saving and earning more atoms.
---
On PC only. Glitched from the dev room. 
---
I don’t consider illegitimate content to be a ‘rare drop’. If it’s not intended to be in the game at all, then it has no rarity. 
---
But now it is legitimate, and the plans are a little rare, but the gear itself, not so much. I was dropping outfits at Fasnacht like they were candy. Cheap to make and they sell for good prices too.
---
Post-PVP teabagging shots and nuked camps was pretty much the impression I've had of it...
---
Bethesda's reddit account made a vague statement to a user about how many people had asked for a fridge of some sort and that they would be 'passing on the recommendation ;)' to their staff. This doesn't mean that the OP's recommendation was some startling revelation - testers had recommended it too, since food items stored in a stash rot faster. It was an obvious necessity. What ends up happening is that players did in fact get a fridge, but it ended up in the atom shop for 700 atoms(basically $7). So what did redditors do? They took Beth's original reddit quote and started a thread stating that since reddit 'created it', the vague quote basically gives the OP some form of props, so then all players were therefore entitled to owning a fridge for free, and then beth's reddit comments got downvoted into oblivion. Now the only real time Beth's reddit account even comments on a thread is when things are literally on fire, like the fasnacht event not spawning intestines, but when it comes to 'ideas', you'll get nothing.
---
At this rate, I'll have 20K atoms before anything shows up that I want to purchase.
---
Yeah, I've been bored as hell since finishing the story line in roughly two and a half days.
---
What's wrong with the garage door? Genuine question cos I bought it on release and I've  never come across any problems so far
---
I thought the jetpack skin would work on my SS armor jetpack.
---
It does not.
---
That's really poor. Thanks for saving me time, money, and effort.
---
Yes. Having a scrapbox means you don't have to spend the vast majority of your playtime trying to find loot to repair weapons and armour/craft bullets/repair camp items.
---
I read that in Modus's voice and it totally worked
---
Really don't understand how weight management is such an issue for people. Drop those missiles and nukes. Don't horde a shit load of food. And you don't need more then 100 of any junk item max.
---
Yup, i bought it thinking it would work on my SS armour jetpack ):
---
Yeah. It's not a timed exclusive, so just wait for it to either be fixed, or go on special.
---
Scrap an rebuild him.
---
I mean you have to have a gun for tagging at least for sure. I was able to get the challenge done with a Scorchbeast after finding out this 2 ft radius ordeal easy enough.
---
The worst part about melee is waiting for the scorchbeast to land. I did pick up a bloodied ultracite Gatling from faschaut that’s been treating me nicely, although relying on fusion cores for ammo is less than ideal given their 4lb weight.  What are you rocking and are you’re not changing any perks from your melee build?
---
Power Armor should naturally have poison damage reduction. Bethesda really fucked Power Armor over all in the name of fucking balance.
---
Go check it now. As of a month or two ago, it is replaced and unusable
---
Just because you in particular never have doesn't mean everybody else doesn't, either.
---
People must be buying these things or else they wouldn't offer them for sale.
---
Agreed. 100c max for flux, and if I’m buying in bulk (like 50+), I’m expecting 75 per. 
---
I can adjust that a bit depending on the situation, but that’s the market average rate. 
---
If he’s getting 300c per, more power to him.
---
I actually farming queen,encrypted,and project paradise!Love them so much!
---
Here are the guidelines I’ve been using and been pretty successful. 
---
General rule of thumb: since I can make my 1400 vendor caps quickly with crafting and selling certain items and selling at Charisma 20 (gets you 25% of item’s base value), anything I sell in my machines I can afford to do so for less than I could get from a vendor. I start at around **20-25% of the item’s base value**, but will adjust up or down depending on the situation. I also try to end my prices in ‘9’ to save both me and my customer a cap worth of tax. 
---
All chems like Mentats, Psychos, Buffouts, Med-X &amp; Fury (including derivatives like Berry Mentats and Bufftats): 9-15 caps
---
Stimpacks: Diluted 4-5c, Standard 9-15c, Super 19-29c
---
RadAway &amp; Rad-X: Diluted 4-5c, Standard 9-15c; RadShield 19-29c
---
Antibiotics: 9-15 caps/Disease Cures: 5 caps
---
Bobbleheads: 29-49  caps, depending on the buff/rarity. For a few like Leader, about 79-99c. 
---
Magazines: 9-19 caps, depending on the buff/rarity. There’s a few I price up to about 49, though. 
---
Treasure Maps: 29c for Forest, 39c for Ash Heap &amp; Toxic Valley, 49c for the others. 
---
Ammo: 1c per. 5mm, 5.56, .50 &amp; .308 seem to sell well. *(I also put up a sign offering bulk deals via direct sales. Example: I’ve sold 2000 rounds of .45 for 1500 caps. Buyer saved 500c, I only ‘lost’ 300c.)*. I almost never bother with Missiles, Mini-Nukes or 40mm grenade rounds. If I have space, I list them for 1c per for about a day or until I need stash space, then dump them somewhere public or on my front porch. 
---
Plans &amp; Recipes: About 20% of Base Value; less if it’s a common plan (I only charge 0c for workbenches if it’s at my camp north of Flatwoods), more if it’s a high demand (I charge 499c for Marine Tactical Helmet plans since they end up being so useful to craft &amp; sell to vendors). Now, there are some plans that are a lot more valuable due to rarity. The Treasure Hunter rare plans, for example. I’m still trying to pin down a fair price for those. 
---
Mutation Serums: 299c, but when overstocked I’ll lower the price. Sometimes I’ll have a themed sale. For example, during Meat Week, all my Carnivore Serums are 149c. 
---
Legendaries: Unless it’s a really good one that’s in demand, price it at 15c/scrip value.  Otherwise, start on the high side but be willing to drop price or accept reasonable offers.  Or you can get a price check from other Redditors on one of the trading subs. Learn which effects are worthwhile (Bloodied, Anti-Armor, Junkie’s, Furious, etc) and which are trash (Nocturnal, Mutant’s, etc). Some are ‘niche’ like Zealot’s &amp; Troubleshooters). 
---
People tend to want max level armor/weapons, and at least 2 stars as well, so bear that in mind. Even a Bloodied VATS Crit Damage/Fill Lever Action Rifle that’s only level 15 wont go for as much as it would if it was level 45.  (But still should go for a pretty decent amount; people do buy weapons for their alts or friends)
---
At 15c per scrip value:
---
Legendary Armor
---
⭐️ - 45c (3s)
---
⭐️⭐️ - 135c (9s)
---
⭐️⭐️⭐️ - 360c (24s)
---
Legendary Weapons
---
⭐️ - 75c (5s)
---
⭐️⭐️ - 225c (15s)
---
⭐️⭐️⭐️ - 600c (40s)
---
Do you mean that the camp would then belong to the other faction as well as you losing Reputation? Because losing Rep. is losing Rep. allowing someone to keep items they stole accomplishes that. Now that I think on it, raiding a camp would lose Rep. with one faction but gain Rep. with the other.
---
Um... you still need to find loot if you have a scrap box. That doesn’t go away.
---
You actually use the ammo vending machines? Also, why wouldn't you craft your own disease cure? Use chemist and super duper and you can get up to 4 per craft
---
These are great ideas. You could have a mixture of solo quests, and server side quests. Remember when they were counting the # of scorched or SBs to kill? Do that similarly with weird requests.
---
Find 1000 bottles of old possum to help repopulate Appalachia.
---
You don't have to be a fanboy to stand against made up nonsense...
---
Huh? He said the game was centered around monetization. 
---
Do you feel forced to spend additional money when you play the game?
---
U can transfer but safety is not guaranteed.  
---
Use world containers.   I usually like to log into my toons at set them all up at a train station first, Then do the trading.  Its to avoid any FT crashes that do happen.  
---
If i want to trade high value items I usually wait for a friend to be in my server for that just in case scenario.
---
As always thank you.
---
Considering they're kinda the same person, it's just asexual
---
Yeah, it feels like I joined this too late.  Just before I got the game, I kept seeing footage of all these cool weapons and then I come to find out that they've all been removed.  It's just Exterminator and Mutant Slayer trash now.
---
The only thing to shoot for is the Gauss Minigun, but nothing about that process sounds even remotely enjoyable so it's not happening for me.
---
Thank you for informing us on the atomic shop. Really appreciate the effort, even if I don't like the items.
---
Absolutely, if you can afford it then sure. I mean I can afford it, but it's too much over market value for me.
---
I did it back during the Xmas event.
---
I took Gorge Junkyard, Grafton Steel, Red Rocket Mega Stop, Hemlock Holes, Tyler Dirt Track, Sunshine Meadows, Billings Homestead, Charleston Landfill, Lakeside Cabins, Wade Airport, and the Munitions Plant. 
---
I play on PS4. I didn't have any issues with crashes whatsoever. Sometimes I'd also do Dabney Homestead, Beckley Mines and/or Berkeley Springs.
---
I'd set up 1 Foundation, 1 stair case, then a T-shaped platform. Santa-tron on one wing of the T. Scrapbox and stove on another, turrets all around. I set up most of the extractors along with defenses for each. I didn't bother defending them most of the time; just came back and reclaimed it when I made the rounds.
---
I also had the Tron at my own camp and I farmed scorched at Morgantown airport and Top of the World and a couple of other places as I made my rounds.
---
I think I could have taken them all, but it would have been a huge pain in the ass to defend them all constantly. I would rubber band AFK to eat and do other stuff, so it wasn't like I was constantly there, but you really need a large block of playtime to get it set up like that. I had a lot of holiday time and just did it over the course of an entire day+night on 2 or 3 different days. Loaded up on gifts and such.
---
I think you should have the ability to put scrip and bullion machines in your camp.
---
VATS works great with stealth commando. Especially with maxed out concentrated fire. 
---
Non-legendary I preferred the handmade to the fixer. But having the fixer plan sets up some really nice legendary options.
---
I always see people talking about the water wheel? What's wrong with it, that it doesn't turn? Did they ever say it was supposed to turn?
---
Might be coming in July, when the red rocket dinner bundle ends.
---
Ha ha!  I had no idea.  I finished her storyline and jumped to the old dude next right away.  Thanks!  I should add her back now that I'm done all the Wastelanders.
---
Good guess but I'm afraid not! (PS4 btw). This more... Pulp adventure...
---
I don't because they lack the most necessary stuff unavailable, hence the thread.
---
Because it's a massive pain in the ass as far as I'm concerned and player vendors so rarely have it. I'd just buy and not deal with firecaps etc. I dislike hunting plant nodes. I know how to do and I have done it, I just don't want to do it and pay for it.
---
RNG.  Was on other day and man there were legendaries everywhere I went.  Even wound up getting 3 of them in the silo.
---
Traveling vendors have bulk ammo scrap. For what you get for the price it's worth it, especially if you're looking to off load some excess caps.
---
There must be many new players who stayed after the free weekends who now have the opportunity of grabbing the pride items, still nice if there was a Pride flag.
---
Changed mine last year without issue. I would really love to also change character name though.
---
Anything worth of note trading?
---
Rootin tootin outfit and hat can be built but don’t show up in the inventory. Tested as of last night.
---
Holy cow I had no idea.  Thank you so much!  I am always crafting things out of flux to sell at those prices like shielded outfits.  Had no idea people would pay even 100 caps for flux.  When I think about it, of course, I would have paid that much easy when trying to get calibrated shocks for my excavator armor the first time lol.
---
It would be nice if at least something worked!
---
This game need more endgame boss type, like a better version of the dungeon we had, more scorched queen type fights, something to challenge us without mfing timers to make it artificially difficult
---
You cannot trade/sell/drop the cameras. They are player locked like backpacks.
---
I was on the fence about buying this. If it sinks that low, you might loose items you drop by mistake, as it might sink completely into the ground. Appreciate the info. Your sacrifice is not in vain.
---
Five digit is the new meta...
---
It turned for the first week, and when you set it down it starts the animation then quits it. Def supposed to turn, they have refunded people who bought it
---
The raider waster paint is bugged in first person when using the Syringer and Pipe weapons .
---
Eh, it is pretty much just basic stuff so mostly basic recipes, plans, med and for ammo there is mostly fusion cells and fusion cores
---
Same. Just because I’m regularly above 25k doesn’t mean I’m willing to pay triple the average price. 
---
*Fiscal responsibility, people!!  Do you think caps grow on trees?*
---
Thank you
---
Yeah and like I said that’s cool, but could’ve made at least 1 more free item for those of us who have been playing for far longer. Like a flag, or stashbox skin, etc.
---
Yeah I did a post about it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gd0czb/ok_when_did_scorch_start_firing_explosive_acid/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I was lvl 269 at the time, full health wearing mostly heavy vanguard and walking from lewisberg to the fire mine ( can't remember the name lol)
---
It was deffo a glitch mob as I've never encountered it since then
---
I like the idea, though I wonder how they would implement it. Would there be 24 vendor stalls at each location so the entire server can have a spot, or would it be more like claiming a workshop where whoever gets there first gets the spot?
---
If it's the latter, I probably wouldn't take advantage of it until they come up with a way to rejoin a server after the client inevitably crashes. I rarely claim workshops for that reason, unless I'm playing with a friend.
---
Fair enough.
---
Thanks! I got that one, appreciate you
---
This argument I will never understand, you want Bethesda to disable PVP because some pvers don't like PVP? Newsflash buddy, most pvpers dont like pve, but we aren't going on a campaign to get pve disabled. Also, 50% of pve players use duped weapons, so that argument is also shitty.
---
Hand scanners are all left hands as well.
---
&gt;before they made the decision to make all future Seasons to be free
---
That's just your spin on the event and it shows that you are not discussing with good faith. You've already made your mind that Bethesda are eeeeevil and now you are trying to pose as being objective.
---
The truth is that we don't know if the decision was made just before the clarification or long before. But Occam's Razor makes it more probable that their wording in the announcement was just unclear.
---
Love to see what the jetpack and backpack look like on a player. And wonder if the jetpack hides the backpack?
---
I mean this is pretty typical of any game that's like a MMORPG. You log in to do a set of dailies. Most of the MMORPGs I play end up being this. 
---
Personally, what keeps me busy is CAMP building and getting new perk cards. I've designed my SPECIAL to be able to use any weapon I want with decent support for doing a PA build. So as I play and collect ammo, when I run out of ammo for one gun I switch to the other. I also keep an eye out for new rolls on weapons I don't have. I've got good rolls on a mini gun, level gun, handmade, flamer, etc. And I keep collecting them. Also keep getting perk cards along the way.
---
For CAMP I love building and doing different themes. So I'm constantly finding new locations to build into. 
---
Finally, I recently discovered how you get the "rare" outfits. So I've been casually doing the events as they pop up and I'm in the mood. 
---
What you're experiencing is what they expected to happen. After you got your first set of rewards you wanted, your desire to keep doing that grind plummeted. Imagine if they allowed people to rush this and grind it out in a week. We'd have this same exact post within a couple of weeks of release. It's why they didn't make it easy to do.
---
That being said, they are trying to help solve this. Temporary events and upcoming seasons.
---
You're thinking of the Marine Tactical Helmet.
---
They could do the thing ,where you can help to random settlers to build their houses in rewards to gain some reputation and and free traveling point!Could be amazing thing
---
Quite right, though to be fair it's not hard to farm caps.
---
Also the plan sells well in my vendor for 500 caps.
---
As a mothman fan I’m pretty disappointed by the new bundle.
---
Backpack is neat - horribly overdue - and one of the wallpapers is usable butttt 
---
-	Two icons? 
---
  -	Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh to more ‘premium’ icons
---
-	Mothman PA Jet pack?
---
  -	 that should have honestly been part of the other PA paint bundle it matches
---
  -	 Not a fan of current jet pack monetization strategy
---
-	The gasmask skin feels very slap dash tbh. 
---
  -	It doesn’t have the typical emissive Mothman Eyes that we’ve come to expect from the Mothman Costmetics 	
---
IDK the way they go about all of this leaves so much room for questioning they should have seen coming from a mile away.
---
People have given them tons of ideas for Mothman stuff and seeing icons being the leading image in a bundle leaves much to be desired. 
---
I’m willing to be the tile floor in the traveller bundle is part of another mothman bundle next week.
---
I run an upscale trap camp near the Whitespring. If you manage to actually make it to my vendor machine, you’ll get as many as you can grab for free
---
You don't have to go up the pipe, there's also a staircase.
---
Quite right, so I am. Pays to read I guess.
---
Also the Teacup event spawns ants
---
I don't think of it as a backpack so much as it's my mothy son I'm schlepping around.
---
They should sell bulk ammo scrap on a reduced price, and an irem should be created known as bulk medical supplies ( when scraped provides things necesary to craft other chems).
---
Hmmm, I didn't even think of that. This is very true. Unfortunate, because I used mats to make it a height to where it sat in line with the ground normally, them deleted them. And it looked really cool.
---
I always need a surfeit of steel.
---
Do you have the Pharma Farmer perk? 
---
Equip and do a run through the Morgantown airport every now and then you will have enough disease cures to start selling them.
---
&gt;People eventually realise how shallow the pond is.
---
Unless you're playing randomly generated sudoku, then the content of any game eventually runs out. By your logic every game ends up "shallow".
---
I’m a mothman fan and i can say this new bundle is lacklustre to say the least. 
---
Two neat things buried with a bunch of atom shop annoyances
---
Thank you new friend.
---
I’d be happy to get a mothman weapon skin, does it exist?
---
Ahh bummer.  Thanks for the heads up!  I usually buy the ammo scrap from the random merchants.  I haven't seen anything else notable from Wastelanders merchants outside of the gold bullion trades, tbh.
---
Not only they vibrate,  they spin.  Lol
---
Or for clipping through doors lol
---
Raiders in FO76 have more depth than in FO4. There is a reasoning behind the lifestyle a sort of philosophy. In FO4 it was just violence and mooch off the settlers. Taking settlements for the FO4 DLC made me see Raiders as useless leaches. They weren't even capable of the simplest act of planting a carrot. If not for the settlers they would all starve.
---
In a future FO76 playthrough I am thinking of being a Gourmond with the cannibalism perk. lol
---
I thought the same, but it does say in the description that it's craftable at power armor stations.
---
Bingo.
---
Yeah. It's pretty good for new/low level players or if you want to buy supplies
---
You're welcome! I'm happy to help!
---
So always put in a ticket on those broken items. Don’t stand for half assed paid content!
---
Are you repairing the extractors?
---
And checking inside the tunnels?
---
So stupid. They expect the equivalent of $5 for it too. 
---
Why not add it to the existing PA paints as a new add on to make them more attractive?
---
As someone who got them last year - I wouldn’t complain that they sweetened the deal for others if its gonna be this basic.
---
Makes sense.  I can't see myself going through 76 again, but it would've been nice at the start for sure!
---
In every multiplayer game there is, and will always be a contingent of players who relentlessly grind til endgame then complain that they are bored.
---
You're looking at closer to 20k atm from what I've seen.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ fair point, if there weren't people like you, no one would be buying all those disease cures I keep pumping out. I like the foraging aspect
---
Yes, it's easy to run between the three of them to kill enemies and repair, not many enemies spawn.
---
the settlements in both locations should have been so much better... Specialized shops with interesting characters, I know hoping for another Diamond City is a lot, but if they gave us things to do.  
---
How about a trading zone?  Where people could go and hang out who are looking trade, put a  wanted board up. A place people could check in and add to the board what they are looking for. Then an easy way to for people to message you.
---
I could help you in about an hour or so
---
What's the backpack look like on your character?
---
Wait, there's 3 dailies at the Crater? I know there's the Importance of Communication, and Retirement Plan. Are you including Photo Opportunity as one or have I been missing out on something?
---
Ok bet
---
Not really doing anything so I will just go around farming steel
---
I use alcohol, buffout, daytripper, daddy-o, and mentats
---
I know a lot of people are disappointed but I've been waiting on that Cultist bundle to return and I am all over that backpack. Solid week, hail Mothman.
---
Wait 2 weeks after patch 20 and use the atoms to get tops rewards without  the grind.
---
Have a great day :)
---
assaultron fisto
---
I want one.
---
Those merchants are rare encounters in my experience, have very little stock and that is expensive as it includes a bunch of other stuff.
---
The thing is that Whitesprings or train station vendors might have it. I question the meaning of these vending machines though. They're a waste of polygons as it is.
---
Honestly this game really needs to make the Scrapbox a permanent upgrade/unlock, and introduce more stashbox types (ammo, aid, etc) similar to that of Path of Exile's stash tabs. 
---
People will still get F1st for the survival tent, atoms, and private worlds... and if they actually make good looking cosmetics instead of the peanut butter scout armor paints. PoE and even Warframe shows people like cosmetics a lot, and paywalling stuff like stashboxes behind a subscription just feels awful.
---
Plus they really should make plans weigh less/nothing, and if they are really that adamant of not removing daily caps at the very least make it so we can turn excess legendaries into Scip Notes.
---
The skin for the Grognak Axe, "The Stanley" break the weapon. You still have it the weapon in your inventory, but the Axe becomes unusable in most all situations. Half the time when equipped you become entirely locked up, unable to swing/sprint/jump, and then the other half of the time you "can use it", but it is treated as an unarmed attack for some reason so bonuses for 2 hand weapons no longer affect it, which once again renders it basically useless. The real kicker is after you've applied the skin, you cannot remove it.
---
Please assume the position.
---
Absolutely need poison/acid and disease resistance. It’s a joke that I’m in this bulky armour, essentially a walking tank, but stingwings and crabs and do damage overtime which destroys me and mole rats and roaches give me diseases by biting my shoelaces
---
I never knew I always wanted a Baby Moth Yoda.
---
I placed a service ticket with them on the issue, have not heard a single thing from them in the 3 weeks its been open. Have tried following up multiple times, and I have only ever received an auto response 1 time.
---
I don't see how that's any different from now, women have always had all sorts of different.... toys.
---
Two at crater and one at river adventures where you turn in mirelurk meat and help defend the pipes from mirelurks.
---
That sounds like a cool group/ Ps4 player myself, I usually try to stay away from the majority of the games community because I don't want to put up with kids or weird people. I am a solo player and I also own the freestates bundle with the power armor paint and flag, so that is really cool. It would be cool to have people backing me up and killing muties.
---
What would be awesome is an instanced zone for each faction where the player's actions are represented. The same idea as the Allies but all there at once. Trophies and other things to symbolize accomplishments for the faction.
---
We might as well make it so we can design some of it as well, just like our CAMPS.
---
Yeah same.. It's something
---
I wish I had friends that played to do stuff like this.. also that flower shower cap!
---
&gt; I think your missing the point. I feel the same way as op does and this game doesn't have to be boring. 
---
It doesn't have to be boring, but it is. Nothing ever has to be boring, but sometimes things are. The best way to let Bethesda know you're bored is to stop playing, and stop spending. 
---
I completely agree with you and the OP, at times I get bored with FO76. I take a break, I go play other games. I start a new character maybe, play it totally different than the last. The _end game_ of FO76 is trash, and it is boring. Everything after level 100 is just time wasting. The endless pursuit of mediocre legendaries that you're never quite happy with is weird to me. But that's the end game.
---
That said, I've spent hundreds of hours in the game. I had fun, I had enjoyment, I got my money's worth. I'm happy to walk away and come back as I please from this point. I don't _need_ anything else from this game.
---
I get you want the game to be better, but you and I can't control that other than speaking with our wallets. Go play something else.
---
Oh Tobias, you blow hard!
---
I’m down. PSN: mrgruenwald
---
Should we plan on a specific time?
---
Thank you.
---
Not terribly exciting but thank you for putting this together.  Upvoted because it actually contributes to fo76 talk 
---
(and to counter the numbskulls who downvote improperly)
---
So there is a 2nd daily quest for Foundation. You need a camera.
---
Yeah, I meant like carrying out a raid with the settlers, to get something back for exampl, would gain rep with settlers and lose them with raiders.
---
Atm, once you’re max rep with both, there’s not much incentive to do the daily’s, other then gold. Then eventually you’ll have everything you want and not need to do that anymore.
---
I bought mine a few days ago for 6k.
---
Yeah I did manage to get 2 rare masks but that’s it.
---
Have you played Subnautica?
---
It was great at first cause she had her own cap pool that wasn't shared with the other vendors.
---
Now this is a good idea, I'd pay for the components if they had it but vendors don't keep organics.
---
hopefully, paratrooper outfit comes next, it was on the datamine
---
There are numerous regions of the map that feel like your in a completely different game. Dont want to spoil anything but not one corner of the map feels the same
---
Introducing the new "assualtron 6000 professional massager"
---
I never knew about this one, thanks!
---
I just wish we cud downvote players vendors. Nobody is paying 5000 for a non legendary Fixer buddy, or 1000 for serums. Would save ppl the FT caps. They cud make a separate vote tally for CAMP design since some ppl would vote based on that or the vendor anyway. Iv seen plenty of good vendors that are basically a shack and a generator and plenty of bad vendors with well thought out mansions, so 2 votes would be necessary imo.
---
I feel like they gained at least 17 experience and killed at least 2 scorched
---
I just dont get it.
---
I run a stealth archer with my level 35, 2 star lever action rifle as a backup. It is 2 shot anti armor and increased AP regen I think. I can just swap my archer cards for my rifle one and so forth. Both the bow and the crossbow are just plain ole regular ones. I have the Blood Eagles skin on the bow but that's it. I'm getting my sneak cards to level up the ones that I have. I'm like level 78 or so. I have a private server and usually play solo because of, well, dicks. If anyone wants to pop in to get a quest, farm, or something, please do. Just add me to your friends list and shoot me a message and let me know you are coming.

Black Rider is the ugliest there is lol
---
tamed power armored deathclaw...sounds great
---
Just a quick question for you but how often did every robot survive the parade for you?
---
I really wanted this but, I feel like it would've looked much better if it was integrated into a leather brace/skinny backpack rather than just some metal rods floating about.
---
To fix the range you have to re equip the standard nozzle and then go back to long barrel. You will need to this every time you log in. Luckily I had over 2k screws when I played.
---
That’s why I dress her as a clown
---
I don't, I wouldn't get it and I wouldn't use it, I just dumped 500 radaways and 500 stimpaks and 200 supers. I don't want to deal with running around. I have caps that accumulate over the course of playing, I need stuff, Bethesda in their wisdom installed machines around that don't stock these while they have pretty much everything else.
---
I mean it's like life, some stuff you just do and get an exchange currency that you spend on other stuff that you don't do it yourself. I can't find these on layers vendors and I can't buy in bulk because they are heavy. It's something I need to restock low quantities frequently.
---
Once you let go of the RPG hoarding mentality, you won’t have to play micromanagement simulator anymore.  You don’t need 50 assorted steaks, 100 stims and 15 different weapons.  You also don’t need to pick up every beer bottle and dishrag in West Virginia.
---
It depends on your build, but even my loudest, most obvious power armor character shooting machine guns all day only carries a couple steaks, 5-10 water and 30-40 stimpaks at any one time.  I’d carry less stims, but I like to be prepared to take all the pylons during Encryptid if someone starts one up.  My sniper uses 0 weight reducing perks and walks around at 100-110w, depending on how much ammo I happen to have.  I never, ever spend more than a minute or two in my stash.  I can waste all my time doing quests and attending events.
---
Since I have nothing to spend caps on, I don’t bother with vending machines.  I can understand how it could be frustrating to get capped off at 30k, but why sell if you don’t need money?
---
Seriously, you don’t need to load yourself down.  99% of supplies are plentiful.  Specializing in one kind of weapon means that two or three rifles, axes or machine guns will do a better job than a grab bag of assorted weapons, and you won’t need all those stims when you can kill things efficiently.
---
Sound like I have a new pursuit  ... I have a one star Furious Napalmer, which I love, but the Vampiric effect sounds fun.
---
I got bored with FO76 not too long after release.  Got back in with Wastelanders and... well, it's been fun with the lockdown-ish time.  Something to keep my mind occupied in a fashion.  I missed out on the vault runs and was surprised I didn't notice the Vendor machines come out earlier.
---
The grind is... the grind.  It's both better, and worse, than it was before.  I don't feel like I have to monitor Reddit or Discord for trading, I can just bounce around.  But I've got my Bloodied PF and Unyielding armor set, got a slew of other solid weapons.  Even got the Gauss Minigun even if I generally use a Bloodied Ultracite Gatling.  I took to pounding through achievements for the fun of it.  Possum/Tadpole.
---
Nuclear Winter would be fun if I was any good at Battle Royale and PvP (I'm terrible).
---
The game has a shallowness to it.  Things that could/should/would be more fun if a lil more work was put in to add some depth.
---
Now I just look forward to hoping for the luck of the draw for those more-challenging Events that so very few people want to do.  Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble. That's the stuff I look to now.
---
well yeah, because of the messed up garage door, they have disabled all atomic shop garage doors, which means you cant repair, remove, or move them if they are already part of the camp. shit is fucking annoying as hell
---
I had a single foundation with two sets of stairs going in opposite directions, with four turrets on each platform. I blocked the stairways with barriers on the foundation. I built two of those gaurd towers, with 8 heavy turrets each. I then placed a third foundation in between the two with a double staircase (two stories), also blocked on foundation, up to my santatron. Never had to repair my santatron, the mobs had no chance against those towers, half of defend events completed on their own. Other half the mobs didn’t aggro in.
---
I mean 76 is a one time purchase, you probably got a lot of hours out of it already. Updates are free and thus slow so just play when a new one comes out.
---
Did you do technical problem, or refund?
---
There was only one time where someone shot a vertibot that was a little too close out of the sky and killed all 5 of the robots but other than that every time 5 robots made it to the effigy.
---
Like every 20-30 player vendors I travel, only one of them would sell. It's unfortunately an undependable method to count on when in need. I just had to restrict traveling pharmacy to rank 1 so I cannot keep high quantities in my inventory anymore and my stash is always full.
---
Emm in like 30-50 minutes
---
Ima add you rq
---
Yeah same, not really into the mothman stuff if im honest but thatnks for the post my dude
---
Thanks for your view!😊
---
I have a sign on my vending machine that says "Buy Cat Bowl If U Like Camp". I sell them for 1 cap. I love seeing when they get bought. I have a cat themed cap, but I did it with wood in another camp.
---
Technical problem. While I know it's more likely to be not fixed, I am holding on to hope because 1. Lost a good axe because of it and 2. Because it's such a bad ass skin I just want it fixed so I can use it, dont really want my money back just wanna smack some super mutties with a giant trophy on a hockey stick lol
---
i put my vendors inside my house and on a switch, if i get close to cap. lets say 28k i go home, kill the power with the switch, take down the open sign out front, and lock the front door. 
---
this takes my camp off the map and prevents access to the vendors 
---
i wish there was a closed sign version so i could switch it lol 
---
ya i love this game, and all the limits are annoying as hell. the grind is real and its also hell. i think i get to play this game like 45% of my time in it. with the new bullet sponge update coming up soonish i think ill probably stop playing all together
---
What is your goal in submitting them?  I know the obvious goal is to have them fixed, but they would not fix them just for one person.  By that I mean they are working on fixing all of those things as soon as possible.  They have also said they are aware of these issues.  A ticket would be important if they were not aware understandably.  Maybe let’s not take their time away from solving the problems they already know they have?  Not trying to be petty or bitchy or lol I am not sure the word.  So hard to write something like this on the internet because I don’t mean it in a bad way.  Just saying as someone who works in a job where people often think...”but it will only take a minute..” not realizing what is involved outside of the technical aspect.  The technical fix is always pretty easy...it’s the stuff outside of that which is difficult.
---
So I’m guessing you got more uncommon masks than commons because when all the bots survive you have a higher chance to get to uncommon and a 1 percent chance for the rare masks making it a 5 percent chance to get a rare mask for each time you do it because you have 5 masks
---
I don't think Bethesda is evil. Greedy, incompetent &amp; lazy, sure. Not everyone of course. There are obviously people who do good work in the company.
---
Also you used the wrong razor. The one you're after is Hanlon's Razor, which pretty much says don't attribute malice to that you can attribute to stupidity.
---
The Occam's razor is that PR hedged their bets with wording of the summer season being free and waited 3 weeks allowing a backlash to brew before clarifying. No company in their right mind would allow such a misunderstanding causing such negativity to persist for weeks if it could be dispelled in literal minutes.
---
I second this Xbox ladies of Fo76 clan 🤓
---
*2 years
---
An Instigating/FSS/Str Super Sledge could easily go for near max caps. I bought one for 12k and flipped it for double that two days later. 
---
Just because it’s not the ‘top-meta’ doesn’t mean it’s worthless. In fact, you can sometimes run into problems with the really high end stuff, because you pretty much shouldn’t be selling for just caps on some things and then need to find someone to trade similar high value items with and probably need to arrange a courier.
---
It’s a complex market sometimes, but there is more value than you may think.
---
sounds kinda awesome, but time consuming as you said. I think I have to temper my goal somewhat, and just concentrate on a select few, as you did. thanks for the reply
---
and sometimes you get hit with 10 stims all at the same time just delayed 10 secs, so your down but with SUPER HP
---
Oh yeah, still need to make a museum of Fasnacht masks that holds 25 of each lol
---
Although id live to have unlimited stash i also gotta say you guys need to learn to let go of things sometimes, im a super hoarder but recently i have been cutting down how much i carry, just gotta look at it like "do i genuinely use this item?" If not then scrip it
---
I am fully invested in all the Commando perks and my B25 The Fixer does seem to outperform my BE HM. Thanks for the insight.😊
---
(hides in water, does nothing)
---
I'm sitting on 5000 atoms, just waiting for something that I actually want to spend them on.
---
Summer is here.. but i'll be back in a couple of months.. yes i will
---
My goal is to get payback for the easily $30 I’ve spent on items that are now unusable and broken. I want them to fix them, I don’t expect they will fix them, I don’t want to support their lazy shop
---
This is not a please fix ticket, this is a please refund me for these broken items ticket. If you want something fixed, hit them in the wallet.
---
I used to farm Horde Events like this but then people would show up and kill the boss. Very annoying.
---
I agree with the rest of the comments, until recently I used 5 points with my 2 shot/explosive gatling gun but went to just 3 due to the small difference and only kept that much since it is my main weapon of choice.
---
Playing a different game is good advice if you get burned out on a game.  
---
People aren't getting burned out though, they are just straight up bored. 
---
If you stop playing the game there is literally nothing to come back to. That's fine on it's own, but it also causes the game to die out really fucking quickly.
---
It's a little buggy, but make sure to bring some mirelurk queen meat which you give to blackeye and then when you talk to fishbone chose the first dialog option, then the third, click through all his talking then ask him one more thing and you will have the option to help him out.
---
Need. Are you still able to acquire it?
---
Thanks 😊
---
Did you miss the bit where they repestedly stated a dozen times before launch there was no NPCs?
---
Ants often show up in the Project Paradise, Campfire Tales and giant teapot events.
---
Put a ticket in and get a refund.
---
There was a surprisingly large amount of random settler stuff added if you walk. My favorite was following my friend who broke the tree line and walked off a cliff. I broke the the line and ran into a sign warning me about the cliff. At the bottom was both my dead friend, and a settle who fell earlier. It's those little details I love the most.
---
Follow the actual quest to get the unruptured ones.
---
I enjoy it, otherwise I would just be a truck walking all over with wasteful stuff. It makes the game work. Scrapbox, should be free though.
---
Legendary items are worthless in this game. Not all of them, mind you, but about 95% of them are.
---
Pvp in this game is not skill based at all other than nuclear winter.
---
I was waiting for someone to say this
---
It's for pets. They're working on it. They've been testing it since April
---
You can’t take the skin back off right? I remember doing this and losing one too. 
---
It is a cool weapon, I bet they fix that one
---
What does DLC stand for?
---
I’m wondering something about leveling up. 
---
So I’m going out of my way to avoid all missions before hitting at least level 50. I have a camp set up near a Deathclaw spawn point and I save/quit and kill it over and over, I’m currently level 38. 
---
I tried event hopping to level before doing this but it seems like events rarely spawn sometimes. Regardless, it was too random for the time I was spending. 
---
My question is if there is any decent way of leveling I haven’t considered? I just want to hit 50 so I can dive into the content but this Deathclaw grind will take a while. Not trying to rush or expecting a shortcut, I’m just wondering if there is something I can do that I haven’t considered. Maybe event hopping is still arguably the way to go? These Deathclaws are giving me between 250 to 450 XP at a time, but more than 250 is rare (they’re level 41).
---
if you are on PS4 and have a FSS vampire switchblade cluttering up your inventory, I'd help you lose that pound :)
---
Umm... Did you read my comment?
---
Give it another go and see if your comment makes any sense.
---
Yea I hear that.
---
I’ve tried falling traps. Burning traps. Spiked traps. Flinging traps.
---
Trap bases are what made me want the game. After my first successful base I tested various structures in an attempt to make the smallest most efficient trap base, and just last month I’d finally done it.
---
I created a 2 foundation trap base that can kill a player of any level. I also used letters and various signs that say things like, “restricted” to lure players in. I like the psychology of trap bases.
---
After taking mountains of high level loot from unsuspecting players, being an overall scumbag, and creating the perfect trap base...I’ve retired.
---
It gets boring being a jerk.
---
Now I own a modest arena and have fun fist fighting randoms. The reward is of course the payment for killing the other player.
---
I keep a small shop to get people to visit, and I can easily repair it if someone griefs the arena.
---
Rules are simple. No revenge, armor, clothing, meds, stims, or weapons. 
---
Now I still get my “player killing fix” without it being at the expense of someone else’s fun or their hard work.
---
k bye
---
do you know that there are bugs active right now where ppl can take items for free from your vendor and from your stash if theirs a stash box near the spawn point. its something to do with fast traveling to right next to your vendor and the lag of everything not loaded in yet. (kinda like how you can walk through walls if there not loaded in yet due to lag)   that's why i placed my vendors far from my fast travel point and on the 3ed floor.
---
After u get the holotape it directs u too the fabricator without telling u where to get the unruptured ones
---
QA strikes again
---
Its embarrassing, but I repeat over voice chat to not kill the hoard boss, usually ends up with me singing about not killing the hoard boss. 
---
Some of the time it works everytime.
---
I do like how they incorporate your photos into loading scene images. It is a nice walk down memory lane viewing moments of our past exploits. Heck they even do it for you with the challenges and at least one quest, for those that aren't into taking pictures normally.
---
Make a complaint on bethesda.net so they can hotfix it. you can also request a refund if you're that unhappy
---
It's a power armor jetpack 
---
Doesn't need to cover any backpacks
---
That really isn't the case here, though. 
---
People that didn't grind it and took their time (like myself) are now getting bored as well.  
---
That happens with every game, but it's a really bad sign for an online game that relies on it's replayability.
---
If the eyes on the gasmask is like the glowing eyes on the gag mothman glasses I'd be on that in a heartbeat.
---
The majority of my time is spent in loading screens.
---
I think they have a QA department but management doesn't allow them the time to test properly.  Ongoing issue with management.
---
SS jetpack does not hide this backpack, they fit together perfectly.
---
That new mothman JP skin does not apply to SS JP though which is kinda stupid since non-PA jetcpacks became flavor of the month after the Wastelanders release. I guess Beth missed the point here... Again.
---
What’s the point of the vid? Duped vs hacked?
---
I believe it is for performance reasons, currently I think the worlds built try to add players based on regions to keep performance somewhat consistent, with private servers there is not the same regional checks but its limited to ensure stability
---
signal boost... i miss that show lol
---
I've done this quest like 5 times. Check the quest specific for phantom device. It shows you exactly where to go ie garrahan.
---
True, but my time spent farming still has value to me. If they’re selling something in a vendor, then they want to get caps. Caps equal time, so it boils down to ‘how much time did I spend to acquire the amount of caps they want for this item, and is that time spent less than or equal in value to this item, in my opinion?’
---
But that’s pretty much true for all things in life.
---
thats one hell of a power armor skin
---
Nothing new. All loot bags occationally fall through the ground. And corpses. And people.
---
Smoke machine is limit one, and does not follow terain, also has weird mini moth lights on the side. note it also hides the ground traps fairly well so fair warning about a smoke screen near vending machines
---
I'm not upset at all to see some Mothman stuff, but a welcome mat that doesn't set a spawn location for mapping to your camp is fucking stupid.
---
Stop hoarding.
---
Give it about 2-3 days.
---
Just dump them on your other characters via the private server, or with a friend.
---
Yeah Foundation and Wastelanders in general is really boring.  It would have been cool if choosing a side actually had consequences, like you'd be in aggro with the other faction or players aligned with it.  It's turned into a solo game where you can't even complete Wastelanders quests with teammates.  And what's the point of grinding for the gear if you can't trade it or sell it with other players?
---
Takes a bit, something like two days. If you don't see anything by wednesday evening, just send them a friendly reminder
---
Is that a fast travel mat?
---
I just hand them out to 50-60lvl players. Spread the wealth, it's just a game.
---
Only if you try to place one. If you have one placed already it’s fine. I have several across characters and they’re all still there and functioning normally.
---
Probably will at some point. Haven't made an alt yet, though planning to soon.
---
The endgame of FO76 it's very mediocre
---
That player is an amateur. 😄
---
[This is a professional leveler](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lnf6/a_guy_one_shot_scorched_queen/).
---
I would prefer drop bag skins that make the bag stand out more not less. Even without it sinking, it hugs the ground too much and it is camouflaged.
---
Make one that is fire engine red (yes, I used a crayon color) and as tall as a player character's waist. For example, A Tomestone with a responder fireman hat on top.
---
Alright, thanks
---
Get into PvP.  It's really fun and rewarding for the time you put into researching builds and gear and learning the skills.  Join a RP faction that does battles with "enemy" factions.  I think this is what they wanted the game to be but the players were slow to catch on.
---
Welp looks like i have no reason to login this week.
---
Right
---
Thanks, my mate didnt look at that one
---
Ah...ok I understand.  That makes sense as far as getting a refund.  I don’t think the people doing this are lazy to be honest.  I just think there is a lot to do for a limited size team.  I think the best thing to do is to put a disclaimer in the shop noting that it may not work as advertised upon release since that is always a possibility and have an expected time frame for solutions.  I mean there is no such thing as a product that works as advertised for all people at release in the digital or physical world, but having that disclaimer will manage expectations.
---
I was hesitant as was my friend, so drunk me timed it. It takes 4:46 from start to vault exit without dicking around. And it's a mule so who cares.
---
So ima do the nuke then later we can launch another one . sorry just tell me your psn and then I'll add you so later when you get on we can launch
---
the update that is going to make it so that lets say a lvl 10 at top of the world takes 20 rounds to take down a scorched and then a lvl lets say 498 is now going to take 20 rounds to take down the same scorched. its supposed to make it so that its more fun to play and that everyone can explore  the same location  together no matter the level . its called something like one wasteland ?
---
 to me it sounds annoying i dont want to fight sbq now because it takes so many rounds of ammo. and with the update you cant go to a low lvl area to collect a ton of scrap to re make that ammo because its going to take as much ammo to clean out top of the world as sbq fight lol
---
Actual side quests
---
When you have a phenomenal camp, people will go out of their way to let you know. Over voice chat, through friend requests, or just messaging directly. If that never happens, you gotta step up your camp game!
---
If there’s an open spot, I’m down. It will be my first time though.
---
Psn : Sir_splashalot_0.       I have a mic 👍
---
um nothing its a paper bag replacer.
---
umm as soon as I saw the image Im Like WHAT THE F\*CK BETHESDA  
---
Ur not the only one that had that happen to🤣🤣
---
It still makes sense.  
---
If you have to wait (half) a year every time for significant content to drop, people aren't going to come back anymore.  
---
The power of online games like these (especially those powered by monthly subscriptions and microtransactions) rely on replayability, of which there is none at this point.
---
If you font see them in 3 days open a ticket.
---
Take screenshots of your balance now and proof of payment just in case
---
I absolutely cannot imagine this would've been made and not 1 person would've tried it, just to see whether it actually works/appears; for instance even the creator. (because selling an image without an actual object would be a new low even for Bethesda.). So it would've been used, seen it worked (but not as intended) and then pushed out anyway, because management say so, because MONEY. It's easier to sell something and fix it later or not at all if there isn't enough complaining.
---
I can't confirm this, but I am pretty sure you will need the jetpack mod unlocked to equip the jetpack. But I could be wrong.
---
I believe it's compatible with all PA types
---
I shouve a hole buch of asstrons up my ass
---
I have the same feeling with the game "i'm bored with it fed up etc" Covid 19 gave me the time to finish off anything outstanding like the achievements or getting plans or rep for both Settlers and Raiders 
---
While i still log in daily to grind for gold i don't have anything else to do plans that i don't have i cant seem to find those either i have atoms but nothing to buy or the camp budget to actually use them
---
Well there goes my reason to sign on for the week
---
With all of these mothman items coming in I wonder if we’re about to get some cult quests added to the game
---
Move your extra inventory to a mule character.  Or stop picking stuff up.  But I agree that they have designed it to keep you playing otherwise they wouldn't have these artificial stash and cap limits.
---
Those have been free in the shop this entire time since they first offered them, they never left.
---
Haha 😂4K badge Iin apex legends and 20 kill badge is literally killing 20+ ppl in a battle royale and damaging enough ppl to kill 27 players out of a 60 person lobby. You obviously don’t know what I’m talking about. I’m done talking to u kid. Take a hike. Not to mention nobody forces you to pvp in fallout. Don’t know why ur bitching. Soft little boy, get off reddit
---
I like it for a roleplaying perspective, it looks like a proper bag. And it does have some white/red patches/stickers to help it stand out enough to see it.
---
But I agree. I thought the bag would be a bit larger (atleast height wise,) to help it stand out more considering it's somewhat camouflaged colours
---
I just blue’d myself!
---
Aghem those bad boys are worth about 25 tokens, id just keep it.
---
Nothing to that extreme. The Mire is about as close as you get IMO.  Parts of it are pretty creepy.
---
See a professional therapist with experience in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  Social anxiety can be treated effectively.

💯‼️
---
1. Exit elevator.
---
2. Get blue card.
---
3. Erase data on blue card (room directly to your right after exiting room with elevator.)
---
4. Use body scanner.
---
5. Return to room with card eraser use terminal to fabricate card.
---
6. Go to room with two terminals swipe card again.
---
Grid will now allow you to pass.

Well in her case, bolt ons, but hey that's even more fun.

this was the old way.  You could be AFK and someone could kill you without you initiating PVP.....but they had to spend alot more time and ammo than normal bc it took fractions of your health.  They have since fixed that, you now do NO damage to other players unless they shoot back.  Just enable pacifist if you dont want to pvp.  i toggle mine on and off depending on events and always turn it off after events, just in case someone feels cheeky. 
---
 Im not a PVP build, but if i can get the upper hand, my junkies minigun shreds pretty quick.
---
Maybe I’m just out of the loop, why are people upset with this bundle?
---
Why everytime I log in?
---
Is the character name the one that shows above your head in game, or is that your psn?
---
I've seen people trading legacies for them...
---
Ay could you hook me up? I still need most of the plans. I got caps.
---
That first picture is...odd.
---
It just works?
---
Agreed. Whoever runs the atom shop is an imaginationless dip
---
Christ, it’s like every solution you just want to argue with.  
---
Nobodies changing anything for somebody with that attitude.
---
Is Ark a good game...seen some bad reviews?
---
It's been 'reported' recently to one of the CMs who said they'd bring it up with the devs.  Not sure if anyone put in an actual ticket for it, though I'd be surprised if no one had.
---
That actually sounds like a realistic post-apocalyptic survival horror experience.  You'll need to move your CAMP somewhere safer and I believe it will be repaired.  Then switch to a melee weapon and do some looting until you rebuild your scrap.
---
I am hoping the build out both settlements over time and even add more. Lots of possibilities.
---
They have to push an update to fix the door. We won’t see it till a a patch 20 at the earliest
---
20+ kills and 4K damage ina single match.....not anywhere near the same as one shotting AI mutants in west tek. Even though I’m sure they put of more of a fight than you in most games 🤗🤗
---
Don’t need caps. I can give you everything but a left arm. I’ve only got one of those.
---
No just a Skin.
---
the 2 you are thinking about is healing salve mire and healing salve bog
---
edit: none of the disease cures are especially rare
---
So based on that first comment, you're saying you should play a game you're bored with because it'd die out fast if you didn't?
---
This makes sense to you given my original comment talks about not being bored by playing other games &amp; come back patch 20 (due very soon) or for the next DLC drop which could be within a few months?
---
Yeah its pretty clear they didn't put much thought into the vending machines
---
Thank you so much! I was really confused as to which it was and then couldn’t find any references. Guess who celebrated for nothing 👌🏻
---
People buy i stigating and weightless
---
I too get bored, but it's more like I just have to be in the mood.  I have so many other games that I need to move on to and I know once I do, that'll be it for FO76.
---
In game others should only see your PSN, only you can see your character’s name.
---
Don't go to /r/thalassophobia, then.
---
Pvp
---
Agreed, bump Private up to 24 and raise Adventure to 48.
---
May get the welcome mat but another week of saving up atoms
---
Yeah I'm actually going to level an alt at some point with a different play style, maybe on next double XP event. Stealth rifleman at the min so wanna try melee or power armor heavy gunner, something different. Will transfer a load when I start that.
---
Honestly not trying to be disrespectful, but maybe it is time to move to another game.  Maybe you will get the bug to return after having a little break.
---
I came back for wastelanders and had a blast, now I am playing AC Origins and wow it is a lot of fun.  But I know I will be back to 76 when new story content drops.  FO76 is a fun game, but you can get burnt out on it as well.
---
Shit tier
---
I putted ticked already with request to slow their horses with releasing new items without checking them in game :)
---
Wow super useful thanks for linking this
---
for my SS armor, i got lucky with the chest. Got an uny/AP/LD, and saved up for the Jet pack...thats the most fun ive had for a while.  Cant get decent pieces for the limbs tho.
---
I was running fascnat like that..&amp; then would occasionally blurt out over comms, 'We're streaking! Everybody's doing it, C'mon'. No one did it though
---
Np
---
Because I'm not looking for a solution, thread doesn't ask for solution. I have solutions, I employ them. I already have farmed firecaps etc, I know of Pharma Farma etc, there is no question like "guys, I need this, how do I get it?" Sorry but if I come across as unappreciative, because I didn't ask for these.
---
If someone wants to say "no it shouldn't be like this" then they can explain why. I won't say "oh jeez now I know how to get it, thanks" because I already have gone past these and none of them are solutions as far I'm concerned. Yeah I don't run out but it's a massive PITA. Let me pay and be done with it.
---
You can't put wallpaper on wooden windows still, been that way for some time now and ruins my spoopy house &gt;.&gt;
---
It also explains why she constantly comments on her Assaultron body, and why she thinks the bot got the better end of the deal.
---
You all dumping all your masks are the reason people who hold onto them will get a few thousand per in a couple months.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Yes. I need this. Mine would say wear power armor. My base is on top of a monorail pylon and has the tendency to spawn people in the air. Sorry for all those broken limbs people. Thanks for visiting my camp.
---
Okay for sure. My psn is lopezcommalauren
---
Thanks for the info regarding the atomic shop update, OP!
---
I would have joined in for sure!
---
Your just here to cry. Got it. 
---
* here’s a hanky.   Broken games broken. Ain’t getting fixed son.
---
Instead of the other "war on Bethesda" that is going on, how about an "Atomic Shop Strike" where we all stop buying Atoms or stuff from the Shop until all the bugs are fixed?  And I mean all of them, including the trade window, god mode, all that shit.
---
I can't even build up the desire to finish wastelanders I stopped at choosing a faction, the bullion grind / rep grind just takes away my desire to play. Started playing control a couple of days ago and am really enjoying it , I'm just not going to play for awhile
---
i normally sell these in my vendor for about 30 caps a piece but i wont be on till around 10 pm central time
---
End of time. I’m now into month three waiting on an “ expedited email response”.
---
Don’t hold your breath- Bethesda’s a shit grade company.
---
Yeah, the only thing worth it in the bundle is the wallpaper. Thankfully that is available separately.
---
I want to buy a marsupial serum.
---
That's what they want. Once you've drained your atom balance all you'll have is the drip feed from seasons. At a certain point, you'll *have* to pay real money for atoms if you want the newest stuff.
---
Ok hope to be seeing ya
---
No argument there my friend
---
Man, that mothman gasmask is on a whole new level of bad. Looks like they half-assed colored over the original.
---
He is stepping on BjornX's toes is why.
---
Just put it at 0 caps on your vending machine, that 100k will go fast, I am sure.
---
I have played online for years but only just started FO76 about a month ago.
---
I also avoid grouping until I know people. I find that my pace is different than others and I don't want to hold them back or push them. That being said, I have had pleasant experiences with other players here. When I was really low level more than one player dropped items for me. Just yesterday, a high level player asked if I needed any help and told me some interesting info about the place I was exploring.
---
I have read about and seen YouTube videos of not so nice interactions. So it is out there but it seems not as much as other games.
---
It is really easy to avoid griefers. You just leave the server and load into a new one. You spawn in the same area, if not the same spot.
---
Some tips:
---
Avoid claiming workshops on public servers. Don't loot anything in a claimed workshop or player CAMP.
---
Make note of a CAMP owner BEFORE teleporting to the CAMP. If possible teleport to a location near the CAMP rather directly to it. I have yet to find one but I hear about the Trap CAMPs that use traps to kill you. This is either as you spawn in or after you buy something from the vendor.
---
I would be happy to adventure with you. I am in the Eastern time zone.
---
There you go. I'd take that!
---
Yeah that’s a bug, I can actually help you fix that! 
---
Start with a normal wood wall, put on your wallpaper, click X then Y to edit wall, turn it into window, boom!
---
Stealth Bloodied Commando Build spits in the face of 20 Level 52 Legendary Mister Gutsies.  Psh.
---
Sucks that it is, which prevented me from getting the camp bundle alongside the Halloween bundle last October.
---
I found the flamer disappointing. Cool AF, but the health of enemies often rubberbanded and sometimes they would just not die.
---
That's a good point. Maybe a two tiered option. You have some standalones and a general pool where you throw your item in like a pawn shop. Maybe?
---
That's really cool they did a West Virginia Day bundle. Gonna have to farm some atoms!
---
The engine / servers are nearly at their breaking point. Example: critter spawns had to be culled to conserve resources and got added back for fasnacht. Server performance has been in the crapper ever since. Critters are tipping the balance, yet people keep proposing these grandiose dynamically scripted ideas. It just won't happen.
---
This is only a temp fix though, the second you log out the wallpaper comes off :/
---
Anyone know if you can wear a hat/helmet with this gas mask?
---
Knew some adventure mode pvp-ers that tried out nw for the first time but bailed after a handful of matches Bc, of course, can’t use their legacies and god-rolled armor lol; pvp in adventure is just shit lmfao
---
The missile launcher with the right perks is "Okay."
---
The two problems it has is that it breaks so damn fast, and half the time when it kills an enemy is sends them flying. Which normally isn't bad because it's like, who cares. I won't get the 8 .38 rounds off that scorched. But I've had one too many times where I killed a legendary 3 star ghoul in the nuke zone of cranberry bog. And it's body went flying into chunks and I couldn't find it. 
---
I do think bloody mess is slightly to blame for that. But the rocket launcher sent the chunks all over the place. And can't find the giblets in the grass. Would be nice if Bethesda made bloody mess not proc on legendary enemies.
---
At the least, anti-armor, instigating and furious are usually worth keeping. There are a number of players who don't do junkies or bloodied and are looking for these.
---
Yeah. You wouldn't want players to see vulgarities. Not in a game series featuring Fisto the sexbot.
---
Mothdalorian
---
Yep. 700 hrs in since launch on Steam, officially ran out of things to do. Now just logging in to spend to gold/script and log out. Once I run out of notes I'll just stop on the gold I think and prob won't bother farming legendaries for the script.
---
I’ve collected a helluva lot of pipe weapon legendaries for my junkies build, and in every damn scenario, junkies explosive was always the top damage.
---
Non pipe weapons with these legendary effects really go off if you have a fire rate above 100 ( except with queen), as buggy mechanics means these two mods trip the Uber god bug on weapons and you’ll start killing shit like nobodies business.  Fire rate above 200 and drop explosives for queen.
---
Trust me. Shit goes boom. Junkies for life!
---
Search for the weapons calf that’s out there for base damage comparisons across weapons- doesn’t take bug into effect, but it’ll give you an idea of which gun type you want.
---
Maybe ATHENA would be down for a  ménage à trois.***..***
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!!
---
............................no!
---
I love you.
---
Accountant. They're called accountants.
---
The sweats are to be ignored
---
My experience suggests otherwise! I’ve definitely built a whole base using that method and never had to replace the wallpaper
---
If you are on Xbox I’m happy to come demonstrate and see if we can work it iut for you
---
Yay mothman stuff.... Again... Yay
---
I know
---
That’s why I’m here.
---
.
---
GARAGE!!!!
---
God bless the people that still use the default bag so I can use the large NW crate mod on them.
---
i shoot down cargo bots every time i see them. i dont even run silos often but i sell them in my vendor for 25 caps, they go quick.
---
I don't know about the internal regulations, but I think this could be exploited by players. E.g blocking of paths to the location.   
---
But I have to agree to some degree.
---
I just want the mothman dancing emote!
---
I agree. I make it a habit to first put any teddy bears and the such, in my stash or in a display case before I scrap. I still end up scraping something I don't want to sometimes. Especially when I am not near a stash and need to reduce weight.
---
Well in these larger locations that have multiple ways to get to the area, it doesn't really matter
---
Whole games been lackluster.
---
Aunt "Peg"
---
Those are all within perimeter though, one even covers the crops folks need to take pictures of.
---
You can build near it, never within the location...
---
Heavily leaning towards the bundle, but since I don't use PA the backpack skin just might be it. Looks like I'll be picking a bunch of other stuff too. This week looks pretty legit to me.
---
(Raider Punk rolling around platform)
---
"Quiet Day on the Radio..."
---
Um, the crop farms are too big for a camp to take it up fully
---
I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.
---
She's taken, sorry.
---
Ps4
---
i'm trying to have 1 of each type of weapon as a legendary.
---
wouldn't mind each type as bloodied.
---
Yeah both foundation and crater suffer from this issue. But Foundation ROCKS compared to crater for the simple fact that the gold bullion trader is outside.
---
And you don't see even obscuring any of it is a problem? And rather selfish really?
---
Really cant advise skipping the armor penetration prrk for rifles. This build seems power armor dependant since you took 0 defensive perks but are leveling in to shottys.i dont advise nerdrage outside of bloodybuilds. That said, were playing f76, theres no wrong builds, but jack of all trades types seem to struggle more than most.
---
250 hours in and yeah. I usually log in Tuesdays...if I remember or can be bothered to.
---
Been bugged for me for 2-3 weeks now. Ever since I bought them on my alt, my main character has never been able to buy them anymore.
---
Havent talked to him on any character for over a week and he still doesn't let me buy.
---
But it let my alt buy them when I tried him after.
---
(Also, anytime I've bought from him in the past I let his whole dialogue play out without skipping anything to help avoid him getting bugged but it still got me anyways.)
---
I always use the same weapons. lol.
---
So yeah, i should just scrip them.
---
What problem would happen? There are 2 crop farms and you can't even cover up 1, its not selfish whatsoever.
---
When you claim or buy an atomic shop item expect scrap and repair kits, items are unlocked account wide.
---
Scrap and repair kits are bound to the chosen character.
---
I’m pretty sure you can block the core entrance from there
---
Wow, they finally brought one of the sleeping bags back. Honestly thought those were permanently vaulted.
---
I'm aware that was an intentional decision.
---
But there's several problems with it:
---
* Fallout (as a series) has always been a Role-Playing Game (RPG) with strong RPG elements, including stat checks, dialogue trees, and multiple endings or choices. FO76 upon release had NONE of these.
---
* FO76, as a quasi-MMO also featured none of the elements for a basic MMO at launch. No auction house or trading post, laughably bad PvP, a bank to swap items between characters, etc. etc.
---
* FO76 also failed to feature what has made Bethesda such a behemoth in the first place -- the modding community. Private servers were supposed to be a remedy to that, but FO1st members can tell you that that doesn't work.
---
* They didn't even bother to fix known bugs from the FO4 engine that modders had already fixed. They reintroduced old bugs, and added brand new ones on top.
---
* As part of a larger game industry trend, Bethesda is cutting (or not adding) content that was once a normal part of the game you purchased. They then add it in later and charge you for it, or make it seem like a "free" DLC. Wastelanders should have been in the game from launch.
---
* And this isn't even touching on the debacle of server stability, the promotional items (nylon bags, power armor helmet), or their monetization methods (FO1st, Atom shop, etc).
---
Many of these elements have been worked on or added in (for free), but **they should be seen as the baseline**. I cannot praise a company or game for doing the bare minimum.
---
Compare it to other games which add free content all the time. I play Guild Wars 2 as well, and regularly get content updates and balance changes, none of which I have to pay for. The base game is fully functional (and now free to play), and I have bought the expansions. But the core game was solid to begin with. It went above and beyond my expectations.
---
From where?
---
I have a real love/hate thing going on with speed demon. On PS4, I am constantly clipping into things because I am moving faster than the world is rendering. Also, getting tired of the constant health maintenance. But I’ve been reluctant to go back to normal speed. Conflicted.
---
The picture on the post
---
Wait. Someone took the time to create a bot just to blanket downvote? What a loser.
---
There are 3
---
What
---
Of course it is, anyone playing on your server has to either work out the indicator is now hovering over your camp, so they need to picture the other one, or find a bit not covered that triggers the picture detection, or Bethesda have to not put the marker on that one, because you're there.....
---
What were the unique effects?
---
yeah i forgot starched genes its there
---
But the you will have the same problem with that character, you literally need a mule. Just a pack mule, it is Soooo helpful.
---
I'm keeping one of each, and slowly selling the rest. I've been able to sell them surprisingly quick for 50c each, but no luck at 100c. I'm in no rush to get rid of them, so I'm gauging the market, and seeing how much I can get haha. 
---
Plans I'm holding onto until later in the year, probably when we get Fractured Steel and the game gets a wave of new/returning players.
---
I think healing factor is a noobtrap as well.
---
Pride stuff is always free mate, like the gift emote, camp terminal and the punch bowl.
---
Yeah if you buy example a outfit. You can go on any of your characters and craft that outfit.
---
With scrap and repair kits they will be unlocked for your currently selected character. You can change which character you want to unlock for within the atomic shop menu or by backong out and selecting a desired character from the main menu.
---
On the sunny bot, does he sell legendaries? I keep finding 3* mid tier weapons for dirt cheap. Occasionally a good one.
---
Unless you are actively doing dailies and events or grinding random encounters nonstop, most of the spare plans you will have are probably not worth anything. The really valuable plans aren't world drops, they are rare event rewards. With that said, I find that armor, power armor and weapon plans (except junk like the Mr. Handy Buzz blade) will move. I usually price these at 25 or 50. Some of the power armor mods like calibrated shocks you can sell for much more. In terms of stuff to hang on to and check prices of, some of the disease cures are rare drops, chem plans will usually sell, some of the armor piece plans (not mods) like marine are hard to come by and will move and any shielded or dense plans are valuable. Also, if you have any of the event only plans like sheepsquatch stuff or the caravan trader ones you can often use these in trades.
---
Yep. It's tasty stuff in summer time. Though, growing up in PA, we mostly called it Italian Ice.
---
If you really think that is "selfish" then bethesda just won't allow you to build there, it was just an example, lmao.
---
Just wait for it to go on sale or pick up a copy second hand if you can't afford the 30 bucks.
---
so youll spend money on skins but not to play.. ?
---
rocket science...
---
Bro what does that have to do with the post
---
Odds are after November if I had to guess or when they are going to push Starfield and the new Skyrim.
---
It’s possible to get 1200 atoms in one rotation correct? New here, definitely not spending money on atoms.
---
I dropped all if mine on the ground, didn't see a use in them.
---
And they don't, so you've made my point. Your point however is escaping me?
---
i love that backpack actually.  I can personally do without the rest, but that backpack is amazing
---
There’s free weekends, look out for one of those and give it a go
---
I've wanted the mothman dance emote for a while, but I'm not seeing it. &gt;:(
---
I'm not gonna try to prove my point to someone who is too stubborn to realize the main point.
---
I'm an accountant, and I can safely say that I have more imagination than whomever is putting these together.
---
Yes, after i finished wastelanders and saw the grind that was left behind i decided to walk away until new content arrives. The game deffinetly lacks the hook that a GTA online has, for example.  
---
We need a Heists level event or something along those lines, something that naturally brings people together, or something that allows us to group with our friends in a more private way.  
---
In the end, this game suffers a lot from these dead months with no gameplay content, as it has been since it launched. Granted, the game is in a much better condition now that when it came out, but has it made all the right steps? Not yet, wastelanders was a good start, but they sure seem to kill all the momentum that this DLC has brought to the table, and i understand that the world is in a bit of a catastrophe, but i think that some things could be handled better.
---
I recommend Bloody Mess when doing a jack-of-all-trades build. 3 perk points for 15% damage for everything is damn good.
---
Hey always see these posts weekly very helpful 👌 but are you a 1st member? If so it'd be great to see when they add new stuff to the 1st subscription as well?
---
Nothings wrong with him, "It just works"
---
possessed?
---
I had one visit my C.A.M.P. Then my follower blew it away for no reason. COOOOOOLLLL....
---
It's a reference to Italian Ice/"water ice," a popular summer treat in Pennsylvania (which is where most of the Foundation settlers come from.) Used to be a chain of little shops called Rita's that only opened in summer and sold it, they'd give out free cups on the first day of summer. I assume that chain still exists but I'm not living in PA (or even the US) any longer so can't really be certain. Also, never heard anyone in PA who sounds like Forrest Gump, despite Derrick's goofy voice.
---
You know you only get that if you sub to fo1st right? That and the robot dance.
---
What's the point :-)
---
Yes and it looks great. The jetpack's plate where it connects to the back is just above the metal section on the back of the science scribe
---
give me a handmade covered in vines and sticks plz
---
More stuff for ATHENA to blow up next time she's in my CAMP!
---
And that is why I don't buy nice things.
---
If you form your team before you join a server, the game will find a server that has enough space for all of you. If you have enough people you'll find this is often a fresh server. Sure, randos can join it later, but unless you have a bunch of people who are farming workshops, this shouldn't really be an issue. It would be nice if they would increase it from 8 to 12, as 8 seems a little restrictive. Or maybe they could offer a premium version where multiple people can pay towards a large team server that works for even bigger groups. But I'd hate to see them increase the cost of Fallout First more than it already is so that the private servers can be bigger.
---
It’s a canvas bag
---
I've been attacked at workshops on PS4 but I can't call that griefing. The game makes sure to specify that workshops are contestable PvP areas. I don't like PvP at all so I don't enjoy fighting over workshops or being sniped when I'm at one, but I don't blame the person doing it when it happens. I just leave the area.
---
It’s not. Very disappointing. Someone already posted a pic on this sub. I almost bought it too, glad I didn’t.
---
ahh fo1. dang, no wonder I never see it &gt;_&lt;  thanks for the replies.
---
It was a Fallout 1st item.
---
😂 Sorry
---
I believe all backpacks still clip since the last update and the giant nuka cola issue.
---
You might have been in one of the glitch zones of death that appear sometimes after acid and scorchbeast spray attacks.
---
What's a guy gotta do to get a damn Mr. Fuzzy ride around here?
---
You're welcome!
---
Unfortunately I'm not a 1st member, sorry
---
Unfortunately, that is \[was?\] a FO1st thing, and I don't recall if it's just always there, or if it was one of their monthly things...
---
Sell them all for 50 each or less to someone who still believe they'll have ant value later on
---
That’s wild! You built that giant liberator bot camp right? That thing was insane too. Great building skills man, I dig your style!
---
One of the best outfits in the game imo.
---
What’s for free this week?
---
I might have purchased it if it did...
---
oh I know what water ice is, it's pretty common in summer here around in germany.
---
I don't use PA, I just got a full set of bolstering and it has helped a ton with avoiding getting one shotted. Most of the time I'm jumping around to avoid damage.
---
Probably not. Too many other problems.
---
Beckett's fix is in the PTS patch notes, so that's coming.
---
As far as Sophia goes, I'm still getting daily quests from her.
---
The pride frame and flag which were free not so long ago too
---
Every freebie is a repeat lately...
---
Can you trade plans from the other faction?  I’m curious as I sided with the raiders for the ammo maker and the Minigun, but can a friend of mine trade me the plans for the Gauss shotgun or the farmable tiles for bases?
---
I hate that there are so many amazing recommendations here and in the comments and in past threads too yet Bethesda hasn't implemented anything. I really want to hope that they were kept vague so that they could more easily adapt them into some future story dlc, but... I know that's pretty unlikely. I sided with the settlers and don't regret it but I completely agree that even just a few more unique characters or an additional quest or two would have added so much more then what we've got.
---
GameStop deal of the day today is 76 preowned for $3.99.
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks.
---
It's like this for weeks. Free items, that were already there.
---
['Bout that time of the year again, I guess.](https://i.redd.it/kczgr4kljr251.png)
---
Why would they do something for us long time players. Not really Bethesda style.
---
It's probably not so much that anyone is *too* upset *with* the bundle, but rather just people disappointed that much of the content available this week is material that's been available before, while there are other things people are really looking forward to (like the prefab Red Rocket garage) that have not been made available at all yet.
---
Wait really? I figured I just missed them in the shop
---
To be fair PA needs "Inmunity to poison/Airborne Diseases" and "Running while Overcumbered in PA doesnt consume AP. You can sprint in PA while Overcumbered at 2x the AP cost" If they aren't going to adress the advantage regular armor has with all it's legendary perks.
---
Aww no worries heh I'm surprised they don't advertise new stuff when it gets added tbh
---
I also would like to be able to avoid the floating sky mansions when immersing myself in quests.
---
They should honestly have an event where you defend the settlement from like a scorched attack or maybe a goul attack
---
What do u mean cant be found in the vault? Doesnt it spawn in one of the locked rooms. I swear i saw one on my first run through with the raiders.
---
It got TOO slippy out, Yeah!!
---
Not just that they didn't even bring back the mothman statue which has a really cool effect with the bundle smh...
---
Yep. The Elder Scrolls Online sub suffers from the same thing.
---
I would figure it's popular in Europe considering what we called it in the states was Italian ice. Of course in the US, things with names like that aren't necessarily reflecting their origin, it's often just named that way to sound "exotic" to boost sales. Italian ice is pretty common everywhere in the US too, but in many areas of PA and NY it's like a summer obsession. I figure Sunny doesn't understand people saying "water ice" instead of "water and/or ice"
---
I'm curious, what's your ign?
---
That is exactly what I was hoping for!  Wonderful.
---
Another week of saving up atoms for the glorious BOS release.
---
Croc backpack or Mothman backpack....hmmmm
---
you can get around 500 or 600 atoms from the daily and weekly challenges per week. 
---
This will change once we get seasons.
---
Thanks! Does look quite nice, and better than I'd expected! Not sure if I want to jump on it now, though, or wait to see if they fix the clipping issue... :/
---
4lw4y5R1ghtN3v3rWr0ng
---
Same here. I did have the raider punk stop giving me quests at one point. 
---
Heard the fix was to delete his object, switch servers and then rebuild it.  I built the astronauts one instead but since doing that I have gotten a companion daily every day for about 3 weeks now.
---
How is this especially?
---
No nothing like that but I’ll always be able to haul out a ton of steel and sell the rest of the junk for caps at the nearby vendor, I also get 2 or 3 legendaries from it that I also scrip at the vendor
---
With pistols, explosive is definitely better than FFR unless you are going for automatic pistols. You basically have to rely on vats crits because there is no armor penetration for pistols. With a good explosive pistol and head shots you should be able to one shot most mobs and then use the melee for what you don't one shot. I personally find that Instigating pistols work the best if you're not doing bloodied or junkies. With the reload times, etc. You aren't going to get a second shot, so you need to make sure that first shot packs a punch and Instigating will out damage all other prefixes except bloodied or junkies on that first shot.
---
Yeah man, we desperately need more Fasnacht like events
---
Underrated comment here. Have an upvote!
---
 &gt;the fanboys here will defend all the "FREE DLCS" (that arent even worthy of calling a DLC)  
---
So what disqualifies the Downloadable content we have from being called DLC?
---
Mom said it’s my turn to play Catch the Commie.
---
Isn't that the intention though? Cultist stuff is supposed to have a crude DIY aesthetic.
---
Just hopped on to give it another go and this time most of them stayed, the 2 windows I have on the first floor reset though, so weird! EDIT: Used brick wall and got all window wallpaper to stay now!
---
&gt;and no one in the "PA sucks" threads mention it
---
because it doesn't fit the narrative of PA being left behind. PA is still far tankier than SS armor regardless of what perk loadout or legendary effects you use, thanks to the diminishing returns from DR/ER on regular armor. SS armor does give a lot more damage, but I think that fits: sacrifice damage for armor, or vice/versa. You're either pumping out the damage or taking the hits.
---
Happy blue envelope day
---
As many have mentioned, you can transfer anything between characters and its best to use a container.
---
However just to correct some of those inputs because I've personally tested ;
---
1. Going from private to adventure, and back to private does not cause you to lose stuff if you can enter private within 5min from last exit.
---
2. Dropping stuff as loot bag works to move stuff between characters but not advisable.
---
3. Biggest concern is random server crashes where you are unable to rejoin, even if your friend was in your private world. Your friend however can pick stuff up for you if done quickly before being kicked out.
---
god damn lmao
---
Stupid question, maybe, but... what do you mean by "collapsed in texture"? I'm honestly not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at...?
---
Finally, someone with an idea.
---
You put a lot of effort into these?
---
The Stanley skin for the grognaks axe changes the axe to an unarmed weapon and the skin cannot be removed
---
Good to know. Thank you 👍
---
Where's your camp module? Your pet will spawn in relation to its placement, so it's best to keep the module a good distance away from any of your structures. Also, pets just die. You'll only ever have them for a few days to a week at most before they die, vanish or you nuke your own camp to get rid of it because it keeps attacking your crops for some reason.
---
Imagine putting a welcome mat in your camp... In the middle of all your traps.
---
And now you know why it will never happen.
---
They should activate once you select their personality type.
---
Probably cause cultists are lame... but the backpack is nice
---
How long does an atomic shop rotation last?
---
He’s Just Vibing Man, Dont Harsh his Vibe
---
you had me at raider games
---
I’ll try it again, thanks. They must have a delay
---
The "badass" raiders seem to love to complain that they won't go out and scavenge, it's too dangerous. It's easier to just rob some settlers.    
---
    
---
And then you see some settler out chopping wood 50 yards from Fissure Prime, and all he's concerned about is the weather.
---
That's this sub in a nutshell
---
Maybe she snagged it before I could realize it.
---
Building is my jam, and that's a cool trick. Thanks for sharing!
---
I hope so. Would like to see them become relevant to the story/game somehow.
---
$12 and it can be yours!  You keep it after you cancel Fallout Fist.
---
Honesty is the best policy
---
I think these are more first-gen raiders, where they still haven't turned into some sort of raider oligarchy. They have reasons, or at least still bother with justifying their actions.
---
So they haven't given out the free bundle yet?
---
You need tons of acid/lead/steel/flux/ultracite just to make ammo, so no 100 junk is nowhere near enough.
---
Thanks for that. I have the module out in front of my camp, and have it positioned so that whatever pet I have will walk around out front- away from my structures and any danger. Before I tamed him, I had a megasloth for over two weeks. It lasted for more than two base relocations, and even (somehow) grew 20 levels when I moved to the most recent place. Had a mirelurk king before him that lasted longer before an Angler got him. So, apologies, but my pets don't "just die." They last if you know how to take care of them, and don't attack your camp if they aren't Scorched- at least from my experiences.
---
Baby anthroPoda
---
Ask Van Lowe
---
Wait... they don't sell Disease Cure? Wow. The *one* chem I sometimes run somewhat low on, enough that I'd *maybe* be willing to fork over a couple caps for some... and they don't carry them? That does definitely seem like an oversight.
---
Had the same problem with Beckett, he just stopped giving quests.  Moved on to Sophia a couple weeks ago and have had quests every day.  Just did a quest for her an hour ago.
---
How many allies are there 4, 5?  Switch to another one for a while then switch back.
---
Wastelanders kind of killed the replayability.  I had 5 different characters I was playing until WL dropped.
---
Now that's down to 2.  I can't stand the thought of doing the WL grind on any other toons.
---
It seems like you don't get the atoms until the sub fee clears the bank.
---
It’s all ravioli.
---
I had the exact same happen this morning, his eyes were blown out and he wouldn't move
---
It's about the only thing they update, welcome to Cashout 76 we find new ways to make money every week we also delay new content because we just want your money enjoy
---
Same thing for me -- had a vicious wolf, camp is in the same spot. never showed up.
---
it's pretty painful finding a new one
---
Lovely why can't Bethesda tease what's going to be released in the future I bought the red rocket mega diner pack after grinding 1200 atoms and it's a complete waste of atoms in my opinion the Mothman stuff is cooler.
---
&gt;Is this really how you feel when you play? That if you don’t pay you are at a disadvantage?
---
No. The game is less convenient and requires more time if I don't pay. If I want to play the game, the core pillars of gameplay in 76, exploring, shooting, looting, I need to futz with tedium that isn't fun and takes up my time. I can pay to reduce the amount of time the game requires I commit if I want to do the actual fun bits of the game.
---
Does the jet pack work “over” my excavator torso? That may be a stupid question but I think if I “ replace” it, I lose my extra 100lb carry weight without the full power armour suit on? Thanks.
---
Is that paratrooper just a backpack skin?
---
Yes, sadly happened to me too around level 45 which is quite early I think. I absolutely love the game and enjoyed those 100 hours so much and definitely plan to come back after some time. The running around though from point A to B and inventory management is what I fucking hate the most. I refuse to spend a couple of hours every session just on these two things.
---
K to
---
7..44dyzsu dea k nice  r fur x the v cv
---
I've been buying them at 20 each or less because I love Fasnacht. Im TheMasterDev on PC, pm me if anyone seriously has loads to dumb
---
What's the point? Is there a reason behind it?
---
Oh, now THAT is valuable information. I assumed you lost all the emotes/skins as soon as your sub ended...
---
Oof, the angry reddit neckbeards have arrived. Thanks for the downvotes, losers. Luv ya x
---
Don't remove anything from your vendors but the power supply. That'll hide you on the map. Alternately, if people can still buy from powered off machines (I've never checked) build them into a locked outbuilding with a garage door and cut the power to that.
---
Oh okay, was hoping for some moth man stuff lol but that’s cool
---
Dang, it didn’t work. Tried to glitch it but now I’m inside the Protectron pod
---
Ahhh I see you got the sexual assault-ron
---
I just want the fridge and sink to come back :(
---
Takeee me hoooooooo ooo ooommmmmeeeeee 
---
Buuuugggggyyyyyyyyyyyy rooooaaaaaddddssss!
---
*I* would recommend they just abandon the product and move on, but that's a personal and cynical opinion. 
---
Realistically, if they want to continue supporting 76 they have to continue utilizing the methods it's clearly built around. Which was my point about it being designed this way and why it could have been better with different design intentions. Otherwise they have to completely redesign how the game works, and that isn't feasible.
---
You got a point. Will keep that in mind!
---
There's this Bed n' Breakfast, I cant remember the name or the location but its run by two settlers and they ask you to come in and stay. Me and my buddy randomly came across this location and decided to talk to them. We didnt know we were actually able to interact with then. They told us to go to sleep upstairs.  We went up to the room both lied down in the bed . We could hear them say "they're asleep we're ready" we hear a raiders getting ready behind the door and as soon as we get up and open the door they enter dialogue with us. They're pretty much cannibals getting ready to eat us. But both of us have lvl 3 Cannibal ourselves and was able to turn the tides and murder the raiders and the settlers running the place, afterwards we ate them all 👍
---
If the bundle or stand alone item says "All power armor types" and doesn't work for the T65 then you are entitled to a refund
---
Looks perfectly normal to me
---
And re buy the Game for the next gen consoles....
---
Atom Shop is offine in the PTS maybe also for QA?
---
So my friend had this same question about the Red Rocket one. You need to know the jet pack plan for the armor before you put the atom shop jet pack on it. So since there's no Excavator jetback, you can't put the mothman jetpack on it.
---
The Cult of “Hate Everything about Bethesda no matter what” is strong on this sub Reddit.
---
Downvoting this guys hard work.  We don’t deserve players who put in their own time and energy for free to make things a little better.  Bottle up your hate and release it on your own thread.
---
Keep up the hard work my friend!
---
I have thoughts about that as well. The short version: you can get to about 300 DR/ER with armor and mutations alone. Beyond that point, adding more DR/ER, be it through perks or legendary effects like Bolstering or Vanguard's is a whole lot less useful than going for damage reductions: starting from 300 DR, just 15% damage reduction is much better defense than adding the 175 DR that a full set of Bolstering or Vanguard's can provide.
---
if you want to use defensive perks, that means Blocker (Str), Dodgy (Agi) or Serendipity (Lck). As to legendary armor effects, look for the mob-type specific damage reductions like Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, Mutant Slayer's or Ghoul Slayer's as well as the 3\* effects that reduce damage while blocking, standing still or sprinting. Mirelurks are primarily dangerous due to their poison damage, so see if you can get one or two (but not more) armor pieces with 25 poison resistance.
---
Grab everything and then submit a ticket for a full refund for everything. Thats a bait and switch maneuver and false advertising.
---
it's time to enter the world of competitive camp building
---
If im right he is actually completely oblivious to it because he's so wrapped up in his conspiracy theories and killing bugs and rodents.
---
Red Rocket was just the communist bundle proper without Fascists propaganda added on.
---
Bravo!
---
that's a great idea, I remember F03 I used to leave weapons in a container and then strand myself naked in deathclaw territory
---
race for your life, charlie brown
---
It would be nice if the welcome mat actually worked as the spawn point.
---
Just hop onto the action?
---
They uh already did?
---
Sure.  Until you run out of your 5 character slots. Then what?  Am I supposed to purchase the game again in order to enjoy it?
---
I guess he completely misunderstood what you meant when you said you have separate accounts.
---
floating in space forever.
---
SHUT UP LADY OMG OMGOGMOGMGOM
---
Praise be the winged savior! Bow down to the moth!
---
I've never actually checked it out, what special effect does the FS jetpack have?
---
Thanks for uploading!! Definitely going to be buying some sweet mothman merch! Solid week this week if you enjoy the mothman lore!
---
I got some kind of bonus like the “Well Tuned” or “Well Rested” bonus, but that was when Fallout 76 had just come out. It might not be in the game any longer or was just a glitch. I tried to google it, but didn’t find anything.
---
Yeah, to an extent. This almost looks like a low res texture though.
---
Free States was the same thing, Not a skin but an actual jetpack.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Sorry to hear that. Good luck!  Hopefully it will happen soon.
---
It's  because of console players. 
---
Companies don't update their game outside of console gaming update cycles because it costs money to update on conoles. Console players whine louder and they don't care about PC players who don't spend much money on microtransactions anyway.
---
Basically any seemingly bad design decision in AAA games these days is solely made to exploit more money from console players.
---
It’s not a bug.  The mothman jet pack skin requiring materials, I mean, not a moth itself.
---
I just wish that there was more balance between the weapons, which doesn't seem hard to do. For example Junkies has 10% damage per addiction, so why doesn't Mutants have 10% damage per mutation? It makes no sense to me.
---
I have the jetpack on it already
---
What 3 item limit? I made about 40 chest plates before I got one with life-giver and 20% weapon weight reduction. Worth it. They call me mister rocket pants now.
---
I always keep my vendors at 20 weapons, 20 armors and 100 plans. that's reason enough for most players to visit your camp. I don't set prices low first but when I noticed the weapons/armors doesn't sell fast enough I always go 500 caps lower per day. Until the first few people start to buy. Then an other 500 caps lower and it doesn't need 2 more days until my vendors are empty. Also what always goes are scrips. You got your max scrip per day and enough legendarys for the next day and more?
---
Put 3*/2*  into the vendor for cheap 500/300 caps and they will go very fast.
---
Same!
---
It's beautiful! Although my poor wallet lol
---
&gt; Foundation doesn't feel alive. It doesn't feel interesting and the only reason I think most people go there after finishing the story is for the daily.     
---
So, a regular bethesda NPC city.  :P
---
Chinese stealth armor is better than the hazmat suit.
---
Also, hack ALL the terminals in the base. You can change the targeting on the turrets to either off or attack everything (this means also the defending robots).
---
You took my comment very seriously.
---
On the Xbox it takes about two and a half to three days.
---
Along with 1200 atoms, a scrap box to save endless space, private servers to avoid turd season, a survival tent for a second free fast travel, endless skins for a New Vegas outfit.  All in all, pretty good value.  Plus you get the all powerful superiority complex according to the youtubers and their band wagoners.
---
It's like someone attached sparklers to the exhaust ports lol
---
Absolutely, I’m sick of fast traveling to my camp and ending up inside the geometry of a cliff.
---
It's 100% RNG unfortunately.
---
He's probably cranky because you woke him up..
---
Rule #4 - always dislike laser turrets
---
Stop playing. Find something that gives you joy.
---
Couldn't have said said it better lol
---
counterpoint: I love that bundle
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Only been playing for ~5 weeks.
---
This set is aesome but I really hope we get more free states soon.
---
What weapon class do your cards support? That's an important decision before deciding on the best gun.
---
It's just a radiation mutation, I mean do you NOT have a small boy growing out of the side of your ass?
---
Nice! Looks amazing
---
Snooze you lose bud
---
What does that mean, out of curiosity
---
Agreed.  I really don't understand the design.
---
Not really. I make my ammo in batches so once I'm done I have plenty of space open and like 3-4k ammo.
---
Been playing a long time but some of these are still great tips, thanks!
---
It is RNG. But there are many lists that RNG is applied to depending on the enemy/purveyor/quest. I'm wondering about the mechanics for a random legendary enemy.
---
thanks a ton! the older version looked pathetic, super happy with my improvements!
---
The fact that no one else did is even more hilarious.
---
I was able to craft a free states  jetpack for my t65. This should be the same.
---
Yes.
---
Seriously! Dude is always asleep. “He’s the boss out here.” Of what? Sleeping in bunk beds!? Sheesh!
---
steel is easy to get , you should always have alot of extra
---
Id say so yes. If you take your time alot more. I've only just finished it and I'm 200+ hours in. Spent alot of time just milling around and doing events though!
---
What do you mean by that? 
---
I'm literally asking a question since Bethesda stated how they'd be giving a free bundle. I wanted to know if I've either missed it or they changed their minds on that.
---
What was it?
---
You're very welcome! I didnt see it before, but it's absolutely perfect now. ;)
---
The bow is a novelty build, never actually meant for combat extreme combat.
---
Yeah it's unfortunate. You need to spend the precious flux to craft the backpack even if you already have the backpack. I thought it would just be a skin.
---
I have 300 hours in fallout 4. I've downloaded modded quests. But it's not fufilling my need for more Fallout lore. 76 gets a bad rap for being an MMO. But I just want more Fallout lore. So as long as I can get $40 worth of that I think Ill be happy.
---
He means 3 legendary modul a day
---
This is the way.
---
The photos don't show it, do we know if the torches actually light up?
---
You're welcome! My pleasure!
---
Another week of saving my atoms just waiting for something really cool
---
This would be amazing.
---
played around with the connectors and was able to get this, much better than the file cabinets [https://i.imgur.com/PL5xBNo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PL5xBNo.jpg)
---
Thank you! I appreciate your kind words!
---
Lazy devs.
---
Nah - scrip is too easy to earn that this is not needed. 
---
In general if you’re not selling then you are pricing too high or trying to sell things nobody wants/needs.  90% of my plans/recipes are 20 caps.  They almost always sell. But I’m not selling steeped tea recipes, ivory handle grips, or chemistry benches.
---
Oh most definitely. I loved 4 and got around 300hrs out of it. I wasn’t sure what to expect with 76 but I completely fell in love with it. Now here I am, 1900hrs in and I’m still hooked and playing daily
---
It replaces the paper bag when you drop items
---
not much of interest for an older player this week, oh well i guess i'll be saving money for next week since i already have the mothman stuff that i like
---
If I'm being honest, and theres obviously alot of people who would disagree even on this sub, I don't think it deserves as much negativity as it gets. I think it's a great game and the world is so interesting to explore. I would say that you'd have alot to see and do and you'll most probably enjoy it, but it's a different game to other fallouts with a little learning curve.
---
I don’t think it should be that way. It’s completely silent so it is great for a stealth build. Give it the damage or the reload speed to be viable and fix the hit reg. It should work as well as any single shot rifle. I understand things like the broadsider being a novelty, but a bow is a sensible weapon in a post apocalyptic setting. Additionally it has its own specific perks. If they didn’t mean it to be viable, it wouldn’t have specific perks.
---
Edit: added to comment.
---
I’m turning one of my alts into bow/crossbow only.  What annoys me is that while you handle firearms and melee weapons right handed, bows are left handed.
---
Havent played since  I redownload for wastelanders. Wont play again as long as I live. Wont support Betheada in any way again either. Not a single product.
---
the bottom two or three photos in the link show the old version for comparison, hopefully it isn't corrupt like my last attempt, took me 15 minutes to get it working 😅. thanks again!
---
It's my turn to use the sex box \*grabs vcr\*
---
Do you still get dailies when you complete their final big quest?
---
Wank, wank and more wank.
---
What is the actual point, in addition faction gear for a faction that is 100% hostile to you?
---
And how much more ugly red rocket crap do we need?
---
Hoping for the free states bundle soon, we had one of them recently but not the other one.
---
Ok cool. The most popular posts on this sub are people saying they are bored. But it sounds like those are people who are 3000+ hours into it.
---
I am planning on 13 strength and 11 perception. So I plan on going in between heavy or shotgun and rifleman.  I really don't want to do all my cards for one build like i have been reading.
---
It definitely does have it's moments of aggravation, I spend alot of time figuring out the VATS rhythm(because VATS is so borked with bows) just to get connected hits.
---
I'll agree though stealth archer is a fun build especially with the nice high crit damage....when it connects .
---
I would have to say this is definitely an oversight much like how the backpack skins worked at the beginning of wastelanders where you have to make a new one I stead of reskinning. Unfortunate but will hopefully be fixed. Thanks for the heads up cuz Cobalt flux ain't exactly an easy resource to acquire!
---
I just think we've had SO much mothman stuff, it's getting a bit boring.
---
I've had some experience with looter shooters and MMO's. So I hope I'm prepared. Destiny 2, Anthem, etc
---
Yeah that's true. I just feel like I'm missing a quest or event that'll give me something good.
---
Embrace it and build a bunker in the void!
---
I can confirm this.  No option to add the jetpack to Excavator PA, when switched to Ultracite PA the option is there, so no excavator unfortunately. 
---
I'm short 2 cobalt flux in order to craft it, so i cant speak for whether or not the jetpack has "effects" at the moment
---
Cant compete with that.....
---
What happened to the giant Red Rocket sign? The one that looked like the rocket would shoot out the top and blow up. I want that but have only seen it at a players camp. It was part of the bundle with the wrong door, anyone have any ideas?
---
Yeah it’s a rare bug that allows you to buy it for free. Make sure you don’t exit the store or switch screens and buy what you can.
---
It’s because of the pip boy. If you’ve fired a bow before, you’ll notice the bow string cuts very close to your forearm, which is why archers wear arm guards. It would get stuck on the pip boy.
---
WoW, Rocket League, CoD:MW, ESO, FFXV, Borderlands 3, Destiny 2 (until recently)
---
Those games either fit a majority of the criteria or are actually worse.
---
Oh. My. God, Becky. Look at her
---
MOTHMAN BACKPACK YES
---
eta: I just. All the mothman. It's all mine. And I have a psych visit in three minutes so I don't even get to tinker with it all. At least all this Mothman stuff makes me feel marginally better. So depressed. So that plus psych visit may be good?
---
Aghh delete dis. My precious look!
---
yep they have lights i saw it on a YT video..
---
I got back into trading. High end weapons, matched armor sets, rare plans/apparel. It’s keeping me online, but yea, it’s a struggle. 
---
I was thinking about the t-65, but not sure that alone is enough. As it is, I’m just trying to get all my gauss stuff in a bloody variant before I move on. Log in, scrip, buy legendary modules, shift stuff around on accounts.... then stare at the screen for an hour as I wonder what I’m doing with my life.
---
I completely agree with what you said about the scorched. It just genuinely makes me mad when I get swarmed by scorched level 1 and level 6 that are constantly screaming, hitting me, and sniping me with a shotgun. They do basically no damage and dont drop any good loot so its just annoying taking them all out.
---
Thanks for putting the time into this.
---
I'd say this is alot more casual. I also wouldn't really place it in an mmo category too heavily, you could do alot of stuff without even coming in contact with another player. If you enjoy building in fo4 too you'll probably get enjoyment from that, as do I, it's fun setting up shop for people to buy things from you! Best thing I'd say about the game is the world, no matter how many bugs are in the game or how much people bash it, the world design is brilliant.
---
Thanks for the nightmares 🤣
---
Was during Fasnacht, so unless you got yourself the blue Crazy Guy, heart light, ochre? wallpaper, and...uh...was that it? You missed it.
---
I block on my melee, and I've killed stuff using bash when it had like 10 hp and I needed to reload. Felt very cinematic.
---
R/wooosh
---
Just stay in pacifist mode go aggro some enemies around his camp, hide in his camp while they wreck it for you while trying to get you. It's great if you can find a SB around. Their screech attacks really do a number on a camp.
---
Yeah I always forget to do it, just like the crit meter
---
My friends and I did the nukashine challenge. No gear/weapons/clothes. Drink a shine, make it back to a point on the map using only what we find along the way. Winner gets... something. 
---
It’s like naked and afraid, 76 edition.
---
wait..you can get an assaultron on your camp?
---
Block yes, bash no....but...there are quite a few legendaries that if they have +bash damage they have bugged out effects.
---
Yeah that looks better. I also messed around with this last night using the short connector bar (without the conduit on it) and it looks weird, but less noticeable. What I’ve done on some floating things in my camp is put either a ceiling fan or light underneath the rocket to give it a fake propulsion system. It looks like that would work better on the rides than that stash box though because those are flat. 
---
Here, look at the first minute or so of this video to see some examples of how I have mine: https://youtu.be/w29Bz12ZL5E
---
Yea man, don't you know? Taking 5 screenshots and uploading them = lot of effort.
---
Darn
---
you're very welcome! I've gotten used to them having this above my bed since october 😅
---
See, this is why you negotiate the hot space nerd / dangerous robot babe threesome in advance.
---
Missed opportunity!
---
Any of you now looking to dump your bows or cross bows on Ps4 I'll take them off your hands.
---
Ah ok. Thank you for informing me. I played a little bit during fasnacht but the one week I played the bundle wasnt there. I've been perusing this subreddit quite a bit a somehow never saw a single mention of it since.
---
Gotta have original plan
---
Yep. Any of the additional Atom shop jetpack require you to know the original plans for them.
---
They still havnt done a proper endgame with fun activities :c
---
Wow really?
---
I really don’t understand how it requires more time of you don’t pay. I don’t feel that way at all but I guess we are all entitled to our opinion. Just feels like maybe we are playing different games.
---
Screw spending the time stocking/storing the vending machines.  Build a lockable structure to stick them in with a switch to power the building.  Don't want to vend?  Lock the door and kill the power.  While it won't fix the boredom, it will give you more time to play once you've found something that appeals.  
---
For me, I do camps.  The Scrap Box turned me into a Camp builder for my XB1 group, I'd give them a layout and they'd swap it with whatever pieces they wanted.  It eats up my time, I find it flat out soothing, and it keeps me involved with others in the game.  Heck, I spend most of my time on Private, but when I go public I make it a point to give a modded set of Deep Pocketed Leather armor and a modded pipe pistol to the newbies.  Again, something to do
---
These clowns still haven't fixed the rusty watermill, make it spin you lazy slow jokers.
---
So do you have an alternative to support this or any other online game that continues to evolve?
---
N O
---
You're very much welcome!
---
For heavies and not farming you'll want a gatling gun. It has a low firing rate and the ammo is cheap to make. Plus a lot of super mutants carry 5mm. Combat shotguns are good when you are surrounded by a bunch of enemies, but I've had good results with pump actions, too. Fixers and handmades are not exactly equal, but close enough so that finding one with the effects you want is the goal.
---
And as for effects? That's the big debate. Bloodied, Junkie's, Anti-armor...it depends on what you like. Most people prefer general damage weapons but you may have to start with something focused. Remember that Hunter's and Zealot's work against scorchbeasts. Mutant Slayer's will be quite nice for clearing out West Tek and Huntersville and other Super Mutant/XP infestations.
---
Legendary enemy spawns are location dependent. I’ve never seen a legendary near Flatwoods, but I encounter them quite often at harder areas. 
---
For example, I server-hop NAR Repair Yard a lot. A legendary enemy will spawn maybe every 7-8 times, sometimes less frequently, sometimes more frequently. It’s also known to spawn the Sheepsquatch. 
---
So while RNG is still the basic factor, you probably have to consider where you are located.
---
Old post, LOL!
---
No you can not trade plans aquired with gold. They are character bound. You can still hit max rep with  foundation it just takes a while. About 1.5- 2 months worth of dailies.
---
Ive been maxed with the raiders for a few weeks and just hit max with settlers last week. Ive done dailies almost everyday since wastelanders came out.  May have missed 7-8 total. My last 2 days I didnt get credit for either, so that added a little bit.
---
Sorry about that. It was small, but free stuff is free? Come to think of it there were surprisingly few posts about it, although one or two that were pretty much like "we deserve far more than this."
---
If you've been expecting  them to push out a fix for the garage door each week then you have no clue how any of this works.  That isn't a server side issue they can just toss in a fix for during the weekly atom shop update, that's a problem with the assets for the original and new doors themselves that won't be fixable without an actual patch.  They're not pushing a hotfix through console cert to fix a fucking garage door.
---
That’s why we miss.. we’re shooting wrong handed. 
---
I’m not sure about the pip boy theory, the strap can serve as a bracer and we don’t wear them on the inside of our wrists
---
People going on about Red Rocket prefab, i get it, but in all seriousness the shops 'Featured' section has been taken up with Red Rocket stuff for a few weeks now, and I'm not a big fan to begin with. 
---
Whereas i was like a child on Christmas morning when i saw the mothman bundles lol
---
I'd Rather they switched it up regularly
---
Do you not like doing events? Dailies? No side quests left to do? Explored everywhere? Done scorched earth?
---
I usually try to hop on every week to check out the atom shop but in combination of doing homework and getting my daily tiers on modern warfare I just didn't really have the time. 
---
I just sorta assumed Bethesda lied about the free bundle or something. I'm glad they pulled through though
---
Half the time he bitches at me for bringing it back, like I sold it or something.
---
The bag is glitched into the ground which makes it look much smaller
---
Ok thanks :)
---
You can also buy one from one of the whitesprings vendors of you really struggling to find one
---
They probably voted for President Di before the war...
---
Another thing.. it's an online multiplayer game with the worst team play. No sharing missions, clunky friend lists and invite UI, no clan or guilds in a world full of clans, factions and guilds. I mean they have such a limited amount able to be on a server and still have to cap your .. well everything. Not to bitch.. I love the lore.. the writing, the humor. It's the programing talent that seems to be lacking. I mean decades of lore and successful colorful story to use! Bad UI, great card system idea and they just now decided to work on a loadout option?! Who are these people?! Legendary Loot, armor and weapons are even half ass. It's almost sad./ End rant. Back to the game. I do enjoy building.. even with a huge limit on everything. Plenty of Toilet paper though.
---
Don't forget the rusty watermill is still not working after they released it, dont think these lazy slow devs will fix this bug anytime soon.
---
I've read about this one. You could use it without the plan for T65 jet pack right?
---
Good tips.  I picked up a Gatling gun not too long ago and haven't used it. I'll check it out. I saw the base damage was 70 at my level. It's higher than my final word which is 40
---
I imagine he's now over encumbered and has to SLOWLY walk all of his stuff back to his base/train station.
---
Edit: Or better yet, when he finally gets back with his new found loot, he'll see his stash is now empty and think "Oh no! I've been robbed as well!"
---
The gauss minigun is the best part!
---
Always there. It's one of the few things that is a permanent bonus.
---
if you take the time to read terminals and listen to holotapes, there is a mountain of lore to be discovered.
---
Pride week
---
The middle east bethesda is not putting a flag up, because one can assume that PR in the middle east strongly advises them not to
---
Haven't used bows yet but I've put 12 points into all bow perks in anticipation of reaching max rep to get the compound bow. Reading things like this makes me worried I wasted my points. I'm rifleman/commando currently though so don't need to move special points I guess.
---
Yeah, the menu lag has been really noticeable. I decided to rebuild my camp (after seeing some great r/FO76Settlements and it’s been a chore.
---
You could go to an area that spawns higher-level enemies and farm that.  Server-hoping is exactly exciting, but it can get you some XP, especially if legendaries spawn.
---
I only really bash weak enemies like Radroach or Fireflies. I haven't played Melee in awhile, but blocking can really help out a lot, so I try to do it often.
---
(awkward waking up animation where he glitches through the bed before teleporting right next to the bed)
---
"Finally someone with the guts to help!"
---
&gt;The gasmask skin feels very slap dash tbh.
---
You know, 76 has seen no shortage of really cheap and lazy skins... but the "Mothman" Gas Mask has to rank pretty highly up there, especially considering how expensive it is.
---
I mean, they couldn't even by bothered to... I don't know... give it compound eyes and make them glow or something?
---
As long as you don’t put a new one down nothing happens to it and if the person leaves while your in the map your camp will spawn up.
---
Just had a thought. Can you bash with gun to counter melee attack?
---
And then, he opens his stash and sees nothing there...
---
A) “Oh, I got robbed, who cheated the game like that! I’m contacting Todd right now!!”
---
B) “Oh... oh. Damn it. So that’s how stash boxes work in this game. Son of a bitch...”
---
Depends on which part. High cost bundles usually stay for 20-25 days. Whereas a skin or an icon usually only last a week
---
Does the Redder Rocket tab have anything new?
---
If you want an easier place to get unruptured ones without following the quest (don't know if there's enemies at the actual quest suggested location or not) but camp McClintock usually has two cannisters you can grab super easy. I think ones in the locked room upstairs and one is on a shelf downstairs in the rooms at the left side of the building
---
Ah. Is that all they meant? I saw that reported in a couple other threads on here, but didn't think it even looked *too* off in these screenshots. Either way, was confused by the wording - that's a clipping issue, not a texture issue. :)
---
I was trading with a guy the other day that had two. He wouldn't sell or trade them for max caps or some decent 3*. :( They were shielded.
---
This is absolute gold.
---
Yes, is doesnt overwrite the placement unless you move it yourself. Switching servers will auto place everything where you had it.
---
Downside is staying on a server where your camp couldn’t be placed means that crafting things could eat into items you have in your displays as for the duration they aren’t in displays and therefore junk items will be auto decomposed to craft
---
It does not
---
Yes, and it's been and gone, hense the 'snooze you lose'.  That's all lol
---
Edit: it included a 'cupid' neon light (heart with an arrow through it), a yellow wallpaper, and a craftable Fasnacht Crazy Guy Mask with a different colour scheme.  You didn't miss much
---
With my 2H Melee, yes I block immediately after every swing because that actually speeds up the delay for the next attack. It’s small but noticeable and if I happen to block and reduce some damage, all the better!
---
more then half of the bag is non visible, literally its sinking in ground
---
Oooh. That's to be expected I guess. Thanks for the information, shame on Bethesda
---
"  I finally popped my Nukacherry."  
---
Damn thats a good line.
---
Lol, I definitely hope it's A.
---
*"the real danger lies in any assumption that commercial visibility equals victory in the movement for LGBTQ+ rights, and in losing sight of who’s been excluded from that equation all along."*
---
[Here is an excellent article on the topic, from which I sourced the quote](https://www.them.us/story/corporate-pride)
---
It also means that we're probably getting watered down content in order to satisfy less-accepting countries like China and the UAE. I think the closest thing to an LGBTQ+ reference we got in FO4 was two women holding each other in the intro. I can think of three in NV with names and full backstories just off the top of my head; Corporal Betsy, Veronica, and Jimmy. I'd rather they make an effort to be progressive and be censored, rather than just ignore the existence of LGBTQ+ people in the region entirely to protect their corporate image/profits. If anything, this only perpetuates the notion that it is okay to pretend they don't exist in the Middle East, thereby maintaining the status quo and inhibiting real progressive change.
---
Ah ok, fair enough
---
She doesn’t deserve you
---
I almost exclusively sell plans and make a steady supply of caps off them.  You can't price them very high though with a few exceptions, and my income is from moving them in quantity.
---
Between 5 and 30 caps each for the most part depending on what exactly it is.  People come and buy 10 or so at a time usually.  I have newer characters come and basically empty 2 machines worth of plans on occasion.
---
&gt; Then if I get near max caps I gotta spend another 10-15% of my time  trying to spend it before my vendors sell something and I lose the caps 
---
Then just stop selling shit?  If you're so desperate to burn caps that you have to dedicate time to running around finding something you can rationalize spending them on just for the sake of having room for more caps do you need even more caps from selling stuff in the first place?
---
I dont know if thats what they meant but i assume as it still looks a 'little bit' stuck in the ground :D
---
Not since the last patch.
---
I run 6 charisma for lone wanderer 4 travel agent and tenderizer
---
Yeah I love the settlement system in FO4. Thank you!
---
VATS is broken for the bow right now. Once you get the hang of it without vats then its not a bad stealth build. But vats will miss a 95% shot even though the arrow will pass through the enemy sometimes.
---
Yes! I've been seeing a lot of settlers and raiders just doing their thing, and sometimes they have voice line I've never heard before. The environmental storytelling in FO games is always awesome too.
---
I just wish there were more nukashine "waking up" points and not just in the forest, because I really like wandering around in the Mire for example
---
and also i like just building different camps and making funny pictures
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
Bethesda really loves milking the Mothman. Gimme some Ingrid Cold content.
---
Ah damn didn't think of that. Thanks for the info though.
---
Yeah you can stagger enemies.
---
I had this small trick or treater show up at Fasnacht- https://imgur.com/a/5InabUZ
---
Screenshot it on the controller as someone else said, then you can either post it to your activities wall, message it to a friend or on any social media you have connected on your console.
---
If you get the psn app you can then also view your activities, including any photos you uploaded , and you can then download them to send on via email or whatsapp, etc
---
Thank you sooo much for asking this question.  I backed out of the conversation with overseer to prevent negatively effecting my rep with either faction.  I'm glad I wasn't the only one wrried about that.
---
I agree. I actually got 1900 Atoms refunded about 2 or 3 weeks ago before the vending machines and display cases came back. I bought them to use, and I could no longer use them. Once it went past a week of being disabled, I submitted a ticket and they refunded the Atoms a few days later. They were brought back a little over a week later. 
---
I did not expect them to take my request seriously, but to see it as a call to action as in "Holy shit, people are going to start asking for their Atoms back if we can't get this done" thing. Did my ticket do anything to help them get the fix ready?? Maybe, or maybe not. 
---
But either way, I support submitting refund tickets for items that are straight up broken. There is an expectation for these cosmetic items to work as advertised and if they can't make them work, then why do I buy them?
---
The pip boy strap is way too thick. If it was.way thinner it would be fine but as is it will just cause issues
---
Yeah buddy. You'll get your monies worth. Also it isn't finished yet. Still got a road map of future free DLC. By the time you catch up to the pro players. More content will be available.
---
makes the moth fluttering (when mothman shakes its wings) noise as you use it
---
So the upcoming DLC is confirmed to be free?
---
There's also the other Mirelurk daily at Ohio for Raiders, from Fishbones in the hut.
---
In Fallout 4 I do but in this game thr latency makes timing a block or bash really difficult. Easier just to kill things
---
😯🤔🤔
---
I have noticed I get a green circle with my camp 3d printer at those nuka shine locations. While I haven't tried, can you build a camp there so people wake up in your living room?
---
let me tell you, I love this game. I bought It a couple months ago and I still can't put it down. I truly regret listening to the reviews and holding off. If your on Xbox and need people to play with hit me up. GT ButtMudMike.
---
Oh, me too. This is just too funny.
---
Indeed.
---
Edit: try PTS to see what new stuff is coming to public servers.
---
Wait. Are you asking for examples of ongoing support for games that aren't egregious in their monetization? Because that's a stupid question, there are many games with ongoing support that aren't as aggressively monetized as 76. I will merely point out that there are dozens if not hundreds of titles on steam right now that are in ongoing development and support based entirely on the funds generated through basic sales of the game itself, without any microtransactions, subscriptions, or monopoly money. To say nothing of the several triple and double A games of similar success.
---
There's that smug PC elitism that makes sure we always value your opinions so much.
---
You're very welcome! And happy cake day!
---
You just assumed they lied?
---
I know they don't have the best track record, but you shouldn't blame them for you not  checking for the weekly freebie
---
So far all DLC has been free. They make their money through the Atom Shop and Fallout First memberships.
---
Try it!
---
I also sometimes play with a friend and we both drink and then try to find eachother somewhere in the map by just talking on the voice chat, it's really fun, but I actually enjoy it more when I do it alone
---
Nah. PC Master race. 😘🤣
---
That Mothman backpack is adorable, and I'm totally swooping on that spooky campset.
---
This  coming from a guy who blew 11000 caps yesterday at player vendors on 2 sets of  Halloween  pumpkin plans. No regrets. I'm a sucker for spooky shit and I missed all that content when it came out. Just wish it wasn't so rare or expensive!
---
&gt; If you're so desperate to burn caps that you have to dedicate time to running around finding something you can rationalize spending them on just for the sake of having room for more caps do you need even more caps from selling stuff in the first place?
---
While I disagree with your statement. Just so you know, commas do exist.
---
As to your statement, there is still plenty I want to buy with caps, just some of it isn't easy to find.
---
Do something obnoxious. I made a character whose quest is to obtain a god roll Fancy Single Action Revolver (which is probably never going to happen), who as a result is in an endless Scorched genocide spree for claim tickets. Also making Faschnact donuts to sell in huge numbers just to confuse people in a Faschnact themed restaurant-bar.
---
“Paratrooper”
---
Paratrooper what?! Lmao
---
I've heard it said that the pride gear never actually went away in the first place, so this is just calling attention to a freebie anyone could have received at any time in the last year.
---
I did for at least one of the cores I used
---
That's very helpful thankyou!
---
You ironically miss the point of that sub
---
LMAO your picture is miles better than mine
---
I just honestly wouldn't be too surprised. They did lie about Fo1st atom shop sales.
---
Usually a week though lately they've been staggering most bundles to last between 2 weeks and a month to overlap longer and compensate for a lack of new items.
---
None of the atom shop jetpacks can alas... I would have saved up for the red rocket one to wear with the Nuka girl outfit if that wee the case!
---
Thanks you kind stranger! Sorry for the late response
---
Hello, are you playing on Steam or Bethesda.net? Additionally, do you have any mods running?
---
If you are on PC we should play together sometime! ZeddtheRED is my IGN
---
All the jetpacks they have sold so far: Free States jetpack, Red Rocket Ranger jetpack and now this Mothman jetpack., were not skins, but jetpack plans basically. You still have to craft the jetpack to use the jetpack, even if you already jetpacked your jetpack. Jetpack?
---
if the person leaves your camp doesn't auto spawn...in my experience you have to leave and rejoin that server for your camp to spawn

 &gt; Hello, are you playing on Steam or Bethesda.net? Additionally, do you have any mods running?
---
Oddly specific.
---
It's because mutations have both negative and positive effects, while addictions are purely negative. While I agree that mutant's damage bonus should stack nased on the number of mutations, it shouldn't have the same value as junkie's
---
Yeah once you get to 200 I'm honestly not sure what to do....my build is basically all been sorted out after doing trial and error a few times and with very little end game and so many broken weapons and other glitches that make the game easy since Bethesda doesn't address them it can barely be taking seriously but I still enjoy hopping on from time to time :)
---
I am playing on Steam.   
---
The game is fully vanilla.
---
how full is your xbox?
---
For some reason, that version (especially cropped from the top before I clicked on it) reminded me of [The Noid](https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/story_main/public/TheNoid_Main.jpg?itok=RQNPuVg-) 
---
Now I want to see someone running around and giving out Pepperoni Rolls while wearing the Jester Mask and the Ringmaster Outfit.
---
Would be cool if they added some new psychoactive chems with effects some interesting effects, like somewhere between serums and normal chems with a big improvement at a larger costs then simply a small special stat debuff. Could even allow the perk card I forget the name of to remove the negative effects and last twice as long, then builds around using those perks and chems could be made. I've put too much into this and we don't even know what will happen with the cultists.
---
Storage wise? I have 541 GB free
---
Bought it thinking I'd finally found a loot bag skin I liked. When dropped it just looks a little sad and pathetic sunk in the ground.
---
Not that bad try a fully moded t65 or ss armor if u think thats bad
---
There's always nuclear winter
---
so people will have harder time stealing my flux, this seems like   a good thing...
---
Oh please. Lmfao
---
IDK if strength  improves it. My main is 1S and my alts 15S+, I haven't noticed any difference and usually it's just schorched I do it to to disrupt that stupid lunge attack.
---
Indrid*
---
Yeah that is true especially the t65
---
just an FYI. The paratrooper pack is tiny and hard to see.
---
Hopefully they increase the size a bit.  
---
I was a little disappointed after trying it out.
---
I don’t consider this egregious, I consider it extremely tame which is what attracted me to the game. 
---
I am just asking how you suggest they fund future content since you clearly don’t like the current model. So you are essentially suggesting a ponzi scheme? Just keep selling more copies of the game and that will fund free expansions in the future? Can you name an example of a game that provides free expansions funded entirely through additional sales of the game? I am trying to educate myself here. I didn’t think it was a “stupid question”. I’m not aware of any games that adds new expansions without any additional monetization beyond initial purchase. I’m not asking you to name the hundreds that are apparently out there, just the 1 that you think is monetization done right for an online game that gives free expansions.
---
After seeing a many complain waiting for that Mothman baby to be released, I feel there should be many happy people. But no.
---
somebody commented 'avoid the noid' below the photos. I never realised the resemblance 😂 I'd better open a domino's in game!
---
I love my bow/crossbow build, but do sometimes get frustrated at hit registry. The bow sucks with VATS too, so whenever I want to use that I switch to crossbow, which seems to have much superior hit chance using VATS.
---
I prefer to use bows in third person mode. It seems to increase my accuracy, personally.
---
I was JUST about to type this xD You legend!
---
Well exactly, or gained right? This game could have had millions logging in every day still, and would.be flourishing if it was designed even remotely well. But I stead the numbers will stagnate and dwindle and the commu ity will be a little echo chamber incapable of seeing any fault in the firey mess .
---
It's not a good thing.
---
Sometimes, I skip through his dialog (which you really shouldn't do if you want reputation) and fire my gun at the end.
---
Some would say that's an accident from mashing LMB.
---
Believe me, it's not.
---
Literally just pointing out facts, couldn't give less of a shit what plebs think. Obviously you are not going to value any information I can give you
---
Strong endgame build and utility perks. Pick one.
---
Alright good to know. Thank you
---
It also bores me as hell. The game keeps adding stuff DIRECTLY to your inventory when you complete events. And it doesn't even gives you the full list sometimes (displays a "..."). So you have to wander through your inventory to know what you need to drop.  
---
Also the games only display the weight for single item, not the entire stack. Plus you can't sort by stack weight.  
---
I too spend like 20% of my game time on my pip-boy. Not to mention swapping perks and etc...
---
My favorite part is in the evening hours, when most of Foundation gathers to play instruments.  And Ward always sitting in a corner, by himself, making paranoid rants.
---
I don't have the same issue, bows miss at 95% a lot but as a fire emblem veteran that's just the way she goes sometimes...
---
Oh please grow up.
---
People still enjoy it, you obviously don't.
---
So find a new game to play or stop moaning about this one.
---
Either way nothing of value will be lost.
---
One rank of cannibal and 3 ranks of lead belly basically means you'll never have to carry food or water ever again. You can eat and drink every single thing you come across without any concern for rads. Every single body is a free snack. Only dirty water and raw foods can give you disease.
---
I can't stress how much more enjoyable those 4 points in endurance have made the game for me.
---
That would be a waste of the devs time in my opinion. Play the game, unlock the plans as you go.
---
Finally maxed rep both sides yesterday took along time n got all mods for minigauss n ammo machine. 1st minigun i made was a 2shot 10 dam while aim felt good
---
They seriously need to reconsider the end-game content. Just add some tiny story content every week. Don't tell us where it is and let us find it.
---
Anybody have any idea what [that outfit](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/1U1Hd8qcKuIG6zjbebUCZZ/2da15314f583b3d7dafbd928aa2024bc/76_ATX_Mothman2020_1920.jpg) [is](https://imgur.com/e7EHVhJ)? The one with the stop sign pauldron. I've seen raiders in game with it, and also in this screenshot, but doesn't seem attainable in-game or through ATX. Same with a new Raider underarmor which is like [a tank top](https://imgur.com/lPBJJoA) or something.
---
Yeah, forgot to mention the vender heh thanks
---
\&gt;  I really don’t understand how it requires more time of you don’t pay. 
---
I can't help it if you can't understand it. I've explained it more than once here. Once more, as plainly as possible, you can pay money to:
---
* reduce the time spent farming materials for repairs.
---
* reduce the time spent farming atoms for that one item you want.
---
* reduce the time spent organizing your inventory and stash.
---
* reduce the time spent grinding seasonal goals.
---
Conversly, you can spend the time you gain  by reducing the time spent on the activities above through an expenditure of money to:
---
* spend more time grinding for that loot you want.
---
* spend more time filling your stash instead of organizing it.
---
* and spend more time doing whatever it is you find fun in 76.
---
Now you may not have paid a dime more than shelf price for the 76 experience. Cool. Me neither. But that doesn't mean the game isn't designed this way. It is clear that it is to anyone with even a passing interest in the hobby.
---
I’m not really talking high level plans, I’m talking getting rid of like cryo grenade or chem bench plans to get other low tier plans, not trading up for high tier plans
---
They cannot. You saw an old build of the PTS.
---
Sleep before you craft anything. “Well rested “ gives you’s +5 xp I believe.  As far as I recall
---
Dont let them tear you down, lvl to through 101 with a bow and I dont get frustrated. If you miss who cares, nobody saw you so just fire another one.
---
Yeah 10% is kinda pointless.
---
Gotcha I see, I didn’t know some of these had been on the shop before, I’ve only been playing a few months so it seems all new to me  and I actually kinda just dig all the mothman stuff so I might be biased.
---
Or gained.
---
ooh I like the look of those, nicely done.
---
I wish the stash rocket had a vertical variation, that could mesh well with a propeller bottom
---
Yeah I'll keep poking at it with variations, lots of options in the power connector category.... thought I was onto something with fashnot confetti, but that has no substance for placing things on 8( but now that I think about, that might help hide the pipe under it a bit
---
I also feel like new and returning items/bundles may follow a slightly different rule set. For instance, you can see the new mothman cultist icon is there for 20 days like the bundles.
---
That makes sense, I guess I’ve always been a fan of the mothman stuff and I’m still a relatively new player so a lot of it seems new to me.
---
Bash damage is a good way to tag legendaries in an event. It signals to other players that you aren't going to one shot everything and to calm down.
---
Ive been scripping crappy legendaries and trying my odds on rolling a good gauss minigun.
---
Looking to roll a zealots (for the queen) or a vampires.
---
We would gain a bit of peace from idiots constantly complaining.
---
How long did it take you?? And did you do the random encounters?
---
Shame on Islam. Not Bethesda.
---
It's by design. They get you hooked, then nickle and dime you on any features while annoying you with their game design into spending money. It's the mobile game monetization system and Bethesda is bringing it to PC with full support from people on this sub
---
Her name is A.T.H.E.N.A. you must complete the commander's questline
---
Edit: She's just a travelling merchant
---
That might be better than nukes. As it doesn't cause a server wide alert so he'd probably have no idea whats going on. Till he got back.
---
If you like the settlement system you should like the camps in this game. Fun going to other peoples to camps to shop and see what they've built. Hope you have fun, sure you will!
---
I'll be right back
---
So how did companies in the 90ies not all go out of business within 1 month. You all are delusional if you think Bethesda can barely afford to keep this goldmine running.
---
It doesn't even have a backpack. It's literally just a plushie strapped to a piece of metal
---
Don't kill the messenger kill the maker
---
I would sell it for 200 in a vending machine.
---
Bash can stagger enemies, and break their melee animations before they are able to hit you. So sometimes I do it even though I know it won't do much damage.
---
I block all the time, great for when your outnumbered as a block will stagger on enemy while you attack the other. Take a practice but it can be fun.
---
Hmm. Aside from clearing your cache (I assume you did). Not sure, if your download/upload speeds are good, problem might be the servers you log into
---
False. Even that your comment is getting upvotes is embarrassing.
---
Wow does not sell you ingame items with functions after only promising to sell skins. Wow allowed you 20 years ago to complete a quest in a party.
---
Wow Vanilla is probably the most feature completely most detailed game I have ever played. The complete story in Fallout 76 is just second rate compared to the first few starting quests in WoW. Comparing Fallout 76 to Wow is like comparing Solitaire to Fortnite.
---
A whole different universe.
---
Some griefers will invite you. Then the griefer's buddy will shot you or his friend. Once that is done the original griefer would shoot his friend and then the friend will wreck your camp.
---
Praise be to the one true holy being
---
They've done repeat freebies quite a few times now. :(
---
I sided with settlers maxed rep with them last week was down to a millimeter on the bar with raiders yesterday then did bout 20 randoms and got it finally
---
I mean how long do you expect a game to keep you entertained ?
---
Online doesent mean eternal entertainment.
---
I did it to a troll about a month ago. He was right near a fissure site and he must have come back to see what I was doing around his camp. I was sitting in his chair giving him the thumbs up emoji while a SB and all the scorch that spawn with it wrecked his camp trying to get me. Just go outside every little bit and put a shot into em to keep them interested.
---
That sounds like an awesome idea !
---
hell yeah, finally get to cart my beautiful son around with me.
---
the mr fuzzy tokens dailies?
---
[edit: oh i understand now, sorry, sleep deprivation got me]
---
I’ve cleared the save data a couple times and my speeds are good around 20mbps download and 6mbps upload, other than that I’m stumped :/
---
I’ve had mine spawn in before I don’t know if it was a fluke but I’ve had it happen once or twice.
---
Might be worth to block once update 20 is out since one of the legendary perk card gives damage and heal upon blocking an attack. Although the proc is based on chance.
---
Funny you should mention that. The confetti USED to work well for making solid walkways and placing things on those, but they did make them to where you pass through like a year ago. Let me know if you find any other good strategies, I love using some floating items in my camps and am always looking for better ways to implement them.
---
Who would downvote this?
---
Good job on the mask 👍
---
You can create an alt and run down there and do it again. Thankfully it's a low level area so you won't even have to level up, you should just be able to b-line right down to the park. The easiest away around challenges that don't register your first time around is by doing them again with an alt.
---
It does have some unique effects. The flames are a bit different and purple and make a mothman noise
---
Yeah to unlock them u complete mistaken identity but u can only do it once
---
Even though the other items are meh, and that backpack shouldn’t be in the bundle, I’m happy there’s a loot bag that isn’t Halloween or fire themed.
---
Would it count for ur main account?
---
This happend to me once but my xbox live had just expired.
---
Mutant's is a non-ask which is why I suggest it should just be removed from the game. Marsupial is powerful to the point of being game breaking.
---
In the writeup above Mutant's would be +10% damage for something you were going to do anyway, while Punishing is +30% damage regardless. There's just no place for it.  The reverse actually presents players with an interesting choice - Staying completely unmutated and rad free isn't easy to do and requires going without the broken marsupial mutation.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to point it out
---
Xbox live is all good, every other game works like a dream, just the only game I wanna play is bugged
---
"Voices" is the quest "Someone to Talk to"
---
Sorry those are just plain ole US government assholes and not the BoS.
---
Is that sofia?
---
That's so cool!
---
I'm an old lady so I dont tend to mic with all the kids much. Are you on ps4 ? I'll happily clear out the ghouls at whitespring so you can loot and explore freely :)
---
Those verti-birds aren’t connected to the Brotherhood- simply there so players can get nuke codes.(It’s something to do with launching a nuke not sure if it’s actually nuke codes).
---
I'm like 80% certain that poison damage exists for no other reason than for Mirelurk Kings to flex all over Bloodied builds. I mean, it's good that the build has a check to it but Lurk Kings beat the shit out of non-Bloodied everyone as well.
---
Incredibly convoluted and messy.
---
I agree there should be some balancing but I don't like your ideas.
---
Lol
---
Wastelander was literally just a PR move to say "hey look we listen, we added 100 000 ways for you to spend atoms and made the game as annoying as possible and without any useful camp items to force you to spend money to enjoy any aspect of fo76 at all but we ADDED  NPCS"
---
No worries
---
I'm level 875. I used to play 5+ hours a day. I play for maybe an hour a day now. I do my dailies for scrip to roll SS armor. I have 5 level 50+ characters I do daily scrip on. Then I log off. 
---
I've got 3 accounts and they're all so full on caps I have to burn them all buying ammo. Today I spent 20k on fusion cells so I could sell stuff. Making 10-20k caps in a sitting is not uncommon for me. 
---
Game needs stuff.
---
PS4? So that's whey there was a roof party of people wearing fashionable glasses and nothing else!
---
Of course
---
They did, bullion.
---
Umm.. is that a pedo bear mascot mixed in with the pride stuff?
---
Tsk tsk Beth.
---
Ohh what a little sod! Dont be put off by little shits like that though!
---
Dont suppose you're tempted to post his gamer name are you.. ?
---
There for the nuclear keycards
---
Do I just raise the reputation? 
---
Thank you so much for the info!
---
That’s actually what I did. Played until I got bored. Left from maybe October until Wastelanders
---
What grade are you in
---
&gt; Also extra bash legendaries mean nothing to me.   
---
Keep on thinking that... I love me some furious 40% bashing broken ass accelerated minigun.
---
I'm too evil...this would of been my secret
---
They can’t destroy your camp, as in store or scrap anything you’ve built. They can’t even move the items you’ve placed or cut the electricity. They can build in your camp though so they could try to mess with you by filling your budget completely by placing items everywhere, but I’ve never experienced this myself. Overall, I wouldn’t sweat the randoms on your team
---
Oh okay
---
That's... unfortunate, but exactly the type of stuff I was afraid of. 
---
What exactly do they gain by doing this?
---
Yeah, it’s exclusive to 1st members. Those two emotes along with the ranger outfit and helmet with a desert skin you get upon joining 1st. There’s a couple other minor things like icons and photo mode stuff but I can’t remember which ones.
---
The first reply about locked doors was way too subtle. Koodos for admitting 20 min in the nuke silo fixing pipes and crap  is too long when you can kill the SBQ in under 2 min. I myself have screwed up and taken some of the best close ups of a wide assortment of doors and some walls as well!
---
I've played since launch and the camp does not spawn in on a server after someone leaves your spot. You must rejoin. There's a bug that had the camp taken notification show up incorrectly, or possibly the tent, but the camp places anyways.
---
Does the jet pack skin only apply to power armour jet packs or can you apply it to the secret service chest armour mod? Anyone know?
---
Nothing. Doesn't change the fact they added no real content aside from a few gimmicky npcs that could literally just be computer terminals. So they baited scrubs you like you into shilling for them "But Bethesda gives us FREE DLC" while making the game even more grindy and pushing people even more towards purchasing atoms.
---
Same! Literally I just log in to exchange notes to bullion and off I go on TLOU.
---
Well I mean, there is a lot of truth in your comment
---
Not that I'm disagreeing but just a little curious, what makes being able to jump higher game breakingly overpowered?
---
I literally cannot remember the dudes full name. Titan-axe? Some shit like that.
---
Nothing puts me off donating to the needy!
---
Ok. This is good news. Thank you.
---
My budget is pretty much maxed out anyway do they'd have a hard time building anything.
---
I feel the same. Somewhere about 25 runs into the Fasnacht Event I suddenly really understood why some higher level players just go around helping new players and giving away free stuff--what else is there to do??
---
That's really annoying.i erased the game and reinstalled it but that's a pain in the ass honestly.have you been on a private server lately? I had a bug during faschnaut that I had to do private before and move location before I could spawn in public server
---
It’s 1650 atoms. 1st is a good value for one month and then never subbing again. If you keep paying for it after a month you’re only paying for the scrap box and maybe the private server if you use it a lot. The tent is nice but it’s not worth paying for imo. And yeah I guess the atoms too which is nice but I still think the price is high for just those things month to month. And there’s not enough good things in the atomic shop to spend all those atoms on. I find myself sitting on thousands of atoms waiting for the atomic shop to be good.
---
The Nuka Cola projection lamps... Projects maybe 2% of the time since I purchased it.
---
It's stats, more regular daily login  in their financial department planning logs automatically results in more atoms spend if the game is designed to annoy you into spending atoms. It's similar to many strategies casinos used to use to keep their players coming back and addicted before it was outlawed in many modern countries.
---
Go troll somewhere else. You know wastelanders is more than just adding NPCs. I don’t even know what you are talking about with the atoms comment. What I gather is you want a big camp expansion? Ok? Wastelanders was never that.
---
You get a holotape, and You get a Vox Syringer from a box, and shoot animals with it, then they "talk to you" for 30 seconds while you stay in range to record data (I recommend having a stealth suit or stealth boys)
---
starts in Monogah, at a house with a basement (dr something). Mole dudes are usually lurking around)
---
Thought everyone knew that already same with the wide shelves you can stack full size on them the same way.  Trick to those is attach the second shelf up on the left side and the rest snap in nice and clean with no ugly overhangs or clipping.
---
Atomitc Shit this week too, i'm waiting to the Secret Service Armor Skins
---
Got the same bug. I think hes saying he hasn't even got her out of the bunker. I've got the flight recorder and when I talk to her she only says "this place is doing a number on my back." That's it. Cant give her the flight recorder at all.
---
yes it does, you just constantly pick everything up and put down the tent every 10 mins to empty your inventory.
---
The soldiers who claim to be moving to foundation never arrive... I think the mire ate them!
---
Fireproof optional for pvp (fire can ignore armor)
---
Yes. Well you probably can't force them into your living room, you can build at those locations. I had a CAMP at a nukashine spot before and while pretty rare, I did get some random visitors from time to time lol.
---
Do you feel annoyed and need to buy atoms?
---
BS, do you have the slightest idea how lucky you are ? lol
---
Yeah, the atom challenges are account wide so doing them on multiple characters counts towards the same pot.
---
I read here a long time ago that someone it drop for them so as soon as I saw them I was like “oh wow” now that is rare.  I was due so glad it was something I will use!
---
Yes. It does cost mats to build though.
---
I can help if you still need it, I'll be on in about 20 minutes
---
Then you meet the booty taker https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnUFZjxQPM4
---
You still are looting... maybe even moreso
---
Well, of course the BOS are the enemies. We, in the Enclave, are waiting for them to show up, so we have some real traitors to shoot at.
---
I want an unlockable different skinned equivalent of any atom item. As they promised in their advertising for this game. Everything else is mobile gaming.
---
The NPC do nothing and could easily all be replaced by robots with barely any change. This is not progress they haven't even brought the game to a point where it is worth playing if you aren't a total fallout 76 lore nerd or don't like The Sims 3.5: The Apocalypse furniture store.
---
Is my game bugged?
---
I can craft 4 versions of healing salve but none of them have any effects.
---
Explosive is 20%. So demo expert adds 60% of that which is 12% for 5 perk cards, totalling 32% explosive damage.
---
For 5 perk cards, there's way better options.
---
Bows are great but it is broken in vats there is a trick. When you enter the vats at the same time relase attack button . (In compound bow you must ready to fire before entering vats) This means %99 chance of hitting  even it is %15 chance and also if it is going to hit enemy it will. In sbq fights when I succesfully hit her even she just fly away arrow will follow her and still deal damage. How I know all of this. Well after wastelanders came I stop using J2525 handmade J3325 radium bows are fun just need to understand how it works
---
Nylon!
---
My dream of selling the hard-as-balls-to-make recipes would finally come true, in the form of a restaurant CAMP. Sucks that the only craftable food item that doesn't spoil is the Faschnact Donut which is a horrendous pain the ass to craft and does so little.
---
Especially since you can't even transfer the gear from one character to the next. Get a God roll gauss weapon on the wrong character and it's worthless.
---
Well, it's no pint sized clown with a knife, but it'll do.
---
I expect holotapes filled with legends and horror stories...
---
... at least one spoofing the hook-hand urban legend, and another spoofing Lassie's Lost Timmy deal
---
Fireproof can make you immune to scorchbeasts scream attack. Consider using blocker and dodgy.
---
they could've done it like the camps but limited to group-only visibility. There are 4( I think) huts behind the elevator in Foundation, make it when you join a group their rooms load in for you and your room loads in for them, vice versa when you leave.
---
I'm so confused what I just watched, but thank you
---
Even better yet, he bumps into a lovely Yao Guai and when he lays peacefully on the ground he sees a friendly message at the top of his screen ‘Another player has taken...’
---
Just want the contemporary bundle back, been a while.
---
Wait i have the free states but have yet to use it. Whats unique about it
---
I have been playing from beta as well what does that have to do with anything? I was just saying that I had it happen once or twice not saying your wrong and I’m right I’m just letting the person know what happened to me. Like I said it could have been a bug or fluke or something like that. Just passing on my own encounter and knowledge of this.
---
Ooooo... 
---
... I wonder if this could finally unlock the nukashine Dreamwalk thing
---
I'm gonna shoot the first BOS I see in the forehead.
---
The power armor heads are those actually helmets or skins for helmets?
---
Surprised that the backpack isn’t a bundle exclusive.
---
Buttmud's at it again
---
When was it advertised that every skin in the atomic shop would have a non-atomic version? I don’t even know what that means.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks.
---
Lawn flamingos EVERYWHERE
---
&gt; I don’t consider this egregious, I consider it extremely tame
---
I have to question your perspective. 76's monetization methods are "extremely tame" compared to what exactly? Because 76 utilizes almost all of the proven monetization methods that have been explored over the last decade. I'm very curious what you are comparing it to that it could be described as "extremely tame".
---
&gt; I am just asking how you suggest they fund future content since you clearly don’t like the current model.
---
I've already answered this for you. If they want to fund future content they need to either completely redesign how the game is monetized and how content is added to it, which is unfeasible at this point. Or continue doing what they are doing, which is effective at making money but ineffective at making a good game.
---
&gt; So you are essentially suggesting a ponzi scheme? Just keep selling more copies of the game and that will fund free expansions in the future?
---
Lol. No. Were it designed this way, they could sell expansions too. And I'll point out that Wastelanders is a far cry from a free expansion. It's content that should have been in the base product. And all of the "free expansions" are paid for by micro transactions and subscriptions. They aren't free even if you aren't the one paying for them.
---
&gt;Can you name an example of a game that provides free expansions funded entirely through additional sales of the game?
---
Um no. I never claimed that was the case. You said "an alternative to support this or any other online game that continues to evolve". There are loads of games with active support and regular updates without additional monetization beyond sales. Expansions are different and loads of games sell expansions without additional monetization. And again, the "expansions" 76 gets aren't free either. they are paid for by subs and atoms.
---
&gt;I’m not aware of any games that adds new expansions without any additional monetization beyond initial purchase.
---
Then you must be new to the hobby. Bethesda's very own Skyrim and Fallout 4 were such examples before they tack the creation club on. They sold expansions without microtransactions or subs.
---
&gt; just the 1 that you think is monetization done right for an online game that gives free expansions.
---
76. Does. Not. Have. Free. Expansions. You are working under a preconceived and false notion that Fallout 76 has free expansions because they are given to everyone. They are funded by subs and atoms, and thus the cost of the product is separated from the product itself, but it is not free. If everyone unsubbed tomorrow and stopped buying atoms, there would be no more expansions, there would be no more seasons,  and eventually there would be no more game because they would shut the servers down.
---
It isn't free. Everyone is just living on whale-fare.
---
Or time to critically think about playing a worthwhile game
---
I don't have to spend any time trying to find anything. I just press e while walking. I'm not looting I'm exploring the level/ map while doing the quest and looking for lore.
---
Not really into Mothman stuff, but the post is still appreciated.
---
😉😁.   Wish they would fix it.  Def takes away from the game, but at the same time running the whole silo correctly is a bit much for a 1* drop most of the time.
---
Thanks, dont like that one, too much effort
---
Can you get these from large holiday gifts now? I think I got a sitting gorilla from opening the large holiday gift but I’m not sure.
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch thing is a good place for that, if no one is available, or servers are jerks
---
Photo Opportunity is a independent quest that can be used for either of the two factions
---
This comes up daily, but I would hate the see how much budget that would eat up. Especially cause people would want to display multiple suits. I have 12 fully customized suits but I bet that would be over 20% of the total budget to display
---
Yes. Raise rep with Foundation and have about 5500 in bullion to spend.
---
Thank you fot posting these.
---
(uses Raider PA as Scarecrow)

[Edit: or Strangleheart, either way]
---
Thank you!! PSN is taxanddeath.

[“Everybody get naked! come on don’t be stuck up, it’s gonna be great!”](https://youtu.be/0cdnc_xrgeQ)
---
A skin would be an alternative to an existing item already. That's what a skin is. If there is no item to skin it is not a skin. E.g. ice cooler, smoke machine, collectron etc
---
I was thinking that as well!
---
I would just figure out what works for you in place of lone wanderer when running with a group. I would run Strange in Numbers at least. Refractor isn't bad for events like Encryptid. I think the only way to up your damage would be to switch to a different weapon prefix or get rid of healing factor so chems have more of an effect. Vampires weapons are a good way to tank at events as well.
---
We get it, you don't like the game.
---
So move on because nobody cares if you do or don't like it.
---
You are producing nothing of worth and coming across like a karen.
---
Is that what you are really after?
---
Oh my bad. I never bothered to find a camera so that's on me.
---
You mean settler wanderer, not forager. But yeah, she’s dirty
---
Nice thanks. And the 3D printer location more or less adjusts your spawn point.
---
ValtTeck, lvl 80
---
You can save a point if you dont mind switching out for the travel perk, helps you reallocate for more combat efficiency, if you run for instance 4 charisma for line wanderer and 1 in tenderizer since it has diminutive gains after the first rank, you can swap tenderizer for travel and back after traveling. I also understand that it can be forgotten or annoying to switch back, but it could help strengthen a build. Just saying. =D
---
yeah they argued they had to make the NPCs passive in order for there to always be the right NPCs for conversation and quests...but they definelty could've given the location some more love in form of activities there.
---
Sounds like nuclear winter but less fun without any rewards. 
---
Not that I like or enjoy nuclear winter, but honestly that's pretty much it. You spawn naked, gather some gear and run to the safe point while trying to survive.
---
He's pint-sized to the pint-sized slasher but, legends gotta start somewhere
---
Lol I wish I had room to decorate! 
---
I built a sort of watch tower/lighthouse and it's eating up my budget...I want to take it down so I can decorate my cabin better but it's just so cool and the view is amazing. 
---
I'm behind the penitentiary and can see the top of the world. I'm surprised it even renders that far!
---
 Was  the MMO or MMO lite a big thing in the 90's.  I know wow came out in 2004.  What was server costs then with 56k internet. I was in north east michigan with 33k so I was just happy when askjeeves loaded up.  You know they are a business right.  They dont spend there own money.  It took the entire airline industry like 2 weeks to need a 50 billion dollar bailout from us tax payers.  But thanks for the ITT tech run down on 90's video game economics!
---
will he go away if we give him cranberries?
---
The Free States group on Discord always welcomes new recruits. I'm PC, but we have a decent number of xbox users too https://discord.gg/JBXNWx
---
and what's weird is that it def existed in the game very early on. i had it either in beta or right after full release, i forget, had it on the open air second story of my cabin and would spawn there. i didn't move my initial CAMP for over a year, and when i stored it, it just kept saying something about unable to be placed or unavailable.
---
Fun thing is, these vertibirds are actually from the Enclave/Government and escort the nuclear keycard transporter.
---
This game could benefit from crossplay. On PC I find lots of people, mainly friendly, and I'd imagine the console community could use the companionship.
---
I put mine in a bathrobe next to the decontamination shower for a bit hoping she would take the hint and clean up, no such luck though.
---
Considering the Flamer is still bugged from FO4 I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Ok that gives me a really good guide to shoot for.  Those king mirelurks are my nemesis with that noise they make.  Is that poison damage they do?  I had always thought it was a certain kind of energy damage but despite raising my ER it never mattered much.  This makes total sense now lol.  
---
I still don’t have great energy resistance though actually looking at your numbers.  I think mine is 179 on a brave day.  My DR is good but my energy is horrible.  I was thinking about using the grounded serum, but I hate to do that because I love using a gauss rifle and that would ostensibly nerf the energy damage output. 
---
Along the lines you were saying, I am more interested in limiting their damage and increasing mine.  I think you can be really careful throughout a lot of the game but once you have conquered everything the wasteland has to offer with enough defense and stimpacks, you are tired of being hit...you wanna hit back...even if that means you might die more often lol.  
---
I have realized that the real endgame for me is not having a single build that does most things, but builds that can be switched out for maximizing the extent to my current folly.  Like deep pockets and high capacity backpack to explore and loot, and then another set of armor for the solos focusing on robot damage reduction, and finally an event set.  Of course...those last two are primarily power armors I suppose as that’s what I generally wear for SBQ and like the Encryptid.
---
Oh... the horror... the forager is an old man. And you put him in the red dress, and you call him she.
---
Now thats a nightmare fuel.
---
When did they advertise there would be free variants of all camp items?
---
I read in advance to advance both equally and saw that if you didn’t do both before the final choice you would miss out.  So I did one settler and one raider choice but both got their Chinese Suits.  Then when I saw the 4000 gold cost or something for the suit  I was like OMG!   As a casual player that is a month or more of doing dailies, plus smiley, plus a lot of events just to get something that took a few more days before you picked raider.  Then you need the secret service armor, maybe a weapon or two, brutal.
---
The literal only weapon in the game with a strong "bash" attack is the minigun...when out of ammo and used as a giant blender. It's actually disgustingly powerful when used this way with the 40% stronger bash legendary effect, but i seem to get that effect on everything but miniguns.
---
I think it's a stash
---
Propose your own.
---
We both know you won't. 
---
One of the problems with Reddit is salty dim witted bastards can brigade and down vote things out of visibility without any real effort. At least you bothered to post. This pattern isn't conducive to improving the game.
---
One of the things I've thought of doing is using my skills as a web designer to put together a site to hold suggestions that people could read through similar to the Minecraft suggestions site.  I'm not going to bother though because getting the word out about the existence of the site would be downright impossible given the unyielding negativity of this site.
---
How cool would that be if we could record holotapes and leave them around?!?
---
I do the same exact thing without a scrapbox. Pickup stuff as I go. I assume you are a 1st member? You weren’t able to do that before you subscribed?
---
Yeah we could use a dialogue option that says, "you stink, take a bath or leave." Water purifier and bathtub, or decontamination shower required. Lol
---
I get ya, was more suggesting how to get the plans you are putting in your machines to sell better.  That's actually what I tend to do, sell excess plans and when I get close to max caps go and buy some more plans that I don't actually have.  It's an extra step from your suggested machine but it works.  Isn't quite as convenient though.
---
that would be the old government, however, if you part of the Enslave, us members of the Free States might need to have a word with you about sharing the means of your production with the people *slowly sharpens knives*
---
I'm only 71 and I've been feeling that for a few days, since I got the gold from the vault.  There's stuff to do but I don't really have any interest in grinding, a little more exploring but there's the grinding to do instead.  I feel good enough, just some lv 45 excavator PA (I do have 1 calibrated leg so can carry 400, and the medic pump.) and my best weapon being a mutant's 50 cal machine gun with +10% damage aiming and resistance reloading.
---
Im skeptical because I feel the same in a simple excavator suit. All you need is the emergency protocols, doesn't matter what frame your using, and bingo you're invincible (except vs poison)
---
I removed first aid 3 and took the rank 2 to get nerd rage 2
---
The bundle with the wrong door is the 2nd Red Rocket pack 
---
The giant rocket was in the 1st pack 
---
Came and went like 2-3 weeks ago
---
Yes. I truly feel this game deserves resistance. And that it should go down as an example of a developer getting greedy, ruining a franchise and they should be penalised for never testing their game and releasing garbage update after garbage updates
---
Ok Karen.
---
Wait, whats wrong with the flamer?
---
At least you'll know how much camp budget you have, using FU's.
---
Does anyone think the contemporary house building set will return anytime soon? 
---
I know it just left recently, so I would think it will be some time. Any ideas?
---
Jesus Christ, and I just got my jetpack fuck lol
---
That's an idea, could reallocate that back to first aid or elsewhere if you drop the one charisma. Only thing charisma points are good for imo is the vendor discounts, but you can get that with other charisma boosters.
---
Yeah so your gloating about bloodied being useless because there's a glitch to exploit for people "in the know". Reality is most people don't read up on the best glitches to exploit. Magic weapons are a bug not a feature lmao
---
Minor modification to the assaultron blade, lets call it the Butcher Pete mod. And assaultrons are well known for their head game.
---
I'd like to speak to the manager of making shitty games please and charging insane amounts of money for aesthetic bullshit please!
---
You can’t trade the bullion pieces.
---
If you snap a screenshot or even better manage to catch a recording of it, then stuff usually does happen.
---
Im a bloodied unyielding build with 2 bolstering pieces I think I'm looking to get heavy robot ot just any kind of raiderish looking heavy armor to get the legendary perk effect when it drops
---
Ok karen, please excuse me whilst i buy more atoms and help to prop up the thing you detest so much.
---
Yes, that's all he wanted all along, but everyone was out
---
Dropped them
---
They aren't afraid to run around doing it. The weapons have been in the game for 6 months now and I haven't seen any of the people using them get banned. I still see hacked 50cals at the SBQ fights pretty often.
---
You can't sell skins for items that aren't in the default game. If you are selling an item that isn't in the default game you are not selling a skin. They said there would be only skins for sale for real money.
---
Only one of their many tricks to make people believe this isn't a mobile game-like. This isn't a court. Bethesdas lies have been obvious for years and if you are giving them the benefit of the doubt that's on you. All they have done is lie and introduce more monetization over the past year while going " welll techniiicalllyyyy"
---
Egregious would be things like paywalling new quests, preventing you from progressing unless you pay, charging you to take part in specific events. These are all things common in other games, not in 76. 
---
I am going to ask one more time... how do you suggest they change the way the game is monetized that still allows them to develop new content and support the existing product?
---
So you can’t name a single game that does what you are proposing? We get new content added regularly to the game (Van lowe, wastes on nukashine, player vending, factions, new enemies, new weapons). None of it is paywalled. I am just asking for another game that does this without any monetization beyond initial purchase lol. you say there are hundreds and cannot name 1???
---
Also fallout 4 charged for DLC before the creation club... all 5 DLC cost money. That is content lacked behind a paywall. 
---
I understand the expansions in 76 are payed for through monetization. My point is that all monetization is completely optional. You and I are able to enjoy all of it without spending a cent. That is what I (and everyone else) mean by free DLC. Obviously they make money off the game. Nobody is denying that. 
---
I still don’t understand what you want. Do you want to have to pay for each DLC and update like in other games? If that’s your opinion, I guess you are entitled to it. I personally hate that practice. I bought 76 because I didn’t HAVE to spend additional money to enjoy DLC. It’s a unique experience. I’ve gotten a lot of entertainment for my initial purchase.
---
Omg lmao
---
He's correct, any charge level above 5 will reset the damage back to a level 1 charge. It shows the big number, but its just a display glitch
---
crafting the vault 94 armors (currently bullion purchased) (solar, thorn, strangler heart)
---
Thanks so much Henny! Yeah I loved the liberator build, it forced me to think about blueprinting a *lot* because the idea was to make loads of them for all the members of the communist party of Appalachia haha. I'm basically working my way towards a kind of science adventure aesthetic somehow. Along with movie trailers because they're fun. Did you see the inspector raven animated comic book I made?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_steel
---
Couple different types of armor.
---
&gt;  I was shocked they were willing to do it in the open 
---
Don't be.  This is what happens when the people maintaining the game just don't care.  Bethesda never seems to take any action to ban them or take away their toys, which allows them to be so brazen about using them.
---
Stashed about 20 items thats minimum 30k value + 5 toons at max caps so people can sell em instead of me lol
---
I can’t get that one to work every day, just worked the first time for me so I stopped talking to him again after awhile.
---
I got ally, I’ll be on tonight and I can craft a compound
---
Do you want mods, I havnt bought any yet
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
I sell most of my scrap. Still in it for the camp decor (if there is any).
---
Hail Mothman. I’m excited to spend a bunch of atom on mothman shit. Mothman bless.
---
In any game involving combat one of the most valuable assets a character can have is mobility.  The more mobile a character is the more they can control the engagement, and disengage when you want.
---
For a concrete example, there's a world of difference between going through Whitesprings with Marsupial, where you can jump up on platforms to get away from the ghouls, and doing the same without that mobility.
---
That in and of itself isn't game breaking. The game breaking part is you aren't giving up anything for it.  Intelligence is one of the weaker stats in the game, and a penalty to it is largely meaningless. I mean, sure you get slightly less XP, but with marsupial you can survive a lot more fights.
---
There's no meaningful choice here.  Mutations in general - there's no reason not to be mutated.  I put Pureblood on the list and made it fairly powerful to give a compelling reason not to be mutated, without nerfing or changing mutations in any way.
---
Yeah a screenshot was just my screen going white and pixelated. With the sound of nukes dropping all around. 
---
Didn't have a recorder going.
---
I bought FO4 GOTY and got bored before even touching the Nuka-Cola DLC. Seems my character was mowing through everything easily and no progressions to work toward, even through I really like the environment and atmosphere. 
---
Tried the FO76 free weekend and got hooked. I've probably spent over 100 hours already and just finished the Wastelanders story, mainly because I've been playing events and some of the story. Seems still so much more to do to get the things I want in this game.
---
Some of the plans you get access to at the end of the Wastelanders dlc are for special armor sets, Strangler Heart Power Armor for example, these require Vault steel to build.
---
Maybe I'm making my own conspiracy theories *Dale Gribble Intensifies*
---
But hey, I still have about over a hundred episodes to watch, so still ample time to see if anything happens on that line.
---
I will ask 1 more time  When did they say camp items would only be skins?
---
The glitched boss gutsy that fires assaultron laser in sugar Grove. Haven't encountered for a while but that was the most brutal gutsy.
---
Good.
---
Lol I will post 1 more time and not tell you. Go back to high school.
---
If you are on Xbox I have one you can have, GT OGRedd
---
Calm down will you, I just don't like them.
---
I actually like to sort the posts by controversial, so that I can undo some of that lazy downvoting people do. This post was on the list of controversial.
---
So I came here to read you suggestions and see why people were downvoting it, and their just a little messy. There's too much going on there.
---
I’ll probably still get it. It will work with my mandalorian rip off role play, The Wastelander. The moth man cultists want the baby back, the settlers want to use it to negotiate peace, raiders want to sell it, blood raiders want to kill it, and the cult of the mega sloth wants to eat it.
---
in your pipboy or you weapon wheel? Cause sometimes it doesn't show in my weapon wheel until I've gone into my pip and selected the weapons.
---
Clothing mannequins too, please. Blows my mind that they haven't done this yet. But hey, at least we can display our beer steins. lol
---
There is a reason I dress her, head to toe....
---
the grind is too long and there isn't enough interesting content to prop it up. the limits are crippling. cap limits, gold limits, vendor limits, storage limits, scrap limits, etc. it's exhausting. 
---
I put in about 200 hours. it was a good run.
---
They royally fucked up by locking all the new "endgame" armor and weapons to a character. Who wants to do the gold and faction rep again? So now there's less of a reason to actually start new characters.
---
What do you spend these coins on?
---
I’ve heard some people do this as a superstition before buying from Murmrgh.
---
I had this problem too but after a short while after completing the quest simply return to Creator and the quest should reappear.
---
I feel your pain. I also hate when you first get a kill their inventory shows up for an instant then ends up being crap. Or kill a super mutant with a gatling laser and he has a board. In reality your just missing out on disappointment so its a win.
---
These are excellent ideas! I would actively seek some of these out, especially Ra-Ra's Birf Day!
---
I'm looking forward to it too, I'm rebuilding my toon right now. Running 5 pieces of unyielding combat armor, but can't seem to find all the heavy pieces I'm after. The amount of AP I have is awesome for my bloodied minigun, but there is so much more work I need to do to get my build finished. Really it might have been faster to level another toon from one to 55-60 or so.
---
That was like 20 years ago. So I gather they didn’t actually say it even though you keep saying they did? Got it. Thanks for keeping it civil.
---
Yea
---
Then make a suggestion on what could be changed.
---
And again, you won't because that would take effort.
---
I don't expect to get everything right on the first draft. But without some input there won't be a second.
---
The main went a bit into Rifleman.  Not all the way - just the first rank of each Rifleman, and a little Tank Killer and Concentrated Fire.  She keeps the melee perks active.  Even though they have become somewhat vestigial outside of the Queen, it's still the fastest way to deal with a Sheepsquatch or a Mirelurk Queen.
---
Alt 1 balances melee with pistols and shotguns.  She does swap out the melee perks for Shotgunner ones outside of the Queen.  But, as we know, shotguns have some damage "quirks" that will probably get fixed at some point, and so she may end up dropping that in the long run.  The thing about pistols is that outside of the 10mm and the useless Pipe Pistol, none of them are particularly fast.  They are all revolvers, and it makes the flow of combat feel quite monotonous and slow.
---
Alt 2 is all-in on Rifleman.  She is by far the best at killing Scorchbeasts (arguably, killing in general), but she struggles with the Queen because there just isn't a huge role for rifle users now that they've disabled crippling on her.
---
Mutant's and Explosive take up different slots so it's entirely possible to roll one
---
Even better, then.
---
For instance, they should have made a simple flag that one could place in the CAMP and give both the icon and the flag for free this year...
---
Lewis doesn’t have to create his own suggestions to have an opinion about yours. 
---
I don’t need to know how to fly a helicopter to be able to see one upside down in a tree and say with confidence and accuracy ‘Someone fucked up’.
---
You put a lot of thought into this. But you even started out with a chip on your shoulder, and then cop an attitude at a polite and tactical reply that gave constructive criticism. 
---
You even labeled this post ‘Discussion’. Seems like all you want is people to agree with you 100%. 
---
I see some interesting ideas. But I agree that it’s over convoluted. Secondary and Tertiary effects having a direct influence on the power level of the Primary effect is more complex than needed, and likely more complex than the average FO76 would want. At first when I thought you were using that to replace all the other 2/3 effects, I thought it might be streamlined. But keeping the original 2/3 effects and still adding in new ones, on top of the ‘Improved’ &amp; ‘Superior’ is too much. 
---
I’m sure it makes perfect sense to you. I do not think it would appeal to the majority of the player base.
---
Its a paper bag replacement, so when you drop stuff or die it leaves the paratrooper bundle instead of the bag.
---
I might be missing a joke, but what's turd season?
---
Nothing, just the thrill and maybe your loot.
---
She wouldn't have been complaining about her headache all the time if you'd been getting the job done.
---
I came looking for this answer. Thanks
---
I added you. You down to play around 9:30 tonight?
---
Thank you for the reply, however...
---
I am pretty huge FO76 fan, got 1st for a year. Not shy on spending in the atom store. So much that I look at these Tuesday posts and plan out what I'm going to get when I get home from work. The way I remember it, the bundle that included it was only there for a day. I wavered briefly before deciding to get it and then it was gone. One or two days tops.....IMHO
---
I will try and go back and find the Reddit post that showed it, might clear it up for both of us.
---
What foundation and crater needs is not necessarily more events stuff they need more named npcs with engaging dialogue/ mini side story quests. All that equals more depth
---
Posts like the OP's are exactly the reason why I don't understand people who power their way to max level early on in multiplayer games.  I'm not saying the OP or anyone else here did that, but the result is the same: once you've done absolutely everything there is to do and meaningful progression is no longer a factor, of course you're going to get bored. 
---
Right now, I'm having a blast, but then again, I'm nowhere even remotely near max level (I'm level 62?  63, maybe?) so I have a long way to go, but I'm in no hurry.  I'm already doing dailies and side quests and trickling out main-story quests when I feel up to it, and sprucing up my CAMP now and then.  I spend a few hours each night, maybe a few more hours on the weekends when I'm not out and about, and that's perfect for me.  There's so much more I haven't done yet, but I'll get there eventually.
---
I do feel that they need to add more story/daily/event content to keep things fresh.  I'd love to see more random encounters with Raider or Settler NPCs that lead to entire quest lines (aside from companions), and at least a handful of new events with every update that get added to the regular rotation.  Give people more things to do with more ways to earn loot, and people will keep coming back.  That may sound absurdly obvious to all of us, but it seems that Bethesda is slow on the uptake.
---
Oh that's cool I didn't know you could do that. I'm on PS4.
---
 I have the PSVR which is pretty fun with this game but I prefer just normally playing it.
---
Pretty solid. I prefer Tenderizor over suppressor personally... But most of the time I'm using Line Wanderer anyway.
---
I was confused by the mutant part at first. I like my bloodied junkie hybrid builds. It's nice being able to switch back and forth. I'd recommend fireproof if you aren't running a dense chest already.
---
Does anyone know how does the mothman backpack plays with a jetpack attached? Someone able to provide a screen?
---
It’s not broken. It’s a convenience feature. It’s easy to get used to and starting a new character without it feels ‘weak’. But it’s not broken. 
---
Highly useful and convenient, yes. But the same can be said for a lot in this game. Having your camp at an Acid Node is ‘highly useful and convenient’, for example.
---
I own 2 of them.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Why bother, it's not like the Bethesda community managers even give a shit about out opinions.
---
If they would do their job properly and actually engage with us they might end up with a better game. 
---
I cant be arsed, right now anyway.
---
Yeah another refund. Wtf are they doing... Are they constantly drunk or that lazy?
---
Thanks man I like that I can rely on you to post the pictures of new items in the atomic shop.
---
What time zone?
---
Prolly just buggy
---
JakeDS457. May not be on always, but I try to be. LvL 141.
---
From the comment i responded to
---
&gt; It's laughable to call Bethesda's monetisation practices the "current industry standard".
---
WoW was* the industry standard and has all of the things they listed. 
---
&gt; Wow does not sell you ingame items with functions after only promising to sell skins. Wow allowed you 20 years ago to complete a quest in a party.
---
These weren't mentioned in the comment i responded to. Also, they do? Im not sure what else you would consider a level boost.
---
I wasnt talking about the polish of content at or post launch. There is no argument to be even attempted there. It was a ridiculous idea to try and turn an already outdated single player engine in to a multiplayer game. I also absolutely think FO76 should be free to download and anyone who purchased compensated. But to act as if they invented some extra predatory system unique to them is disingenuous.
---
Edit:  Changed is to was
---
I haven't even played wastelanders yet because i got so tired of the b.s.
---
Normal bugs don't bother me, it's these type of users and Bethesda's inaction on the matter that bugs me. I just went back to fo4.
---
If you're using a stealth rifle build, look for The Fixer gun. I found it on a train-station vendor for only like 900 caps. It will allow you to do incredible short-burst damage silently. Game is incredibly broken when you can sneak up on a Yao Guai and ended it before it can even turn around to see who's there.
---
I absolutely agree.  I was all in on this game before wastelanders.  I've got about 900 hours into the game.  But I haven't played in weeks because the combination of strict daily limits paired with the fact that there are no fun end game activities has ruined the game for me.
---
If I want to do chores, ill clean my house, not login to a fallout game.
---
I have the blue ridge backpack mod. No idea how I got it. I don't ever remember completing 'Riding shotgun'
---
It's a bit ridiculous, especially when you are just given it during the foundation missions.
---
What system?
---
Alright thanks. Yeah I really only added the mutants as some of the build is oriented to benefit my mutations and vice versa. I’ll look into fireproof too
---
(Bill Daughtry happy giggles)
---
There is a bench there that you can scrap at! I always do that to being my character back to a normal carry weight!
---
All good man, enjoy
---
It only effects pre-war alcohol.  Essentially, if you cant find it randomly on a shelf somewhere in the open world, its not pre-war.
---
Hey Namore24, I guess when I looked at the one that you had for sale on the marketplace I totally skipped over the explosive attribute. But again that you for the info.
---
I think tenderizer is better too after reading it. Better numbers for sure
---
Did OP strike you as someone with a plethora of caps to buy god roll Legendaries?
---
And if PA were useless, we wouldn't see nearly everyone wearing it for SBQ or Encryptid. If it weren't for PA users at those events, they'd fail. Repeatedly. Stealth builds aren't efficient for major events.
---
It's not an industry standard tho, it is an industry standard for mobile games and chinese f2p games. And consoles. They are trying to establish this shit on PC as a normal way of paying for a game.
---
A level skip is a very minor thing  in WOW that seems like a very bad faith argument to me. Also level skip is a result of Blizzard moving with the industry towards more casual play, it didn't exist originally.This is exactly what I am talking about. Accepting these things leads to worse and worse gameplay.
---
I started watching it but got busy with something else. I’ll go back and check it out! Yeah that liberator build was something else! I build a lot and couldn’t wrap my head around the complexity of that build even with your explanation. I typically make music video type videos of my camps or random adventures like this one: https://youtu.be/3adUzwI8Mv0
---
That was an old look at it. Since then I’ve doubled the budget, changed a lot around, and build a crazy underground section with a vault boy and girl scientist spying on the shoppers. If you’re on PS4 you should check it out!
---
Everyone else is out here raging. I'm just appreciating smol mothy boy
---
Oh god. Let the old man be dirty if he wants to... poor forager... getting put in a dress and getting told to get washed
---
He be like ‘just take it you loser, i still have a ton at home...’
---
Only place I've found them is on the random encounter vendor bot that has a chance of appearing in a handful of places.
---
Not as rare as some of the jumpsuits, leather coats or field jacket, but still worth something. Have seen them go anywhere from 2k to 10k caps in vendors.
---
Ah yes thank you the wanderer
---
Yeah, it's still a rarer item.  I dont know what system you are on but on PS4 I would expect to pay 4k+ even after all the dupes.
---
Hahahaha!
---
Oh shoot. I'm at work. I shouldn't be laughing this hard.
---
I hope you can find one that you will enjoy as much as i do this one.
---
I dont need clearing 
---
The 1st bundle is old- from over a year ago. It includes the rocket sign, broken garage door, jumpsuit and I think an avatar 
---
It came out again for a limited time (like 2 days) when the 2nd bundle (power armor, jetpack, workbench) and other items (robot helmet, shotgun, ect) dropped a couple weeks ago 
---
Than we had the 3rd bundle last week (still in the shop) which includes the dinner pieces 
---
Believe me, I bought them all
---
Incidentally, the rocket sign was also sold separately for like 3 months maybe a year ago
---
There had been some in the past
---
I have a me50, and one with fmswa
---
Yeah same. I have my main that's lv280. And my alt that's like 220. I have ZERO interest in trying the get the alt the secret service stuff. I've been logging on for the same stuff. Get gold, get dailys, switch to another game. Seasons can't come soon enough. At least their will be new stuff to work towards.
---
I always turn in on.
---
This, or downing luck improving food/chems. I don't think it makes a difference in the game, but if it makes the player feel better then more power to them
---
I can’t even sell all my 3 star weapons for 200 caps
---
lol yeah I didn’t put him in a dress I knew that wouldn’t be pretty, but I thought the wanderer (she) might be a looker in a dress...not
---
so this is how the cult began
---
Jeez, I'm surprised Red Rocket hasn't made Mothman their celebrity endorser yet /s
---
🙄
---
*You do you* I guess.
---
You can keep doing them, until you get to Allies after you pick and finish the final quest
---
If you're on ps4 you can hit share and grab the past 15 minutes
---
It doesn't work every time I do this, but often I can enter the Atom Shop, exit back to main menu and in social other player show up.
---
Xbox 1 - whatever the latest upgraded version is. Thankfully I have plenty of games on my phone to play while I’m bouncing around the map.
---
Thanks for posting this.
---
Appreciate the post. Great work.
---
I remember playing right after the game came out, running into a stash box somewhere thinking “look at all this useful junk” then stealing it. When I got back to camp I put two and two together.....
---
Ah, darn, I must have missed them.
---
3000 hours in, don’t even know which button blocks.....
---
Im pretty sure linking accounts for a free copy on steam is over yo
---
Thanks man I have quite a few games to fill the time. Enjoy!
---
Will do.
---
I do 10 for camp/recipe, 25/50 armor mods, 50/75 weapon mods and actually base plans I do 25% of sticker price.  I farm them doing maps and make an easy 3k a day from selling 10 military cots.  Volume fixes everything.
---
Dupes is a good point.  I got one from Vendor and was max coin with an Alt and paid 8k for one for that character.  I didn’t mind over paying as I needed space for coin, that was before Smiley and bullion grind
---
daily quests will never go away (unless they hate you? nobody's gone negative to see what happens afaik, even then its probably just temporary until they like you again) 
---
 either way the final missions decisions end up being roughly 3 days worth of something lost. to clarify, by lost i mean "missed profit,"  most decisions in there wont cause you to lose rep, you just wont gain extra
---
I 100% did this on launch day.
---
I have one. It's like killing mobs with a stimpack. Hands down my favorite weapon in the game
---
Usually someone has to have played a game long enough to become bored with it, before they turn into an A##. But this guy is an over-encumbered "under"-achiever.
---
Thank you, this made my day.
---
Just the survivor bow pretty much
---
Currently carrying 50 disease cure and 50 antibiotic with 50 each in stash, so glad the game seems to vomit disease cures, makes the game easier given bone worms.
---
If you get the blank weapon wheel bug, open your pipboy and manually equip a weapon/armor and it usually fixes itself
---
I’d believe it
---
It would be nice...
---
Bethesda $$$
---
Or somehow flag them, even if it lasted a week or two.  Yes I realize folks add more stuff, but I agree that would be a nice add
---
You don't lose rep at the endgame.
---
When I first got the coat that was how I got it. Server hopped for hours to try to get him to show up at that damn train station. Then the first time he did actually spawn, a super mutant spawned nearby and killed him before I could get to him. Needless to say I about gave up, but a few more hops and he appeared again and finally got it.
---
What’s free this week
---
People literally asked for a flag two years running and BGS is silent for every time it comes up. 
---
Would take like 10 minutes to make. 
---
Think of how much good will they coulda bought with that 10 minutes.
---
I sometimes block. But it feels like most times it dosent work. If I'm mid swing and try to block it just continues to swing.
---
The new Skyrim. Bruh, thats like saying fallout 4 2
---
I think foundation should have a "grand exchange" it would be the trade center for everybody thus putting real players there making ppl wana be there and be more lively
---
if it helps the breakdown is 4000 for the suit and 1600 for the helmet, and it becomes available at "neighborly" 
---
plus side is, as of now you only need the suit for the effects and the helmet is just cosmetic/gasmask. (i didn't test water disease)
---
that smoke machine...I must have it....
---
I use a ps4 but I took someone's suggestion on changing out the harddrive for a SSD.  Had a gift card left over from xmas and got a 500gb samsung for like 70 bucks.  Best thing ever.  I cannt even play mobile games anymore even on load in.  It took 10 minutes.  It also got me super excited for the next gen of consoles lucky pc guys.  Anyways if you have a couple bucks burning a hole you might consider it.
---
A nasty lesson, I am so glad I read ahead as I started a new character and before I started knew to do both quest lines until the final choice.  5000+ billion to a casual player is a ton of time, on top of wanting SS armor set
---
Recycle free items every year is just lazy. There are hundreds of small items in the Shop, why couldn't they make some of them free ? Or come up with a free original.
---
The only way I found to lose rep is to side with the raider on the settlers daily.
---
 You gain a little bit of raiders rep and lose a little bit of settlers rep.
---
Ahh, just dodgy then.
---
I have 3 powered, and 2 with poison resistance.
---
Is your weapon a Prime weapon?
---
Seconded. Motion moved
---
Always
---
Thank you for your work.
---
You would think they’d be aware of this and just arc the handles the opposite way. 
---
Anyways as others said wish it was done on the wooden frame one.
---
The hacking is out of control and even on a smaller scale the fact that every vendor is loaded with very obviously duped plans is another testament to their inability to do a damn thing about cheating. These items should've been removed from inventories weeks ago. Now we get to see that cheating is totally cool and the icing is that players have the balls to ask ridiculous amounts for these duped items. Its an all around bad look for this game and the community.
---
Ok, you're the expert. I thought they pulled the 1st bundle early because of the garage door fiasco. Just wondering if I would ever see that sign again, thanks. BTW, can you in fact, launch the rocket off the top?
---
Will you submit this to Bethesda? Love these ideas and who knows if they'll ever see this post otherwise.
---
"Probably doable." Where as a heavy weapons/PA build can solo it multiple times a day if they wanted to.
---
Stealth builds are great for certain situations. They are inefficient for most big events. You've completed Encryptid "plenty of times" because of the PA users who were there.
---
Head to harpers ferry every now and then and do a run through killing everything there. I've actually got my C.A.M.P. setup on the cliffs above the bridge leading into it so I can do runs through HF for steel (scrapping weapons) when I need it. 
---
I usually start on the far west side, kill the two scorched/ghouls/super mutants near the first gate, then run along the top of the train heading north where there will be three more enemies. Then I wrap around the the north of the town where there a couple of houses, you'll run into about 6 or 7 more enemies there.
---
From there, I go through the north gate and kill three enemies up on the a little dining patio. Head south from there and go through a building where there will be 2-3 more enemies. 
---
Then you'll emerge at the base of large stone staircase leading up to the main "town," where the church is. At the base of these stairs there will 3-5 enemies. Kill them, then head up the stairs, there will be three turrets with armor piercing ammo, stealthily kill those, then open up the gate leading to the town. 
---
There will be more stairs leading to a church, generally one enemy spawns up there, alongside one more turret behind some sandbags. Inside the church there will be three enemies to kill. There are also 3-6 other enemies in the enclosed town area. 
---
All in all, it ends up being a decent amount of XP each time you run through it, and you get a good amount of ammo and weapons to scrap, as well as some stimpaks on dead bodies. There's also the occasional legendary or two that pops up. In my experience, legendaries seem more likely if you're with someone else or there's a group there. Totally anecdotal, but it's happened enough that I think there's a connection. 
---
Good luck!
---
Edit to add: Oh! One other XP boost to do alongside "Well rested" is eat canned meat stew every hour. You receive five of them for doing the Feed the People event at Mama Dolces. Canned meat stew provides like 20% food or something like that, as well as some water. Provides a 5% xp boost for one hour.
---
Thanks fam, time to start saving up again lol
---
Well known thing fwiw
---
Hey fisto got a new body!
---
old man straight up shits himself sometimes
---
Cool! go to Camden Park during daylight hours and you'll meet her at the entrance. she's truly amazing - look forward to a photo!
---
Yeah, that's the only way. Making your decision at the end game doesn't make you lose rep with the other faction, and you can continue doing the dailies until you get allied with both regardless of what you do at the end of the story.
---
Why doncha join in?
---
News to me
---
Yeah
---
The rocket launches when it is destroyed. The only way to really launch it yourself is to blow it up with a flamethrower trap
---
It goes up like 20 feet than explodes
---
Your statements are just as ridiculous as mine. You have no pssible way of knowing Bethesdas financial plans and no way of knowing if this game is making millions.
---
There is no reason to assume it isn't. it's one of the most successful beloved IPs of all time pandering to console gamers that are used to spending insane amount of microtransactions. How does it matter if I mixed up the 90ies and early 2000s. The point remains the same. Running this game isn't as expensive or financially ruining as you claim it is.
---
Server time is literally almost free these days.
---
For anyone not aware it looks like support has been pretty compliant with returning atoms for items that don't work recently
---
Had this for a long time, made maxing my rep totally doable. Now its easy notes. Sometimes he will glitch and it wont complete, changing servers helps.
---
Oh man, do I feel this.  As much as I have been enjoying playing FO76, The inventory management required in this game is RIDICULOUS.  I even have the Scrap Box and I'm STILL struggling to not go over my carry weight.  I'm constantly clearing out stuff from my stash to scrap or trade for caps just to make room.  And I don't even consider myself an RPG hoarder; if I don't intend to use it, I either don't pick it up, drop it somewhere, scrap it, give it to a new player or trade it.  I've even used the bulk of my Strength points on lowering weights and increasing carry limit, but thanks to the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS lack of ability to **properly** re-roll/redistribute perks, I've actually ended up screwing myself on some of those weight-reduction cards.  My dumb fault, totally, but it still frustrates the bejeezus out of me.
---
I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, but if there's one thing (among the unnervingly MANY things) Bethesda needs to do to improve this game, it's address the weight/carry limit issue.
---
Yeah it's still pretty high even after scrapping lol. But I slog over to the station to sell all the rifles and such to easily make cap limit
---
Hmmm.  Other than food buffs (Which I don't think can make that much of a difference) I got nothing.
---
yea I decided to add a switch to my shop to turn it off and made it so none could get to it i even have to edit my way to it I have shut the power on players mid sale.. pretty funny, but I 100% agree with you
---
Chems and other buffs make a big difference. The perk that buffs suppressed weapons at night also adds a lot of damage.
---
That's genius and dastardly!
---
Ranged sneak crits don't work if your target is engaging another enemy. You actually get way higher dps soloing the queen vs. fighting her in a group due to this fact.
---
We are all born naked and the rest is drag
---
Xbox
---
lol tell the boss you’re thinking about the great future of the company
---
What's worse is that's a fembot
---
No problem, you're welcome!
---
Ooooh that makes more sense. Thanks
---
It's a quality of life "feature".
---
And it doesn't matter your level because they can't do anything about it.
---
You should be able to select the whole house. I think you select it then hit L1 or another button to select entire structure.
---
There finally listening to us.
---
Gonna go out on a limb here - have you ever used fallout 4 creation club?
---
The account linking was utterly nuked by fallout 4 creating a NEW account with a old email address after I had changed it on Bethesda’s account management portal.
---
Same boat!
---
Yep. It’s actually pretty nice. Just not 500 atoms nice.
---
Thanks. I was quite pleased when I thought of that
---
Last time they changed the map animals stopped spawning and they had to delay Fasnacht.  So I am really worried about map changes.  Also if they happen often they will stop being meaningful.  So if they were going to do something like this they should be big events (say 2 per year) and there should be 2 or more sides.
---
Maybe the raider want a lake and Foundation is like "Oh hell naw!"  So you can do something else to prevent the change from happening or you can help make the change.
---
&gt; I really don’t understand how it requires more time of you don’t pay. I don’t feel that way at all but I guess we are all entitled to our opinion.
---
It's not a question of opinion. You are in denial about basic game mechanics if you don't see how people lose almost 30% or more of their playing session to micromanaging shit that is only there to encourage purchases.
---
I just remember when it first came out. Shortly after I took a hiatus so I probably missed a few more opportunities.
---
It’s not called an inventory management simulator for nothing
---
Bloodied, Junkies, and sometimes Instigating or Furious depending on the weapon. Two Shot by itself is trash, it's only passable when paired with Explosive.
---
seems like u aint a friend to him
---
No, anti-armour and furious also have their place...
---
Yeah I've got switches as well, but just be aware that the vendors do not require power to complete sales. The power just takes the icon off the map, which hopefully can buy you a little time
---
Meh, never was huge into the elder scroll series so it is skyrim part 2 to me.  What's the new one called TES:redfall or something like that I think.
---
Old ATX bundle.
---
Literally the only time I block is when I'm doing melee on the queen. When she's grounded you can see when she is about to attack. Blocking for a second keeps me alive. Smash smash smash..block...smash smash repeat. 
---
I only bash when using my explosive weapon while wearing my jetpack (no dense), and only on roaches n mirelurk spawns near my feet.
---
Or junkies.
---
Was an atom shop item. Not sure if it can still be purchased...
---
Thank you for your time and your patience and for fighting the good fight, I will be able to refer people to a reasonable explanation of these obvious mechanics in the future.
---
I just can't stay polite to people playing this obviously dumb.
---
I have a TS FF LMG that begs to differ.
---
Manual blueprinting has a budget limit that is drastically smaller than the overall camp budget. It's incredibly unlikely you'll be able to save a blueprint in this way and keep everything saved. If you move your camp, a stored camp blueprint will be created which has a larger budget  but may also split it into chunks. Mind you, this method also keeps the components stored in your camp, which you can only get back by deleting the  blueprint.
---
3’s my favorite!
---
It's not trash. People are playing favorites. It doesn't have to be a God roll to be useful. Some perks aren't used much because they suck.
---
What was it called and what other rare items have not been in the atom shop for awhile
---
A map, it help me out to actually make the loading screen usefull
---
Ahhh that's pretty strange. It just seems like my DPS in general is way off
---
cosmetic sales, any competitive game worth playing. New Star Wars BF. Bethesda is selling items with functions not skins.
---
You are creating creative unrealistic scenarios. Games monetizing the fuck out of every step in the playing experience is a completely new thing outside of mobile gaming. Claiming "how will these poor developers finance themselves" is absurd.
---
They are not developing any expansions anyway. Wastelander is  a joke with more Atom buying  encouraging mechanics not a full expansion.
---
No I haven’t. Did uninstalling and reinstating work though?
---
I ended up just dropping a bunch of legendary heavy weapons (1-2 star bloodied and junkies) because they take so much stash space and they weren’t selling no matter the price.
---
Instigating for non-bloodied snipers.
---
If you’re near a train station, that helps a lot.
---
I keep hoping they put the corvega paint back on the market
---
Mothman statue if I recall....
---
That is a long list and one that googling with serve u better than my memory...
---
The queen also has a 70% damage reduction that kicks in before her resistances. So it's probably closer to like 80-90% reduction if you factor in her armor.
---
179 ER is OK-ish, although more is of course better. DR is more important though. The only thing that uses energy damage and is actually dangerous to you is a high-level Assaultron with its eye laser and some of those wall-mounted laser turrets. And frankly, nothing short of a couple pieces of Troubleshooter's armor makes an assaultron easily survivable.
---
The Grounded mutation is -50% energy damage, or -12.5% with the Class Freak perk. If you want to specialize into energy weapons, you might indeed want to look for other sources of ER.
---
Your TS25 LMG benefits from the damage overflow glitch. I figured it went without saying that "magic" weapons are excluded from this assessment. TS is crap on most weapons.
---
There was a moth man camp bundle that had some effigies with skulls.
---
&gt;Serious question, how would you recommend they fund future development and ongoing support of the game?
---
Can you name a game that isn't targeted towards mainly kids and consoles that uses a similar monetization like Bethesda?
---
Its okay to give yourself a break from games. I'd argue its better than burning yourself out. We know content is on the way and the season pass stuff so there will be things to play and do. Nothing wrong with putting it down for now then coming back when you're interested again  
---
Edit: A thing I did was start a new character just to see how different the story is now that there are NPCs everywhere. You get to visit a lot places that were updated that you would normally overlook since you already discovered them.
---
Lollingtonbear
---
I’m convinced we are living In a pre-Fallout world atm.
---
I use instigating and furious on my weapons..
---
I avoid 2 shot like the plague.. accuracy suffers too greatly
---
Or anti armor and junkies
---
intravenous toxin filters for arm pieces? 
---
There are not many useful PA arm mods.
---
 The one that reduces power attack AP use is ok if you use +power attack damage melee, but otherwise, ain't nothing good there.
---
ahh yes a friend told me that happened to him sucks then I would literally replace the doorway to get in shop with a wall instead thanks for the heads up tho!
---
There was a brief time where you could have both I think, but it probably crashed servers so they changed it very quickly, like within days if I remember correctly
---
I usually run level 2 action boy and 3 dodgy together when I need the survivability and swap it for 3 covert op and 2 sneak for damage
---
I also have 3 powered pieces
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, because I like your notion of subfactions within the Settlers group.  Why not break them down a bit more and allow players to fit in where they want to be?  You could do the same for the Raiders, too.  Once you choose one side or the other, then you can start quest lines to join a subgroup.  Want to further your Responder role with the Settlers?  Here's how.  Want to join what remains of the military until the BoS comes back?  Here's your first task.  We'd see both factions wanting to represent something more than just "we want to build shit" or "we want to break shit".
---
If by endless skins for a new Vegas outfit you mean one. I’ve been subbed for 3 months and the only skin added for the ranger armor was the desert ranger one. I so so want the god damn elite and advanced armor.
---
Wait isn’t the robot a female!?
---
Lol Glad you like them. 
---
I wouldn’t even know where to begin trying to submit something like that. Or if they’d even look at unsolicited stuff.
---
Try a trading sub...
---
My bet would be free weekends when a lot of griefers hop in.
---
I use junkie weapons with ffr or explosive and i do pretty good dmg with my perk setup
---
Shhhhhhh!
---
Show some love for executioners
---
For me, building is more like my peanut butter
---
What’s ur name
---
You should try out an instigating lever action.
---
Negative DR does break the effect, and has done so since before WL. If you're using the addictions, and switch to a hazmat, you'll be at -20 and lose all damage. I recommend 2 ranks of Iron Clad to offset the -20 DR. My build has R2 revenant and 4 LS armor pieces so I just swap Rev for Ironclad if I need the hazmat, since I wouldn't have the auto revive anyhow.
---
&gt;Egregious would be things like paywalling new quests, preventing you from progressing unless you pay, charging you to take part in specific events. These are all things common in other games, not in 76.
---
The hell kind of game do you play where this is common?
---
&gt; I am going to ask one more time... how do you suggest they change the way the game is monetized that still allows them to develop new content and support the existing product? 
---
And I'm going to tell you one more time, I've already answered this question for you. Twice now. Which tells me that your "I am trying to educate myself here" is nonsense because you aren't listening. 
---
&gt; So you can’t name a single game that does what you are proposing? 
---
No. I can't name a single game that does what \*\*you\*\* are proposing, which 76 itself doesn't even do. I can name loads of games that continue support and add more content without egregious monetization methods, and I already specifically named two, made by BGS themselves. 
---
&gt; I am just asking for another game that does this without any monetization beyond initial purchase lol. 
---
And I'm not suggesting there shouldn't be any monetization. That is what you are suggesting as a straw man. That's not an argument I've made. 
---
&gt; Also fallout 4 charged for DLC before the creation club... all 5 DLC cost money. That is content lacked behind a paywall. 
---
Yes. That is what I said. That is how products work. All of 76 is locked behind a paywall too, even if you aren't the one paying for it. And some of it, you can't access unless you \*are\* the one paying for it. 
---
&gt; I understand the expansions in 76 are payed for through monetization. My point is that all monetization is completely optional. 
---
No. You clearly don't understand. That monetization is not optional. If it doesn't generate revenue there are no more expansions, no more content drops, no more seasons. It may be optional to \*you\*, but the game ceases to exist without it.
---
&gt; I still don’t understand what you want. 
---
What I want is impossible because 76 already launched. What I'm saying is that most of the problems 76 suffers stem from it's monetization methods. It is designed to be tedious and it is intentionally cumbersome because that is how these live service monetization methods are proven to work.
---
Would I rather pay for expansions? Yes. Absolutely yes. And here's why: If everyone is getting free shit-sandwiches because Frank is footing the bill, I'm walking across the street and buying my own shitless sandwich. Now you might say, "But look, these sandwiches are free because of the whales!" But i'm going to point out that free shit is still shit, and the place across the street is charging everyone the same amount for a sandwich with no shit in it.
---
Works fine on asylum worker uniform outfits.
---
Edit: I’ve tested it with all of the outfits in my inventory and the majority of them do not clip. Mostly atomic shop outfits or things like imposter sheep outfit are the only ones that clip.
---
What outfit are you wearing with this and what did you even test?
---
yeah i agree, that seems to be the problem! my error disappeared after going back a few hours later. you probably won’t have to wait a day or two. i can’t explain why it still happened on a private server, but i think once you load into a different server you should be able to place your camp.
---
If you want you can have from me  berseker ffr 1 agility ultracite laser for free if you gonna use it. I have to much script already. I an on PC BTW.
---
Would it make you feel better if the next major update has leveling adjustments for all the new players that arent playing this game?
---
Lol just think, if people knew better you could potentially have a whole lot more legendaries available to sell. People want to complain about the trade economy sucking and players only wanting "God tier" equipment but most players don't even know what's good other than the obvious meta picks, and like in the case of Bolstering/Vanguard sometimes the meta pick isn't even the best option.
---
I'm pretty determined to try and squash these misconceptions, so Bolstering/Vanguard salesman beware. I'm coming for you.
---
raider marauder PA paint blocks your view when using pipe weapons as well.
---
AyetheCaptain
---
Hmm. I prefer *not* being killed by a light breeze (let alone any of those level 52 Colonel Gutsys), so Bloodied is useless to me (I *get* the appeal, sure, but it's not for me). And Two Shot butchers accuracy in VATS, doesn't it? Not much good for a sniper build that relies heavily on VATS, then...
---
Any of the enemy-specific ones, though, or Nocturnal? Yeah, I *do* just scrip those.
---
I for one had no idea. I also have no idea what you are talking about, link to a video or image or something? That sounds neat
---
I know it’s not as rare now but the hunters longboat is still one to look out for (not at events though)...it just looks good.
---
The leather coat is apparently really rare.
---
So if you see them for sale cheapish then get them.
---
Imposter Sasquatch outfit is nice too...without the helmet it looks event better IMO.  (I’ve never had the imposter outfit drop).
---
Very interesting to learn this! Thanks for sharing. That's the first report I've seen from another GPU. It might be a general AMD issue then, or at least we now know it affects the Navi and Vega architectures.
---
Same dude! I had the bundle with the statues and smoke machine and stuff, but the other bundle is awesome, and I missed the signs, bed and camera paint, this is actually the first time in like 2 months+ that I actually am excited about the weekly update. I have bought a few scattered things here and there the past few months but the main bundles and stuff have not done anything for me, I dont particularly care for the "brand" type items, nuka cola, red rocket etc, or the factions stuff outside of the Cult. So when everyones happy, Im generally disappointed, and now they actually add stuff that interests me, and everyone on here is butt-raging.
---
Thanks.  Drat, I guess I missed it.
---
I like the lever action rifle
---
Alright I’ll give u 50 of each gimme 30min
---
Berserker is really the highest risk yet mediocre reward, it should go higher than bloodied. Maybe 2.25x for completely naked.
---
This is a great suggestion. I hadn't thought about using ironclad in my perk set as it seemed counter intuitive. It must have been a while since I've tested my berserker numbers, so this is good to know.
---
Oh..I never did a video it just seemed common sense that the cases and shelves would hold the peg board displays and day one they did. I have always just assumed everyone knew that.   
---
Uh how do I move a pic from xbox to say imgur? Never been into the whole pics vid thing.
---
hunting/sniper for true long range sniping..
---
lever and handmade for closer in work...
---
I usually just use the carpet truck to move the glass shelf into the weapon displays
---
BE 25 less vats lever will be what you want
---
The only one I have had attack my camp  was scorched...
---
I’m keeping myself busy by being a merchant / Good Samaritan after unlocking the super cool SS jet pack. This whole vending business is new to me and I’ve been having a blast visiting people’s camps, haggling with them or otherwise shooting the shit over their funny names or ridiculous CAMP antics (one dude had a casting couch set up on a cliff, another had “registered sex offender” on their front door).
---
As for the Good Samaritan bit, just a month ago I was about level 35 compared to my now-99. So I go about crafting stimpacks for me / my girlfriend / my friends and end up in such abundance that I can go to lower levels and give them nice healing care packages, ammo too! 
---
Still grinding out the damn reputation system for both raiders and settlers, and I admit, without fresh atomic shop gear or engagement with the community, I would be at a dead stop playing a different game right now. However, by trying to engage more with fellow wastelanders and overall making some fun for myself in exploration or scav running, 
---
I think I’ve found a nice balance to get solid gaming sessions out of the game. It keeps me engaged with other parts of the game too, although maybe once I reach your level, I may hold similar sentiments. Here’s to hoping this roadmap gives us a couple cool things this year so that we can all be the degenerate wastelanders this game has allowed us to be!
---
I have plenty of Violet, have to check on the Cobalt though.  I will donate for free to the cause, but I can't login until a bit latter (probably 4:30-5:00 PM Pacific time).
---
Excluding legendaries, you'll want the handmade rifle with hardened receiver and piercing clip. It's more damage, more ammo, more recoil than the combat rifle. Stack with weapons artisan to get 200% weapon health
---
Exactly. To be fair, it can be hard to tell with some animals, like mongrels and things like that.
---
Thank you for sharing that!  :D
---
Yeah, I had the epiphany one day after a poorly placed nuke forced me into a hazmat when fighting the SBQ. My damage was so awful and I couldn't understand why. It took me a bit to put my finger on the issue and find a solution, but it works wonderfully.
---
That's just wrong! They are advertised as skins. Had I known I wouldn't have bought the RR bundle.
---
There is a spreadsheet out there - basically, the benefits for DR / ER start plateauing around 350 / 375....
---
Over-all, probably preference. Assuming you are also going stealth, anything that can be silenced. If you want a more fun route then railway rifles are an absolute blast to use.
---
YES! I keep trying to collect cooking oil to make donuts for people and have to be so careful not to scrap it on accident...
---
The last time I checked, I was unable to reroll the bot's inventory by relogging as before. If that's the case now, it'll definitely be harder to come by.
---
Seems like a post-WL issue. I've seen magically regenerating heads and limbs a lot since the update.
---
Quad - I have a Quad Handmade (and Fixer) and I wouldn't trade the for the world.
---
Interesting. I was originally going to keep trying to roll for Vanguard pieces (full health junkie). With bolstering secret service, vanguard, ironclad and scaly skin will be complete overkill then? May have to think about respeccing somewhat if that's the case and losing ironclad.
---
Wasn't West Virginia on the Union side?
---
So, I'm level 112. I felt like I was level 48 like yesterday, even though it's been a few weeks... I can tell you that at 112, I don't even feel remotely close to having exhausted all the content. I've finished both Wastelanders and the Main quest lines, I'm done with Raider rep and a few days shy of Settler.   
---
There are SO SO SO many place I have still not been. I accidentally discovered that there are Lookout towers all over the map, and if you climb to the top of them, one side has a prompt to discover or survey the area or something and everything in the area you haven't been to shows up with grey icons on your map. There are areas I stumble across and find a note on the ground that leads me along a short story about how a guy fell into a church eventually leading to cannibalism and becoming a wendigo.   
---
I have a ton of camp items and gear, but I love to collect plans and build my camp. I love to look at other camps. I will dredge through low level areas, because I find places I never thought to visit and shock myself at what I missed out on when I was lower leveled.  
---
There are a ton of builds I want to try, but I am too lazy to mess with alts just yet (though stash limits are progressively pushing me to making a mule...) I need levels. THe best way to get levels? Stack intel, get the known exp buffs, and just go. Go explore. Aimlessly wander around the map and you will find so many things you didn't even know were a thing.  
---
Just my own experiences. YMMV
---
Thanks but no thanks, I'm on ps4.
---
Toss in some grape mentats for good measure!
---
In general, VATS and heavy weapons do not mix. The .50 is no exception.
---
From trying with the red rocket jet pack, no you can’t build it without having the original suits jet pack learned
---
I assume you’re getting at..... every time you load in, it says “over encumbered” even though you’re not?
---
These are old US government programs. They attack you because they see you as a foreign invader trying to take America for the Chinese. No brotherhood whatsoever.
---
what’s BE mean i’m a new player
---
Yeah, I distinctly remember that shit during beta.
---
Foundation does exactly what Bethesda wanted them to.
---
Keeps people logging in daily so that they statistically buy more atoms and see more ads for Fo1st
---
Completely agree. The damage output really is a joke but makes for a lot more interesting game play.
---
I really wish there was something of use in the shop.  
---
I have like 5k atoms and don't want anything. Put actual useful shit in there like massive backpacks or weapons.  I really dont care about pay for convenience.  Its a coop game ffs.
---
I've found the sweet spot to be somewhere between 350 &amp; 400 DR / ER - which is in line with what I've heard. 
---
I tried a full Vanguard set, but I was disappointed with the amount of damage I was taking. Instead, I rely on either a Zealots set (for end-game in the Bog) or Troubleshooters for Silos &amp; Encryptid.
---
Either one, as SS, work as a general armor as well, since they have very good DR / ER by themselves.
---
Thanks this has made me chuckle no end. I needed this today thank you.
---
Aww! I love him. Good boy trying to help.
---
Bloodied, explosive. Bloodied isn't an easy build to jump into but there's plenty of videos on YouTube to break it down
---
[xboxdvr.com](https://xboxdvr.com) would let you link the image if it is on xbox live
---
I do Stealth/Rifleman.  I use a Instigating lever action or my Instigating fixer (Which is the spiffy combat rifle).  I use them depending on what I am doing.  
---
My fixer has mods so that I get more shots per vats so its a bit less accurate.  My lever action is set for high accuracy.  
---
So if I am outside at longer ranges I used my lever action.  If I am in a building where I am going to turn a corner and run into something I use the fixer.
---
Im loosing faith that the game will really ever recover. They are taking way to long for the big changes to happen. I rather have paid for a expansion full to the brim with quests and dailies and endgame stuff and fun systems.
---
Thank you! Very true!
---
I've noticed it too, but it's always been bad. I just couldn't figure out why it was SO bad. Thanks though, I'm going to try this out.
---
I was at 18K caps on Sunday and by today, Tuesday morning, I capped out.  So....about 7 hour for 12K caps.   I wasn't doing cap runs either.   A couple weapons at 1K, serums, costumes, etc.
---
That 1200 mothman bundle has very shitty itens to justify that price.   
---
 Good compilation, tho.
---
So you crouch around every where and nothing shoots back at you? Have you tried just watching movies?
---
Ah bummer. Any particular reason for that? Was hoping to stack the furious damage in VATS. Guess I'm going to have to actually aim.
---
😊
---
&gt; . no one could visit your customized home or check your vending machines.
---
why not
---
Here is a better tip to make it faster. 
---
Hacking max rank, lock pick max rank. 
---
When u get to the reactor room, make a left out the door and hug the wall.  Follow it to a lock pick door.   Then go through that door and make a right.  Hack the terminal.  U now bypassed fixing reactor room.
---
Happens to me every time on PS4
---
They just have a high per-shot AP cost and low accuracy. You'll get a short burst out of it in VATs and likely miss anyhow.
---
What are people generally selling those at?
---
If you eat a sweet roll and use grape mentats, it's 500 per serum IIRC.
---
I’ve been seeing full bodies reappear for the last 3 weeks on Xbox. Lol
---
Any increase would be welcome. Not a full click/clan/gang/guild/ect, but we do get up to 12 that would play together if we could.
---
I was unaware of the diminishing returns until relatively recently, but it seems to hold true in my anecdotal experience anyway.
---
I currently run a bloodied heavy build with full unyielding. I am rocking around 600 resistance when in nerd rage area, and in or around nuke zone taking on scorchbeasts/mobs my damage taken (with or without all the dodge and reflected procs) is pretty much exactly the same with the 600 DR in full armor as it is in my chinese stealth armor at around 380DR. I don't get any closer to dying than if I were in my full gear.
---
I have full ironclad and was actually thinking about dropping it when I can be bothered to figure out what I wanna run instead. Maybe go back to lifegiver, but as said above it makes no difference really, poison is about the only thing that screws me at the min.
---
Edited for info and typos.
---
Did he sound like a 14 year old boy? This is always how I imagine players like this are IRL
---
Fair. Hopefully if I run at low health in my uny/ap refresh armour it'll mitigate that somewhat. Appreciate I'm going to lose the accuracy of stabilised etc.
---
Going to have a play around I think and maybe give it to an alt if it doesn't work with my current build.
---
Junkie’s: Easy to manage and let’s you keep high health for those uncomfortable with playing a glass cannon. 
---
Instigating: On high damage single hit weapons, this can be insane, especially 2H Melee weapons. 
---
Anti-Armor: Makes a huge difference with the right mobs, and equally good on high or low attack speed weapons. 
---
Furious: So effective and fun on high RoF weapons. 
---
Vampires:  Want to feel like an unkillable god?  Get a high RoF high capacity heavy weapon with this effect and watch your health bar... barely ever move. (Just be careful while you reload)
---
To be honest, it’s more about the synergy than just the primary effect.  If I had to choose between a Bloodied Shovel or a Nocturnal Super Sledge, I’d go with the Super Sledge.
---
Yeah I'm currently at 355DR and 333DR just with regular secret service and Ironclad, this will increase a bit with buttressed mods on SS.
---
You think it's worth just running SS with buttressed and scaly skin mutation and then removing ironclad and replacing with lifegiver for more health instead of DR?
---
Thanks for the help
---
The Liberty Prime skins voice lines will overlap, typically when you kill an enemy immediately after meeting it, leading to funny (but annoying) combinations. Also since Wastelanders, the voice lines play less often, but that might have been intentional.
---
You want investigating
---
Really, I'll have to pick it up then
---
Khajiit has wares if you have coin
---
I ran across this earlier. A dude dropped me a gift but I had no idea wtf he was trying to convey to me cause I couldn’t see it on the ground. Luckily I finally did notice it and it was 20 large gifts. Bless his heart.
---
I have a bloodied and a zerker. The zerker is fun and unique to play, but I agree that the damage should be higher. I'm squishier than my bloodied build and cant get the same special benefits from unyielding or the same damage
---
Can't we just worship Megasloth?
---
Funny enough. Yeah.
---
Definitely in my opinion.
---
Just don’t rush headlong through it.  Take a bit of time of explore and do side quests / events as they pop up.
---
The main quest took me ages to complete (admittedly I started two new characters and had to build up the motivation to do a certain part involving the DMV again) but it was worth it when I finally launched a nuke and killed the main boss.
---
I got one of the major side quests of the main game done but haven’t done the one that gets me radshield yet (radaway...but better).
---
I’ve done one of the ally quest lines from wastelanders but haven’t started the quest proper or done anything else.  
---
So there really is plenty of content, it’s just a matter of pacing yourself a little otherwise you will burn through it and burn out before you finish it.
---
People complain about the end game grind...but you don’t have to grind.  You don’t need to get the best armour or the best weapons from wastelanders to play the game and deal insane damage.  I have bloody FFR combat rifle and out perform almost everyone else at events and boss fights because it just wrecks everything faster than anyone else...so much so I carry a vampires FFR combat rifle (what is it about me and combat rifles) to not steal every kill without thinking).
---
Just play the game.  Take time to gather plans and build your camp and enjoy that aspect of the game too.  The main story is compelling (to me), and even better now that there are NPC’s in the game...the world is more alive.
---
People complain about how tedious the end game is...obviously it can be, because they have done everything and now just spend their time grinding to get the best everything which isn’t fun, and can’t bring themselves to start a new character because they have burnt themselves out on the game AND the new character probably won’t do as much damage as their old one.  
---
Seriously people, accept that your pistol or shotgun build won’t be as OP as commando, or rifleman, or heavy guns, or melee, and learn how to play using the different weapons for fun and a challenge...a bloody black powder pistol one shots almost everything in the game (including scorch beasts).  A double barrel bloody FFR faster reload shotgun annihilates anything.  Actually...a bloody anything is OP, as we know, so try a different build and use a furious weapon (if automatic, or fast melee), or a instigating weapon (hello shotgun or heavy weapon or two handed melee), or an anti armour weapon (really shreds anything with the right weapon mods)...or even vampires automatic ranged or fast melee...it’s almost impossible to die except to rad or poison damage.
---
Bethesda has a road map of new content too, so just take your time and by the time you’ve done everything there will either be new stuff to do, or, as is the case with Bethesda rpg games, you’ll be wel overdue in wanting to start a new character with a different build (that ends up being a stealth sniper like every build you’ve ever used in any Bethesda game because reasons).
---
It's supposed to be limited to one per C.A.M.P, as far as I am aware. People with more than one are using exploits, I would assume.
---
Two shot is really trash, especially if you use vats
---
  Furious, junkies, instigating are all much better
---
&gt; Ochre Wallpaper  
---
&gt; Crazy Guy Blue Fasnacht Mask  
---
&gt; Red Neon Heart
---
Came to this conclusion, decided to take my full health melee to all life saving, with a backup troubleshooter for Her False Sheepiness.
---
People often buy these things specifically for higher visibility to retrieve their loot.  This isn't helping!
---
If they wanted to cash out a few atoms they should offer the workshop pole with the flashing light on it for loot bags.
---
The "stanley" grognak's axe skin breaks the weapon so to speak. You can't unholster it in first person, in third person you use it like you were unarmed so you're punching and not chopping. It dissappears from the workbench so that you can't unequip the skin, can't drop it because it has a skin on so that'll destroy your perfect rolled bloodied axe.
---
Stimpack difuser? Could someone elaborate please
---
WV Day stuff? Hell yeah.
---
It's pretty sick
---
Hi, I run a stealth bloodied rifleman.
---
Easiest to come by is the (mod 50cal refined) hunter rifle. This hits the biggest (in my comparison) among rifles, cheap to maintain ammo and repair cost. Downside between shot reloads and the reload time.
---
2nd hardest hitting using .45 is the lever action. This feel so much better than hunting rifle. Faster in between shot reloads and faster reload. Also much less recoil than hunting rifle. (Ye looks cooler)
---
3rd choice is a hardened receiver fixer. This has really strong hits and very good vats usage. Making it the most versatile choice to any kind of fight.
---
4th handmade this weapon is still doing well.
---
Unfortunately the weapons are not closely balanced so the rest is usually legendary scrip fodders.
---
Is there a white bar on the durability bar?
---
Sometimes the meme for Bethesda just write themselves. "Parachute bag falls through ground".
---
Yeah and it hasn't moved either
---
Bought the backpack and bed. That’s all. That backpack is everything lol
---
Thanks for the experience. That's what I'm thinking I'm at about 350 just with normal secret service and Ironclad. If I put bolstering mod on and get scaly skin mutation it might be better to swap out ironclad for lifegiver if there's no difference in me having ironclad anyway.
---
Or..... Ward is crooked, selling this stuff to raiders, and then having you kill the buyer so he can resell the same piece of equipment.
---
Huh, well if it truly hasn’t moved then I have no idea what’s going on.
---
Thanks for the offer but /u/bunkboi42068 just gave me some!! The fallout community is the best :) everyone's been so nice on here and in game I'm having a great time even though I've only been playing about a week.
---
And left Virginia to stay in it. Shows these statues have nothing to do with heritage and never did.
---
Lol how ignorant
---
Yeah i also see torsos stuck in mid air.
---
What am I doing to keep myself entertained? I started playing other games.
---
The Flamer's nozzle attachments, which reduce reach, overwrite the reach bonus from the long barrel.
---
This is why whenever you mod a Flamer with a different nozzle the range becomes pathetic. The game thinks you're using a nozzle with a short barrel.
---
This can be circumvented by uninstalling and reinstalling the long barrel modification but this "fix" resets whenever you change servers.
---
1st levels? Brotherhood recon rifle, right up to a vanilla The Fixer. Both need to be built by someone who knows the plan though. Great for alts. hard to find new.
---
I strongly recommend making your own chunks of blueprint as I can never get the ones the game makes for you to actually work.   Especially if you have stuff like letters, lights, 
---
 or posters that you meticulously spaced... basic structures are easy to slap down but the decorations are, for me, what takes the longest to get just right. Just blueprint those and manually place the rest.
---
Angry Turtle got you covered.  [https://youtu.be/dbnuh8mdU48](https://youtu.be/dbnuh8mdU48)
---
Yeah definitely, it brings back the survival feel of the game.
---
I sincerely don't get the anti hype that pretends Mothman isn't the most amazing thing about  Fallout 76.
---
Try a different pump shotty and see if the same bug is present. If so could be related to just that weapon type.
---
Just gals being pals....
---
Most intresting. Thabk you for making me aware of this
---
Have you tried putting it into your stash and taking it back out a few times?
---
Yea bloodied is the perfect balance of risk and reward, berserker at higher risk deserves higher reward than its current state.
---
I can’t even get VATS to activate most the time with my heavies because I have such low total AP and the AP cost is so high. 
---
LMG is the only decent Heavy for VATS really, and even then it’s not great. I have a B50V25 and even it wouldn’t satisfy someone who uses VATS a lot even though it is a really good roll for VATS.
---
Hence why no one uses the flamer as a weapon and even not for friendly fire.
---
I have a bloody, ffr, weightless (unless I’m confusing my prefixes) flamer that sits on a weapon display because it takes nearly no stash space.
---
Thank you for the advice. I'm already seeing a professional, and I'm taking her advice to step out of my comfort zone by reaching out to others and making new friends. 
---
This whole post is progress for me. I've already met half a dozen wonderful players who have given me confidence and helped me set new goals. 
---
I really do appreciate your concern, though. I'll look into CBT
---
No but I will now
---
I'll try it
---
Yes. Pick your cryptids, folks, we're setting out our new religions.
---
There was a time where you could have two (cant recall if it was intentional), but shortly after was reduced to one. Players that had them both built before the patch can still have both, as long as they don't scrap them. Not sure if storing them prevents it though.
---
Yep it’s a real mess when I loot them. Won’t happen if you don’t go near the dead body parts.
---
This makes sense to me.
---
I still think they could bump the number up to 12-16 players and let the players decide and take that risk...but then we’d have a lot of complains about server performance not being up to par for a paid service (rightfully so)...so setting a low limit is safest in terms of performance and stability for a paid service.
---
In the same boat unfortunately. I clocked 217hrs in the 2 months Ive had the game which is pretty good for working full time and a father. To the point now where Im just checking player vendors looking for Legacy weapons. My buddies and I will drop 3 nukes, kill the SB for measly 1* weapons most of the time and then just goof off in our camps until we eventually afk log. 
---
Love the game, havent gotten sucked in to anything like I did this in a long time. But unfortunately its current state has run its course. Looking forward to when something new comes though.
---
Nobody lets poor Ra-Ra play in any raider games....
---
No worries, I’m actually planning on doing more testing myself actually, as I was previously going for the armoured backpack mod, but now I can free that up and go for something cooler as the extra DR would be wasted and I’d also be losing my super duper mega 420 carry weight that’s much more enjoyable for a serial collector and hoarder 😁
---
Good luck with your changes/testing if you do it.
---
There’s also more than one smoke machines
---
&gt; I mean, I don't think I've ever found an NPC settlement/town/village or whatever to be interesting or engaging 
---
uhm literally any place in Fallout 3
---
Bethesda only focuses on what sells atoms.
---
May reset the code for that item, just a guess.
---
And listing what you have to trade, and what system your on.
---
*Makes note of this for scientific purposes*
---
Disappointed the free item this week is something that's always been free.
---
Kinda like them saying we gave you 3 crap things last week. Now we have nothing else crap to give you
---
LOL 😂😍
---
I've sort of wondered if this is an example of a company embracing pride, but only so far.  Like, there was that meme going around the other week about how Bethesda's branch in the Middle East didn't put up a rainbow icon for their Twitter because, let's be blunt, the Middle East is stuck in the Dark Ages when it comes to social issues.  Would a flag, which has an actual representation in the game's world, be a bridge too far?  Probably.
---
Usually save blueprints by blueprinting foundations as one, walls as another, then roofs, then content.
---
It’s not very reliable at all though so you’re honestly just better off building afresh UNLESS you build a floating house that has one foundation piece with attached stairs up to your actual camp which floats in the air...I hate how those look personally.
---
All of them sold for 30 to 3K caps, depending on rarity.   Every last one is now gone.   Someone came through and bought me out.   Probably the guy who sells Sun masks for 1500.
---
Good for you. Once your confidence is up, the game really opens up to a lot of possible fun.
---
Instigating for me. Hit the nasties hard before they know what’s happening. Bloodied is OK if you’re set up for it, I dabble every now and again. Two shot is a bit hit and miss, I think it sounds better than it is.
---
Several people came to my camp and told me it looked like a great start! Then I saw their camps and thought "I live in a hooverville! I have one sad little light bulb dangling from a roof timber! " But I enjoyed the experience immensely. 
---
I've learned so much already. I went from a level five at the time of the OP to a level 17 just by following them around like a good duckling and taking pot shots at giant, angry bats. 
---
I got chased and gored by a deathclaw, then I stole it's egg. I learned not to be afraid of dying in game by repeated, brutal exposure. It's great!
---
My new goal is to tame an oppossum and make it my pet.
---
Haha. I was actually thinking of getting the high capacity mod, which I guess lowers your Dr so may counteract what I'm thinking. Arrrghhh lol.
---
How is it good to erase History? Just because there is a statue of it doesn't mean that the statue itself promotes the ideas of the era its based on. Have you never heard the saying, "Those who fail to learn form history are doomed to repeat it; Those who do are doomed to relive it." Also, if the people pushing for this actually cared about racism, they wouldn't also be demanding the destruction of statues of people who pushed for the end of slavery, pushed for equal rights for everyone despite the color of their skin, etc. So there is nothing good about it.
---
The new paratrooper loot bag clips through the ground

You can keep doing them after becoming allied for some quick and easy Treasury Bills.

xbox was taking forever but uploading to twitter took like 30 seconds... https://twitter.com/MrEs\_One/status/1273002139359592448?s=20
---
So I tried with 2 different pump shotguns and they both also didn't lose any durability after putting like 30ish rounds through them
---
Ohio river adventures has 3 or 4. 
---
Just down the road towards the bottling plant is a bus station with two that hang out along the road.
---
Yeah! What cavman said. (I found something too 4/5 days it helped.)
---
I've claimed a number of them at a time but I didn't use turrets. I killed everything myself...helps in leveling faster. Abandoned Bogtown is a good place and the super mutants respawn when you return.
---
On a PC keyboard I can never manage the Alt key to awkward.
---
just send them a message. I've done it before and they totally understood.
---
Yup, that's been my exact experience also.
---
It’d be a nice way to introduce settlement expansions and new settlements in stages...BUT...it won’t happen probably...and it’s highly likely it would introduce some sort of duping glitch given past events...though faschnat didn’t introduce any new dupe glitches so if they use the same sort of resource you objects to dump the containers into it’d probably work.
---
The big issue is keeping track across servers of how many resources have been stock piled at the same time...BUT...they wouldn’t have to.  Just to a daily or weekly reconciliation and add the numbers up and see what the total is.
---
Once the total has been reached, schedule the content release for the next day/week/month
---
Yeah you can build on the water at ohio river adventures. Saw a pirate ship there once. It was wizard.
---
True...but damn is sending a message on PS4 tedious.
---
I run Instigating on my sniper rifle.. and Furious on the others...
---
The Confederacy lasted for only four full years. the statues were built after the fact by the Daughters of the Confederacy and had more to do with preserving the name of their families in spite of their racist history. 
---
I don’t know about you but I learn history from classes, books, documentaries, etc. I’m not going around reading statues to learn about history, but that may just be me.
---
Dr. Demento?
---
Thankfully I’m a stealth commando...so gutsies aren’t an issue, even (usually) if they detect me serendipity and dodgy save my rear...but then I have no AP (unless coffee) so it’s run (well walk slowly) and gun.
---
Encryptid events are a bloodbath...well circuit bath.
---
Yea I am at I Am Death and will happily stay there until I say screw it and decide to give it a go. But i got to this point without power armor so it is doable. 
---
I have to study people who have done silos solo and stealthy.
---
The brand new one? Jesus
---
change to another game... i've been playing since beta but i leave for a month or something to not get bored as hell in january was red dead online 
---
now i'm playing apex... and when the seasson pass start i'll be back
---
f76 is not your wife, you are not cheating for playing other games lol it's regular human behaviour you don't need to get attached to 1 game it's ok
---
ikr!
---
i've been told that there should be a so sorry emote coming soon. Knowing Bethesda they are probably going to make it cost 300 atoms and make it a limited time thing because fuck the players right?
---
How long is excessive? It's a work day and/or around dinner time for most people in the States, so current lobbies are gonna be a bit longer.
---
I use vats with my .50 on enemies that I expect to need only one or two shots on, basically low level. Mine is also an exploding variant and I have Grenadier and Demolition Expert equipped.  
---
In any setting like Scorched Earth, I won’t use vats.
---
Yeah :/ I was actually excited for that one. Hadn't found a loot bag that sold me yet.
---
20-25 min load time to find a match , is it just lack of Players ?
---
Well. If you want them to think you are eeeevil don't send one
---
You miss half of the sentence with your quote.
---
Does it do anything
---
It didn't do anything I tried restarting and now it seems to be happening for all my guns
---
That's a lot longer than what I'm used to on PC, but then again I play during peak times (1-2 hours from now). Probably just low players.
---
To what end? Or for what reason?  I don’t play PVE games and I didn’t get excited about FO76 because I couldn’t wait to find out which gun was the highest damage output and farm for that gun.  The fun of this series is having flame throwers and lead pipes and gauntlets and gamma guns and buzz blades and everything in between.  Absolutely I want that two shot explosive or that bloodied or furious whatever.  Of course I do.  But as you get to higher levels it is fun to see how good you can get using certain weapons that are not typically viable.  I mean, let’s be honest, you see a person doing crazy damage to the sbq with a TSE...and then you see another person doing slightly less damage with Mr Buzz blade.  Who’s your hero?!?
---
This is the best way to make caps. So easy it’s boring. Love it!
---
I hope so.  
---
I like the emote system and it does a pretty damn good job of conveying thoughts and feelings in seconds without speech/text.
---
It’s just lacking some things (though they have expanded it over time since launch)
---
Shush, this is actually a useable bug lmao.
---
It’s kind of lackluster, tbh.  I bought it the last time it was around.  The smoke effect is ok at best, and it’s hard to find a spot to place it so that the spinning lights aren’t tiny specks on the ground.  I tried to place it higher off of the ground, but ‘object is floating’ more often than not, or it’s just red and can’t be placed.  I do love all of the other stuff in the bundle, though.
---
I figured as much
---
Lol, I am the "boss". That's why I shouldn't be laughing maniacally. That and I'm the only one here. Some guy laughing in the corner will definitely lose me a few customers.
---
The statues aren't history. A statue is meant to glorify someone. They were constructed years after the war, almost 50 years later. Tearing down a statue that glorifies a slave owner doesn't burn the 600 page book written about them.
---
You can use the damage nozzles but they have to be the *first* thing you apply. After that, install the long barrel and you gain your reach back.
---
The problem is that you have to uninstall &amp; reinstall the long barrel every time you switch servers to maintain the reach.
---
Otherwise the game bugs out and believes as if you are using a damage nozzle with a short barrel leading to the ultra-short reach. This bug has existed since FO4.
---
Instigating lever action
---
It was only in the Beta, and I’m 98% certain it was removed due to its potential for its extreme abuse in a trap bases.
---
Imagine showing up to a camp exactly where someone sadistic wants you, that you are killed by a stack of punji boards or rad emitters instantly and your junk looted before you can even respawn. 
---
But that doesn’t explain why they don’t make one that only works for you and/or your teammates. It could be an programming problem, or just that it’s not a big enough priority.
---
That’s exactly why those statues were erected in the first place. To glorify the Civil War and the racist principles on which the Confederacy was founded. They were also primarily erected in an era in which Southern States were pushing back on the progress made in Civil Rights after the War.
---
They belong in museums, with the proper context, not in town squares.
---
Instigating on a lever.
---
Oof! Could be your character is bugged, best send a support ticket to Bethesda 🤞
---
The day will come were I spend a shitload saved-up atoms.
---
But it’s not this day. Again.
---
Yeah, I go check out other people's camps and *steal all their building ideas* bwahaha!
---
Lol...I shut my locked door in someone’s face and gave the thumbs down emote from behind said door, then turned the power off (which also turns off the open sign and the lights).
---
Imagine if I did this in real life.
---
There was a time when people could put down 10 I think but then it went to 2 then 1. Not 100% on this but my friend told me this when I asked him the same question a while back.
---
Is the smoke machine in this bundle?? My eyes are pretty shit, so I can't see what's listed in the pictures on my phone.
---
We had a strong discord, 15+ members on weekends, we could routinely fill entire public servers with just our group.
---
These days it's just a handful of us left.  There just isn't enough to strive for, and no challenges for people with good gear.  removing vault 94 with no replacement was a huge mistake, and no effort to make NW better or other possible end game pursuits is just smothering the game.
---
The gold grind kept a few ppl busy but most either have what they want, or just don't care to grind gold.
---
Without end game content there's just no reason to log on.
---
I think I have the BoS Jumpsuit plan. How much should crafted ones go for if I were to sell them? 25 caps?
---
TS is kinda poo
---
Agreed. Why cant we just have all the vaults be instanced raids? Each with their own set of "challenges". Itd add something to do for endgame besides just dropping nukes all the time....im a sucker for swag gimme unique outfits/plans/weap skins/camp stuff. Also uhhhhh remove the caps on everything already, isnt it about time they either rekove the cap or atleast increase it? Literally noone would complain
---
*It's not a matter of if they could, but if they should!*
---
Correct
---
Yeah I'm gonna put everything in my stash and restart my ps4 completely and see if it helps
---
With Secret Service armor alone plus shielded underarmor, you get into the 300 DR/ER/RR range. At that point, adding more ER/DR makes only sense if you have nothing else to spend that resource on.
---
That means that if you want to spend perk points on defensive perks, use Blocker instead of Barbarian, use Fireproof instead of Ironclad, use Dodgy if you don't use VATS, and/or use Serendipity if you're a low health build. I personally don't think  the Scaly Skin mutation is worth it, but if you have no other use for AP or run a highly mutated build with Class Freak, then why not...
---
For legendary armor effects specifically, the diminishing returns beyond 300 DR/EE mean that **15% damage reduction gives you more survivability than the 175 DR/ER from a whole set of Vanguard's or Bolstering** armor. So look for Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, Mutant Slayer's, Ghoul Slayers pieces, as well as 3\* armor with the 15% reduction while blocking/standing still/sprinting effects.
---
ETA: the [damage calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/omgvlac2ux) is for Fallout 4, but 76 uses the same damage formulas. It's a but clunky to use because the perks and bonuses are different. The flattened tail end of the curves is what people mean when they talk about diminishing returns
---
this vitrine is shouts DISPLAY all over the place... good to know that there a ways to use this way
---
Hoky shit dude...great ideas. Give this man some updoots!
---
Dear Diary, Jackpot!
---
Here is a youtube of it as I am going to pull the twitter.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKw1ONKHrcU&amp;feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKw1ONKHrcU&amp;feature=share)
---
Yeah, it’s not that you’re getting the plan exactly. You’re character is learning how to make that mod, so you only earn new ones
---
don’t think there is a plan for it but probably to the right buyer a lot
---
It still exists in workshops. They supposedly removed them from the camp because people were using it to spawn people onto traps.
---
Don’t worry, I logged out real fast yesterday when someone was buying up expensive legendaries too quickly. It happens and I bet they understand
---
There seems to be a bug (shocker I know) and you have to buy before the weekly challenges reset on Tuesday.
---
No, Instigating rocks.
---
So, I’m discovering that since I carry so many Aid items on me that the other backpack mods are better, if you want to free up some perk points or even avoid using them in the first place. 
---
Adding an extra 60 lbs compared to reducing the carry weight of 70 Stimpaks (70 lbs reduced to 7 lbs is a savings of 63 lbs) makes this a pretty easy decision.  If you carry 67+ lbs of Chems &amp; Stims regularly, it makes more sense to use the Chemist Mod instead. No loss of ER or RR either.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Fine-tuned my approach lately. Have ditched Troubleshooter’s and now just rock the Chinese Stealth Suit. Until the control room I try and sneak past robots opposed to shooting them (as a side note there is a train of though in that only so many robots can be spawned in the silo at one time, so the more you don’t kill the less may turn up at the end).
---
I hack all the main terminals to switch off the turrets (oh how I hate them) and lockpick to bypass the reactor. In the area you have to replace the damaged cores I always kill the sentry bot as without fail it will see me by the terminal whilst I’m trying to use it. Likewise I always kill the launch commander in the control room as without fail it will see me trying to hack the terminal.
---
Agreed
---
Yes.  My feeling, more to the original post, is that Wastelanders painted them into a corner.  I'm having a hard time getting the interest up to even make sure I land my 20 treasury notes per day (times 2).
---
My main character who's closing in on 400 has the SS Armor and T-65 and the only necessary mods.  I also have a a few QOL items (dirt tiles).  I don't need any of the new weapon plans since I'm commando rifle build.  I guess I'll grab the grenade plans.
---
The SS armor I've rolled so far is fine.  And since I can't sit there and crank out a bunch at a time (since you can only return 150 of scrip) as soon as you roll 5 3* you're done for the day (or a combo of lesser items).  And that's without even leaving your C.A.M.P.
---
Logging into a server and waiting for events to pop, and then having them be Feed the People, Tea Time, and Jail Break....arghhhh.
---
You dont really need an youtube video it would kinda ruin it first time, the quest marker is pretty much a carry.
---
Bloody commando is fun for some people lol.
---
It is ridiculous how stealth works though...enemies have to pretty much bump into you to detect you...but at least they figure out what direction the bullets are coming from and move (and fire) in that direction...so you need to hustle to kill them all or they’ll detect you’re squishy soon to be corpse.
---
I really liked playing as a non-stealth pistol build...BUT, i found a bloody FFR combat rifle so I had to try it out and never looked back.
---
Non stealth pistols in FO4 with Kellogg’s gun was amazing to play...but it just doesn’t stack up on FO76.   (Never ending double barrel shotgun was also amazing...but without the reload animation it just didn’t feel right).
---
The Uncanny Caverns sign is neat. Approach it from the relay tower to the north-west to get up there easily.
---
You have to opt out of it. It is labor intense to opt out.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Why didnt bethesda let me know how do i opt out
---
To put it in perspective, Skyrim has been out for almost two and a half Confederacies. Fallout 76 has been out for almost half a Confederacy.
---
Same here. Other than the 1-2 shot mobs, I only use VATS to locate the target and then exit out so I can free fire. 
---
AAE250DR and TSE25%AP .50 cals here.  What are you running?
---
Please don't tell me i have to wait another freaking week then D:
---
Oops my bad.
---
Maybe it will be fixed by the time you get her out of the bunker.
---
I can second this.  You have from 8 eastern Saturday night to 9am eastern Tuesday morning.
---
Mines doesn't take long alot of times I get put in a 23 player match if it kinda takes like 3+ minutes to load
---
I have played over 600 hours now it wasn’t all story but I can say that you get well over 100 hours doing everything
---
Naw. This is the wrong take. All the comments responding to you have it right. Fuck these statues and the racist horseshit they 100% stand for. Tear them all down.
---
You can cancel you account as soon as you sign up and it will drop the auto renewal. You will still have access to your scrap but you will not be able to add new junk.
---
Very helpful thank you. So you're saying that bolstering secret service armor is pretty much a soft cap anyway and anything else is overkill? If I was to use scaly skin to offset the penalty of high capacity backpack and lose ironclad to lifegiver, would that be a little better you say? I use a few mutations at the moment on full health junkie rifle build. Thanks again for the help.
---
Oh no, I mean I am actually over encumbered.
---
Unfortunately yes, happened to me the other week very annoying but not unexpected.
---
You think this game monetizes every step in the playing experience? Wow
---
lol that’s hilarious, hope no customer ran away from ya 😂
---
Tensions between China and US? Check.
---
Oil resources beginning to run out? Check.
---
A global plague? Check.
---
Murder hornets? Check.
---
And Mr. House’s birthday is in 9 days
---
If you spend 30% micromanaging, you are doing something wrong.
---
Why do Legendary creature disappear before you loot them. Because Bethesda.
---
Any ghoul spawns or just business as usual? 
---
Yea, Ward gets on my goddamn nerves too
---
Some of the ideas in Wastelanders were proposed by people in this sub. I don't know which ones they were already working on vs included in the game just because of players, but they do listen to player feedback in general.   
---
I can't remember where I found the link to submit feedback directly the last time that I did it, but I know I started out on their own forum for 76 which is at [https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language%5B%5D=en)
---
For my sniper, I use a .50 cal sniper's rifle, with a handmade for when I get discovered. I would prefer a fixer because it allows you to move faster in sneak and uses cheaper ammo, but just haven't gotten the right legendary drop. It's been a while since I've played her though.
---
This game is targeted toward adults.... it’s rated M for mature at least in the US
---
Did a little Googling, it may be the Officer Uniform plan. I'll have to verify later!
---
Ya know, I have chemist backpack at the moment and I thought this originally but I have the healing factor mutation, so find I barely use stimpaks at all. I pick them all up til I have 100+ and never use them. I never use any chems at all really. Just hoard them for no reason and end up putting them in vendor or selling for caps at a station. If I was to stop hoarding chems needlessly I'd say high capacity would suit me more.
---
Headaches: cured
---
Agree with OP to a fair extent. I will say that living a Spartan life in F76 helps to some degree. I hover around 315 in my stash (full disclosure I've got 1st). However not everyone will want to do this. 
---
I run a one gun, one ammo nil explosives stealth build with a suit of Excavator (stashed) for looting in bulk. I keep a handful of backup meds. A lot of the stash space is actually magazines and bobble heads and loaded vintage nuka shine kegs for when me and the astronaut turn it up on a Saturday night... Actually this probably explains the ally disappearances.... 
---
Anyways, my most striking observation is my 315 is in fact elevated by those magazines, bobble heads and camp shit. Thus, how does a collector (or vendor?) with a nice camp NOT have an inventory nightmare even at 800. I have fuck all and I'm sitting at almost half capacity. 'Tis sad really. I don't endorse hoarding but why have cool collectibles if you can't get them all and show them proudly?
---
I don’t think you understand what a paywall is. Clearly you dislike this game. Why do you play?
---
You're right it's pretty swanky!!
---
I hope someone makes a mod for this...
---
Cause money.  I had to look it up. I forget the exact directions but you have to login to your Microsoft account via a web browser and then go to your subscriptions. Then edit them and you should see one for fallout first.
---
LoL
---
Who are these halfassed developers that Bethesda keeps employing? Can't even get a collision mesh right on a fucking bag with no physics. Then they charge money for it. Why do they insist on maintaining such a low bar? I just don't get it.
---
If you’re new to the game, you may want to switch to a stealth commando build.  It’s not that much difference in damage, but oh boy it kills in vats.  Aligned long barrel, forceful stock, swift magazine, reflex sight, and powerful automatic receiver will lower vats cost significantly for you.  With concentrated fire you can target heads and limbs for extra damage in vats.  You’ll go through more ammo, but you’ll take down enemies in seconds.
---
Either build you go for, The Fixer is nice for it’s added sneaking speed.  I can build you one if you’re on PC.
---
Is that how it works. You still have the scrap box just cannot put anything new in it?
---
I just want the structure blueprint and not the inside items. I just take pictures of the inside to remember where everything is
---
I kinda do the same. I just pick a random ass direction to adventure in and see where the flow takes me.
---
I was the same. The instructions on how stash boxes worked were never properly explained during basic training.
---
I still have two smoke machines at my Camp, one Halloween one and one Mothman one. Let me keep it even after I moved camps.
---
Yeah the person who uploaded this was the atom shop team.
---
Try the ps app on your phone ...pretty quick look up then it's just like texting
---
Business as usual
---
no.
---
Just works right?
---
The little amount of context excites me, whom is the robot. Where has he fallen?
---
Pretty cool! Can you tell me about the pipboy at all? I want to buy one for my son but dont want a cheap shitty one.
---
Pretty sure you have to open  a ticket with support for this issue.
---
No more nightmares either!!!
---
I don't anymore. I'm interested in games. I'm interested in the fallout IP. And I'm interested in why 76 has the problems that it has. So here I am.
---
Fucking christ this game just seems to accumulate bugs not fix them...
---
What’s that
---
It sinks into the ground. Use it if you want to lose your loot
---
I'll thank you to please read the post.
---
&gt; The account never played a free trial.
---
I purchased the Deluxe edition through Steam.
---
*Life...uh, finds a way.*
---
Yeah naw, happening to me too.
---
Go farm some mask, jesus christ lol
---
Not sure why they market they jetpack separately, as if the jet pack was a separate power armor piece and not a mod for the torso
---
Same, while I am only level 57. It’s just dailies, events and the Scorch Beast Queen. But to be fair, if you get into a server where they just constantly launch nukes to kill the SBQ it is pretty fun. Killed three of them In under like 30 or so minutes. Can’t wait for the Wendigo colossus to be added.
---
Just get a gamma gun. It damages you if you shoot it at your feet for an easy 50 rads or more if u upgrade it.
---
You keep the items in the scrap box, the emotes, and the clothing. You lose access to the tent, private servers, and putting scrap in the box.
---
Bwilson1973  level 200.  Add me and I'd I am on I will help you when I can.
---
Ask for a refund
---
right? Still not out after todays ATX release :(
---
How do I do that
---
Statues are not meant to only glorify. A simple google search of the different types of statues shows that. As for your other point, the people campaigning for this are also the people that have campaigned for the banning of said books because those books don't portray it in the manner they think it should. Kind of like the 1619 project that was based on a bunch of nonsense and refuted by multiple notable historians as inaccurate.
---
I came across this Mothman t-shirt that you Mothman folks might enjoy

---
Same. I go in there and see somebody's turned it off, I always turn it back on again.
---
One time that asshole said he didnt even really need the returned item I returned I killed for and he just wanted to make a point.
---
The Raider Microtransaction Outfit
---
Left Virginia to join it, actually.  
---
The statues have everything to do with the history of our nation, and that of my home state of West Virginia. Both Union and Confederate soldiers have descendants that are still here. Regardless of the side they fought for, every soldier in the Civil War is a part of history, and may mean something different to the folks living in towns where those statues stand.
---
It's a skin for the paper bag you drop

Winner! Winner! Chicken Dinner!

He's been telling me next week for 2-3weeks now..

I'm starting to think he doesn't actually have a supply and he's all fart and no poo

No, for this one you need to go right back to the origins of pulp...

I’ve had it since day one.  The ranger armor was the only thing they offered with skins for awhile

Sounds like the free states skin

---
These statues were set up to glorify them. They wouldn't be in public parks or capitol buildings if they weren't. 
---
Also I don't know where you're getting the idea that people who want to remove the statues also want to ban books. I've never heard of that at all, nor that they want history books rewritten to their own manner. I want the statues down, but I don't want the books banned. You can't lump everyone together.
---
Same 2 weeks now
---
Have they said anything publicly about this? Do they even know?
---
I looked at that one via screenshots, and it wasn't that. Didn't have the free states logo on it anywhere. That one is more of a beige color as well. I'm mad at myself for not snapping the screenshot, especially after I can't find a single image of it anywhere. :/
---
I mean, 40% would probably be "penis penis penis penis penis penis," 40% would be shockingly offensive content, and 20% would be potentially helpful.
---
Yeah, I'm down
---
I want the soldiers and settlers to sit down, take off their janky armor pieces, and sort/match amongst themselves so that they're not running these friggin horrible mismatched ensembles. You can't have one metal arm piece, a leather leg on the opposite side and a combat helmet. Ffs sort yourselves out and take pride in your appearance...
---
Make a mule character to hold stuff. Only problem is you need someone you trust to help transfer
---
Are you on pc I was in a server where foundation was nuked
---
It a nutshell, the damage formula rolls enemy damage vs your armor. At 300+ your armor is so high, that even the strongest enemy can barely punch through it. So, adding more armor doesnt do a whole lot after that point. The upgrade that t65 gives over say, t51, is negligible.
---
&gt;!Atrimis!&lt; is the name right? Do you have any turrets? I went that route at the end and had it back at my base but the bitch face beamed all my turrets, then my cow. 
---
And this was after the patch that fixed allies attacking camp structures.
---
Same reason I got it :)
---
Then you have only been listening to what they say on video and not what they do when the msm turns the cameras away.
---
The comment was suggesting some content was locked into having to use PA, and that just isn't true. No-one said anything about soloing Encryptid all day or anything. If that was the aim then maybe a PA heavy would be the way to go, sure.
---
You do you mate, I have no issue with PA, it's fun. But I can solo the SBQ as a stealth build, and literally 99.99% of all content. If you prefer PA that's fine, not everyone does.
---
Might want to put an edit in the OP, everyone is losing their minds over this. As funny as the mental image was. Lol
---
Edit: typo
---
These are great updates. Thank you so much!
---
I hang on to bloody, junkies, furious, instigating and anti armor stuff.
---
You know, the top 5.
---
What happens when your camp actually gets nuked? I haven’t seen/heard what it does. Does it just say “Fuck yo shit lmao” and completely obliterate your camp?
---
So unless I am in it for the cosmetics, or the flex, there is no reason to get t-65 unless they alter the formula? I would love it if any power armor had even a slight poison resistance, because I can take a scorchbeast queen to the face, but a stingwing can kill me in a few hits. It just works.
---
Backpack from Settler wastelanders bundle
---
When did you quit?
---
Xbox and I was on a private server alone
---
I play Anti-Armour and it works nicely but it definitely doesn't have the straight damage of junkies let alone bloodied, bloodied is just crazy it has way too many stacking effects
---
Nerf it or provide a looooot more perks and stuff to make other builds just as effective, I would personally prefer new perks but either way
---
And there goes all your credibility...
---
We need this every update good sir
---
Ah shit. That’s a good tip. I’m in the top left of the map by an acid deposit 😂
---
Solution don't use energy weapons or wait till they land
---
*Rose
---
I got shielded the other day. Pretty sure it was from guided meditation.
---
Cannot place item: selected item is floating . When it is not floating
---
How?
---
After Wastelanders. Before today. Also entirely irrelevant.
---
Other perks have their uses though.
---
Anti Armor is very underated and usually works out to about a flat 20% damage increase ... dependant on monster/weapon though.
---
Instigating is very good on farming builds.
---
Furious are very good on high fire rate weapons, imo they compete directly with junkies, with almost no downfall. on my heavy gun build i do better with a f/25 50 cal over j/25 50 cal.
---
A lot of them are more niche, but still useful. Mutant slayers is fine when you are target farming Mutants, Troubleshooters is amazing in encryptid, infact the armor is the only thing that resists the imposter as it has 100% armor pen. Damage resist is king there.
---
I can't get over 'thanks cabbage'!! I'm using that...
---
Personally I'd like to see some buffs to the more unusable prefixes: Nocturnal, by buffing it we could make a "Mr Sandman" stealth build etc. I hate that there's no variation and little to no value of other prefixes compared to bloodied, junkies etc.
---
I get on just fine with my instigating Rifles and Sneak/Rifle/stealth cards
---
Dont forget stealth
---
I am not bored.  I am unable to play the game.  I tried playing a few hours today.  As soon as I hit level 5 I can't do anything.  Literally I loaded up the game and walked to the automated farm place and was trying to figure out how it get it running when someone just walked in and sprayed me with automatic weapon fire and I died in 3 seconds despite being on pacifist.  This is right in the starting area.  The settlement wasn't claimed or anything.  The only feasible option to even try out this game is to waste another $13 on first.
---
So, I'm not running any of those and i seem to do fine... What end game are you talking about?
---
Bloodied and Junkies don't need nerfing: it's everything else that needs to be re-evaluated and re-balanced.
---
Most broken aspect overall mate 👍
---
I wasn’t aware SSDs were available for the Xbox. I installed one on my PC a few years ago and never looked back! Startup? Seconds. Photoshop? Half a second. Graphics intensive games? Ultra settings!
---
Unfortunately I wanted my achievement points on Xbox :/
---
You are very wrong, end game is very playable with non Junkies or bloodied.
---
This is gold🤣
---
Stay away from bloodied builds. Every scab in the game runs it.
---
There are plenty full health builds that one shot everything in the game except for bosses.
---
Here in my garage
---
There was a magical moment where you could have one of each kind and then BGS taketh away

Yea they have them.  Ps4 just uses a laptop 1.
---
That's what I'm saying, but I'm pretty sure a small nerf would help level the playing field so that we don't have dominating prefixes.
---
Ya I have 4 characters and 2 of them are stealth my sniper uses Instigating and my melee which is bloody and is absolutely broken lol
---
The dialogue selection is a bit weird. I think you pick the top option, then the bottom, then top option again. Says something like "anything I can help you with?" or something like that.
---
Sneak+shadowed leather+instigating lever does just fine
---
Had a SBQ fight the other night, where she died in the air while doing one of her fast swooping maneuvers. The physics glitched out and she ended up being flung across the map and landed outside the map boundary.
---
Lots of question marks and frowny face emotes were had.
---
yes this is so fucking annoying cant they make legendary enemies not dissolve im trying to get that troubleshooters wooden leg
---
AFAIK It’s not because of the glitch - it’s because a fix for the door for it that they broke would take a patch level change to the game to fix and due to consoles it get’s lumped into the next one - Patch 20
---
No they accidentally replaced the old red rocket door with the new one that doesn’t fit the same as the old one.
---
maybe they WILL give missions with future updates? met this bot-loving lady in watoga, was a nice talk, but only fluff. this fuzzy girl at the amusement park. that professor at vault tec. i dont think they make voice overs for npcs just standing around with offering no missions. those are future mission hooks. knowing from other rpg titles: if it has a name and "talks" it is important in someway... so time will tell.
---
I've had this happen as well, but not with SBQ, I bet people were furious
---
Communist bundle was a bit anaemic imho
---
Well thank you for using your private I cant tell you how many server I have been on where one of the main story places have been nuked.
---
Ah there she is! Of course i didn't buy that bundle either when it was available. RIP me.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Lol. Bloodied and junkies are not the end all be all builds.
---
I run full health stealthy rifleman and one shot everything.
---
Headshots are 4k damage, gut shots are 900-1200 damage.
---
But.... Tha... That's my name :(
---
Also good but bloodied is king
---
Does it work for SS armor? Or is it PA only?
---
I've seen a lot between 250-750
---
I'm in, but atom shop it. Im not finding any more mole miners for days on end just to not get the back pack I want.
---
Why didn't you thank him in the chat?!
---
Settlers relief backpack, part of Settlers bundle.
---
You've intrigued me, could you pm me some pics of you gear, perks etc
---
Every other mothman headwear item has had the emissive glowy eyes. 
---
Crude yes - but always attention to the glowing red eyes.
---
What's it snapping to?
---
Weapon wheel. Thank you  for the response
---
Yeah it looks rough and I’m the target market for it lol
---
I fought one for 30 mins the other day and it never landed, ran it as far as I could one way and then back, I have a zealots lever action with scorched killers receiver that I usually use to finish them off, but sometimes you don't have time to change weapons in the middle of the fight, that's is usually when this happens lol
---
Have you tried shrouded wood armor you get like 3 different effects out of it
---
1: turn off the radio 
---
2: they're working on a universal difficulty system, you'd know if you actually cared
---
3: play something else
---
I had to grind a long time to get Savage Divide cure. Probably bad RNG though
---
If it's too easy, get rid of your perks and legendaries.
---
I didn't want to mess anyone else up also found out it is super easy to do it private on a stealth build, well if you don't forget circuitry like I did which took the most time
---
Wish I had known u were looking for one I just scripped 3 of them one 2 star and two 3 stars, can't find mods for wood limbs to save my life
---
Every game is like this if you play too much, take a break.
---
oh yea and make the events more difficult and the impossible ones easier the freaking radiation rumble and project paradise also make like every other event 10x hard also make the plans a little more easier to find  because im sick of grinding to get 10 missles and 5 .38 ammo and a ghoul slauers wodden chest piece
---
So to start I'm kinda new to reddit and was really thinking about leaving it alone cuz its 90 percent complaining about stuff... but this right here not only made me want to stay but I had to wait 15 mins to post this cuz I was laughing so hard
---
I’m perfectly happy being a Chem and Bourbon addict In game tbh. But yeah, other legendarys need buffs. Some massive buffs.
---
Submachine gun. Combine it with hardened receiver and -25 less vats cost
---
Lmao that doesn't even make any sense
---
thats not a bad idea i might try that
---
I had not yet encountered this bug until this week. I submitted a ticket, but I assume nothing will come from it.
---
I do hope it rights itself this weekend.
---
From the title I thought you meant like a skinned one, that you stuff all your loot inside. I was like, that's kinda dark...
---
It's even more confusing when things like the backwoods camper, where the walls used to be 'solid' and capable of decorations, are now 'soft' and decorations sink into it in the same manner. So that's an actual regression.... Shits getting WORSE...
---
Have maxed rep, for both factions, now on 2 toons, one sided with foundation and the other toon, the crater. Takes about 1 month ish depending on your choice at the end of the vault run.
---
First toon only did dailies, and the other I spent a good 4 hours grinding random encounters for the last bit ( 1 days worth of factions+Davenport).
---
Personally my suggestion, is do your dailies each day and do 1 random encounter for foundation. And to the fishbones/black eye turn ins for crater each day.
---
Ew
---
Also it's you're
---
and also you act like the game is perfectly fine it isnt it broke as shit
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
No I don't.  I'm not blind to it's issues. Your complaints are just stupid
---
Lol they are a bit annoying to deal with
---
Bought my billion yesterday/Monday. I don’t think it’s just Sunday. You just get screwed for no reason.
---
you act like it
---
&gt;I'm a leet twat
---
Yea....
---
Welcome to reddit. We here will love you  and call you everything under the sun. Enjoy your travels across the subs :) wanker.
---
Well obviously you don't know me
---
And add an eyebot helmet to finish the look.
---
and also how are my ideas stupid
---
Check the dates on those videos. You could be watching clips from a time when an exploit was being used.
---
God knows there's been plenty of those.
---
Oh shit apologies my friend.... Was on the bus to work still hungover as all hell and didnt notice! I thought it was a witty new payout :S eeep.....
---
A little tip I think super duper works on that one part if you get luck you can get all of them and have some spare for next time
---
Because they're completely invalid. 
---
Don't like the music? Don't listen to it 
---
Wish they'd fix the difficulty and rewards system? 
---
*They are*
---
I'm almost certain that a bunch of plans I picked up and threw in my vendor were duped. Got em at fasnacht, threw em in there for 5 caps but yeah
---
If you place a wall opposite the wall you are trying to attach it to does that work?
---
The build mode order in this is anal compared to Fallout 4.
---
I had that activated only got two extra so I'll be prepared next time
---
These statues were erected during the civil rights movement though.
---
Um yes this happened to me too,  GIB ATOMZ OK PLZ?  PQQT steam   :).   j/p
---
Junk container is the only fo1st I've found worth it.
---
It’s a shame we have to waste like 5x the budget if they just gave us proper standalone weapon displays. (Aside from just the heavy one)
---
Under armor upgrade should be coming with update 20.
---
its a protrectron  at the last door just before you find the toy rabbit 
---
tried this walk-through
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQlI6T3AzOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQlI6T3AzOE)
---
it's  the point about 16.45 
---
killed the dammed robot by the door but the door  will not open 
---
Were the supposed too be  two  robots ? only one spawned 
---
and sorry about the lack of contest 
---
Bethesda gets carried away with  the dammed grinds 
---
 level 137 
---
spent almost a hour on chasing that little brat 
---
 while getting killed twice  by assaulttrons 
---
and the last part is bugged 
---
And FFS have some spawn points you silly buggers 
---
I should not to go to the start every time I got killed
---
Don't you dare take my virtual name in vane again.
---
Already got this problem with my real name "Pete"
---
I hear "for petes sake" atleast twice a week.
---
Don't make cabbage an insult!! And all will be forgiven 😘
---
I hope so, I only just found the one at watoga today. I thought I'd seen them all.
---
One of many reasons I can't stand energy weapons. I've got some phenomenal legendary effect ones, but the downsides....
---
Theres a human npc trader that can spawn at a few random encounter locations and has a chance of it being in her inventory pool. The spot nw of anchor farm is the easiest to server hop with. I think i found her about 5 times in over 25 hops, and only once she had the longcoat.
---
Duely noted!!
---
End up having packs of deathclaws hunting you down for having it
---
&gt;WoW, Rocket League, CoD:MW, ESO, FFXV, Borderlands 3, Destiny 2 (until recently)
---
&gt;Those games either fit a majority of the criteria or are actually worse.
---
Umm... So if you actually stick to the criteria instead of weakening it to suit your argument, you have, what, 1 or 2 that meet or exceed it? That's meant to be "current industry standard"? 
---
Also, how many of these provide a good amount of content for the spent? See, that's a part of the problem too - monetising so heavily with such a poorly developed &amp; maintained game.
---
Thanks babe
---
They really hate landing near the forests in cranberry bog for some reason too. Such a pain
---
Hilarious
---
Good to know, thanks! I'll need to keep an eye out. I haven't really been looking for them when I visit vendors.
---
Hey I like my dirty hippie ally. Always talking about harmony and all that stuff. Ain't nobody got time to wash when there's guitars need playing.
---
I believe the nuke simply says "Get fucked" and destroys the entire camp.
---
It is relevant and it was just an innocent question. Sorry I didn’t mean to offend you. Everyone seems so on edge these days. I’ll let you be...
---
Stop asking for things to be ruined and ask for things to be improved.
---
I think for a junkie build you only need 5 addictions for the full benefits and I recommend going to nuke Dragons they have a tab for all the addictions
---
How is this a bad thing lol
---
you have any tips? I hate bloodied as I think it defeats the purpose of the game to run around low health all game. I would love to run non auto rifle and vats though.
---
[Addictions](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction)
---
Never said it was
---
Not exactly, junkie guns, fourius for fast firing guns ( lmg, gaus minigun etc), instiganting for vats sniper( level action rifle) and wampiris for shotgun tankers are biable option. Proper bloodied build will give you insane dps but will make you walkimg glass cannon.
---
people like youa re the reason they add 20 power armor skins every month and one cool thing
---
We call him Sleepy.
---
Try starting a new character as a roleplaying character for example my two are 
---
Civil War soldier : only uses black weapons and revolutionary sword
---
Caveman : only use bone clubs death claw gauntlet and other primitive type weapons
---
They are by no means an optimal biulds but a hell of alot of fun and make a very easy game much more challenging
---
Two-shot works with support builds, Vampire's is very useful as well
---
Power Armour getting left behind? What’s that all about?
---
What about it did it lack?
---
That literally makes no sense but okay
---
Blueprints are actually garbo. I've never been able to place my CAMP back down once I moved it. I've always had to build it up piece by piece. Now, allegedly if you move your CAMP the game automatically blueprints your previous construction, so you'll have that. But good luck getting it to for in a new location.
---
\&gt; but I'm pretty sure a small nerf would help level the playing field
---
That's where I disagree: you don't have to diminish one class in order to significantly improve another. Yes, Bloodied and Junkies are extremely powerful classes, but they also have their own drawbacks and as such, they are perfectly balanced. No need to mess with perfection :D
---
Also, I'm not sure what leveling the playing field actually means: if we're talking about PvE, all prefixes are actually viable as they stand. In fact, even non-legendary weapons are viable in the context of PvE. It just takes more rounds and time to kill something, but in the end, all weapon classes will get the job done.
---
PvP is another story altogether and leveling the playing field in that context will take way more than re-balancing weapon classes only.
---
IMO, nerfing is not the solution to a well thought out re-balancing effort: it will only piss off the folks who have invested time and resources in crafting their perfect build and will only make their in-game experience less satisfying as a result, potentially causing these players to quit the game.
---
It's still available through Steam and Beth' launcher. You can get raider+settler for 30€ instead of 40 on steam,under dlc page.
---
Idk about consoles.
---
Usually they don't land because there isn't room because players are directly under them. One of the reasons the queen never lands when you nuke the Drop Site V9 because everyone sits on the drop site and also puts their tents down too close. Major pain in the arse but if it's just you and no one else I would just make sure you aren't shooting the scorch beasts from directly under them, that's how I get around them not landing at least lol
---
Stash box as well would be a nice addition.
---
I had a TSS lmg before and only after I changed to JE lmg i noticed how dmg was escaping thanks to insane inacuracy.
---
Yesssss!!!!
---
The great irony of the 76 building mode?  So many ridiculous restrictions to prevent "floating" assets, and yet people can still build floating CAMPs.
---
your validating them on there broken game its like a little kid draws a shit picture and enters it into an actual art show and their mom buys it
---
What exactly is the "Paratrooper"? Is it a Backpack Skin?
---
Agreed. Try standing as far away as possible. For some reason, that helps me get around that dumb error message lol
---
Yes, it's in the Mothman C.A.M.P. bundle not the Traveler bundle.
---
Thanks buddy. I'll buy that sharpish.
---
Thank you!
---
Okay, sure, except not at all, because I'm simply stating a fact. If *you* wanna stop playing the game, by all means
---
Wait are you saying that if you set in the fence the SBQ will not land?
---
Just tried it. Yes it is compatible with T-65, but you can't actually build/apply it until you've spent 2000 gold bullion to unlock the T-65 Jet Pack mod.
---
I've been toying with different plasma rifles in my stealth rifleman build and by far my favorite has been instigating.
---
i want to play the game i just was stating some ideas i thought would be cool
---
Also had someone put their camp right where it would fire at sbq: his camps assault only lasted about 30 seconds before she completely destroyed it and flew off never to be seen again, like they do sometimes after the surface to air event ends.... That poor kid got ripped on until he left the server, I mean he had the right idea but I think that it took her just a little farther out than she was meant to go and ended up breaking her normal scripted flight pattern... Either that or she just hit her head really hard when she took off again and got scared lol
---
If you hit c on pc while bluprinting it will blueprint more. You should be carefull with any obkect outside the camp like out-door furniture which might be acidently included in blueprint and ruin your ability to place it. Also if you move your camp game with carve your camp into placeable peaces which will be stored and you will have ability to plsce them without blueprint.
---
PA only unfortunately
---
+karma
---
PA only, and doesn't work with T-65
---
Kudos on the mothman backpack. It's so cute I'm tempted to get the bundle just to get it
---
Yeah, that and the open area right outside where players congregate. That's why she never lands 😭 and so you waste a tooooon of ammo trying to shoot her in the air. If you place your survival tent too close too she won't land. She takes up a lot of space so there has to be a large amount of room there for her to land.
---
Yep, got that part. Maybe actually read what I said instead of throwing a tantrum? Whatever, you do you
---
fr this game is turning to ass
---
This is reddit, not bethesda.net - why would they respond on here?
---
Have you tried turning the SBQ off and back on again?
---
Same here. This is the first week I could not buy any.
---
What do you mean it’s the only way to fully access end game content?
---
&gt;I’m a religious Bethesda follower.
---
There in lies your problem
---
i may redo my camp as mothman themed✍️
---
i think i’m converting
---
Now?
---
Yes
---
I missed all the Mothman stuff earlier because I never had enough atoms. But I just got fallout 1st so I have atom points to spend! Thanks for the update!
---
I can play later tonight 11 pm EST GT- CarltonSluder
---
Yea doesn’t even have to be fancy, just purple camo would be so beautiful
---
The thing that still blows my mind is that a lot of their design choices not only add unnecessary tedium, they actively sabotage their own monetization schemes. 
---
I find myself constantly passing up on things in the Atom shop because I just have no good way to make use of them. Camp things? I can't build a big enough camp for the things I already have. Power armor skins? Well, I cant display them, and each one takes up 10 weight in the stash. I was a huge PA collector in FO4, but that just doesn't really exist in this game. Outfits? I mean, I guess, but the real limiting factor here is the atrocious inventory UI. Once you get past a few dozen outfits, scrolling through the list is a whole new level of tedium.
---
Sure, Fallout 1st adds some nice perks, but doesn't really do much to alleviate any of the above. 
---
The other massive limiting factor is all the low currency caps and time-gating of currency acquisition. I've never played any similar grinding game that so heavily dis-incentivized playing for more than a few hours a day - which in turn also makes a Fallout 1st sub that much less enticing.
---
Same the last five scorchbeast queens I have killed didn't drop loot no plans or three-star legendary equipment. And it's been  lagging more than normal.
---
&gt; *Every other mothman headwear item has had the emissive glowy eyes.*
---
There's two types of Mothman items. There's the cult stuff, and what can be described as Mothman museum merchandise.
---
We've gotten two headpieces for the cult and they are creepy human skull ritual masks.
---
This new gas mask would be part of the cult collection.
---
Yes, this is a well known bug. It affects shotguns more than other weapon types. It's one of the main reasons shotguns under perform so much.
---
I had 4 different vendors visit my camp throughout one day. Including server hopping. I wish they didn't because all it did was make my turrets shoot up my camp while the merchant decided he needed to craft things.
---
It was only a outfit / hat, rexture of existing backpack and a pipboy skin. 
---
They didn’t include the flag, nor the protectron or the weapon skin. 
---
At least one of those should have been included imho.
---
Well I never knew that thanks for the info
---
OP, you lack imagination. A ton of builds are end game viable. Even non-legendary ones.
---
:( really wish they would expand the theme to include skins. It’s the one thing that we look at most of the time, not table set nor plushies but our weapons, yet it seems really difficult for Bethesda to make some for us.
---
That list is good,  but it neglects to mention one vital addiction:
---
\- Addiction to purchasing stuff using Atoms
---
(From what I hear, the withdrawal symptoms are severe)
---
That’s because it would highlight how infrequently 1st members get anything. They just released two paints for the most uncommon armors used. Woo-dee-doooooo
---
I would like a flag to hang at my camp. So when people come, it’s like “yes, it is I, a fellow gay”
---
i always buy mine on mondays and yet to have any problems, but the settler daily quest did not give me rep for the passed 2 days which is freakin frustrating.
---
They had a pride frame last year I think that's all we got edit: and a player icon I forgot about thank you u/foleythesniper
---
Yes indeed :)
---
Fair - but I’ll raise you they could have made it way more culty.
---
One or two roots or some branch horns would have shut my mouth up. 
---
Again it still feels like a slap-dash recolour
---
I’m 100% in on 2 and 3 for sure lol. Those loading screens are a waste to get to Davenport.
---
And yeah, the loot bag is a pain to find at times. Lol
---
Who said magic weapons bud? I do have a few but lately a vamp FFR gauss mini with  bobble and hefe is plenty.
---
The problem with this game, it's that it doesn't have any end-game stuff. The devs focused too much in PvP modes for no reason, while left the core game for a year to dry out.  
---
Then wastelanders came but it was the same, do a few quests and again nothing end-game.  
---
They really need to learn how to make MMO games.
---
Mothman &amp; Mad scientist weapons skins / paints would be great
---
No problem :) my clan and I nuke there a lot lol. We got the Wendigo Colossus to spawn too.. Thing is uuuuuugly.
---
Maybe I'm unlucky but I'm level 146 and still haven't got 1 legendary lever action. Purveyor loves giving me 3 star pipe pistols
---
I'm wondering whether the "use world containers" is data based or superstition.  I've been dropping stuff, switching characters, and it has always been right there.  50 times if not more, never a lost item.
---
Yea instant buy for me 👍
---
This should be an easy tweak really given all the much more complex mechanics in the game. Just use the music already licensed in the game if it's an issue.
---
All yo homies dead tho..... but to be fair all of ours are dead too lmao
---
Oh wow just like my teeth.
---
To each their own. Private server paid for itself during Treasure Hunter season and dailies where public servers are dry for the items you have to collect/shoot. Also great for transferring items between toons. I don’t regret the monthly payment.
---
6 out of the last 10 SBQ’s I fought on console, I’ve dashboarded. The 4 I finished, no plans or even a 1* anything lol.
---
Nah.  I run around and jetpack like a lunatic and when I see enemies, I crouch, killem quick and move on.  The spotting time is generous.  Took out 6 high level Gutsies with 6 shots Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam!!!! Lol.  Ez pz.
---
Zombies!!!!!!!
---
I know was upset that it was not released, wonder if the item is broken still or on the back burner.
---
Dont skip dialogue options when handing in the quest. Or if Ward says 2 dialogue options before you say 1 it will glitch and not award rep. 
---
Basically just listen to his annoying ass until rep is awarded dont skip dialogue
---
This wouldn’t be a problem if they have to charged their face holes in between shots.
---
the midas touch
---
Pretty sure they do post here. I could be wrong tho
---
Oh s--t, I've sold three for 1000 apiece!
---
I was really hoping this was going to be some lower back backpack when they datamined this.
---
Respect to what you're saying but these items were SOLD as functioning addons. If they're not functioning as intended, they're defective. Rectifying them should be important, otherwise that's a 'recall' in my world.
---
I do appreciate your nod to 'easier said than done'.
---
No you
---
That’s why they sold so fast.
---
It was two weeks but yeah it was nice lol - I never had anyone complain about a server going down and it definitely wasn’t correlative with any crashes from what i could tell
---
Yeah I'd definitely be interested in some sort of IE weapon if you have multiple, I understand the collection and wanting to keep one. Levers are very hard to find. You had me at "rifleman's wet dream" lol
---
Not 95%, maybe 80. But that's not because they're legendary, but just because 80% of weapons are worthless to begin with. What am I supposed to do with a ⭐⭐⭐ Nocturnal Shovel?
---
Oh yeah, i forgot to add that she charges up in literally 1 second.
---
Thanks.
---
There are a few enemy attacks in the game that ignore DR/ER completely, and basically considers you to have zero of both.  
---
Assaultron head lasers, Colonel Gutsy guns, aaand something else I'm forgetting... maybe Deathclaw uhhh ...claws? (Or was that just FO3/4?)
---
The only suggestion I have is that for #2 only YOU can see your own loot bag's balloons
---
This makes me so happy that no matter what level assaultrons will own anyone :D
---
I still got the whole end game grind to do, but with the plethora of items constantly bugged or glitched I just find myself not having the energy to be spending an hour in loading screens waiting to fond a server that's working properly anymore. 
---
Havent played all week because of it.
---
i want to get to that level. I am currently obsessed with crafting serums and getting all the plans.
---
Yess! I do have my own lgbt sign hehe lemme see if I can figure out how to upload it [lgbt](https://ibb.co/CKTzpKy)
---
It becomes much less likely that she won't land because the fence makes It hard for her to path you and stay "locked on" to you long enough to want to land. Also, when you take into account the crowded area situation that was mentioned in the last comment it makes for a very long and boring mid air bullet spraying parade that just adds to the problem by staggering her and resetting her "random countdown" to land when she finally locks onto something she wants to land near. Also, once she's down, she is much more likely to take off is no one is within striking (melee) distance of her. I usually shoot a few times to get attention, let all the scorched "helpers" spawn and take them out all at once Black Ops Zombie Train style and after that they seem to land more often, I have a theory that they prefer to land when you are swarmed because it creates confusion, but if you take them all out quick enough you can kill them all as she starts to land Nd focus on her. I can't prove this, but it seems to happen more often than not when I use that strategy on regular scorchbeasts.
---
Only when the game is literally on fire, like when Fasnacht wasn't spawning intestines.
---
I would recommend an instigating rifle like a lever action rifle or hunting rifle for your main and some kind of handmade for faster fire backup.
---
 If you want the hardest hitting full health rifle build I would recommend an instigating pipe revolver rifle. The pipe revolver rifle can double dip between gunslinger and rifleman perks giving you twice the power of normal builds.
---
 Currently I run an instigating explosive pipe revolver rifle with an anti armor explosive  handmade rifle as backup.
---
 The instigating pipe revolver rifle can hit for 4K damage head shots and around 1200 damage gut shots.
---
 The normal rifleman build with instigating lever action rifle is still plenty enough to one shot most enemies in the game.
---
 As for builds I don't know much about that as it took me over 100 levels to really get mine to where I wanted it.
---
Put balloons on legendary corpses too.
---
True. Good point!
---
Bulk junk sells quick for me. 
---
Mostly oil, steel, concrete, copper.
---
Those builds are crutches. I have two characters that have been through it all without using them. One with rifles, the other with pistols. Bringing up a bow hunter now
---
Effects like dodgy and serendipity will also work @ Encryptid
---
Well yea...if you're a monster
---
If you're pulling for weight, sell your one star items first. Since you can only get 150 scrip per day from selling your legendaries, this will reduce your weight the fastest. 
---
If you're going through a lot of Scorched Earth events or other like quests, you'll always end up with more weapons and armor than you can sell, though. I really wish the daily scrip cap was at least doubled. I've started ignoring one star legendaries just because they're not worth me holding them until the next time I've got scrip space available.
---
During Fasnacht i was trying to figure out a way to cover the whole field with my heavy gunner, I end up using an SE 50 cal and SE Gatling for the task and it was very successful with vats, basically one shot one kill. Tried the same position with Bloodied gatling and I would miss shots from time to time when the muties come from the other corner. The Stalkers prefix does have a practical benefit when using heavy weapons for sniping. I would imagine +33 vats chance would be useful too.
---
This is actually hilarious. What a cabbage, erm...no offense Sarg.
---
Np. Would you like a link to a build I made a friend of mine it is a vats pistol build using junkies
---
r/thathappened
---
It’s not necessary the expectation of Bethesda responding but I’ll be more likely to get legitimate advice from the god knows how many ppl that are active here, I tried Bethesda they could give a fck less
---
Are you actually hitting enemies with the guns? Or just firing them off?
---
Nah I'm good.  Thanks tho
---
Thanks for the breakdown
---
'Maybe some more patrols over there, ...' Listen, dude, if that keeps happening *day after day after day*, it's probably your own fault, and most likely your own people stealing stuff from under your overslept nose and giving it to those useless raiders. Just a heads up, Ward.
---
Either
---
There may be a bug effecting people with over camp budget builds. Also they have to spawn at or very close to your vendors. My camp I spawn in on the opposite side and my budget is only half so I think I’m safe. The only way to tell is to check so log back in and check. Sometimes played near max caps just buy useless stuff or ammo for future sales as caps. Or they dump it. But you won’t know if you don’t go look.
---
The backpack skin is the closest skin i can get to the croc backpack, its amazing. Hail Mothman
---
Just started playing after neighbor talked wife and I into free weekend. Easily 40 hours, especially if you’re a crafting/building fan.
---
there was a player icon as well
---
Why do I have to keep telling you people.
---
Stop using my name in vane!! I already hear "for petes sake" twice a week. And that my god damn real name. 😭😭😭😭
---
Ehh try an open relationship.
---
Do you have guts enough though?
---
The only perk that is effected by PA is stabilized in the intelligence tree. That perk adds armor penetration and increased accuracy for big guns while in power armor.
---
Sure looks like they're completing it in a *specific* way.
---
Not with my dual barrel shotgun. I can two shot a SB with it and one shot pretty much everything else.
---
Remember In FO4 with the “Build a vault” DLC (Forgot what it was called) You literally had a shitton of extra pip boys but could never sell them.
---
Not the ones under strength, but Stabilized under Intelligence gives you considerable accuracy and up to 45% armor penetration for heavy guns while in power armor.
---
I love it!!! Omg I did something similar with the metal signs at mine! I did 2 female signs and the neon heart sign in between.
---
Sergeant Peter cabbage? Weird name mate.
---
I hear you bro, just taking the michael.
---
Holup
---
Raider waster PA paint blocks while using heavy weapons too
---
Yea I u nderstand
---
Don't you drag my uncle into this. Fuck.
---
I have no identity, and am over level 100+.  I carry probably 15+ weapons: bloodied, furious, vampire, medic and they are all different because they are fun to use for different prey: rifle, .50 cal, tesla, shotgun, plasma, cryo, dc gauntlet, etc. And carry 4k of four different types of ammo. None of my armor matches either ( but I do carry an extra set of troubleshooters for Encrypted). I can't one-shot big stuff like the bloodied players, but it's fun trying and sweating it out on the big events. Then there's times when I try to run Poseidon killing everything with a commie whacker.  Sure, I die a lot (thus the name), but just have fun with whatever build you choose.  Now there's an atom challenge i would like to see: kill 10 different enemies with a Commie Whacker
---
I love it!!! Are you on xb1? If so GT:collins6542
---
Ok, Misty.
---
Stop it...can't breathe *laughs*
---
Keep going...
---
Honestly the world will never know. Seeing as dead vault dwellers aren’t hard to come by. Not to mention, there was a DLC In FO4 where you could make your own vault. You had to give your dwellers Pip boys. But for some reason, you could never sell them.
---
Good luck making that happen, unfortunately. If I see 95% of people still standing on the fences and their tents during the scorched queen event, you know the majority of people aren't paying attention. All of us here in the subreddit make up a teeny tiny fraction of the player base. 
---
But I'm so with you. I'm done with the damn shop until things get better.
---
Thank you. I no longer use demo expert so this is perfect.
---
Interesting to see your evolution and thought process as a griefer. 
---
Your idea of a fair fist fight for fun and still having a shop set up for non-combative players is top notch. Love to see this type of stuff in game. Really wish there was more RP-ing in the 76 community
---
“Finally! Someone shows up with some guts to help out...”
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Assaultrons are the front-line US Army Assault unit, I would expect them to shred.
---
- There's a big difference between making money, and trying to make every conceivable penny in existence. 
---
- The game barely requires any upkeep outside of paying to run some servers. They do minimal bug fixing (the game engine has had the same bugs for decades) and have basically had one single major content update in almost 2 years not including a terrible BR mode no one asked for. 
---
- Again they've had one single real "DLC" update and honestly all that did was add content that should have been in the game at launch, real NPC's. 
---
- The game was a cheap to produce asset flip with tacked on multiplayer code and very little initial voice acting and animation as there were no NPC's. Furthermore the games selling now again at almost full price and has had a cashshop since launch which has been the most functional part of the whole game and full of questionable quality overpriced things for people to throw money at. 
---
- They've also had an awful overpriced sub for the game for the last half a year. 
---
- Selling a survival/multiplayer/crafting game for full price with MTX with a full priced subscription isn't "industry standard" whatsoever lol. 
---
- Most other game developers get by with either just a standard upfront game price + DLC or some purely cosmetic MTX. That's it. With most not being gigantic multi billion dollar companies that have released the same game 11 times over lol and have a history of bad monetization schemes.
---
He is so funny.
---
Very interesting and thank you for the information will definitely do better in the future
---
Yeah and when you're in an innocuous place like the Garrahan basement looting basic scrap and, from the cave area, strides out a high level legendary one going immediately into invisibility followed by DANGER, you can do nothing but say 'Clever girl....' before the bitch is upon you.
---
I dunno, without them it might make the game boring. We need something to be afraid of.
---
Any time
---
Are you not getting any items at all or just not getting good legendaries?
---
The scrapbox doesn't help that the inventory system is absolutely terrible to use.
---
And that's great? If a DLC has had work and effort put into it and is worth paying for what's wrong with that? I can't imagine NOT PAYING for some of the amazing DLC I've played over the years such as Blood and Wine with the witcher 3. 
---
I would take paying for a game + optional DLC over MTX and even worse a ridiculous sub fee a million times over. Easy. No comparison.
---
This whole fight/event could do with a rework.  
---
It's such a huge investment of resources (ammo, primarily) that it just feels horrible when you get nothing out of it.
---
Queen corpse should be empty always, for everyone. Instead, all the loot should be deposited directly into your *stash*.
---
No more queen corpses glitching through the ground / out of the map. No more queen corpses getting vaporized by energy weapons and just disappearing into thin air. No more dead queens landing deep into the nuke zone where non-PA players will struggle to reach.
---
Nope, instead you get all the loot placed directly into your stash, NOT into your on-person inventory. This would also fix the problem of being killed by the adds (or griefers) immediately after the queen dies, and losing all your flux and loot.
---
it does look small. Do you think it is easier to see than the paper bag or not?
---
You sound about right, friend.
---
sounds like someone at 30k caps needing to spend some, so they likely bought a bunch of stuff they could resell later.
---
Wastelanders was a literal PR redemption move to try and show Bethesda actually gives half a shit. It was nothing more.
---
For some reason, I only really use bash in 4.
---
Just play Just Cause.
---
He's fine in my universe. Ash was turned to ash.
---
As others said, its still available. Its just hard to find cause its a store item not an atom shop item. On consoles its just in the online xboxlive or PS stores as a bundle item.
---
GO HOME BILL!
---
that's true, it's good for advice, but maybe just try to have fun, or take a hiatus? I took one for like 8 months, came back, and found that I really like the game(I also joined a discord group, which the wasteland is seriously better with friends)
---
Yes sir
---
&gt;Can’t wait for the Wendigo colossus to be added.
---
Just a heads-up, it's already in the game. It's just not a guaranteed spawn. If you see fissure prime get nuked, check and see if Sundew Grove is in the blast radius too, as the colossus can spawn there near the building at the edge of the trees.
---
For sure it’s definitely person to person depending how you play. I only get on my PS a couple times a week. I also don’t really junk hoard I craft as I go and it’s mostly ammo anyway so I really don’t need the scrap box. It’s very very nice to have but I can manage without it. I understand a lot of players can’t so it’s worth it for some, and not so much for other players.
---
Totally agreed, there’s too few worthy enemies in the game, luckily we still have the assaultrons and gutsys.
---
ESO is a proper MMORPG though with literally thousands of hours of content just with the base game purchase alone. The two are night and day.
---
Were Fallout 76 just ESO with a fallout skin then it would be perfectly acceptable to have a subscription + MTX + Base price and such.
---
Also, addiction to picking up every piece of junk you come across... Aka, Fallout hoarders
---
if the player is new there are  a lot of atoms for world and survival challenges out there
---
No drop from the sbq just the mission rewards jus one leg. Item no plans no 3 stars for at least a solid month and a half
---
Steam is supposed to have maintenance at some point. I’d recommend checking the stickied post in r/steam . I did and I really just want to play dang it
---
same here... same message, same platform
---
Hey, on your game open up the map and hit the right arrow button. it will show daily, weekly, survival, world, and other challenges. Do what it says and get the atoms it says. Most are easy, some are hard.
---
You're not alone. Server status page says all is well, but...
---
Never mind. Just got in. But you weren't imagining it.
---
All backpacks have been slightly borked since update 19
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/grw2qw/has_anyone_had_an_issue_with_the_backpack/
---
Lmao that or just Dying Light
---
These Astronauts ain't loyal
---
Well it's not just faction bots; each one specializes in a different store(kitchen appliances, fancy clothing stores, pharmacy, etc). If anything, it would be nice to see those replaced with human npc's, but I get the feeling MODUS isn't going to let that happen...
---
It’s a shame there is nothing for the T-65...at least make other paints compatible.
---
And where do you think the developers would make time for implementing the mechanics first and then designing the areas and testing everything every month while still having time to work on other things about the game?
---
I would but I’ve invested a year of eso plus fallout first and all the add ons you would figure they would do more than offer a refund. I try but when you invest real cash it gets a little irritating.
---
The same thing just started happening to me tonight.  Did either of you get this fixed?
---
Aaaahhhhh. But Hank please it will only be for the night I promise, then I'll go back to my empty lonely house Hank I promise.....  And you Shut up boomhower!!!
---
No, Pied Piper I believe.
---
I think they are still useful for buying the plans from each type of vendor.
---
Will they? I can only speak for myself, so obviously this may mean nothing statistically but I pay FOR the scrap box. Everything else is a bonus but without the scrap space pvt world is pretty pointless and atoms are easy to earn if you just have a goal or two instead of buying it all. 
---
I fully agree scrip and/or cap limit needs an increase. Stuck in the limbo of cant sell, at limit. Can’t scrip, at limit. So throw I guess.
---
I came home and i had 2 beds for us amd found her in bed  with a ghoul trader it fucked me up man
---
SBQ is not good for farming legendaries, nuked Whitesprings or events like Uranium Fever are much better. But it is weird that it does drop items but no plans, I always get at least two plans off her body and another one as a mission reward. Plans and Improved Repair Kits are what make her worth killing for me.
---
It would make more sense if she was not droping any items at all, which in this case would mean you aren't dealing enough damage to it. But just not the plans is weeiird.
---
Nukacrypt has the codes every week for Xbox PS4 and pc
---
They were there from launch and are part of the mall,  I'd like them to stay. but the faction ones were added back when we could only sell 200 caps worth to each faction.
---
Beth added them so we didn't have to fast travel all around the map. Pretty redundant now!
---
Railway Rifle all the way! You can buy the recipe on Harpers Ferry, and the ammo is made with plain steel.
---
New engine...
---
yup
---
You. Are. Not. The. Target. 
---
The game targets whales. It targets literally 10% of the playerbase that have a good chunk of disposable income and are happy paying for connivence items, although unfortunately sometimes people without a lot of money to spend still get caught up in the web. I know someone who's spent well over $1,000 on FO76 in the cash shop with a lot of it being on scrap kits and repair kits and so forth. Why? Because he finds dealing with the micromanagement stuff like that annoying and he simply can. 
---
Go watch the disgusting presentation or read up on how lots of game companies, especially mobile game makers have a complete process on how to "turn players into payers". Please stop talking about stuff that you CLEARLY are extremely ignorant of.
---
I'm fine with new icons.
---
Those just aren't very good though. And icons shouldn't cost 150 atoms.
---
I will be the first to tell you I know Jack about making a game.  I also know Jack about their p and l because I dont sit on any of the boards.  What I do know is if you dont like their practices just spend money on it.  Plenty of people do and still enjoy the game.  You can bullet point will all the good ethical things companies should do and I'll refer you to ever other corporation in America.
---
Are the balloons filled with helium? If so I don’t want my scrap ceramic floating away.
---
oh thank god, thought the day had come and my account got hacked or something
---
Yeah maybe, I'm looking at this from an endgame point of view so maybe if I was new to the game I would find it usefull them all being there.
---
Try reperking your character to run a vats sneak buildnwith the gauss pistol, not only is vats sneak crits completely broken, the gauss pistol misses its first shot 100% of the time, some times you can empty the entire clip and not land a shot due to a crazy bug, no motivation to gain 9 lvls again and reperk especially at lvl 340. Wastelanders broke the game and since the roleplayers are the majority of the players now it got glowing praise because the roleplayers only play dress up and doll house building.
---
I tried like ten times and it finally allowed me in.  I think that it is some kind of issue with Bethesda's servers.
---
You are not alone! I can wipe out a bunch of high level blood eagles with a handful of shotgun shells, but fuck me that assaultron takes everything I can throw at it. I reccomend nuka grenades, but even though I've maxed out demolition expert, sometimes I'll hail those tiny nukes down upon one and it will still come striding out of the mini mushroom cloud head laser blasting..
---
Idk I either just keep trying or wait 20 minutes and try again that always seems to work
---
Lol I don't think a game being able to be compared to COD's monetization is a good thing whatsoever haha
---
Yup, that was the first website/link I saw and now, I’m going to be going on that site for now on for my nuke launches
---
Last I check all the doors I had unlocked in 76 had two sides.
---
Don't fuck with my Mall. That where I walk around every morning to get my exercise!
---
Yes you can keep it or split it
---
Marathoner doesn't work in PA. Portable power is pointless as is cap collector. Don't need bear arms unless you plan on carrying 3+ weapons.
---
Ehhh kind of redundant, but it's good to have the extra vendor selling bulk lead/ballistic fibers
---
Nah, Fallout 76 endgame is easy enough that you can use any build you want and likely be fine. Hell there are videos of people soloing the queen with non legendary weapons. Sure, bloodied and junkies make it easier, but the game is not difficult without them. Even the vault raids were actually harder to do bloodied than not because if you died you could make the whole team have to start over.
---
Yeah, there were two boxes that spawned them but they only worked from the one box. The other box, they were bugged and couldn't be equipped properly on NPCs. Good old buggy Bethesda.
---
Buying every single plan even if you don't need it is endgame.
---
Ya can't compete with a robit.
---
I'm just hoping they'll bring new quests along with the summer update, then the BoS questline.
---
I mean 2 doors fitted into a door frame.
---
Right. I know damage isn’t the issue, but it makes sense where you are coming from. I’m just venting I couldn’t code it any better myself and I do REALLY enjoy fallout for the most part but investments that bite you in the ass and then a company that shrugs it off gets under my skin lol
---
Response gives it away
---
Perfect! Thank you
---
Is that the Eyebot that has the rats following it? Probably getting this confused. lol
---
Ngl. Hope this never changes. Nothing scares me in this any more. But getting turned to ash my a facelaser does grant some fun so. It's good to not always feel like a god
---
I don’t think I have ever actually got all the codes to launch a nuke the legitimate way in my 500 hours of playing. I didn’t know it was this tedious besides running into random scorched officers. 
---
Makes you appreciate NukaCrypt
---
That's fair, you've put up with a lot of crap, so I hope some good karma comes your way
---
Was literally getting owned by Assualtrons and gutsys earlier in the Silos lmfao I felt your pain earlier
---
It fixed nothing
---
Exactly. So you do that through making the games 30 second loop interesting or engaging enough or make daily or repetitive activities rewarding. Also FO76 is not an MMO. Even if it was, I have never seen the level of literal waste of time systems FO76 has in it in any other video game.
---
It won't. They're just trying to milk it.
---
It is?
---
I recently switched from PS4 to PC.  I used to do the same thing.  Fast travel, put down controller, pick up phone.  It's just so bad.  On PC it's 10 seconds tops.  It's painful to leave behind a character I've been playing for so long and start from scratch, but it really takes me out of the game.  I might want to do a quest, but I look at it and decide based on how many load screens it will take.  Gotta fast travel to Foundation, then zone into the underground area to talk to Paige, then fast travel out.  Oh no, I forgot I need to go do my daily scrip turn in.  Fast travel to CAMP, grab the stuff, fast travel to Rusty Pick, another loading screen zoning in.
---
One of the times it did but the other it didnt because it was my xbox live sub.any luck
---
I never buy junk or ammo from robots so I guess I've not thought of that.
---
I had Marathoner because I don't yet have enough power cores to wear the armour everywhere I go, so I've been running to a place, then suiting up  
---
I thought heavy weapons weighed 36lbs+?  
---
I'll bump off cap collector :)  
---
Any suggestions on what to replace it with?
---
But keeping it will lower the rep with whoever you should of split it with
---
GG!
---
it's does nothing but lay there.  It's just a different model for the paper bag , gravestone.
---
If you want I can help you too I love helping low level players and as a high level player I don’t really have anything better to do My psn is Baam_x_Yurijahad
---
Since beta.  Need to use VATS, have over 200 rate of fire or other things to get around it.  It's bullshit that the main activity of the game is bugged to shit.
---
Look up magic shotguns.
---
How significant will it be?
---
Well we don’t have to pay for it here... so i prefer not having to pay for it. I like the fact that everyone has access to the same quests, weapons, etc whether they pay or not. That’s my preference. I don’t like fragmenting the player base. You are entitled to your opinion and I am entitled to mine. It’s just a different monetization method, and I prefer this one.
---
By how much
---
Thank you sir me too lol!!
---
Check the lower level
---
Circus cage door iirc is the only one I know of and you have to have circus cage plans for them.
---
If you just want the mods you have to server hop until they show up, if you want the plans to be able to craft them then you can buy them at the production terminals.
---
I never gotten that many plans and I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve dropped her
---
I’m sorry you didn’t like it. I was very happy with it as were many others. They did a good job. Just look at steam reviews vs reviews at launch.
---
Welcome to the Communist party!
---
Get the speed demon mutation you’ll move as fast as the game allows with that I think iirc.
---
lol I've honestly been in the same spot north-west of Helvetia/south of Arkos since I start in March of last year. I like my spot, but that's cool my FO 1st account will get a larger camp budget
---
Not sure to be honest, I sided with the raiders for the mission then split it 3 ways and I’ve managed to get them up to near ally but it’s taken me a few months lol
---
Yup, not there, only the holotapes from Paige talking about them!
---
It's fucking stupid. I have no plans on moving any of my camps for the foreseeable future, so I can't get the skins.
---
At that point i'd just lower my standards tbh
---
Just seems safer to me.
---
Yea it's called " the messenger"
---
The game has definitely fizzled out for me. Just taking a long break. Got tired of just logging in for gold/scrip.
---
Ya, on paper my shotgun says 3100 with ballistic bock, tats and a bobblehead but i can't seem to hurt her... like at all. Everything else gets obliterated
---
 I kinda like that it's not overly culty. A simple black and red gas mask can fit in with a bunch of different looks. I could definitely imagine a Blood Eagle raider character wearing it.
---
What I'd like to see Bethesda do is add is a separate open faced mothman cult hood to go with it. 
---
What disappoints me about this week's atomic shop update is the picture showing cultist vines growing over the walls and three skulls placed like C.A.M.P. items. I got excited thinking we'd be getting skulls as camp objects :(
---
Honestly, I was farming at Whitesprings and ended up dead.  I must have run past it 5 times in the grass because it blends with the grass itself.
---
It's very low profile on the ground so it's not so easy to get target over it to get your items.
---
I had hoped it would look more like a duffel bag instead.  Something with more volume I guess ?  
---
I will keep using it, but it's going to take a bit to get used to.  Thank goodness for the diamond over it when dropping on death.
---
Thanks I'll keep that in mind. I've been grinding the daily events for both factions so I hope I can keep the reputation even if I decide to rob them. I mean it's a 1000 bullion. I'll be halfway there for the jetpack
---
I'm not. I don't spend money on any Bethesda products not since the disgusting paid mod debacle. I was simply responding to your comment as to why the whole "But without nickel and diming players they'll all starve!" argument is silly and actually really hurts the consumers who we should all be looking our for. These companies (AAA) make a ridiculous amount of money hand over fist, they do NOT need anyone going to bat for them and they don't care. 
---
They're a corporation that exists purely to make as much money as possible so their investors can each afford their 6th yacht. Unfortunately a lot of that money is made through unethical or even predatory means that all of us need to call out or one day video games will be overwhelmed by them. As they almost were with loot boxes almost becoming normalized and shit was that ever scary.
---
It seems good, but I would add max Tenderizer perk into Charisma with max Adrenaline perk in Agility and max One Gun Army in Luck to increase damage output. And perhaps remove Power Patcher and Portable Power for max Demolition Expert perk to increase explosive damage on weapons that have it (Gauss Minigun, Explosive 50 cal, etc) if you have them ofcourse. I'm not sure why you have Marathoner, unless you run around without power armor (Since it doesn't work with power armor). There is more ways to increase your damage output but that means you'd have to sacrifice scavenger perks.
---
It’s not a time thing, pick up more items (180ish?) from the world and then the weights will spawn again.
---
Shirley your not joking!
---
You have to loot 180 objects to get the ones back when you started at the first object, so waiting a day means zip.  Best to find a good loot run with lead and screws and use private servers to farm it consistently.
---
It’s been three same for me. All my go-to spots have been empty for a couple weeks.
---
500 points. You get 200 points for each daily, 225 if you opt out of your reward or you say "Appalachia has a new corpse." Photo op gives 15 points for one faction if you sell the photos to the enemy faction but don't take a reward. So you loose about two days worth of grind. 
---
You get 1000 points if you give them the gold, so thats about four days worth of rep grind in exchange for about two days worth of gold grind.
---
So its your choice.
---
Strength - Looks fine.
---
Preception - Looks fine.
---
Endurance - Looks fine.
---
Charisma - May want  to have this at least at 3. It has some decent perks that cost three points.
---
Intelligence - Portable power is near worthless, IMO. Unless you're carrying a bunch of PA frames/pieces in your inventory you do not need it. A single frame even with PA pieces on it only weighs 10 pounds in your inventory without the perk. Power Patcher is not necessary to have on all the time, PA pieces break VERY slowly even without the perk.
---
Agility - May want to invest more into this stat. It has some VERY good perks. Such as Adrenaline. Marathoner is a fine QOL perk but you generally don't need it.
---
Luck - If you're planning to have a bunch of mutations, Class Freak 3 and Starched Genes 2 are pretty much requirements. Can Do! and Cap Collector are utility perks that you do not need to have on at all times. They can be swapped in when needed.
---
If this game had the monetization I see in other games I would agree. My personal opinion is this is the right level. So many other games lock progression behind a paywall. That isn’t right. I personally think the overmonetization in modern games is a huge problem. I just personally don’t think this game has crossed that line. I’m sorry your friend somehow spent $1000 on utility items. I don’t even know how that is possible. I personally prefer to repair at workbenches because my weapons break half as slowly that way (repairing to 200% vs 100%). 
---
No need for personal attacks. People are entitled to their opinions without calling childish names. All I did was ask a simple question. Didn’t mean to trigger you... sincerest apologies.
---
Learn all the armor and weapons mods. Learning all the mods for the Ultracite Gattling Laser will keep you busy/poor. 
---
I've also been treasure hunting.
---
I'm betting once they start their seasons and atoms are harder to get, they'll have more worthwhile stuff in the shop. That's what I'm hoping for, at least.
---
Except there really hasn't been ACTUAL quality DLC added to FO76. All there's been is content that should have been in the game at launch. It's literally just been an apology PR stunt. 
---
There hasn't been massive new game mechanics or systems added, there hasn't been good sized new areas added, the endgame is still largely the exact same and identical gameplay loop it was at the games launch, no legitimate content has been added to the game. 
---
But hey at least it's been free I guess lol
---
Now my Irish auntie. Wtf is with you people. Attacking my uncle Mike and 1 eye shirls.
---
Cool, did you do both sets of missions up until the point of choosing a side? I did that then picked the raiders. I’m literally a daily away from getting ally status with them and about half way through neighbourly for settlers which is 1 before ally.
---
Oh man you just helped me make my decision. 2 days of daily isn't grind to be honest so I think I'll be taking all of the score. Thank you
---
Until they increase the build limit, I don't know if I'm getting anything else from the atoms shop. I've already got a bunch of camp stuff I can't build because the build limit is so, well, limited.   
---
And I'm not really feeling the mothman stuff anyways, I like to build more modern looking camps. The backpack looks cool, though.
---
PC
---
No, not false advertising, since the description of the item explicitly says what’s in it.
---
Yeah I kept doing them for the caps and the reputation at first and then I found out that it would be giving me treasury notes. So I didn't want to lose a faction by taking all the gold from vault 79.
---
Nooo,  I have a spare instigating explosive pipe revolver rifle with no 3rd star I was going to give you. Unfortunate. Ps4 :/
---
He’s got the raider persona down for sure.
---
And the bulk scrap!
---
What wolvlob said ⬆️
---
Just in case: you get gold bullion via treasury notes by farming events and the three wastelander dailies. You can trade treasury notes for 200 gold each day and also buy 600 gold from a NPC on the Wayward each week for 6000 caps.
---
Huh, so all my Vampire stuff, in your opinion, is useless?
---
I'll admit I have to work hard, one shot kills are rare as unicorn horns, and even with Vampire guns and knives I still occasionally have to spam the stimpacks in a good fight. But even like this I enjoy the game. Not the slightest bit interested in Bloodied or Junkie builds, but that's a personal preference.
---
Most don't weigh more than 30 even with mods. And for full health builds idk, I like luck of the draw but I have 15 luck so I use quite a few.
---
Intelligence or deviance?
---
Yeah, I bought the raider bundle thinking you'd get the cool eye patch - nope, not included. But what do you do? Even if reddit's Bethesda account says sorry, I doubt that they're going to stop doing this practice of bait and switch.
---
The bullion sales usually reset on Saturday at 8:00pm Eastern Time on Saturdays.  I usually buy mine on Saturday night or Sunday.  This past Saturday night, I was not able to buy from him.  I tried traveling away then coming back, closing and reentering the game, hard shut down of my Xbox, etc., but nothing seemed to work.  On a "whim", I thought to look at my gold bullion and saw that I had 4,400 gold bullion, which would put me very close to the 5,000 gold bullion maximum, if I bought 500 more.  I decided to go to the vault and buy a couple of items for gold bullion, which I planned to buy at some point, anyway.  As soon as I spent most of my gold, I fast traveled back to the Wayward, and "VOILA!" I was suddenly able to buy gold from him.  At first I was confused that I only had 4,400, which would have put me at 4,900 (still below the cap) and could not buy gold bullion, but then I remembered that I also have a few hundred gold bullion worth of Treasure Notes I cannot trade in, because of the daily cap of 200 gold bullion exchange, which I normally exceed from doing quests and events.
---
This is purely a THEORY, but just check to see how much gold bullion you have, plus how much gold bullion worth of Treasury Notes you have.  If you currently have at least 4,500 worth of gold bullion and Treasury Notes combined, then try buying some items for gold bullion, to bring your total below 4,500, then go back and see if you can buy gold bullion at the Wayward.  That is what "seemed like" worked for me a few nights ago, so I am genuinely interested to see if others have the same issue and outcome.
---
Me too. I asked around. It seems the skulls and vines are just set dec unless it’s hiding in patch 20
---
I think they should intregrate fallout shelter for shits and giggles. You recruit settlers to your vault. They can die/breed, you can send them out to scavenge, you upgrade them with stats/armor/weapons. Periodic wave based fights or vault on vault fight simulators lol.
---
Unfortunately not because each Atom shop item has a description that is accurate despite the pictures being sneaky.
---
However, what do you think about new Atom Shop items being discounted on day one?
---
Thank you that's actually very helpful. The problem with events is that most players on the servers I spawn in don't actually participate in them so doing them solo always ends in my death
---
That’s not bait and switch
---
Bait and switch is when you say “hey, we are having a sale on this thing” and then not have that thing when people come in and instead try to get them to buy an inferior product. At no point in the description of the item or the store say “hey we’ll have this eye patch” and then not have it.
---
Pictures do not count as bait and switch
---
Why not both? Lol
---
Mystery
---
I made a mod for fallout 4 that does this. You can’t quite swing but it grapples all right
---
Love this bundle. I love gothic aesthetics &amp; etc.. only thing that sucks is you can place only one smoke machine down in a camp. Idk why it couldn't be 5.
---
Also I see dead overgrown vines on the walls for the wall paper. I had a feeling that it wouldn't be a part of it, but it would be amazing to place those vines on stuff,kinda like the tree set and bushes.
---
I did of course. Just giving a shout out to a guy who was helpful
---
This is where I stroll in with a stealth archer build and no problems... but bows aren't viable right?
---
*Peanut butter and JAAAAAAMM*
---
...The fuck is wrong with you, Phil?
---
Quality is a subjective term. Quite a bit has been added IMO. Everyone is entitled to their opinions so you don’t need to like it just because I or others do. I’m sure there is junk you like that I don’t. A few new features that I think have fundamentally changed the game that have been added:
---
Player vending
---
Legendary purveyor/legendary scrapping
---
Backpacks and related mods
---
Faction system
---
Public events
---
Upcoming public teams
---
Allies
---
Other things added that I consider quality DLC:
---
Wastelanders main quests
---
Wastelanders side quests
---
New events like project paradise, encrypted
---
New weapons like the bow, new Gaus weapons, sheepsquatch weapons
---
Van lowe quest line
---
Sheepsquatch side quests
---
Brewing and the nukashine quest
---
I personally really like the burrows as well
---
Add all that up and you have some quality DLC IMO that they would have charged for in previous titles. It may have been released over time but there is some good stuff in there (again IMO). If you don’t like it, well maybe this game just isn’t for you?
---
I'll love to look at it, do you have a link?
---
Ohhh that makes sense now, thanks for your input 👍🏻
---
Spoken like a true leader.... Preston? Is that you.
---
that's a great opinion you got there. I'd beg to differ when outfits ambiguously imply they're sold together
---
Plenty of games have season pass content paywalled. Many mobile games allow you to get to a certain level before asking more money. This clearly isn’t a mobile game but gets compared them frequently here. 
---
Again, why the name calling? I asked a question and you call me ignorant for asking a question. Learn how to have a civil conversation. It sounds like you don’t even play the game. I’m done feeding the troll. Goodnight. God bless.
---
"Here, Ward, your stolen medical scanner. On the house."
---
Ward: "Thank you, thats really kind".
---
Next day, "I'm keeping my eye on you".
---
Biggest wanker in the game
---
My theory: Ward is actually an advance BOS scout in Appalachia. The "vital equipment" has never been lost or stolen. You are unwittingly collecting pre-war equipment for the BOS who will soon establish in Appalachia!!!
---
The key to rubber farming is to plant it deep.
---
Bethesda knows this
---
This page gives a detailed explanation of looting, numbers (180 for world items and 60 items for containers), and places to find specific items to loot.

Launched my first the other day, though admittedly did it on a private server cos I was paranoid about people glitching in there and launching before me cos I thought I'd take a while. Was really surprised at how easy it was compared to posts I've saw of people having trouble. Looking forward to doing it again on public and starting sbq.
---
It’s a personal one and part of a bigger thing that was a big WIP. 
---
I’ll unarchive it and get it (the grappler portion) up on nexus one of these days.
---
I miss having logic gates

https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10

Here you go OP https://help.bethesda.net/app/home/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNTkyMzUwNDI3L2dlbi8xNTkyMzUwNDI3L3NpZC9mVVVpcXpHd0dlVVlERG1zZnpjcDRXcWxGNmZ0JTdFU3FRcTg1cXhoTDVYN3VOTm8lN0ViSnFoT1lMemRxWEFWcUNDMHEya1A5SlVUU2F1SG1mWnRFbW9vV01TaG93YkhLRVklN0VteW9pYjB1RV9hSklvZWFtNkJkdUhNTGclMjElMjE%3D
---
I mean it tells you what it comes with
---
Don’t need a bitch be what a bitch needs
---
Lmao wow. It's like they're trying to piss someone off with that pack. So tiny!
---
Edit: I think the idea is to keep it hidden in nuclear winter. That way people can't loot the useful stuff you have to drop. Still I think it should be noted about it's size.
---
Also I'm not sure that's the official reason it's so small. It just came to mind after thinking for a second.
---
I go full Chinese stealth suit, sneak 3, escape artist and The Fixer. They never see me. On the off chance I get discovered all I have to do is stand up and squat back down and they lose sight of me.
---
Saying its a PITA is putting it lightly.  I did it once, that was enough. Just think though its a few dedicated individuals that go through that every week to post the codes for us on NukaCrypt, god help us if they decide to stop.
---
I've only been playing last couple of months, but the impression I get is that it was supposed to be a player hub, where people congregate and shop etc. Kinda like a village in an mmo. Makes sense there's a space with lots of crafting tables available.
---
It’s not an opinion, it’s the legal definition of bait and switch.  The item has a clear description of what’s being included.
---
So glad i got a refund on the water wheel when it is still not fixed. (got the entire bundle atom amount refunded and kept all the items).
---
You can just put two frames down in one place
---
They explicitly tell you what they're selling. It's not even in small print so you can't even use that excuse.
---
Correct, the diminishing returns mean that the difference in damage taken between say t65 and x01 is negligible.
---
Some poison resistance would be nice since right now PA is very vulnerable to it. I'd love to see them add full set perks to all sets of power armors similar to stranger heart's thing or excavator's extra carry capacity.
---
Outside the mines are terminals that you turn in the coins for rewards, junk chems etc... Just doing a couple of lode barings will give you over 100 coins, each coin, I believe, weighs ~0.1lb, so it adds up.
---
I thought of a couple of others to add to the list:
---
**Raider Joes**: Help Joe by repairing the crops and tractor in Crater’s farm field. Watch out for the scorched that are attracted by the sound of the farm equipment!
---
**Ward and Seek**: Ward keeps losing stuff and the rest of Foundation likes to make fun of him for it. Hide items around Foundation before Ward can find them all.
---
I can suspend my belief to shoot right handed though. I really can. Bugs me so bad.
---
Ugh I wanted to report the "backpack falling off after death" but that's not an option even after you go through their bullshit option tree. Oh well. Guess I'll deal with it til it gets annoying enough to make me quit the game.
---
Not even remotely false advertising.
---
That like complaining about a car commercial for false advertising because you don't also get the phone that demonstrates the in-car apps, the drink that went into the beverage holder or the attractive woman that was driving in the car.
---
That's what I hoped it would be.
---
Before we had player vending I had the idea that we could have rented a store for an hour and it would have displayed on the map as somebody with items to sell. 
---
But player vending is better!
---
I'd like to see maybe some more classes in the artisan room which is the one with all the benches in.
---
You are on a sub for a video game.  You are having a discussion that could be had about any corporation in at least america.  Go make a real change in the world go boycott starbucks or something.  You dont even play the game but here you are on your soap box about the evil video game companies.  I wish I had the time you people do.
---
As a tip all silos have a weight room, Charleston FD, one of the tower-mansions, that gym in flatwoods.... seems like I’m forgetting one or two.
---
totally forgot i posted this. Yeah, junkyards.
---
Yes they nerfed it after Halloween. 
---
You could also use it in NW lol 
---
tho players would see through it figuratively and literally
---
Sounds like a good problem to have!! 
---
Eerily similar to my "bug" with Ward and always having his stolen property.  Lol
---
Exactly this. Normal assaultrons are easy. Dominators - best way is to fight stealth with stealth. They are definitely the hardest enemy in the game though.
---
It will probably be our next week. Again.
---
Explosive bait.
---
Crap then unfortunately
---
Anyone know what items are needed to craft the mothman jetpack or is just a mod?
---
??
---
Check NukaCrypt/solved
---
They usually have them within a couple hours of reset.
---
Robotics Expert lvl 3 is your friend lol
---
Sounds like a Rust player.
---
Not sure if this is the case but that new red rocket skin said it was for all PAs.  If it didn’t work on 65, then you could call it false advertising.  They’ve done plenty of just plain dumb stuff with atom shop, but I don’t believe this current stuff is false advertising.
---
Delete this comment, now, very quietly. ... (Don’t complain about free XP and rewards)
---
Oh absolutely. I'm terrified of the damned things even when I'm invisible. It's a blast sneaking through the silos turning the turrets against the robots.
---
This video might help ....
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGQ0xvqT-0)
---
Not a bug. You have to craft it and you need to be able to craft the corresponding jet pack for the power armor you want to use it on.
---
I'm joking.
---
Arrrgghh. I’ve been wanting that glow in the dark map. And it’s leaving before my 1st refresh hits.
---
if someone is on your team they can add to your camp, they are just not allowed to store/delete items (cant move them either iirc)
---
edit: not sure about "in" the wall part, unless they did the old double-wall bug
---
Had to happen while they were partied with you at some point, otherwise they can't do anything to your camp.
---
If you are on a team, then any team member is able  modify your camp.
---
ah I remember the first time I went to Watoga, getting chased by 3 assaultrons at the same time was really fun
---
Did my first nuke the other day (level 114 but put it off for ages). Was really surprised at how easy it was, considering I always read about peoples difficulties - why I put it off. Chinese stealth suit cheeses it. Didn't even have any lockpick or hacking perks. Got spotted twice because there was turrets I didn't spot in vats that caught me when I used a terminal (annoying it stands you up and takes you out of stealth to use a terminal, is it impossible to use a terminal while crouching?)
---
Also with the sound of their laser charging and the time it takes it might be something THAT powerful.
---
I bought it and the items were too scary at night and took them down lol. I still dig the smoke machine.
---
Karma whore
---
I scrap, script and drop hundreds of armor pieces a day. These fools can't even get a full set of matching armor. Why would I want to help any of theses fools. Annoying to say the least.
---
It's due to steam maintenance today. Issue every Tuesday around this time, just have to wait it out or use the bethesda client to play.
---
“All these new comers make me nervous”
---
Skins
---
That’s the thing I know every jet pack mod and I can’t put it on my T-51
---
It's not bad it's just annoying I wish the game would just actually work for once
---
Teammates can build in your camp.
---
LOL wut?   
---
Removed: Rule 10.... No rules...  
---
All i need is damn 3 Stimpak diffusers... No one sells...
---
Might be. Let's hope for the best.
---
Thank you very much for the info, i appreciate it.
---
We desperately need a new endgame boss challenge. I'm doing 4 nukes a day on sbq and it's getting tiresome. Like you I've hit the 200s and I'm running out of things to do. I basically do encryptid, silo and sbq. And then repeat.
---
It's not a skin that you can place on an existing T-51 piece. You have to craft a whole new jet pack.
---
Don’t worry. The Enclave will hunt you down....
---
There are mods on PC doing literally some of the above. I prefer glowing ones though for gut piles etc.
---
It looks good. The eyes glow. Works on strangler heart too
---
So I literally have to remake it.... that’s such a waste
---
No, the only light it comes with is the desk lamp as per the item description. The candles I believe can be purchased at the whitesprings though. IIRC
---
And there's nothing wrong with that? You pay for additional quality (usually) content that has (usually) been made after the games in a finished state. That's a great and perfect business model and why it has existed since the dawn of gaming. You get what you pay for and know first you're getting a finished product. And if your game can at all be compared to a mobile game then that's a bad thing? Mobile gaming is such a joke because all the games are literal monetization traps or casino's lol 
---
Sorry but where in the English language is "ignorant" an insult???? Do you know what it means? 
---
Ignorant: Lacking knowledge or awareness
---
Based upon everything you've said you're clearly lacking knowledge about Bethesda's monetization history and gaming industry. Hence you're somewhat ignorant on those topics. That's no more insulting than if you called me ignorant when discussing say science which I don't know a lot about. What other word do you want me to use? I was trying to avoid causing offence but if you want I guess I'll use ACTUAL insulting language such as stupid or dumb?? 
---
I've been a gamer for 20 years and I do a lot of extra research into the industry, the companies, the market, monetization methods etc etc. To me learning about all of it is extremely enjoyable not to mention beneficial as a game player myself. I also have 4 friends who work for different game developers of different levels in the industry. Heck I even know a lot about the insane tax cuts big AAA publishers get or just how ridiculously overpaid some of their CEO's are. 
---
I know my stuff so forgive me for calling someone who, at least based purely upon what he's said, knows a lot less than me on the subject "ignorant". If that basic English language word is insulting then I'm sorry I don't know what to tell you? EVERYONE is ignorant about lots of stuff unless you know literally everything there is to know in the world? Really rich that you accuse me of not knowing how to have a civil conversation lol. 
---
Oh and yeah I don't play the game right now, got to level 94 after Wastelanders and decided there are far better games that reward my time out there I should be playing instead. Doesn't mean I can't check out the subreddit or participate in discussion about it thanks? Or is this a space where you're only allowed if you're a die hard fan of the game?
---
Does the backpack give extra storage and if so how much? Does the jetpack benefit over my existing X0? Just started playing again after over a year break and am sitting on 4k atoms I earned through gameplay.
---
No. The bundles say what is included. Having other items in the photos is not false advertising.
---
I've spent quite some time optimizing a heavy weapons power armor build, so bear with me for this long post. 
---
Strength: I don't see much point in Bear Arms unless you want to carry multiple weapons and Blocker is not useful against most non-player enemies since their damage is barely enough to get through the resistance given by power armor, only exceptions might be the SBQ itself, but you shouldn't be tanking her melee attacks anyway. Lock and Load is definitely a must for heavy weapons, reloading without and Speed Demon will make your life really hard. People like Bandolier but I don't really see the point, I'd much rather take Travelling Pharmacy so I can keep tons of chems on me at all times.
---
Perception: you don't need any of these perks, you can equip lockpicking whenever you need it so there is no point in keeping it on at all times. Butcher's Bounty is really not that useful too. I would swap these for Glow Sight since glowing enemies are extremely prevalent in the late game and Grenadier if you get any weapons with the explosive legendary effect.
---
Endurance: Lifegiver is not worth it to be honest, even more so in the case of builds that use power armor since you'll barely take damage from most enemies, what I would recommend is Fireproof since explosives and fire are one of the few things (outside of PvP) that might actually hurt you and, once again, its absolutely necessary if you ever get a weapon with the explosive legendary effect. 
---
Charisma: Travel Agent is another perk I see absolutely no point in keeping on, you can just slot it whenever you're going to fast travel and even then I don't see a reason to, traveling across the map might cost you a max of 60 caps and, if you have a well-placed camp and remember that you can fast travel to Vault 76 for free you will barely spend caps fast traveling. Furthermore, if you're playing for yourself there is absolutely no reason to not have Lone Wanderer on, its just too bloody good. Tenderizer is also a must for maximum damage output, since the perk is applied after all others, so it actually drastically increases your damage when stacked with all other damaging perks.
---
Intelligence: Batteries Included and Portable Power are really only useful if you're using Gatling Laser, in which case I'd consider them brilliant perks, otherwise they are almost useless. The power armor itself does not consume fusion cores that much. Power Patcher is another perk I'd say you only need whenever you're going to use it, you don't need to keep it on at all times, and, if you use Fix It Good to repair your power armor as you should, you'll probably only have to repair your PA like once a week. I'd say the same for Chemist. Stabilized is a must so keep that, maybe add Nerd Rage if you get a bloodied weapon or Demolitions Expert if you get a heavy weapon with explosive effect. 
---
Agility: You won't be using VATS or sprint much, so both of these I don't see the point. What I do see the point is Adrenaline, it will increase your damage insanely. 
---
Luck: If you want to go for mutations then you NEED Level 2 Starched Genes, really. If you don't have Starched Genes there is no point in getting Class Freak. Can Do! and Cap Collector frankly I don't see the point either. You should REALLY get One Gun Army, stagger chance and a chance to cripple is huge when facing hordes of enemies like ghouls and Scorched, which you will in the late game. 
---
Here is my Bloodied Heavy Gunner build if you want some reference:  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f437b5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sx2pe2eh2cu2ip2ib4ir2a04c72lu2lt2ls2l71pq0&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Badass](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f437b5b&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sx2pe2eh2cu2ip2ib4ir2a04c72lu2lt2ls2l71pq0&amp;n=Bloodied%20Heavy%20Badass). It's meant to be used alongside either a bloodied explosive weapon or a Gauss Minigun. I can solo the SBQ with this, the damage is insane and it's also pretty tanky. 
---
Whenever I'm running with an Ultracite Gatling Laser I usually swap Demo Expert for a Level 2 Batteries Included and Level 3 Portable Power since both apply to the Ultracite Gatling Laser. If I'm running a non-Bloodied weapon the only perk I usually take off is Nerd Rage! for Level 3 Gunsmith.
---
What new item is being discounted?
---
Instanced camps are coming likely won't see any change until then.
---
Hopefully being instanced we will get more space
---
Its called being (perpetually) over-encumbered
---
This is a cool thing to do. Venders were down when I started so I know what it’s like to be desperately seeking bobby-pins or canned food or ammo. Sometimes if I see someone fresh coming out of the vault I will go and give them some basics. My only pet peeves are jacked up prices, vendors that are hard to find and camps built on the side of a mountain where you can fall to your death if they log out or you spawn in the wrong spot. TBH though it’s all in fun. Some people just gotta lighten up. Just remember 90% of plans are already owned by 90% of players. Just sell the cool ones. UBU
---
Screen capture? Hard to imagine how this is even doable as you described.
---
lol really... Listen. If you were to boast your apex skills you should be boasting your rank, not some stupid badges. You do realize there's mmr in apex right? You come up with a new account and play with scrubs you get 4k 20 in first 5 rounds jeez
---
I honestly question myself every day.
---
Would be kind of fun.  Free leather and gears.

I’m doing OK as a vampire melee.....

Got me to the far side of 200, anyway :)
---
Wait no way the eyes glow? That's awesome
---
&gt; e
---
Oh! Cool. Awesome to know! Thank you! (:
---
Mind blown.
---
That's not the right way to fix things. What you suggest is either a workaround or is easily fixed with available options (pacifist mode?). They have to FIX clipping issues and ash/goo piles for her, not invent some special treatment for her loot.
---
Baaaaaaaaahhhhhhmmmmm
---
It’s likely the collectors edition pipboy for Fallout 4. It’s not that bad overall and looks nice on a shelf. It can only fit some of the older phones as it was made in 2016, though
---
Cause I was one of the hardcore pvpers. I played with them, I seen it all I know it all. Don't act blind eyed. Hackers everywhere. Aimbots don't even count as hacks for them
---
Yea the flashlight is the eyes, like the XO1
---
Thanks for keeping it civil. What did I say to upset you?
---
Please assume the position
---
Get a rank of butcher's bounty, cook your mirelurk, glowing meat etc.  Get Through Killer so you don't have to waste time going to sell more than once per day.  Do events.  Get a vampire weapon so you don't need to use stimpacks and sell those.
---
f you're desperate then the spacesuits in Crater sell for a lot and there is a fusion core there with no fighting.  The temple thing near it where Guided Meditation is has just an absurd amount of stuff in it including lead, plastic, fusion cores etc. with very few ghouls needed to kill.
---
Eastern regional pen
---
Says the person who based their argument on feelings. News flash: Facts don't care about your feelings. Like the fact that in 2016 Virginia banned "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Huck Finn" from the school system. (HINT! This was done by the same people who now call for the removal of statues.) But go ahead and just keep going on with your daily npc programming form the likes of CNN and ilk.
---
Ehhh larping is never easy. You just have to keep in character, or find a group that's into that
---
Oh gotcha very nice
---
When you fast travel, you tend to spawn enemies.  Just show up to the enemy CAMP and don't fight them.
---
Cool, love the childish insults. Continue to believe whatever Fox news shoves down your throat.
---
Yeah... duped weapons. While 80% of pvpers own hacked weapons that fire mini nukes at 2k rpm.
---
What's that? Someone's part of Enslave? *puts on Free States helmet and FS eye patch* not on my pip-boy you won't
---
Yeah, once you get to the point where the only content is things like SBQ and farming better gear, you have no use for Caps, so you fill Out having all the plans.
---
Ugg noobs....
---
She should go see John Redcorn about those headaches
---
....? I'm on a sub about a product that does certain things I personally disagree with and I'm completely within my right to have a discussion about that?? Exactly why am I not?? Yeah lots of companies outside of the gaming industry are shit? No kidding? That means I shouldn't talk about it period?
---
And thanks but I don't ever go to starbucks? Not sure what that has to do with anything? We have very little power to do much about corporate greed apart from discuss and be vocal about it. 
---
Oh and I recently put the game down after hitting 97 after Wastelanders so not sure what that has to do with anything?
---
I'm sorry do you work for Bethesda or something? Why are you trying so hard to defend them?
---
My guy those weapons are only on pc and PC is only like 10% of the pvp community
---
Good guys need bad guys...you don’t exist without us
---
lol Read that as "fleetwood Mac encounter", ignore me, carry on...
---
Yea...
