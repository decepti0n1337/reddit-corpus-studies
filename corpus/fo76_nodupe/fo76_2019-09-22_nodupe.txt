I was trying to make a one headed cow

---
I‚Äôve seen the sheepsquatch plushie already
---
Not really. Just about any bloodied heavy weapon (except grenade launcher, missile launcher, or fat man), automatic rifle, or shotgun is still good. Melee weapons too, but you need 40% power attack damage bonus to be super effective. 
---
If you can get one with explosive effect or weightless, that's just a bonus. Even 1 star bloodied weapons can be powerful.
---
I love meat week. Not to actually participate, but to go AFK on the drums while at work or asleep. It‚Äôs a great way to get a ton of extra scrip (from shit legendaries), bullion from treasury notes, and caps from selling event plans in your vendor. I‚Äôll AFK it when I can‚Äôt play, and just do something different when I do get on
---
I got you friend
---
Thanks kindly for the headsup! I've been eating my squirrel WITHOUT soup!
---
Oh shit thanks. Let me know you're GT and I'll join you
---
Lol
---
I just started with the gamepass release, but with how abundant radaway is in the world and from easier events it would be cool to see more radstorms. Haven't seen one yet, and only saw regular rain one time
---
I will, thanks
---
Same! I'm no good without vats a lot of the time, which makes it difficult to kill a player in NW
---
Guess I could switch a few around
---
Sorry, I should have been more specific. I was speaking specifically about PA skins.
---
I don't even understand why so many people want it. It looks like some kind of hoaky G.I. Joe design.
---
Final boss gives a legendary?
---
Oh cool, definitely want to post about this as much as possible so it gets patched ASAP.
---
The only time I've used them in two years was for Line in the Sand before they fixed it.
---

---
RIP Line in the Sand :(
---
Well, hope the fix it soon, its not that important but its annoying. Imagine getting to rank 60 and going through all the ranks everytime you complete a challenge...
---
Sure I‚Äôll try them out but can I just switch commando and rifleman cards
---
it is not a naturally occurring BE .50cal, but a less than legit version thereof; either keep it and use it sparingly and not in an assholish manner and you will likely be fine or trade it off to someone for a legit version; many would like to get a hold of such a weapon and would kit you out for it
---
It‚Äôs not just about min maxing but also simply comparing weapons we have or perk combinations
---
Dang it ! Good Luck in you adventures then ! üòä
---
Yup, it was on auto renewal with Microsoft, but on the bethesda page it showed that I wasnt on it.
---
That would be cool. I know sometimes the NPCs will acknowledge certain pieces of gear equipped sometimes. I've heard Raider NPCs get worried about my sledgehammer in particular.
---
Crater is not too far from the observatory, is not like you have to pay 100 caps to get there, I dont get it.
---
Each int point is another 2% xp which is what everyone wants right now its more important that -10 or 15 carry weight that can he made up with a number or meats,  bramine radstag or pizza rolls.
---
There's always one üòÖ... thanks for the link, I'll be sure to add that to my round of questions next zoom quiz.
---
RIP your son
---
I just checked and yeah it was with Microsoft
---
‚ÄúThe base game story is non existent‚Äù
---
No, it‚Äôs definitely there, you were just too lazy to read the terminals and listen to the holotapes
---
If Micosoft looked at what makes FO76 money, it would be the 1st subs and CAMP whales buying CAMP bundles. MS should make CAMP budgets the first thing to get an increase. Spend resources there, and you'll offset the cost. 
---
The game is essentially free to play with MS game pass and the only revenue is from the Atom store and FO 1st. Dupers make more money than BGS selling in game assets.
---
They are not. 
---
If somebody has a mutation that is useful to him it's a guarantee he's using the easy 1 point card to boost it. If somebody doesn't have a mutation, or has a mutation he wants to get rid off, that perk card is useless.
---
Im online now. My friend wont play today. He's self employed and had to do over Time. Now his gf demands some attention üòÇ  
---
Ah well. 
---
Wanna Run some daily ops ?
---
Who gives a shit? They died, it‚Äôs part of the game, they need to deal with it. Either don‚Äôt die or store it right away. I‚Äôm not gonna back off on something that benefits me because another player made a mistake
---
Decent, not anything too tempting, but I guess nothing will be until we get PA displays
---
chems and armor bonuses don't nor does +5 legendary but magnetic personality did allow my friend to share lvl 5 adrenaline with his party sunday as we were running with him and he only has 9 charisma
---
So what do you mean? In idiot terms lol. Do you think they will supply PS4,PS5 ect. I hope it is but nobody really knows rn.
---
Well the mountains did block a huge bit but you are right
---
Raiders are 10x better than commies
---
Yeah
---
Yea, I tried that. I even logged out while my guy was holding them, then logged back in and tried to assign them to the displays and nada
---
I suppose it's 3 separate rolls with different success chances.
---
The chance to get 3 rewards is probably around 0.25%. üôÑ
---
Such an awesome weapon. My first character was dressed up as an oldschool pirate and used all black powder weapons and a gatling gun...was so much fun to play.   
---
Right up until it just become impossible to do events with him and I had to modernize.
---
You as well. Keep being awesome to newbies
---
As someone who uses grenades, I like my grenade drops. The frags make it easier to craft the MIRV ones I use.
---
This. If I have to do all those things, then, I wasn't really smart to begin with. 
---
5 int + unyielding bonuses + casual + maybe an occasional canned stew or cranberry juice. I am around 20-25 and that's decent enough.
---
Use perks that boost damage. Don't use perks that reduce the weight of your stuff.
---
Mountains ain't THAT high here. :D
---
I can see tha being a thing.
---
The XP on Primal Cuts is insane.  I gained a level in three, and I‚Äôm over 500.
---
I‚Äôm also walking out with 2-5 legendaries each, but it may be a hot server.
---
If you die after earle dies, you get teleported outside the mine and will receive the event rewards minus the loot from earle himself.
---
I think everyone's pointed it out, but I'll also add to the, 'Scorched types are extremely aggressive to your stuff's comments. Unfortunately there isn't much you can do other than....putting it down, or putting up with it, unfortunately.
---
Well I mean the actual new stuff not the recycled ones...
---
Also the rustic cabin stuff fits Appalachia very well wether or not in Fallout universe.
---
And I also don‚Äôt think that the spec ops outfit exactly fit fallout universe either, but that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
how do you manage disappearing legandary corpses?

This is a stupid joke, I'm trying to help people here
---
I'm genuinely surprised you've been getting downvoted, given that this subreddit has a bad habit of bending over backwards for bethesda, as well as the fact that your explanation is reasonably sound.
---
Like, it shouldn't be a hard concept to understand that our community managers aren't just taking out complaints, printing them out, and then wiping their asses with them. Nor are our devs just rubbing their hands, scheming up ways to make the game run worse.
---
The issue with communication most likely has an internal source that outranks both of these positions. Blaming our CMs and the devs doesn't do anything but make them hate their jobs.
---
For anyone who hasn't worked in any field like this or done any QA testing, chances are what's happening is the complaints are heard, the CMs tell the community so there's accountability, they report it to devs who put it into a log with a list descending from "crucial needs" to "quality of life's", and then some goober in a fucking suit kicks the desktop.
---
The CMs wouldn't bother fucking replying if there weren't intentions to get everything in motion, the issue in such a hypothetical is purely on the interior member in the suit and the lack of creative freedom for the team's other members
---
I even kind of disagree with you and still blame our CMs a bit, because technically their job is to keep the community appeased and keep PR high but they kinda suck at it, but even with me disagreeing I still see your point
---
This. If you enjoy playing the game, 177 is good.
---
My cow dies whenever I leave. 
---
Add razorgrain 
---
new cow  
---
but like a  new goldfish it‚Äôs not the same
---
It does, if you put the fastest mod you can actually shot three time before reloading.  
---
I love that weapon, i have a quad and it wrecks everything cause it's so fast!!
---
I didn't realize they are rare because I got two in a row when they first released the event. I vended my extra for like 7 caps. Kicking myself now.
---
[deleted]
---
I‚Äôd really like to know what this shotty is and your perks. I tried several gauss shotty (B, TS, J) and none could visibly take a chunk on his hp bar.
---
Welp, guess I got to get me a cheap 2 star Heavy Weapon with Explosive for this then.
---
&gt;Save
---
It just resets when you log back in :(
---
Not entirely, no. But you can bet it just may save your ass in a fight lol
---
Nice video.  I‚Äôll add Lucky Hole Mine and Thunder Mt to my Cranberry Bog loop :)
---
Yes and I understand that. Was just a rare find too me .
---
It sucks it was switched to scorched but I‚Äôll try one method someone mentioned to try and then if it doesn‚Äôt work, he‚Äôs gotta go lol
---
An insult to the Proletariat cause. There shall be consequences.
---
your vending machine prices are too high
---
You can't have two rank 3 cards, as an example. Just rank 1's stack.
---
Not a new bug.  A bug people post about repeatedly every single day because no one knows how to use search.
---
True, but you asked what game. Not what FALLOUT game haha. Anyways, what I mean is that DPS is king. Without any doubt. Defense doesnt matter. Sneak doesnt matter. Looting doesnt matter. 
---
Defense wont save you if you dont kill the enemy, which is fine. Sneak doesnt matter, because you cant sneak to complete objectives. People that use sneak use it to boost damage. Looting doesnt matter, because in FO76 looting is mostly useless aside the 3 or 4 things needed to craft ammo, and you cant get good equipment by looting. These things you could use in other Fallouts, but not in 76. However, many people still think that a non-combat build is perfectly viable, and enjoyable, as if you were combat focused, and it clearly is not. Is viable somewhat, but it requires an extensive usage of resources, care and overall frustration with the game.
---
And it doesnt need to be that way. DPS should be king, but using non-combat builds should be enjoyable and perfectly viable. You should not be recommended to do a Combat build for every gameplay style you want. You should have some kind of balance between combat focused (making combat EASY) and non combat builds (making combat hard, but outright frustrating). 
---
Funny thing is that a lot of people complaining about endgame stuff and easy games in general, are the ones that only use min-maxing combat optimized stuff. And guess what? The point of that build is making things easy! If someone with that build struggles, then someone without that build cant play the game. And with every step that FO76 has taken until now, we are moving towards that DPS-build or frustration-build
---
R91 doesn't have storefronts, so it's not coming for a long while if at all.
---
Same as my GT
---
Not for a rifleman, I have tested it a lot, with different bows and weapons. You get better results keeping the Unyielding set but replacing the weapon.
---
For a commando, sure.
---
Doin one more op and I‚Äôll switch back to my other toon and give you it
---
Quite high currently, but will soon be quite common. Trade while it's hot.
---
Didn't you just comment on another post commending this other guy for getting the same outfit?
---
How about for those lovingly admiring Phil Spencer‚Äôs portrait ?
---
Hmmmm, what's it worth tho? Cause I dislike it, deosmt go with my reclaimed gas mask
---
But he‚Äôs a dick
---
I think all next gen games will be MS(PC)/Xbox exclusive, with switch ports no, PS5.   
---
This new generation of systems is rushed by both sides so sales will slump early post pre-order the real system war will take place once system exclusives start rolling out.    
---
Take that as my opinion based on rumors from friends that still work for microsoft, though the rumor a MS playstore is still going strong after a year so this whole buyout seems to be inline with what I had been hearing.  The big question is will they be timed exclusives or pure.
---
To go over your list.
---
1: No storefronts
---
2: No storefronts, no entitlement records, doesn't exist atm
---
3: Would have to check if it has storefronts, but likely doesn't.
---
4: Yeah idk either
---
5: No storefronts.
---
6: No storefronts.
---
Most of these things aren't up for release because they can't be released.
---
No
---

---
Turn on pacifist mode. Then the only way it can die is npc enemies.
---
Or, you know, legit new players who launched their first nuke and need the flux.
---
Don't jump right into a PA build. Focus on quality of life stuff early on. Ammo is going to be scarce, so keep a weapon for every ammo type if you can. Perks which reduce costs for repairs or degredation might be helpful as well. Once you've got your bases covered, specialize in a weapon type. I'd recommend just using the 1 star versions initially, as they give you the most bang for your buck perk-wise.
---
Also, the community is friendly as fuck. Give a higher level a wave and they might throw you some gear.
---
4 what?
---
I have only ever requested two refunds. After the second time, they let me know my refund was applied but "to be careful with future purchases because this option may not always be available." It seemed so ominous and mildly threatening lol now I'm nervous to request a refund if something were to go wrong. I guess that was their intention though. Have you ever been told something like that?
---
Maybe , hopefully still some around at cheap prices  . Crafting the ammo is a grind as well .  Time for me to put the plasma rifle on the wall maybe .
---
Unlike Rex, he was teleported to Mothership Zeta.
---
Minigun isn‚Äôt a good ammo farming tool, i barely recovered the ammo I used. .45 is ok if your gun put out good damage. Heavy hitters like Gatling and auto grenade launchers are winners.
---
Whatever the person is willing to give tbh, me 5000 caps max, but some impatient souls are giving up awesome legendary weapons.
---
I do find them ocassionally near the wayward and near the yellow building in the Town where Faschnat is at..
---
I've noticed something kind of similar in melee I think. I'll hit an enemy, and it'll do like the base damage of the weapon, but if I stand near the enemy for a few seconds, it'll spontaneously die as if the game realized that it was supposed to modify the damage. Super weird.
---
Thank you! So far I have been doing just that, using whatever weapon I have the ammo for or using some melee which I enjoy as well! Still getting used to the perk system haha
---
My instigating Lever replaced my Bloodied lever and I am a rifleman again. 
---
My vampire tesla replaced my bloodied fixer.
---
My antiarmor SMG replaced my bloodied SMG. 
---
So, yes. And DOUBLE yes at daily ops.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what U want tbh lol. I sneaked and completed a few of the missions, was a long time back tho level 302 now. There‚Äôs nothing my build can‚Äôt do. It sneaks where sneak is viable. I can unlock everything. I can kill. I can loot and u do....rarely....get decent stuff from drops. Which part of the game do u want changing or do I want entire swaths of the game changed to incorporate more sneak and conversation/puzzle type elements?
---
Username checks out
---
These are often dead and looted, unfortunately. Don't forget to plant some tatos too.
---
Well its not like we ever really need to go there.
---
Imma get a legacy for it
---
I think they should release on all platforms. Imo it would be a stuiped business decision to alienate half of the playerbase. People say they didn't spend the money to get the same revenue but if they design games better more people will play. They will play the game because it's by a AAA title and Microsoft.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Ok I think I found you. GT is same as on here minus the underscore
---
[removed]
---
You miss out on the weapon racks then.
---
Do you have a headset? It‚Äôs easier if you just add me and we can talk. Like most mmorpgs there‚Äôs quite a bit to learn. Honestly the most meta build is a power armor heavy gun build. It‚Äôs entirely possible to run other end game builds IF you get the right legendary weapon to run it. And then it‚Äôs still more challenging. My user id if you want is Hellstorm79.
---
I wait till I finish my OP before I loot Corpses/paper bags. You get 5 minutes before the game kicks you back out. Just dont press the Options button. (PS4)
---
I use  ultracite 50 on my vampires explosive, when I craft ammo I make 680 per roll, with legendary perk(lvl 2 I think)
---
Same here. It happens for me if I level up score while doing daily ops
---
Dude every small thing adds up except for your inputs on the damn situation. Get off this sub you're making everyone look bad
---
Alrighty, I just gotta clear this op and I‚Äôll give you one
---
Awesome, thanks for responding.
---
Right? I fast travel jump from player vendor to player vendor then server hop and repeat to buy ammo mats.....
---
So paying to fast travel to the Boringhood of Steel? No biggie.
---
Ahhh ok, appreciate it. Never knew that
---
As someone who likes grenades. Please just give me your grenades. I never have enough grenades.
---
the weapon racks seem heavily bugged. i could only assign certain long and heavy guns. no melee. no pistols.
---
Thanks! Good hunting!
---
Pro-tip from Bethesda: Be omniscient because they don't let you test their atom store offerings.
---
I‚Äôll try and add/reach out to you tonight! Currently helping my father in law put up drywall in their garage! But I‚Äôll be on tonight for sure! Thank you!
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs butchers bounty because I don‚Äôt have the perk and still getting double resources and occasionally double legendary
---
The new legendary ammo perk, ammosmith, and super duper. 
---
I burned through 6k .50 and 3k 2mm just on Sunday afternoon. I have lead and acid tagged for search and built a camp on a lead deposit and then pick up every single weapon I find and scrap them with scrapper.
---
Welcome!
---
My first hour I had a couple of people join for the first Prime Cuts, then had to solo three more over the course of the hour.  Hopefully my next server is better.
---
Realized I didn‚Äôt answer your question, yes I have a mic so we can chat!
---
I think you answered my question. Glad to see the mere mention of pvp triggers you. And just a thought, maybe you don't see pvp because you don't go looking for it. Anyways, later foodie.
---
Try restarting 76.
---
I stopped buying since the Jukebox. I thought When I bought the Jukebox I would get some more of the malt shop oldies (or somthing akin to that) but no got the same exact tracks from the regular in game jukebox.
---
This was at primal cuts as well?
---
I love that perk. I have it maxed out. First one I did and you get a fuck load of 50 when crafting and that‚Äôs not counting super duper
---
Herp Torg?
---
Use the barrel to play on it and to taunt the beasts
---
Any idea where to get the shotgun mod? Just scrap a big ch of Gauss rifles?
---
I‚Äôve been told that since the second refund and every subsequent refund. So at least 15 times. They‚Äôll always say that, and probably don‚Äôt refund atoms if the reason is something like ‚ÄúI accidentally hit the button too fast‚Äù. But if the in game items you purchased are just straight up broken or do not work as advertised (or just not as intended or with issues), of course they have to honor those refunds legally. You‚Äôll never read a post where someone complained about a broken item they just paid real money for in game, and Bethesda absolutely refused the refund. Just doesn‚Äôt happen because the backlash would be another shitstorm they don‚Äôt need. So buy all the broken items you can!
---
Yep XBox it's happening a lot.  I had to change servers to get it to stop going across my screen.
---
One more thing, you are going to have to put points in carry weight reduction at some point. Gear later on will reduce weight od certain items, but for now you will have to take what you can carry. Like the other QoL perks, make your picks based off your needs. Early game feels very much like spinning plates and it is great.
---
Welp.....guess I won't be buying those :(
---
shoot. that worked for me. must have been a different bug. Good Luck!
---
What i want is using a non-combat build, and have fun, without being frustrated. 
---
I want to be able to loot meaningful things. I want to have fair and fun fights without needing to spec half my build into it to not make it frustrating, or having X weapon/weapon type/legendary effect check. I want to be able to complete objectives without having to kill everybody around the objective. I want to have fun in a Fallout game, without the thought of "Damn. If I had a meta build id be having fun, but as i play the way I want, i have only frustration and deficit of resources, even when speccing towards resource gathering. And i cant even go back to a "easier" area, because there is none"
---
The lodge set
---
Idk but I saw a New Locked Halloween decoration in my camp build menu, it has a lock, not an atom so I don‚Äôt think it is atomic shop. I have hope for something!
---
Thank yooouu
---
Stealing steel from people at workshops. As well other junk along with it
---
So does the recliner have a reclining animation where i get to sit back?
---
Thank you so much!!
---
I just unlocked but I can't find it.  What category does it come up under?
---
I agree with this considering how many people posted about Crater and Foundation needing to be free for months on end. If they ever add actual Enclave content then Whitesprings Bunker should also be free,  in general all faction bases should be free to travel to.
---
That's really weird, especially since my collectron is set to collect weapons and ammo, but collects no grenades. I'd be happy for them.
---
Well if it is about profit only then it will come down to who has more machines in the market if Xbox is trailing Sony I can see them doing pure exclusive if Xbox is ahead of Sony in Xbox sales I can see them released on both.   
---
But like I said Xbox is trying to do this unified structure between PC and Xbox so if their own steam like store is coming it would make more sense to exclude Sony and other platforms so more people come to your own. If it was just fallout I would say it would need to be on both consoles. But we are talking mega franchises with Wolfenstein, Doom, Elder Scrolls, Fallout it would cause many folks to migrate to xbox and just add another launcher for PC. Xbox would also no longer have to worry about cross platforming for many games to be.
---
Thank you very much
---
Good to know Im not the only one, thanks
---
Do you think this is intentional then?
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for the info. :)
---
Yeah primal cuts I was getting 11 acid from Yao guai and antiseptic from the prime honey beasts
---
What kevel are u
---
Excellent, will do. I‚Äôm very much looking forward to getting online tonight
---
I also use grenades, but I don't understand the benefit of MIRVs. They just seem like a frag but with more materials. What am I missing?
---
14 acid from some crickets without the perk. Not complaining at all
---
Thanks, if it's common, they may fix it soon
---
This
---
The targets are all marked now, so you can solo Prime Cuts as long as you can stay alive and don't waste time dealing with the ankle biters too much.  I was 4/4 in the first hour with three of those going solo.  Definitely harder than before in terms of the difficulty in killing the extra spawns, but much easier to find and kill the required Prime Beasts.
---
Must.....resist.....the....urge....to buy....everything! 
---
Well I failed...
---
Doubt it but I‚Äôll take it. Especially double legendary
---
So called PVPers are the real food builds lol
---
No clue, but awesome info none the less
---
Good title. Thanks for posting.
---
Good to know, thx
---
Microsoft doesn‚Äôt own Zenimax yet, not till around June 2021
---
No, you have to get your Settlers reputation to Ally. It took me about 1.5 months to get it playing daily.
---
Cool. I‚Äôm Pacific time and am on randomly. I will most likely be on again tonight since today‚Äôs the weekly reset.
---
We want to be able to spend caps on things!
---
I go by how many rounds it takes to kill something - I tested demolition expert on a level 100 Yao Guai with the same guns and as close to the same conditions as I could achieve. Demo expert only saved me four rounds on average - it‚Äôs only saving grace is it‚Äôs use in PvP, where every bit of DPS counts and legacy laser rifles are king of commando.
---
Tbh all I want is TES and Fallout but I guess we will have to see. I think they would make a larger profit of they release on all platforms but I guess it's pride. I guess this is what happens when they start a exclusives war with each other lol.
---
So yesterday I did it solo and first try I got elder in 720. It was easy, at each uplink I think I killed 5 or 6 and then the final wave I killed six and boss showed up and downed him quick. So maybe it did idk
---
I am also pacific time and I‚Äôm expecting to be on prior to 7-8pm depending on how long this wall takes
---
I don‚Äôt think Microsoft wants to compete because they are making there own halo show on hbo
---
This is the best kind of harmless shit post and I wish I could upvote it more

Nah fuck this crazy toaster. Autumn all the way
---
Well go ahead and try your luck in the trade forum..good luck
---
With my perks I have literally killed an entire herd of radstags with a single grenade. It's about choosing when to use them.
---
Where? I always do a white springs run every time I get on. Good XP and possible legendaries.
---
im just above level 50 so all that info is new to me thank you. ill try to figure something out i guess

Huh. Old bugsüòÇüòÇ

you're seeing things.

Ehhhh.

Ready when you join, yes. Ready when you're there waiting for people to join? No. I'm not going to sit there doing nothing waiting for people to join, I'm going to go run dailies. If you join my team, and jump right into the op with the two of us, I'll follow you in once I've turned in my technical data, or gotten the rest of the way to ward's escapist bonesaw.
---
And when I join a team, same thing. I keep an eye out for an emote that could mean "Thanks for joining, lets go", but if no one joins the op, and we're not a full team, I just fill time with minor quests. If I think we've got a good team, I load the op and just chill in the lobby for a minute or two.
---
Grahams meat cook, by vault 76, starts at the top of every hour.  If you get there a few minutes early, play drums or turn a spit.
---
If you are there at 30 minutes past the hour, you can trade with him and hang out, but you can't trigger the event. 
---
Primal hunts happen a few times an hour, so don't worry if you miss one.  Playing the drum there will encourage the creatures to come and attack you faster.
---
No, as there isn't one.
---
Take One For the Team perk card is bugged.

use an online build planner like [fallout builds](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/) or [nukes dragons](https://nukesdragons.com)

power armor heavy gun build should be done around level 70, most of the perks you will want are level locked and will only be available around level 45.

---
note: heavy gun perks are at higher levels, these perks are under strength so it may be a good idea to start with a shotgun or melee build at lower levels.
---
i bought them :-( i wrote a ticket for a refund.
---
PSA  Please don‚Äôt walk in front of someone using an explosive weapon.
---
What?
---
It‚Äôs not there, dude.
---
It's basically an event where Chally doesn't eat the meat.
---
no you‚Äôre just reaching for straws here
---
reminds me of a line from the show " raised by wolfs " 
---
dude said something like " with so few of us isnt it better to leave him alive as cannon fodder "
---
Yea well, she didn't make the station...  
---
Just be glad anything goes isn't on loop forever.
---
Depends on what it is on.  On consoles there are glitched neverending laser rifles and bloodied explosive auto pipe pistols/rifles.  The game isnt broken with those.
---
I'm still waiting for my BOS skin backpack.
---
I wanted to see if I can get a tse tesla
---
If you ignore the rest of the things that are there you can make one, but that's not the same thing.
---
I totally don't see it. No Nazis around here.
---
Obviously they wouldnt cause massive lag spikes like a never ending fatman
---
Ouchy. There's some serious weight there. If you're on Xbox, I'd happily take some. I make Stimpak Diffusers with them. Useful for team healing.
---
New day, new meat... New to Grahm anyway.
---
I have her, and will only return her for the sum of 30,000 caps, unmarked and only from Nuka cola Dark bottles. If my demands are not met. I will start mailing her back to you, a section at a time. Do not call the Responders or there will be evil afoot.
---
That seems to have no effect. And there is no quest marker. Weird?
---
Is this type of swinging on the road map?
---
None of the displays work even the normal weapon racks I have put in 4 support tickets 3 have been ignored 1 has got a copied and pasted reply
---
True
---
I had a lot of fun with shotguns early in the game.  I definitely second that suggestion.
---
there is one in there.. but how do you judge intention?
---
are you saying you think a neonazi designed the fence?
---
Many people have. Myself included
---
Yea, any of the Murder/TTT style games could be a very fun mini-game they could add, but the only hitch is the need for devs to work on it which is time and effort spent to make content that exists in other forms. I mean they did Nuclear Winter, but it sounds unplayable on PC due to cheaters and while I enjoy it on consoles, our larger community seems to dislike it.
---
This all being said, once we get personal instances shelters if we can make them vault sized I can get some players will host this sort of thing.
---
Actually that leads into a cool idea, custom games in personal shelters. Deffinatly not something to hope for with the initial release, but if the owner could access a terminal to set rules and options that could be super fun.
---
I think it‚Äôs a hard sell. You have to really focus to see it. Plus, there are additional lines extending to the top right and bottom left.
---
what is super duper?
---
Common bug.  To work around this, look at your scoreboard from the main menu before you load into a game.  This can stop the repeated blue bar filling issue.  üëç
---
Based on this, I'm going to assume you've never actually seen a swastika, but someone described it to you once.
---
No, at most i see a pinwheel.
---
10% damage per drug type (ie med-x, psycho, alchohol) each similar drug shares an addiction. Up to 5 addictions for +50%. Some drugs are less detrimental of an addiction so do some research and see which ones fit you best, just don‚Äôt do xcell.
---
Maybe just Google it next time.
---
this has not happened to me yet on PC
---
Resembles more of a snowflake to me.
---
"Alright next question and please, answer *honestly...* 
---
Have you had sexual intercourse with a species considered *non-human*"
---
"That happens enough to be a question?"
---
Yes, exactly.  It‚Äôs just switching Rifleman and Comando cards.
---
Yes. That is different from the Creation KIT though
---
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me but sorry you have to go through this shit too!
---
I feel like there's a misunderstanding there, you give off the impression the community managers deserves shit *for not fixing the mask.*
---
Objectively it isn't even the CMs job to fix the mask, lol. Most likely (and anecdotal evidence of all the fallen off requests back me up there), the process is the CMs are just voice channels internally and suggest what to do. Even if they did everything in their power, they're basically only an extension of the players.
---
This position is completely irrelevant if the devs and the CMs have no creative control, which is what it's seemed for quite a while in this game's lifespan.
---
Chances are the creative control is spearheaded by some comically rich super villain in a suit. There's little reason to believe the devs and the CMs are conspiring against their player base, as that's just straight stupid from a business perspective.
---
The replies with downvotes (primarily the one data miner fellow) are mostly voicing that your vented frustrations are going to the wrong people. It's like threatening the cashier over price changes at a Walmart. Chances are the cashier has no power to influence the negative situation beyond telling higher ups it exists.
---
I understand not trusting the CMs words (I've lost faith in them since it took them two weeks to announce a fix to a weight bug that put your carrying capacity in the negatives when nw launched), but blaming them or the devs for a lot of the shit going on is misguided.
---
So I mean, yeh, you're kinda toxic, but like, *I get it* LOL
---
Not as toxic as the other guy tho. Homie gotta take a break from the game fr, dude comes off like 76 bullied him in high school and he's going to the class reunion with a fuckin glock LMAO
---
Sea of Thieves has one. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúInsiders‚Äù and exists as a separate build of the game, rather than an option within the existing game.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd say they won‚Äôt respond about free or in-game items not working. But if it‚Äôs an atom shop purchase and you‚Äôre requesting a refund, that is usually responded to pretty quickly
---
It seems that it coming soon.
---
If you look up Chinese Chippendale railing you‚Äôll see that it was a popular style starting back in the 18th century. I can see where you‚Äôre coming from but I think their intention was to use the Chippendale style that was popular in the area.
---
Do it, this nerf was actually good for pvp. Ive been min maxed for a long time now anyways so I honestly didn't notice much of a difference other than im tankier now. 
---
My advice, look into a guerilla build. With tank killer working for pistols and being able to turn a legacy laser into an auto pistol it makes for some interesting build options. Having more agility means more AP for dodgy to proc with and then you can take all those points out of perception and place them in endurance or charisma. I have a buddy who runs a guerilla build and he was able to kill top name pvpers before the addition of tank killer.
---
Every day since the season started, first exp gains causes me to cycle through all of the levels again. It's annoying as fuck at level 25, can't wait until I'm at 50 or higher and I have to sit through it.
---
I see a pinwheel. That is not a swastika.
---
Speaking from a business standpoint, itd be very poor taste to null any contracts or agreements on buying a property and would harm relations, especially since Amazon is a giant industry that sells Microsoft product, so they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.
---
We're just gonna have to wait and see at this point, though.
---
I would like if they just made floater grenades sellable. I usually stockpile grenades to sell for caps and floater ones just disappoint me
---
Should also add NTA before people hop ship, close observation but this ain‚Äôt it chief
---
Only three land mines, though.
---
Arguably Minecraft improved after it was sold it Microsoft. More devs, professional management, and quality updates. 
---
They are monetizing Bedrock edition with skins, maps, and emotes but I‚Äôd be more concerned if Microsoft *was not* utilizing the massive brand power of Minecraft in some way.
---
It‚Äôs there plan as day but I doubt it was intentional
---
Sure I see the swastika pattern in that. Do I think it was intentional? No. Do I care enough to make a stink about a piece of fencing in a vidya game? Also no.
---
I read somewhere the other day if u open the score map before u log in it‚Äôs stops it happening. Luckily not had it happen to me yet and yes I do check the atom store and then the score map before I log in so maybe something in it
---
I mean if you really force yourself to see it I guess? But its still an incredible reach to get there, absolutely monumental reach
---
Fallout 76 story are evolving
---
Just don‚Äôt go idle because that doesn‚Äôt let it progress through the counter. So it‚Äôs not even like I can walk away while it‚Äôs going off.
---
Actually you can loot the Shepherd's Crook, you just have to kill some enemies and they have a chance if it's within the event. I've done it myself a few times.
---
True.  I‚Äôve seen plenty on top of tents spinning.
---
Yes, they sure did. I'm pretty sad NGL. I'm now running Big Guns, was never a fan but I'm getting used to it now. The only reason I went that direction is because of Final Word, it's a nice weapon. I've primed it now, got all Big Gun perks &amp; jeez that thing shreds through anything. Impressive. I also have 4 other Gatling Plasma's now which the game has never dropped for me until Ichanged my build. The silly thing is, even though I'm carrying 5 big guns now, along with all that ammo, my inventory weighs less than what it did when I only carried my beloved Mole Miner Gauntlet, Final Word &amp; a combat knife! Go figure! 
---
Legendary Ammo perk is a God send now that I'm using guns.
---
Batteries Included (Intelligence) is essential if you're going to use any energy ammo, including Fusion Cores.
---
I don't mind leaving it here. It's the same as my reddit user name SinOfSociety
---
Yeppers
---
I have a theory that may prevent changing servers, first check if your progress bar is bugged in the map screen, in my case, showing a full bar with rank 1, I fixed it by manualky checking my progress using the scoreboard option in the map, after that, the progress bar displayed the correct information and any further completed challenges didnt trigger the bug
---
Playing drums or turning spits a couple minutes before the event starts gives the progress meter a nice boost.
---
My quad explosive pump is bae.
---
Fuck legs, including mine.
---
I find this happens in the burning mine sometimes
---
Well my gf and I both can't connect to the ps4 servers atm and get disconects quite regularly, so i guess ps4 is fucked.
---
I would definitely try it, CS can see the transaction history and the amount of atoms you had at what time.
---
Thanks.  I actually found two more areas that are easily accessible as part of my loop.  One is right near Foundation.  I‚Äôll edit my post to reflect them
---
Idk i was doing scorched earth event and got kill by players.
---
Visit camps.  You can usually find ammo for pretty cheap.
---
What does it look like?
---
Yeah, a neat benefit of Quad is that it makes a Perforating magazine (40% more armor penetration) more practical, compared to Stinging (20% AA, 2x capacity).
---
So, you can think of it as "quad capacity", or "double capacity plus some anti-armor".
---
Depends on your username, if you have a shop that is actually powered, or you are nice to strangers doing emotes. Otherwise, nuuurp
---
Rad storms are probably hard for lower level players to manage with their dads spiking. I personally love them for the same reasons as you.
---
Most of the G-Mod style game types would fit well with the sillyness of the Fallout universe.
---
And I forgot all about grafton steel thinking about it you just reminded me, cheers I'll add that one to my daily routine!
---
Happened to my a few days ago but been ok since
---
Nice condescending assumption there. Classy.
---
They‚Äôre selling the shooting game which is on the battle pass
---
Some wannabes always shoot all other players during events, and if you‚Äôre ready for pvp (pacifist off), he‚Äôll just keep shooting.
---
West Tek and the Coverted Ammo Factory will keep you in ammo and caps if you sell the weapons you get from the super mutants. Plus super mutants are amazing xp. Alternatively you can craft a ton of water purifiers and sell water to vendors for spare caps
---
It's a stylized snowflake, not a swastika in anyway shape or form.  This kind of pattern is common in ski lodges all across America.  Now it's all I can see though
---
Have you tried exiting the game and logging in again?  That often fixes this issue, and you will see you do have the item.
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work, then submit a ticket.
---
Right? Who wants to spend caps fast traveling when we can get stuff that matters with caps.
---
At least the treasure hunter event is in a few weeks.
---
Shit, is that what it is, I though it was my mutation. But it also happened a different time to a teammate without mutations and pacifist on.
---
I had read that on a heavy weapon build guide as well, and have been focusing on melee (haven‚Äôt stumbled into a shotty yet) until I get there because I like whacking things with my pitchfork lmao
---
That is a reach, it is a traditional pinwheel style. I mean if you are a closeted neo nazi racist tool I guess you see swastikas everywhere.
---
Bethesda just got 7.5 billion in cold hard cash. They don't care
---
Happened to me before, I submitted a ticket and it was taken care of straight away, they will refund your atoms so you can repurchase it.
---
This community will fight and argue about everything.
---
Agreed, though I do think magnetic personality should go back to the way it was.
---
Luck perk unlocks at 50.
---
I made ultracite .50 cal. Holy McMoly Ammoman, you make 720 in one go. A few goes &amp; I somehow ended up with a few thousand! I'll take it!
---
Zero difference -- the issues are in Bethesda's code, not AWS.
---
I would rather lose some XP than join a public team, tbh. I don't play this game to be super social, and even if I can just ignore everyone I'd rather not have my UI littered with group related things. Quite frankly I'm annoyed that public teams have formed some sort of meta.
---
Quite a few item displays are broken at the moment. Which is funny that they just introduced new weapon display racks when displays are broken for quite a few skins/weapons.
---
I dislike playing in teams more than I like exp. hell, what pushed me over the Fo1st edge wasn't the scrap box, or the ranger outfit.
---
it was knowing I wouldn't have to play in public servers anymore.
---
I have had a similar issue: Until yesterday, I either got no reward or the vault 94 stash box plan. RNGesus smiled upon me yesterday however, and I got the war glaive plan. 
---
But I'm sure that was the limit of his beneficence, and today I will get either nothing or yet another stash box plan.
---
Well, I agree with this, but I think the OP title is attempting to cause a viewer bias by pre-labelling.
---
However, that said, I asked my wife "Do you see anything offensive in this?", her immediate response was yes, something 2nd WW German, but not a Swastika, so maybe there is something?
---
A luck perk that gives you a chance of doubling anything you‚Äôre crafting other than the new gold weapons.
---
Afaik one of the Devs mentioned  there would be a BOS season in the Quakecon interviews, my guess is S3 will be that, which is good news if you like playing the game a lot and bad news if you just want the stuff.
---
If you are in a public team and have the perk equipped it will trigger PvP even with pacifist on. The debuff counts as an attack.
---
Come for the excellent XP. Stay for the multiple legendaries!
---
I always hit it. Dinged a level and got 4 legendary spawns on it today.
---
I'm sitting on like 2000 atoms with 4 weeks of atom shop stuff I haven't liked, BUT I really like BoS bunker :/
---
Calm down , Stretch Armstrong.
---
Misc
---
agree, one person gives up their good perk sharing (likely a high CHA build to begin with) and then everyone else can share perks. It‚Äôs not as fluctuating as Unyielding or other buffs
---
Yeah, no. Whole reason I have a private server is to avoid people. I certainly wont be jumping on this public team crap.
---
I made the point on a Rifleman thread last week this very gun should be added and make it a proper, powerful rifle that gives sniper builds and FO veterans a way to use their maxed cards and play a preferred style.
---
I can adjust to Commando and Heavy Guns easy enough, but like to play a realistic way too. How a human might have to in such world. 
---
Kudos for the mention of The Gun Runners ballistics. Adding that ammo, solely for Rifleman would be a nice choice and a nod to a very popular playing style that's crossed so many FO games.
---
Past games are safe but if some1 plans to buy ps5 and have it tes6 or fallout 5 i would be carefull.
---
I could not stand that. So I started paying the caps and fast travel to the bunker instead. But if I die most the time I get put in nuke zone and have to pop radway to stay alive being I‚Äôm bloodied
---
The spits do cause the meter to drop if they aren‚Äôt tended, so those are best done first.
---
Agree with this
---
I don‚Äôt know what this is or what it does
---
You don't have to be social at all. You can join a casual team and basically just play solo. But playing solo on a casual team gets you more XP.
---
[No! It wasn't me, it was the one armed man!](https://youtu.be/HflILF_9O2k?t=27)
---
They don‚Äôt own them yet. It won‚Äôt be finalized until 2021
---
Just submitted a ticket, thanks for the reply.
---
I like how this has turned into a debate as if fast travelling shouldn't be free in the first place.
---
We deserve better, fellow Vault Dwellers.
---
Maybe the Zetans took the cow away?
---
I was talking to a friend about it today, and while the boat has probably sailed on an overhaul for 76, perhaps something like it.
---
Can you imagine a proper MMO game? Like a subscription-based thing with new content on a set schedule. I've always thought 76 needed elements from the MMO genre - hub areas, factions, instance encounters.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
That, and I know people have been saying it since day one, but persistent servers. It would completely change the dynamic of 76.
---
I'm reminded of when I used to play Team Fortress 2 (many years ago) as it was a game with privately hosted servers. You could just bounce around random, but I always recommended finding a few you prefer and become a regular there. Because what you'll find is the same people will be around about half the time, you'll get to know these people and build a sense of community. Heck I *still* talk to some of my TF2 friends.
---
And that game is much less interactive than Fallout 76.
---
Can you frickin imagine.
---
Awesome! I appreciate you helping out!
---
No. The event spawns waves of enemies. When each wave is cleared, a short countdown happens then the next wave comes. It doesn't matter how many people tag an enemy, so long as they die fast enough. The amount of Prime Meat given out at the end depends on the location of the event. Or that's how it worked before One Wasteland. Higher level areas spawned tougher creatures and gave more Prime Meat. I guess now that everything is level appropriate they would make each event worth the same amount of prime meat.
---
And remember to pick up any salt you find! Once you know the squirrel spawns, salt is the bottleneck.
---
And then they would ceremonially burn Beth engine in campfire.
---
Yeah, that was the first thing I did. Ticket has been submitted.
---
Make sure pacifist is on and remove Taking One for the Team of you have it equipped. It can still activate PvP with pacifist on if you are in a public team and someone attacks you.
---
im level 40 just got back into the game. I have defense perks, i have damage perks, no sneak perks, i have perks that reduce weight of items and i have perks to allow me to craft better. i am all over the place and i run solo everyday and rarely come into any issues. Yea some fights are insanely hard and i need to run but that is what you get when fighting a scorchbeat with level 35 gear haha im learning new things, was away for over a year and a lot has changed but you can have fun with different builds just gotta play smart. i utilize heavy sneak attacks to initiate combat then mow down with the handmade rifle or the fixer. works very well for me anyways.
---
Yup
---
I would buy it.
---
Seriously. If I have MAX affinity, I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend caps for your bullshit in game economy that only you care about, Bethesda.
---
Happy to help! Let me know if you get a chance to try it.
---
The point is, you don't use any extra scrap than normal. You just hit craft a couple times, Super Duper kicks in &amp; BAM, you just made double for no extra cost. If you spam craft, you sometimes don't notice if SD kicked in &amp; so you stop to check inventory &amp; you suddenly have a huge amount. 
---
I don't actually understand your point though. Super Duper is an amazing perk, everyone should spend the 3 points &amp; keep that card. It's too valuable when it comes to crafting anything... from ammo to food, serums to assaultron recall cards.
---
It‚Äôs prob because Xbox series x and a pre orders came out today
---
you fucking dare fucking come here in real life and tell that to my fucking face. it has fucking propellers what more do you fucking need
---
* Step 1 hoard flux for months, 
---
* step 2 equip ammo smith, 
---
* step 3 equip super duper, 
---
* step 4 use maxed out ammo factory, 
---
* step 5 craft ultracite ammo enmasse 
---
* step 6 PROFIT!!!    
---
I have 750k 5mm I may run out next year after i burn all 200 of my ultrasite plasma cores and my 120 ultracite fusion cores.  And still have 50-75 of each flux.
---
Public teams are one of the best features the game has added
---
Lone Wanderer is the reason I solo
---
Most people on public teams play solo. You're not forced to interact with anyone else at all.
---
On Xbox and yes twice now but it stops if your in the daily ops and goes back on when you leave daily ops
---
i don't really mind so much - i only got a small handful of the unique guns from the survival challenges, if they add them all back in as plans i can finally stop holding onto the ones i have in my stash
---
The only day you should buy ranks is the last day after earning as much as you can, each rank has the same atom cost, but the score to rank up slowly increases.
---
Damn I got prize bot giving me 100 last night should‚Äôve kept it lol
---
There was some Twitt from obsidian when they responed to question about new Vegas 2 with something like this "üòâ".
---
Then what did you mean about it impacting ‚Äònuke frequency‚Äô. Please elaborate to correct my misconception.
---
Yeah I can't recall this ever being in the shop at all. Mind posting a showcase picture?
---
As a bloodied build, I just don't want to have someone take away my rads. I wouldn't get mad at them cause I could avoid it by not joining one.
---
You don't have to actually be social. I don't like talking to people and don't use a mic but I join public teams. The only UI element is the team list in the bottom corner. Its not that obtrusive.
---
Yeah, yesterday there was almost no Blood Eagels to shoot
---
If it‚Äôs something where we constantly go there because we kinda have to aka Crater and Foundation, yes we do need free fast travel if not like Enclave where you only go there for a couple quests then you‚Äôre done no we don‚Äôt
---
Really ? it only happens with freaking fallout
---
I've got them before
---
My bad not a legendary from the boss but definitely guaranteed a legendary from each run
---
Yeah that‚Äôs why Enclave doesn‚Äôt really need to be free it‚Äôs really only a couple quests but then you‚Äôre done
---
I‚Äôm tempted to try this Instigating Explosive Railway Rifle I got the other day.  I haven‚Äôt used one since FO4.
---
Interesting note - with the exception of the minus int (and even that could be justified, if you think about it), all of the penalties from these mutations match up with new Vegas/3‚Äôs radiation sickness debuffs.
---
Int could be justified, as your character is probably in a poor mental space when they‚Äôre feeling 800 rads in the gutter.
---
I‚Äôll stick to my orbital strike beacons, thank you very much.
---
I get that, but it's an awful feeling to come into a game late and be barred from something so cool. I would've 100% done the entire grind if the season hadn't ended before I could even begin it.
---
That's cool. That UI element is enough to turn me off either way. I also don't really want anyone fast traveling to me or anything like that. If I feel like being social, maybe I'll join one but like I said, I hate the idea that it's even become a meta.
---
It‚Äôs a potential drop, yes.
---
I will tonight for sure. I have a Deathclaw but my trophy pet is a Mirelurk Deep King.....one day.
---
Let us know how fast the issue is fixed.  I had a screw up and am now 4 days out with no response.
---
Has nothing to do with the acquisition. FO76 servers are just garbage. The actual deal won't be done until 2021 and then the actual changes will start, but I highly doubt old games will be super high on the priority list at that time.
---
You need to mini nuke everyone that ever even thought of harming your cow
---
morgantown airport (big town northeast of vault 76), scorched here will drop pump shotguns. collect several and scrap for mods. need to get one of the long barrels on the pump and the hardened reciever. reliable stock works well. clear out the airport terminal building and check the grey stash box on the top floor.
---
Yeah, and if you don't join one then all you are doing is missing out on XP.  Don't like playing in teams? Casual team option was made for people who don't like playing on teams.  You can join a casual team and then just go do your own thing and earn more XP. With the legendary perk system, I'd say XP is pretty damn important.
---
Of course your mileage may vary depending on build, gear, and speed.
---
I'm also not forced to join a public team, so it works out!
---
Interesting note on egg head - with class freak, the penalties are less than one. Your pipboy will show the full stat minus as 1, but your carry weight and health will be rather strange numbers as a result (I have 311 health, for example).
---
Yes indeed, and it's annoying af. I don't know what they broke in the last patch that caused it, but Lord, I hope it's fixed before we rank up to the really high levels, or else it'll wind up being a solid hour of hearing it.
---
I play solo on my berserker. The loss of lone wanderer is too much to give up for them.
---
120 caps in 2 minutes...he can escape every 15 minutes if you ask me.
---
Better Macrohard than Ten(per)cent(of the planet)...
---
There will be a reputation grind for BOS. The system exists, I can‚Äôt imagine them not reusing it.
---
if I'm in private, sure. assuming no one else can join me.
---
the problem arises when someone else is in the same group.
---
Thank you.
---
I‚Äôd rather take 20% less damage and have increased ap regen than 17-23% xp
---
6600 caps! Is it worth it?
---
West tek, harpers ferry then burrows is my choice of location but I bet their are other better spots nows since one wasteland dropped.
---
Get outa here, everything is a dildo if you are dumb enough.
---
Of course they want us to rank up a perk card when we‚Äôve been scrapping them for coins.
---
Casual team option was made for people who don't like playing on teams, IMO. There's no expectation to run ops or do events or work with others in any way.  Just being on the team gives you more XP for everything you do.
---
Yeau i ended up not bringing him anywhere cuz he died so often.
---
Tell that to all the people who'll never get legacies.
---
That works too, I just want a bos themed caml
---
I will
---
It's stretching it a bit, but I guess you'd see it if you were looking and trying to. I just think it's a neat little pattern, personally. I think you may be making much ado about nothing on this one. Sorry!
---
Only mod I‚Äôve used is the TM map one.  To better see body‚Äôs of water when hunting for a new camp location.  
---
I removed prior to patch22.   All I did was remove the command line inthe custom.ini file.    Didn‚Äôt even delete the file itself.  
---
Loaded up game and normal fo76 map shows.
---
two explosions and a larger blast radius. They are better against groups.
---
Uhh, it's under free and special offers. I don't think it's a fallout 1st exclusive...

When I played FO4 all I wanted to do was find my son just to kill him because that main story line to me was boring as hell.
---
People only say fallout 3 and the others are the best. But to me I say it‚Äôs because of modding. By them selves their ok games not perfect by a long shot.
---
I don‚Äôt see these people as true fans of fallout since the first thing they do is mod it to hell because it‚Äôs easy to do so compared to most games.
---
So this how I triggered by accident PvP with some random guy today. I ended up with tones of steel and lead. Thanks Beth
---
Mine is LanVlam. I'm online for 3 hours
---
It‚Äôs great when combined with vats, all explosive railways are very satisfying to shoot, and Ops recover its ammo well.
---
I like to drop off full sets of deep pocketed gear for people starting out along with some chems and stims. Someone did that for me back when I was lvl 15 and it helped me a lot, so now I'm just trying to pay that forward.
---
It‚Äôs random between scrip, caps, and notes.
---
Even better if you could attach a target dummy to your camp terminal in order to change the DR of the dummy to actually equal that of enemies, that way you can test your build for the queen or earl in the comfort of your own camp.
---
No, I agree, the free travel spot to Crater and Foundations ere certainly welcome.
---
Wait, I can craft this..? I never noticed, or knew. Do remember a second window in the Atom Shop, although blank like the uniform and thinking it was just labelled Mountain Scout too. 
---
Is it in the Headgear section to craft ? No recollection of seeing an option. Have the Mountain Scout uniform.
---
That sucks.  This helmet is one of the few cosmetics I actually like.   I got my first one on the first day CP was introduced. 
---
Just got a 2nd one yest after several, several runs.
---
I doubt it.  West tek still has the highest concentration of high xp enemies I'm aware of.
---
One can only dream.
---
Why is it a problem?  You don‚Äôt have to talk, you don‚Äôt have to play with them, nothing you do affects them, nothing they do affects you other than the do boost.
---
Yeah I might consider buiyng it when they will remove adding hanged Item both to stash and camp limit.
---
There are a few reasons why I'm usually not joining a team. Lone Wanderer being the biggest, but also because I sometimes don't want people to find my camp or don't like them joining my operation. For example.
---
Dude just lock it up in a shed or barn or better still don't have one , your just asking for it to be killed if it's outside after all it is the wasteland and in a real life version they would probably loot your home kill you and then burn your house to the ground , 
---
or just go and play farm simulator or something if you can't cope with the wild wasteland
---
Getting the Mod Box from the other vendor is cheaper but it is rare. Ive found only one there ever and i would check it every time when i was farming Technical Data.
---
Also anyone who is in public teams should run empath, I do it
---
NP I can link you a couple of good builds if you need
---
I was about to ask you if you play on xbox, then I checked your post history, and you do play on xbox, indeed.  
---
Xbox pvp is basically teslafest.
---
Only thing about the Enclave is that off limits quarters
---
Idiots. They could have got it for $5 on sale.
---
man thats a streeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetch there buddy.
---
No there isn't one. And rightfully deleted/banned for idiocy and trying to cause problems for absolutely no reason.

You can have that effect, but better, playing on a team.
---
I can confirm; I had this issue too.  When you first come to the main screen, look at the SCORE progress bar at the bottom.  If it says Level 1/1 MAX LEVEL (or something like that) open the score map then just quit right back out.  It should then display properly on the main menu screen and not pop all the level up animation things when you join a server.
---
And he paid off the creator of VATS to make himself untargetable!
---
There's a better effect than that for team play.
---
Finally someone who gets it.
---
It‚Äôll be my first priority today! Excited to get my hands on one thank you!
---
Yesterday there was less than a three minute delay between the end of Jail Break *(completed successfully for me, but not for that Suicider Super Mutant)* and the beginning of Man Hunt. 
---
What the hell was I even doing then, Warden?!
---
crippling social anxiety comes to mind. I understand it's not something relatable, but knowing that someone is directly engaged with me just makes me not want to play at all.
---
There's a Similar, but better effect when you play on a team.
---
Yeah, sort of regret picking this one.
---
exactly why I wanted to call attention to it when I was a level 25 and not an 80 lol
---
Simple fact: *I don't care*.
---
I'm smashing enemies left and right without any maxed out Legendary Perks.  I'm also well ahead of schedule on the Season Pass.  I see no need to subscribe to this XP meta if i don't want to.
---
I feel like it was a mistake to even do it
---
There's an effect on teams similar to loan wanderer, but better.
---
How does the antilegacy build work? I'm genuinely interested.
---
...or Tencent.
---
Dogmeat doesn't exist yet.
---
Remember, 76 is set 30 years after bombs drop.
---
Fallout 4 is 200 years on
---
I did have that problem at first as well, but haven‚Äôt run into It recently.
---
What?  You don't need to even be on a team to do any of the meat week events.  Just show up and do stuff.
---
Oh? Which would that be?
---
ü§¶
---
I'd rather not play with random people because I have no interest to. I play on a private world for the whole point of not interacting with other players. I enjoy my own little slice of nuclear irradiated heaven without other players even having the slightest possibility of annoying me. :)
---
It‚Äôs a public event. You should‚Äôve be getting kicked out unless you‚Äôre trying to join a team
---
Oh it is... as an entity it is also realizing that excessive greed is actually hurting them in the long run.  
---
This has the illusory effect of them seeming less greedy as of the last couple years.
---
Well I know that but I‚Äôm being destroyed by everything alone. I‚Äôve failed 2 so far
---
Of course there is fun in PvP and some rewards, too. I would even say duking it out with a worthy opponent is by far the best and most rewarding activity in game. Sure as hell beats grinding for silly cosmetics.
---
Sounds like she earned a scholarship to Bovine University 
---
https://youtu.be/UhoHwQ0cwIQ
---
Is this the only event they have?
---
Yup, just did the end game dungeon for Wastelanders on an alt last night and the part where you have to clear out the reactor had the turrets up and literally every other enemy was already dead. Big old heap of ghoul bodies in the middle of the room was funny, though.
---
Same, don't know what's up.
---
Wait, really?  I‚Äôm pretty sure I can VATS him. I‚Äôll have to check again... *after he escapes for the fifteenth time this week!*
---
Right I‚Äôm trying to join teams. That‚Äôs what I said tho
---
If you like exploring fallout worlds, you're going to love this game. It has a huge map with tons of detail and elaborate dungeons. Loads of atmospheric storytelling that they're always so good at. I'd actually say it's the biggest and most interesting map of any fallout game. 
---
For now play though the story and explore but also take time out for events for some good loot. If you're looking for plans for your camp, take workshops and do the defense for them too. 
---
Start thinking about heavy guns when you get to lvl 50/45. Rifles and shotguns are good while lvling up. To prepare for big guns and power armor make sure you put a good amount of your special points in strength and intelligence.
---
When all players load in at the same time. Anytime there is an enemy next to me, all the boxes are looted when I load in.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt know what you expect üòÇüòÇ I stopped playing when I logged into a server that was already nuked, and my bad just disappeared in front of me üòÇüíÄ was enough 76 for me
---
Exactly. Plus the bonus free caps when a teammate finishes a quest are always nice.
---
I have maybe 100 hours on it in single player, never played multiplayer, never seen anything asking me to buy stuff. From what I've read, it seems you're totally right about the multiplayer, but I've never experienced that with single player.
---
I probably do need it lol my potato build was not impacted by these changes at all; still mediocre but not struggling like others. I have intended to switch to bloodied since I have picked up several good bloodied weapons. Just haven't gotten around to it. One of these days...
---
Training wheels came off.  
---
Might have to respect to a little more DR then before cause higher harder hitting NPC now.
---
I enjoy it. It makes leveling up easier for both my new level 12 alt and my main.
---
Understandable, have a great day.
---
Cool, I was hoping there'd be a Platinum player icon since we get Brickhouse in the Legendary Run.
---
Most people don't use teslas on PC. It's usually either legacies, lmg or automatic rifles. Quantum spamming seems to be pretty common though.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this so thank you! I only JUST started playing, I think I‚Äôm level 6, and I‚Äôm still trying to learn the new perks card system. I‚Äôm too used to FO4. So question: if I join a team, what am I supposed to do? I never joined any bc I thought they all had specific goals and I just want to play solo and do what I need to do.
---
One of the most requested and very long waited upgrade to the game. Nothing wrong with it. The game has been as hard as hello kitty island adventure for nearly 2 years. Like stupid easy. Scaling mobs is a extremely good design desision from bethesda to add longevity to the game. If you are having problems.. Re-think / optimize your build, aqcuire better items, go back to easier areas until you are comfortable with harder areas. If you can call any area that. The game is still easy, but not as easy as it used to be.
---
Since One Wasteland, I can level every 45 minutes with Kindred Spirit and Mama Dolce's cans running as long as I stay moderately active and do any ! events that pop. That's quick enough for me.
---
I do join teams when I'm in the mood, or I want to go shopping on the cheap, but "faster xp gain" isn't high on my list of incentives.
---
Same with junk getting double acid and stuff
---
ü•∫
---
They game was way too easy for veteran players, so this change was needed. However, they unintentionally made it much tougher on mid-level players and I think they will need to do another balancing pass to level things out a bit. Either by allowing enemies to spawn a few levels below the player if they aren't above 50 or by buffing some of the base weapons or further tweaking the damage calculation changes.
---
Same here. It's been a year and I already forgot what exactly was bugged at M.Night. Can you please elaborate on that?
---
Just put on t-51 power armor and run around tagging wendigos. You'll gain 1-2 levels a pop.
---
Less people will be inclined to drop nukes as they are more busy and don't want to overlap a meatcook. I never said anything about my own willingness or ability to drop nukes; that was all you I'm afraid.
---
Depends on how much do you care about dying? Those top armor pieces mentioned here will cost you *a lot*, but you can make do with lesser ones. Hell, if you rock X-01 stealthboy torso with ultracite PA pieces, you'll be good to go (unless you're on xbox and thus going against teslas).
---
That‚Äôs an interesting... theory.
---
Noticed that as well when I did Primal Cuts in cranberry bog.
---
No, there‚Äôs not
---
Especially now that every enemy around the corner is worth at least 100xp
---
I got nothing yesterday ;-;
---
I'll be interested in PA when it comes with a wood finish.
---
It was fixed within 5 minutes of submitting the ticket. Linda texted me within seconds of the ticket being submitted and in a couple minutes the Atoms were back on my account. I was surprised how good the service was honestly. Sorry you're having issues.
---
Shhhhh...

---
I was on some random public team - me and 2 bloodied - and some other dude joins and shared rad sponge or sun-kissed or something and one of them got on mic to cuss him out lol. Not sure if it was on purpose, but that guy was *mad*.
---
76 is a footnote in this massive deal.
---
I'm on Xbox come find me with that nuke I kill them all , animals are disease ridden in the wasteland and should all be put to sleep immediately
---
Nice! I got the solar panel yesterday on one of my alts. I pictured having solar panel roof tiles and no longer needing all kinds of wires and conduits all over my house. I'm such a fool.
---
You have a car?
---
lol
---
Holy shit, thank you!
---
I don't care about xp , and I like to do my own thing at my own pace.
---
So, if someone chooses activity A over activity B, how does that affect anyone except for them?  Doesn‚Äôt that person have the right to choose which activity they do?
---
**Explain to me how an individual having an additional voluntary choice of an activity is a bad thing for that individual.**
---
Also, I never said anything about *your* ability or willingness to drop a nuke. I said ‚Äòanyone that depends on others for that‚Äô. 
---
*If you don‚Äôt depend on others for that, then the comment wasn‚Äôt addressed to you.*
---
Me too :)
---
Nope, critters don't scale to your level.
---
Same. Well, maybe not the ahead of schedule part, but anyway. I just don't get why (apparently) we *have* to level up as much as possible as fast as possible. Why not let people have fun on their terms? This almost sounds like those vocal "if you don't min-max/use bloodied/junkie's/whatevs you *suck*!" people.
---
To each their own. In the end everybody will do what they are comfortable with.
---
&gt; this could cause problems in Gernany
---
As a German I can promise you, we use our brains and do not give a fuck about a balustrade where some millennial thinks he sees something.
---
Pharma Farmer perk card is a must early on - stimpacks are hard to come by initially and it helps get you stocked up. Doing events will get you stimpacks, some caps, sometimes ammo and sometimes basic armor/weapons that may be better than what you have or can be scrapped for building mats. If you set up a vendor at your camp, it's a good idea to price your items lower than what the game says an item sells for - also, very few people will buy regular clothing, grenades, or common plans, the latter of which because most higher level players will already have them learned, but there's always new players coming around so it's not a total loss to put them in there. Also, generally speaking don't sell basic ammo for more than one cap. I think ultracite, 2mm EC, and plasma/fusion cores are about the only thing I ever see anyone buying for more than one cap. And lastly, welcome to Appalachia, hope you enjoy the game for a long time!
---
I'm getting this today..been going on for around 15 mins now.. have gotten over 300 caps..You wait, I'll find out tomorrow I'm perma banned for duping caps lol
---
Yeah you got wrong one. I had the one you purchased already and bought the one with the smoke machine this time. Wanna see what new stuff they added this week
---
I may prime my baby today thanks to you
---
Nice! Ive just gotten valley and burrows signs the last two days
---
One thing I learned from FO76 players.  Everyone is scared of socializing.  
---
First online game I‚Äôve played in my life that people are scared of other people online. 
---
I‚Äôm not shaming it.  It must suck real bad to have those types of thoughts/feelings.  
---
It just shocks me that FO76 is the only online game that introduced this to me.
---
There are 2 - 3 more that spawn a little SW of Top of the World near the mountain edge.
---
Empath, it's a mutation.  It, along with strange in numbers and class freak make you take 27% less damage.  If you total the perk point cost, you have 4 for max rank lone wanderer, and 6 for mutations.  (1 for strange in number, 2 for starched genes, and 3 for class freak.) However, the other benefits you gain with mutations far outweigh the cost of two more perk points.
---
Ok, The Scavenger Collectron is on sale 50% off. Is there even a point to get it if you have the BoS Collectron? BoS seems to pull from a bigger loot pool, other then it being an insufferable cunt half the time.. but I've trapped mine in a prison so I hear him less.
---
Holy fuck man, I thought my social anxiety was bad but goddamn some people just can‚Äôt even handle even being in a group with people.
---
You talking about the primal cuts events?  It pops up in multiple places around the map at the same time. Before going make sure there are other people at the one you are joining.  Just join and contribute and you'll most likely complete the event.
---
No big deal if you get killed, just respawn and keep playing.  Just stash your junk before you go.  To some extent it makes sense to not even bother trying to use stim packs and just letting yourself die because other than dropping your scrap there isn't really a penalty to death.  Obviously your armor takes some damage but that's about it.
---
Oooh that'll be interesting to learn
---
Yeah totally. This whole game was a big show that they purposely launched horribly, purposely added all the bugs, made themselves look bad and are now trying to fix it all because they wanted to help sell their company.
---
Way better plan than showing yourselves to be competent and profitable.
---
Pay for my plane ticket and I'll gladly come enjoy a vacation to tell you it looks stupid lol.
---
I‚Äôm so proud of our little antisocial Fallout community! Most of us played this way before it became and MMO RPG and for so many of the great reasons posted here like lone wanderer and random jerks sharing things like Sunkissed when you are a bloody build or people teleporting to your camp to fuck it up, I think you have your answer as to why people choose not to do it. 
---
Plenty of people choose to do it though, and so you have an entire community of Fallout players who enjoy teaming. However, there is no question, now you know why many don‚Äôt. Good day.
---
It's not a bug.  You need to check the enclave bunker to make sure you are on a fresh server when reset hits.  Also sometimes nukacrypt doesn't have the newest codes up for an hour or two after reset.  Nuking immediately after weekly reset will always result in headaches when you don't make sure you're on a new server.
---
Start off with a casual team. There is no expectation, just a INT bonus which means more xp. You may have some random higher level folks from your team come and offer help.
---
I level up twice a night and I‚Äôm 330+ and only play for two hours. Shit is so easy. I think before today‚Äôs reset I was level 26 on board also. It‚Äôs a cake walk with all the higher levels
---
Yes, empath is amazing
---
Think oblivion dark brotherhood quest
---
Tough life. Some of us want nothing more than that plan!
---
Hp scaling is way off, even bethesda agrees. Expect changes incoming.
---
isn't it weird that he only escapes on grafton day
---
delete uhd.ba2 and the reference in the custom.ini. That's it.
---
... I need some lawn flamingoes.
---
I only do the nw challenges if they‚Äôre a cake walk anymore being you don‚Äôt need them this season.
---
Don‚Äôt even need to stash junk. Public events don‚Äôt drop junk!
---
Yeah the primal cuts. But I suppose. I just wanted a team to do it with and make friends and such but it‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôll do it this way.
---
Why the strawman and backpedalling? If less people are dropping nukes then less nukes are dropping and less nuke-based-events are occurring. Even if I run a silo and drop one, as I do, then there are still less dropping due to others not bothering. That's all I'm saying, no matter how you try and twist and turn it. You implied I was a leech with no basis or backing, and now you are desperately reaching and trying to get me to somehow 'fess up'. Don't be so childish.
---
Digging into the depths will yield the story you seek.
---
i can do that
---
Imagine the day we get new FO1st items.
---
I like my Lone Wanderer perk, so no thanks. Also, I could give less of a fuck if I get more XP or not.
---
Joining a team shuts it off even if you're solo, which is unfortunate.
---
It also activates the herd mentality mutation, and the 'on a team' legendary perk cards, which is nice.
---
I just solo'd collision course, got this outfit. Couldn't remember if it was rare or not.. And I find this post. 
---
So, add Collision course to the list of events that can drop it
---
I'm not a fan of Bethesda's BoS, but absolutely yes this should be a thing.
---
You again?
---
A fallout 76 casual team is a great first step in overcoming social anxiety. It‚Äôs zero interaction. If you see another player just ignore them.
---
If you see level 70 enemies... it‚Äôs because you are a high level player!
---
And there is no way a rad roach is still giving you a hard time unless you are using level 1 weapons lol
---
The one withe the smoke machine is there this week?
---
Me again?
---
Don't underestimate the DMV. It isn't as good as West Tech, but as far as XP per minute it is solidly in second place.
---
Edit: remember to boot the Departments for 15 to 20 extra Ghouls.
---
This. And now we also get a lot more XP and some 556 to boot.
---
It's been 5 days and I haven't received any new rewards. All I got was some signs from The Burrows and  vault 94 suite.
---
I wonder how many shotgun builds have a double barrel named Boomstick?
---
That's just lazy, share healing hands for the giggles but i hate when people share useless perks or everyone is sharing the same perk.
---
Idk I got it last week so maybe it is still there
---
Is your camp near flatwoods?
---
Those flatwood creatures like to abduct brahmin.
---
ah, that sounds fucking nice actually. sorry about that fucked up outburst earlier
---
Ok I‚Äôve been saving all the ammo I‚Äôm not using so I can eventually sell it :) bless the melee build haha
---
Which is why I don't go there.
---
There was a guy asking them to make us thirsty when eating salt a little bit ago. Figured it was you lol
---
Yeah it did do though before they changed it üò¢
---
Not a big camp maker, so I don't buy that stuff
---
why not make fast traveling free anyway?
---
Fixed it now
---
Poor fella he just wanted to use your workbench..well if you have extra materials I'll buy some from ya.lol
---
Sadly tried this multiple times even restarted my computer. Like I said this is just a bizarre bug.
---
You can do it when you level up.
---
So you made a wild assumption that they'd include features they never advertised it having when all you should have reasonably expected was a reskin of the existing jukebox?
---
Wendigos go chunky with bloody mess though üòÅ love my gauss shotgun üòÄ
---
Trying to figure out if it‚Äôs worth upgrading or switch it out.  Been looking a possibly infiltrator. I don‚Äôt do many silo runs because it takes me 45 mins but there is a shortcut if you have lock pick 3 and hacker 3 which I do but I‚Äôm to lazy to switch all my cards around and back. If i can get my run down to 20 mins I would do them more often.
---
Thats the beauty of public teams, nobody wants to play with you outside of ops or an event. I join them regularly and rarely ever come across a teammate unless I'm shopping and even in events we don't acknowledge each other til its over than we go our separate ways.
---
I got a rug!and a table maybe it was a pool table.unless I already had these plans that's what I've gotten
---
Totally agree with you. Strange in numbers gives way more benefits than lone wanderer. Also AngryTurtle even tested empath and I can confirm that it gives you about the same damage reduction as lone wanderer.
---
Just give me Nuka grenades. They are freakin‚Äô awesome.
---
???
---
Good call lol üëç
---
That's either hilarious af or a massive dick move. Or both lmao.
---
Does two-shot only add one pellet?
---
Maybe ask on the official forum? ;-)
---
I saw a low level (9) running around my vendor mule‚Äôs camp (2nd account- I dual client on PC) while I was in the area, so I turned on my mic to get his attention. He came over, so I started checking out his gear. Hooked him up with a full set of legendary level 10 armor (2 very nice pieces that also had AP refresh!) and a fully modded AAE90% level 15 submachinegun, plus 2.7k rounds for it. And a serrated level 10 vampiric switchblade. A longer-term player who turned out to be a friend of his showed up, and we did a few more actual trades. 
---
I told him he better regift that gear in turn; it‚Äôs special!
---
Xbox?how much for that plan?
---
With my build I have 2 Charisma, and can't find anything worth making it 3.
---
Yes, this. I've seen people at Meat Week just standing there AFK.  They couldn't even be bothered to park themselves on a drum.  Infuriating.
---
Iirc, better reduction than lone wanderer.
---
you know if you are going to turn something in or whatever, you can go do the ops and it will spawn you back where you were after its done
---
But why? I think 4 is minimum. Boost from lone wanderer is the best from all possibile perks and if you team play strange in number/inspirational is also almost must have.
---
Butchers bounty perhaps?
---
"hilarious"
---
There is no strawman. There is no backpedaling. 
---
Read what I wrote. I didn‚Äôt say anything about you specifically. I made a generalized statement that **only applies** to those that met the conditions. You jumped the gun and assumed I meant you.
---
If you didn‚Äôt meet the qualifying requirements, then the comment didn‚Äôt apply to you. That‚Äôs simple logic. 
---
I didn‚Äôt imply you were a leech. I made sure that my statement had the specific qualifications.  I didn‚Äôt assume *anything* about you. But you made a faulty assumption about *me*.
---
So if you want to run a nuke and generate a ‚Äònuke-based event‚Äô like Scorched Earth or A Colossal Problem, you can still do so. 
---
Here‚Äôs the important question:
---
**How does Meat Week prevent or dissuade you from grabbing a nuclear keycard, running the silo, and then targeting Fissure Prime or  Monongah Mine?**
---
Hmm what category did you pick if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, maybe mine went to the wrong place.
---
Some people just forget to leave the group after they finish their ops... it‚Äôs a different group form than a lot of the others.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt like the bundle this week.  I thinks it‚Äôs loaded with goodies and I love the lodge theme. I also swear I heard people asking for a hammock and that‚Äôs in there too. This beats the last couple of weeks by far.
---
Unless you get teleported so far away that you leave the event and need to rejoin. Happened to me a few times, I ended up at the last seconds of Earl near Morgantown.
---
No, but we are now more likely to get a barrage of DLCs to pay for...
---
Sure, they may be a bit... slimy though.  For real though, if someone's front door is locked, don't break into it.
---
Yes. 10% of all players get 2 notes from daily ops when they complete it.
---
That wouldn't be a bad incentive to max rep.
---
Max rep and get a nice free ft point as a reward.
---
...like the entire Season right now. Which i kind of love. XD   
---
But i don't use PA so i don't have any interest in it. Womp womp.
---
It was.  He broke into my base, so I broke into his face.
---
Just in your mind...
---
Loan Shark? New economy system coming to Fallout 76 in 2021!
---
I'm trying to build up a good supply of ammo in DO, so I use grenades. You get the ammo for your equipped gun even if they die by grenade,
---
Good for you.
---
Still not going to play with other people. 
---
I'll just enjoy my Fallout 1st subscription.
---
:)
---
I'm on the fence about this one.
---
It can't be traded
---
Why not? It's a really good location for xp and legendaries.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Question; what would you rename it, if you could?
---
But are they not stacking? Once i was on team with at least 3 shared and i swear i could jump much higher.
---
You just said west tek was better, I literally only run west tek.
---
Perhaps the stars aligned in a good way, because I also got three rewards in one go today (never happened before): caged bulbs, vault 94 jumpsuit and whistle in the dark.
---
Scruple
---
C'mon join my team it'll be fun, I'll share cannibal and leave your camp door open.
---
Would it be possible for Bethesda to make killing a shazoo a crime?
---
I love being able to have pets. I have my deathclaw. (: I named him Jack.
---
I believe you can drop it, right?  It will just destroy the note?
---
i would love to buy those gun display racks, but i wont because every time they have a display case or something to display your items theres a bug that comes along with it that lets ppl take your items that where not for sale for free 
---
im not risking my legacy guns just to show some guns on the wall 
---
and its not really worth showing them off if the game doesn't show the person looking at them what they are you have to label them, and then its just a matter of taking someones word on it 
---
this is a bloodied explosive faster reload fixer... actually a lvl 20 reg fixer made by the person putting it on the wall
---
1. Get scrapper perk, run somewhere like West tek with lots of guns and scrap everything.
---
2. Get excavator armour and go run lucky mine, you will get about 400 lead ore. 
---
3. Get acid from anywhere you can. Vendors, cave crickets, yaogauis, anything. Project paradise is good for this. 
---
4. Get super duper perk (in Luck) and equip it. 
---
5. Go to the book House in summerville and pick up allllll the books to scrap.
---
6. Chem bench, make lead scrap and gun powder.
---
7. Get ranks in ammo factory. 
---
8. Make ammo by the truckload. 
---
9. Repeat :)
---
Cute name!  Is that from any reference we might know?  It sounds very familiar for some reason.
---
I have zero respect for whinging babies crying over a dead cow jeez dude get a grip if I kill your cow just shoot me dead but all you whingers wouldn't as your probably vegan woke pascifists , and even if you did I guarantee the cow would put up more of a fight ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Good rule of thumb: don't ask "is anyone else having (problem)?" 
---
Because chances are you are nowhere near the first person to post about that problem.
---
I think you might be wasting time my friend. Half of the servers I get on Westek has already been cleared out, so I have to waste more time getting on another server. It's much easier to farm two or three locations and then hop.
---
I'm sure anxiety is it for some people. I can't speak for anyone else, but for me it's not anxiety, it's simply a lack of desire to interact with people. I know this game has a great reputation, but there are shitbags all over the place, in this game and elsewhere on the internet. Outside of a few people I enjoy interacting with, I just have no desire to be social most of the time. I have to do enough of that at work.
---
oh that must be tough im sorry to hear
---
It's almost never empty for me.  I'd say maybe 95% there are enemies.
---
On Xbox I‚Äôve been in a few events with people using Tesla‚Äôs and it seems to have been fixed. I even sought out groups of the ash piles to see if they would trigger the visual glitch, and they didn‚Äôt.
---
Glad to help; it's a PITA especially if you are pretty far along.
---
I like grenades so I'm fine with it.
---
I don‚Äôt use that perk card. I like canned goods better simply because they don‚Äôt spoil.
---
Not if I don‚Äôt have a spare perk card to level, I can‚Äôt.
---
Then rock on but I get bored as hell just going through one location over and over and over
---
If soemone has their vendors powered, and behind locked doors, I'm definitely going to be picking locks.
---
It doesn't and I never said it did. I said less people would be dropping them meaning less frequent ACP or Scorched Earth. It was a simple point that really doesn't warrant the level of scrutiny you are giving it at this point honestly. We're done here.
---
Good point! 
---
Though strange in numbers does not impact Empath, check Angry Turtles video about it for info.
---
Hey at this point I wouldn't mind. 1.3k hours into a game that cost 30 bucks is a pretty good return on investment
---
I don't even have vendors, just a regular camp, no reason to come in.
---
Anyone get the Barell Fridge going?
---
wondering is it weak like the ttainless fridge.
---
Yes absolutely. A lot of time left
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. Empath makes you take more damage, not less. It makes your teamates take less
---
It‚Äôs not one location though! There is a location in every biome, different creatures in each one so you can choose to do the ones where you get the resources you need
---
I was happening to me from the start of Season 2, but as of last night it had stopped.
---
Each letter is just shy taller than a Nuka Cola bottle and each sucks up a lot of budget space. 
---
Not worth it if u ask me.
---
70 day schedule
---
I though that it did though.  Normally it gives 25, with SIN if gives 33.
---
I got nothing 3/6 days and shit plans the other 3 and then yesterday I got the war glance. Hopefully I‚Äôll have good luck again today
---
"scru¬∑ple
---
a feeling of doubt or hesitation with regard to the morality or propriety of a course of action."
---
Haha no reference to anything, just seems like a fitting name for a fo76 creature.
---
I dont think it got hit hard enough. We the players are the ones constantly nuking shit for fun. The only evidence of this really is the fire wall in NW
---
Might I ask how one gets a cow?
---
Yes, it does.  Watch angry turtle's video on it.
---
I tend to just stand right where op's picture is taken, no need to reach all sides if everything just comes to you :p (they always pass through that alley, if solo they will pass by there after taking down the other objectives)
---
what if we got power armor shaped like a deathclaw! patent pending
---
How about you play how you want and don't put others down for how they want to play. Ultimately it won't affect you either way right? How others play(or travel) has no effect on you. You can still keep traveling by foot as will I. It's really as simple as that.
---
I know. But if the tracker is already at 46%, i'm grabbing it first. I'm not going to turn it in, but I am going to get the item. Same for the technical data. If I'm at the fort, I'm going to kill the ghouls and turn it in. 
---
I guess thinking about it, I'll finish whatever I'm doing where I'm at (Baring a dungeon that I've only just started), but I won't fast travel anywhere (Except maybe my base to stash junk).
---
You got a valid point. I think the DMV is my favorite because I pull more legendaries out of it than anywhere else
---
Check if the items are broken go 2 your c.a.m.p thing you placed down and should say repair all or somthing like that
---
I know right! doesn't the door glitch still work?
---
Hey someone caught it lol I figured everyone might overlooked it.
---
They don‚Äôt like you either. Haha
---
Geez, apparently sharing correct information offended some people...  So many downvotes for a correct response.
---
But it‚Äôs fine to tell me how I have to be. 
---
Maybe no one wants the tenderiser plan now since Beth made melee weapons trash tier with patch 22.
---
What? I use a lot of grenades in ops. I appreciate getting some back.
---
Bro, the recliner is sick. Jump on the recliner and go into photo mode
---
TIL there are selfless, Rank 5 perk share-angels.
---
Yeah us launching the nukes caused the fire do to pyro plastic  so we went into vault 51 and had to kill each other so technically vault 51 was supposed to be the end of us.   But those people at vault 76 said Virginia is a hot zone i mean Washington DC is in Virginia so you would expect Virginia to be bad which sucks cause i live in Virginia.
---
I did it under billing
---
&gt;!A new ally will be introduced with the Steel Dawn, Solomon Hardy, a BOS combat medic.!&lt;
---
It will destroy it if i drop it thats what the menu says
---
Server-wide rad storm on every nuke drop? Nukes get dropped like every 15-30 minutes, this would make the game unplayable if you‚Äôre not in a hazmat suit or power armor. As it stands, if there‚Äôs a rad storm in the area of a quest I‚Äôm working on, I just swap servers.
---
Who ever said the residents of 76 were human?
---
I mean nothing better than a couple level 100 mole rats eating your ass
---
Recliner is pretty sweet - your character lounges in it
---
I‚Äôm sure you already do but make sure you trigger the desks using the computer , I do B on the way in and c on the way out.. usually get legendaries from those
---
Right?  But I'm used to it.
---
Please tell me you‚Äôre on XB.
---
As a lower level player, I am a little nervous to jump into daily ops. I don't wanna be the guys who holds the group back or anything and I feel like I still gotta beter guns and armor and all that jazz.
---
Idk, I don't care.  All I know is I saw a wanted person at my camp, so I fast traveled there and invoked castle doctrine.
---
What about the outfit displays!
---
They still need electricity to the wall or object they are placed on, mine were working fine last night.
---
That's right. My point was if you focus on killing the sheepsquach VS protecting the brahmin you always get xp and a legendary &amp; might get event success reward as a bonus. 
---
The other way around you might get event completion reward &amp; might be lucky enough to have enough time to hit the sheepsquach.
---
For someone who only cares about legendaries, you always get rewarded. No such guarantee for the guy wanting to complete the event. 
---
That's why event reward incentives is messed up. If getting that sheepsquach xp &amp; legendary was entirely dependent on successful event completion, you watch how hard that legend chaser works to ensure those brahmin stay alive while you are guaranteed to get legendary.
---
BoS is keeping them and will sell us only if you max your reputation. Just wait for their arrival.
---
You heard it first!
---
Thanks, I think I did item.  I‚Äôll try to resubmit.  Take care!
---
I think it will depend on when the AWS service contract ends.  AWS offer  multi year discounts. When the current contract ends, I would expect them to have things moved by then.  For now I can see them using both AWS and Azure.
---
I just don't care. Xp isn't even remotely hard to get in this game and my gf and I like to sit in a party of our own where we can chat and not have other people listening in.
---
I don't even care about the meat anymore.. just the XPs
---
Why does it matter if other people are dropping them less frequently?  You know you can start ACP or SE on your own.  Why does it matter if you do it or someone else does it?
---
Why does what anyone else chooses to do in the game matter at all to you?
---
I really want the slasher clown outfit to make a return
---
Or at least the clean clown outfit
---
I said backpacks but OK.
---
What I wouldn‚Äôt give for just that plan
---
Looks like I'm robbing a few banks around Appalachia this week.
---
This is awesome thank you
---
Do they have power? Do you have a conduit or power radiator nearby?
---
I know, I was hoping they would come with the season but I think the datamines said atx
---
But it kicked me when I tried to milk it, it declared me war first...
---
Damn that's lucky!
---
Man this event is pretty nice. You get mad materials from the side missions loot and then some random stuff at the end of the main one if you're lucky and I still dont know how the legendary one is given out yet. But overall I opened 4 lunchboxes boosting my xp 100% and have leveled up more today than the last 2 weeks of grinding. Shits on point. Meat weeks awesome
---
&gt;Empath
---
doesnt empath only apply to damage reduction to teammates? and makes you in fact take more damage?
---
Ehhhh i guess so
---
Same here. If you don't do that the location is just average.  It's those extra 20 ghouls and the sheer number of legendaries that push the DMV to Elite status.
---
No i will never stop lol this is my enjoyment.
---
I have definitely joined a team just so I could have a free fast travel point on the other side of the map close to the next objective in a quest line I was working on.
---
So, even though being on a public team simply offers you player benefits, and it requires no interaction with others (I literally never even see the people I'm on a team with), you're going to refuse to play on a server with others, even though it would benefit you, because...reasons?  You realize you're missing out on player vending, multiple perk and mutation bonuses, bosses, and more, right?  Not *everything* is better on a private server.
---
Also, why are you refusing to play with other people in an MMO?  You could just go play Fallout 4 or something and get the same experience.  The 76 community is one of the main reasons to even play this busted pile of bugs.
---
I woundt mind if thatvwas the case
---
If you are on PS4 i will give you a regular supply. :-)
---
I dumped 20 today.
---
From my point of view the molerats are evil!
---
I just like to play by myself. I don‚Äôt need more XP. I‚Äôve finished my build. I‚Äôm lvl 251. Playing since beta. Just wanted to share a reason why someone might not join a public team.
---
I will however join a team for daily ops, but that‚Äôs because my stealth build doesn‚Äôt work very well for uplink.
---
PC, read the post, the issuebis you cant trade or drop or do anything with this plan and thats BS
---
Except the Floater grenades everybody is talking about aren't tradable
---
That would be disappointing its the first time I ever had to worry about getting killed much. For the first time ever I have to plan fights and take things into consideration.
---
My base is semi north in savage divide and I see them fairly regularly.  Although like someone else posted above they don't last that long.
---
Sounds like we're getting new allies with the BOS DLC.
---
Oops.  Thought it was 1 score level per day.
---
I corrected my post.
---
Collision Course at the Morgantown airport usually rewards 100 pre-war dollars, just walk over and it should start for you.
---
just lights up
---
I would love to give it to someone who wants it, but im stuck with it instead og getting something i actually want like the solar generator or fusion generator or symptomatic or foosball table or literally anything else that i havent already earned maybe
---
No but they are op. I collect them.
---
Worked fine for me today.
---
What i wouldnt give to be able to give it to someone else
---
If you see the Back on the Beat event in Morgantown, one of the safe houses is a bank.
---
You might want to hold on to it, on the off-chance that BGS allows us to trade between our own characters.
---
Imagine a double xp with 4 lunchboxes... Crazy xp. I actually level a couple of times when I play now, where as it used to take a good few days before I'd see a level.
---
Zachychan.! Well that puts a damper on things then.i thought I had seen some one talking about he was transfering items between his main and alt.might of been talking about the suit and mask then
---
OP milking this for all its worth :-)
---
Its not so much the ass eating that bothers me, its that they infect it with parasites when theyre done.
---
Some people only want to do it one time. Others wanna run it 9826639 times.
---
Wait, you don't like common Fasnacht's masks for 3k or ultracite scrap for 40 caps? :o
---
Deathclaw at the power junction north of Watoga. Scorchbeast in your favorite location. Grafton by Charleston, and Sheepsquatch during the Primal Cuts in the Ash Heap.
---
Yeah I remember.
---
oh you better believe there were lunchboxes involved. And canned meat stew and sleep bonus as well.
---
Despite how it looks in the atom shop photo, they both have yellow lights. I just built them right next to each other in my camp, can confirm.
---
I'd be happy with a tick box list to auto drop grenades missiles and mini nukes.
---
Are you stupid or illiterate? I didn't tell you how to be, I told you to enjoy the game the way you want.
---
It's a great easy source of addictol, that's why I always used to do it.
---
Rodger that broski thanks
---
I‚Äôve never seen this challenge before. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs new, but I‚Äôm going to save all my pre-war money from now on.
---
Nice! I'm still grinding for the War Glave!
---
I don‚Äôt know many times I‚Äôve killed myself trying to kill them with my explodey weapons. üò¨
---
Can‚Äôt they be sold?
---
We're looking into these reports, thanks for the post!
---
Yeah true that
---
But you use fixer and handmade. 2 of the meta weapons. BTW, just to clarify, Totally fine with anybody using them or any other thing. This is not about saying you cant use X weapon. But my point is, you wouldnt think of using revolvers right? You wouldnt think of using pistol or smg. Because they are not there, at that level. Even if thats the style of weapon you WANT to use, they are just not that viable. Maybe viable is not the word.. because they are viable, but they DO require twice or thrice the effort compared to another "same tier" weapon. For example, the western revolver. It should be as used and popular between revolver users as the fixer or hansmade for rifle users. However, revolver users are "forced" to use fixers or handmades to be on par/competitive/feel useful.
---
What I mean is, there is a bad meta in FO76. Imo, there are 2 types of meta:
---
First case of meta is Meta as in the meaning of the word. Most Eficient. Where everything is fine, but something is better than the other. This is what I expect of a game. Everything viable. Everything fun, as long as you play a style you like.
---
Then, you have the 2nd "definition" of meta. Required equipment/playstyle.. Things that are preceived to be needed to have fun or just simply to be "viable" to play.
---
And FO76 is the 2nd type of meta. I dont think there is any doubt of it, or we would see more people using non-meta equipment/playstyles.
---
Yup. üòÅ Add a 5* Explosive Expert for a bit more oomph.

I just watched it, and empath makes you take more damage, first half of the video he is clearly showing it...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqwoKVJQ46A)
---
Here are test results of getting hit 10 times by a super mutant from the video:77 damage taken solo without empath or lone wanderer57 damage taken solo without empath and with lone wanderer114 damage taken solo with empath84 damage taken solo with empath and lone wanderer77 damage taken on a team only me with empath67 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath67 damage taken on a team me and 2 other people with empath46 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus empath serum active45 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus empath serum active, plus strange in numbers (not working on empath but works on scaly skin that's why 1 less dmg taken)58 damage taken on a team only me with empath plus class freak equiped51 damage taken on a team me and other person with empath plus class freak equiped
---
The only situation where you take less dmg with empath than with lone wanderer is when someone else has it
---
I like to try and get 4 before I quit for the night.  When I am done with ops I quit the team and either stop playing for the night or vendor hop
---
Really couldn't care less bud
---
Fallout 1st gives me the option to play solo, I'm gonna play solo. 
---
I wonder the same thing.  From looking at the comments briefly, I see a few people stating they have 1st ... just so they don't have to play with others.  I can understand this, I've been the loner type in the past, and still that way to some degree.  But if you're already in public... I do tend to wonder the same thing... I join other players teams the moment I get on a public .. or I make my own, I sign my mule on sharing a 3\* Inspirational, my wife comes on sharing the same card (it stacks in case you guys didn't know) and sometimes, that 4th slot is just available (for hours sometimes) and it baffles me... I have often thought when this scenario plays out - I guess no one on this server wants to level up?
---
It's been there from the beginning. It's one of the few events you can reliably trigger just by walking up to the area.
---
But if you have all three drums you get an extra boost
---
Your Good with Salt must have Good with Salt.
---
Looks like my conduit was incomplete. Nice one
---
AP regen is a joke if you have the right foods.  Steeped Fever Blossom Tea and Company Tea (especially with Herbivore) do more than any AP regen perk.  You AND your whole team take 25% less damage with Empath.  And since you're on a team, why not an extra +3 to all S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats with Herd Mentality?
---
Lone Wanderer is good early on but it gets outclassed pretty hard in the end game.
---
It‚Äôs definitely a fun name!
---
We're investigating these reports to see why this is triggering for some people and not others. I don't have an update just yet but we're looking into it!

---
no this is the same loot pool as last Meat Week
---
I've done this, and it didn't work. I'm currently reinstalling my game to see if that gets rid of it. 
---
I reinstalled once before but I guess it kept the files, so I deleted all of the files the 2nd time around.
---
I got the war glaive day one and liquid courage two and nothing since
---
The op is great for certain types of ammo, less so for others. For example, using 5mm in there is pretty good as you seem to get 10-60 rounds off a corpse...but if you use a LMG you only get a few rounds per corpse and with it's rate of fire you go through a LOT of ammo fast. 
---
Honestly I think the system works pretty well (and maybe could be expanded to one or two other events) - but it would be nice if the amount of ammo you received was a little bit better for certain types.
---
Collision Course at the Morgantown Airport usually drops a ton of pre-war money in the crate.
---
Forgot about that. Die all you want OP.
---
Pleeeeease enclave stuff
---
This is incorrect.  Empath makes your team AND you take 25% less damage.  It doesn't specifically state in the description that you gain the bonus as well, but if you test it you'll see that it does.  You only take more damage if you are NOT on a team.  And Class Freak reduces the extra damage you take.
---
There‚Äôs an animatronic clown now under Floor Displays. It‚Äôs locked for me too.
---
I don't recall this being mentioned anywhere, and links?
---
I‚Äôll have to watch his video I thought that it affected your team not you
---
&gt;In reality, you cant eat an entire jar of salt at once without dying
---
It‚Äôs same as meat week last month, it is different from 2019 meat week
---
I mean you have to go there for more nuke card locations, don't you? I've only launched a few
---
i was a dedicated full health rifleman on my main character for a long time. i can't believe the difference just swapping out Rifleman for Commando cards did, i'll never look back.
---
Build a fertilizer and that's it. A brahmin will spawn.
---
In game terminals will now be running Windows 10.
---
Oh it‚Äôs fantastic, and not just for XP. I got 7 legendaries from it last night; running it alone I usually still get at least a couple, but with a few other players there, the increased spawns mean increased legendaries! I generally post up on top of the pagoda in the middle with my BE tri-barrel Minigun and just hose everything down. Minigun has laserlike accuracy at those ranges (with Stabilized active) and the explosive effect means even if I don‚Äôt hit them, I hit them (full explosive spec‚Äôd as well.) It was super easy to solo pre-P22; I can still solo it post P22 but I have to be a lot more on my game. And if there‚Äôs other players? I just hose them all down a little bit, let others get kill credit too.
---
Nothing wrong with that.  Not trying to have you not team up if you want to, but I wouldn't skip out on the event if you aren't grouped up either.  You can get a good chunk of xp from those events and get some levels out of it.
---
"Team mates" includes you for some reason.  With the correct perks, you can get the extra damage you take down to 8%, while reducing damage by 33%, including for yourself.  Over all, you take less damage.
---
Yeah it was never underrated, everyone knew it was a great farm.
---
As much as this feels like a scummy thing, the difference is this time it's warranted. Many people buy this without happening to see a reddit post warning you it's broken. If it's put up for sale, whether through atoms you earned in game or real money, it should be ready to go. If they get enough support tickets for refunds it should make them adjust their process to be stricter towards testing before selling. Should. Until then I guess you may as well intentionally benefit off it
---
I‚Äôm talking about the challenge. Not the event.
---
they don't call it "second helping" for nothing
---
I have to wonder how many people on here refusing to play on a team are the same people who've been complaining about update 22 making the game too hard.  I imagine there is some significant overlap.
---
Except, well, once you're done with the rep, why would you come back to this fast travel point?
---
"here's something that could have been useful, but we gate it behind every point it would actually be useful"
---
thx
---
The spits give a boost as well for keeping them turning as well.
---
Ugh... I didn't know this stuff was untradeable. Was hoping to make some caps on the plans once I got everything for myself.
---
Use nukes and dragons and post your build. I have serious damage output. Never need food and drink. Carry 10‚Äôs of thousands of 3 different ammo types and have 420 carry weight 460 in excavator. I‚Äôm not sure what else you‚Äôd want from a build tbh.
---
Goodluck kid
---
Don't sweat it I can tell when someone is exaggerating for effect. xD
---
I dunno. My caps maxed out by the time I was at level 50. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really an issue.
---
Lol. No. I don‚Äôt care.
---
My worst alt leveled up three times between two meat cooks before breakfast and that included a daily op.
---
I've been in a few this week alone. I had one come up out of nowhere while I was trying to line up a shot on a scorched. Suddenly game got a bit darker, I was wondering if my positioning put me into the shadows, then I look around and see the green glow start to emerge in the sky. It's all luck, but I remember they made rad storms more common after constant complaints with that one survival weapon that had a requirement for doing stuff in rad storms
---
Maybe try looking at it from the perspective of the mode only came out last week and it would be pretty disappointing to get every reward from it that week.
---
Ah, my bad.
---
Haven't tried it yet but seeing reports the wall weapon racks are broken and don't snap to walls properly, might be worth noting since atom shop items are broken so consistently
---
I did a Service Ticket Sunday and Left 2 videos of it happening when i hit level 32 and then level 33, both starting around level 5 or 6 (I think) in the video but they started at level 1 and both took about 6+ mins to finish.... I am almost at Level 34 so here is to being Hopeful!
---
That's from the treasure hunter pails coming up.
---
Once Bethesda announce that fo76 will be re released on next gen then they will defo let us transfer characters.
---
Yay! Enjoy Meat Week: The Second Helping!
---
What perk are you sharing?  Is that what could be causing it?
---
Me and my friends have been server wide dc-ing since Friday night on xbox. It seems to be getting more frequent which leads me to believe it's being caused intentionally,  probably dupe related.  
---
So frequently that I'm pretty sure my character will be at the title screen when I get home rather than turning a spit where I left him.

 &gt; Yay! Enjoy Meat Week: The Second Helping!

No to what? Use your words, you're not a child are you so speak full sentences so I know wtf you mean. I never asked if you cared so I'll just assume both
---
There‚Äôs no point in going there though, no human npcs, no new items. BOS will be different.
---
Yeah i have its in my stash hoping they change the rukes that apply to this one
---
Wow that‚Äôs some Far-flung teleportation üëç
---
A team mate sharing it?
---
That‚Äôs my next wish &lt;3. It‚Äôs so pretty. I need it.
---
The difference in his video was 1 point of damage.  In my testing, it was 0.  That's margin for error.  If you have empath and class freak, you get the same damage reduction that you get with lone wanderer, plus you get all the other benefits of being on a team.
---
Ooh what‚Äôs liquid courage?
---
because you'd have threads on here complaining about the constant daily ops alerts
---
Exactly, I'm loving the free travels to the other 2. Saved me so much caps
---
I‚Äôm rooting for you!
---
It really doesn‚Äôt. 20% less damage for any build is extremely useful
---
nice reference  :)
---
Somewhat along these same lines, if you see a team of 3 in a group join up and come along. Even if you aren't 50+, I'd much rather have a 4th body on the point. All the better that we can help you gear and gain a bit
---
I would like a side quest to become the Governor of West Virginia.  My first act as would be to pardon Mad Dog, under the condition he and his gang join the Diehards up at Crater.
---
My second act would be to fire/dismantle the warden for gross ineptitude and negligence of the prison facility.   That place is an utter mess, its as if the ghouls are running the place.
---
Get em KONK!!! Take these INTERLOPERS back to school and LEAVE THEM THERE! Mwuahahaah!!!!!
---
Noice. The caged bulbs look pretty sweet I think. Kinda steampunk aesthetic.
---
I‚Äôm about to do one, I‚Äôll reply with what I get
---
Got like 3 in 1 hour the other day
---
Sounds like you took one for the team! It's that legendary perk causing this.
---
Well if they make too many free fast travel spots it waters down that aspect of the game.Now after this if they make the purveyor free that will cover most of the map.So caps will not be a big concern and people will complain more that they have nothing to use caps on.Getting to the point that they should just remove them from the game entirely.
---
the PVP bug is what caused it. Turn pacifist mode on.
---
Oh please say you checked to make sure you have pacifist on - otherwise prepare for ridicule....
---
It's funny, I used a deathclaw gauntlet to fight a couple of wolf packs (heavy weapon character so no perks to slow damage to weapons) and it went from regular full health down to just under a quarter really fast...I thought maybe I had just imagined it or made a mistake somewhere on how fast it had been damage, glad it wasn't just my imagination.
---
Corn soup FTW. Ez to make and good AP regen with no action boy/lone wanderer/ap refresh.
---
I don't understand the drive behind making Foundation, the Crater, or the BOS HQ free fast travel points.  Other than once or twice (and only for a few hours each time) after bad decision vendor purchases have I ever had so few caps that I even thought about fast travel fees.  Am I just weird in that regard?
---
They're more or less the same size of the base game neon letters. They are good if you have several toons and want letters in your CAMP from the start because the base ones are very expensive in caps...
---
Hope so. Didn't see the Microsoft announcement coming, tbh. Who knows though. It's all speculation at this point.
---
Your character isn't stored on your PS4, it's stored on Bethesda's servers.
---
Lol the wasteland cares nothing for your hopes.
---
MMO = **Massive** Multiplayer Online
---
Fallout 76 is not Massive on the multiplayer scale. It is an online multiplayer RPG, but not an MMO.
---
Man, I'm with you.  This kind of shit is the reason I mostly read in /r/fo76FilthyCasuals and unsubbed from here, only checking this sub when I need to know something specific and current.
---
I wish the "Reward Unlocked" notification thing wasn't directly in the middle of the screen. It makes it so hard when I get this bug while im playing and I cant see what's directly in front of me because of it. It's a pain in the ass when I'm trying to pick up something and then that pops up and blocks my view.
---
FYI it's a triggered event, you need to go there to get it to appear.
---
feeds into profits from needing to maintain gear more often, etc  ;)
---
Looked in my notes and discovered I had the new generator and the War Glave plan.
---
Are you donating it or looking to swap?
---
Wrong redit channel my friend. You want the market redit for pc that's two channels over üôÇ
---
Say what now??? Does this stack with cranberry relish?
---
Unrelated but this comment just triggered a massive wave of deja-vu. So disorienting.
---
Yeah same. Happened 3 times now
---
You're getting downvotes but you're 100% correct. Empathy + strange in numbers + class freak will be much more beneficial than lone wanderer
---
Can you link the guide you mentioned?
---
You do realise casual public teams are allowing people to free fast travel all over the map meaning exploration is way easier
---
Honestly if I had to explore the whole map by walking from one side to the other I would have probably quit, I explored the whole of the forest region then some high level peeps adopted me and showed me the way of the heavy gunner power armour build and took me to places I'd never been before spread across the map so when I had a quest I could fast travel to the nearest location to the quest and walk from there.
---
If you plan on doing similar; watoga, whitesprings, westek, foundation, crater, the rusty pick, Arkos pharma, Charleston capital building are all good places
---
...has escaped................... again
---
Thank you for the response. Glad to know you guys are on it.
---
Very nice
---
Same but I still run it for stims now and again so it‚Äôs worth it overall for me even without a rare drop.
---
sounds like you are using either steam or game-pass. they have different filenames and directories.
---
Oh sweet, thanks for sharing. I figured they wouldn't have a proper animation for it and you'd clip through it funny. If they properly lounge though, that's pretty nice.
---
Damn all these salty nut heads are opposed to a good idea. Amazes me how toxic this sub can be, thankfully it‚Äôs only a small minority compared to those who actually play.
---
i just turned in 4 claim tickets at top of the world's ski resort
---
I would still love if mobs in rad storms had a low chance to drop stabilizing mats. And then make an area around a nuke zone a nuke storm zone (maybe the whole zone the nuke was in)
---
Someone doesn't wanna be at the top of the food chain anymore....just add jetpacks and guass mini guns on its arm why don't cha.
---
You think it is over for sony players? Or will MS keep us in the loop?
---
So even if I'm the only one with empath with SIN and class freak I take less damage than if I'm solo without lone wanderer, nice I'll get that mutation.
---
And what about the mutation of the extra 2+ SPECIAL?
---
Does this mean the mole rat in the toilet is also level 100? Because that one is literally eating your ass
---
Not really, I've been posting pictures of the rewards as I get them. I'll take that part out to quell confusion.
---
This is great!
---
Your a moron and don‚Äôt deserve much of a response
---
fair warning: it's a much different game now. For some, much better. For others, a lot harder.
---
The number changes, but the effect does not, its just a UI thing.

 &gt; This is great!

Truly?

Yeah, I was super excited for ammo factory only to find out that with Daily Ops you'll never need to craft ammo, lol
---
ü§î You don't know until you try
---
WELL THEN YOU ARE LOST!
---
I actually have no idea. I couldn't find if under drinks or chems so it must be an alcohol. And I don't have the plans for the brewing station lol.
---
This was briefly talked about.  Supposedly we are getting free upgrades from gens 4 to 5 on both consoles eventually (provided you have a valid game and account) but your old PS4 disc will work in the interim unless you were a silly boy and purchased the digital only console.
---
Radstorms aren't *that* bad, you might go through one radaway or rad-x, it's certainly not as bad as standing in a nuke zone.
---
My life is great. I don‚Äôt need luck. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game while all of you think your insulting me. 
---
Lol.
---
I'll get that mutation, and the other mutation of the 2+ SPECIAL works if I'm just in a team alone or do I need at least one member?
---
I did now
---
What does the Microsoft announcement have to do with this?
---
Just get the xbox game pass it's cheaper to check it out and lots of other games as well.
---
Sorry, didn't mean to confuse. If anything I'd like it to go to someone that was desperate for it. I think I had someone yesterday that wanted it for a build but wasn't lucky with drops. I'll check on them.
---
Nice! I just got the War Glaive today after 3 dry days in a row. 
---
Will have to get a mod tomorrow bc the bare version doesnt stack up in damage to my electric sheep staff or super sledge.
---
Depends, what do you consider non-human?
---
Totally unrelated, does anyone know if Penny Hornwright is single? Asking for a friend.
---
According to the wiki:
---
"It can also be obtained by Mortimer with a friendly Raiders reputation for 1250 Bullion"
---
If you haven't finished the wastelanders quest yet you cant get it yet.
---
Sorry, poorly worded. Go full auto.  Pre 22  semi is viable, but post full auto. I only use semi on Gauss rifles.
---
There isn't any incentive to test or stop selling broken stuff in the Atom Shop, so they keep doing what they do. There's something broken that is just blatantly untested in every Atom shop release, always has been, always will be as long as folks keep buying. Please, please, please issue support tickets and get refunds, otherwise this cycle will repeat forever.
---
Nobody would be any more weird than the actual governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice. That name sounds like someone who would not accept a single prison break.
---
I dont think you know what a foodie is or a food build is lol. Because those are two different things and I am neither. 
---
Also I wouldn't call that triggered. I'd call your first reply to my comment being tirggered. Based on how condescending you tried to be. 
---
Also, no one goes looking for pvp except all 3 people who like it.
---
I agree. OW should have left the Forrest alone except for events imo.
---
I haven‚Äôt ever seen someone share it, and nobody is sharing it in the team I‚Äôm in.
---
I think he means how much weight you carry, in case you didn't know, how heavy your armor is and carry weight can effect your sneak!
---
Gotcha. Gonna start now...
---
Not bad. Also a great spot to farm Aluminum
---
Players shouldn't be able to damage your camp items (brahmin is a wierd exception to this) if you are not engaged in pvp with them. If you have pacifist on you will never engage in pvp with anyone so your camp should be safe.
---
Now, I've heard that there is some weird stuff with the take one for the team perk that allows others to engage in pvp with you. There is also workshops that enable pvp, but outside of those I can't think of any other ways for players to engage you in pvp with pacifist on. 
---
I have had pacifist on for a long time and no one has been able to kill my pet or my camp so far.
---
PSA: this has been already posted about several times today.
---
Sounds good to me
---
Bethesda: More handmade skins? Coming right up! That thing is pretty heavy when fully modded after all.
---
I would love something cool for my ultracite gatling laser, though...
---
Guess I‚Äôm taking one for the team then
---
Nah fo76 and ps5 players are all good. Fo76 came our way before the MS purchase
---
Hmm... I might slowly switch over time, but I used to run a lever action, so I only have the semi auto perks. But eventually I‚Äôll switch. Auto looks more fun anyways

How bout some more super sledge skins?

Lol i mentioned i own the game on xbox but wondering if the game is worth playing/repurchasing
---
Are you casual or meta bound? Also do you mic up?
---
Sounds like a noble quest, let me know if it didnt go as planned ;-)
---
Yep. It was broken for a while when vending machines launched, but at that point people couldn't even see second/third star legendary effects yet. I was selling a bloodied ffr handmade for 12k and I remember some guy following me around the map trying to ask what the other effects were. Then they made menus better, and they eventually fixed this, but they broke it again soon after
---
I'd love if they were just able to emote back. Even better if they have different responses based on what kind of NPC they are.
---
If Bethesda was smart, it'd be a good way to advertise Atom Shop emotes.
---
I dont think I'm insulting you. 
---
You just dont make sense. Also being spoiled doesn't mean you have a great life. Maybe now sure but in 10 years you'll be paying for it.

The gamepass covers pc as well bro.

---
Is a pretty good build for exploration and just going around. Im quite happy with it, but it feels lackluster. The 2nd day of the ops, i needed around 30 shots of final word to kill a single basic blood eagle. 30. Most of them headshots.
---
Keep in mind my playstyle affects this build. I like using variety of weapons. Im a scavenger, I use whatever i can, as long as its half decent. Shotguns, smgs, pistols, rifles, anything goes. I use the best of its class, but i like changing weapon classes. I like being a balance between damage, utility and defense. I dont like over-specialization. I use serendipity for when im in a bad spot or someone surprises me at low health. I use armor penetration or limb damage perks to get that extra damage and utility you need when at high level, without the "lazy" +10% damage.
---
I dislike power armor, but I use it by changing a few perks when i deal with endgame stuff. This is the build for it: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e65aa56&amp;d=eh2ek1pp2pe2c22cu0cr0c72c50s12s22sw2s01ss2se2ls2a80ib2l22ip2as2a70i10&amp;n=POWER](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e65aa56&amp;d=eh2ek1pp2pe2c22cu0cr0c72c50s12s22sw2s01ss2se2ls2a80ib2l22ip2as2a70i10&amp;n=POWER)
---
I dont see any build problem outside lack of meta legendary effects, because rng/dislike of certain legendary effects (I use double shot/explosive as an prefered legendary effect, but not bloodied, for example) and lack of +% damage perks. Because if that +% damage for every weapon its a requirement, the devs SHOULD buff the weapons and ditch those perks. Is just wasting perk slots and giving false sense of choice. 
---
Edit: also, dislike chems outside of healing chems, so I dont use psycho and that stuff.
---
How the fuck could Bethesda get any worse? Satan owning them would be an improvement and now that Obsidian and the Fallout IP are owned by Microsoft, there might be a New Vegas Revisited future, or at least a chance. I'll never own an Xbox, I'm a PC man, but most Fallout Fan would agree New Vegas (developed by Obsidian) was the best Fallout game, and now that Dev and that IP are living in the same house.
---
Source on that "free upgrade" info? All I have heard is that PS4 games will be playable on the PS5 with backwards compatibility.
---
I would love some help! I am having the damndest time trying to find and keep aluminum!
---
I didn't know it did for fo76, thanks
---
It's always going to happen. Some people don't care and will never care. Been a frequent complaint here about encryptid for over a year and it's not ever going to change. The day before fallout 76 dies forever, people will still be complaining about bad teams of randoms
---
Because I dont need lone wanderer since j always join or make a public team.I just need hard bargain 3 for sales. And exp comes easy as is
---
I usually see a few every week.
---
For the glowing creatures challenge, there are usually quite a few radroaches near Hemlock Holes that tend to be either diseased or glowing.
---
There are a few under the power pylon, just south of the workshop. The rest are scattered in the general area south of Hemlock Holes.
---
You‚Äôre not insulting me but then you suggest I‚Äôm spoiled? Lol
---
Since we are already getting those things that were datamined at the same time I think it's safe to assume it won't be taking long. Save your atoms.

I play with my wife so I always have a mate when we are both home. I do understand your pain though while she isn‚Äôt home I have no one to play with hence why I do the event by myself lol but it‚Äôs whatever mate

I seal team 6 in the back door quiet like....get the caps then announce my presence with authority as I take out the wardens handies and the rest of the super baddies out front.
---
Caged bulb lights and super reactor. Thanks for the luck and hope you get something good too
---
Happened to me because I hadn't claimed of the score rewards yet. Once I did then it stopped doing it.
---
I‚Äôm in agreement. I look forward to the weekly change to unload caps with Smiley. I think it only costs 60-80 caps to travel across the map. And if I remember the cost scaled with level. Sell 3 combat rifles you‚Äôve looted to a vendor and you get your travel costs back.
---
I usually see one every 3 or 4 play sessions.
---
I‚Äôm sharing Class Freak
---
Fitting name, post on Beth forum
---
So many games other then that to check out as well. Can probably get 1 month first a buck if you've never had it before.
---
I discovered farming sim was enjoyable from the game pass.
---
It's nice they took care of you and you got your account back and all, but this sort of behavior from them in this first place is unacceptable. It isn't the first time something like this happened and it sadly won't be the last. How hard is it really to take care of your player base when you are already sending out broken items and bugs on a regular basis. Literally all they had to do is listen to you but they were incapable of that until somebody else gets involved telling them to do so.. Keep people playing! Don't drive them away...   
---
  
---
Edit: This also makes me wonder for every case of this being fixed how many cases go where it is NOT fixed and people are punished/banned when they themselves are reporting it.
---
There goes any hope of getting FO76 on the switch haha, I know it was a long shot even wanting it. But if I can stream 76 to my phone with Microsoft XCloud, then a switch should be able to run it ü§∑üèªü§∑üèª
---
There‚Äôs already a lot of unique super sledge skins
---
Screw Xbox, but see my response to the OP. You're forgetting that Obsidian is owned by Microsoft now. Now the Fallout IP... Obsidian+Fallout=New Vegas, so it might be okay to dream the dream of better times coming back around.
---
They said ops degrades your gear less than everything else. Maybe they have messed up everything else in the process
---
I see, I don't use public teams.  It seems to me that maybe people could exercise a bit more selectivity in teammates then...but whatever makes them happy I guess.
---
I give until the bar fills if nobody starts an op or joins if I start it to leave the team.
---
Good to know, thank you
---
Once I hit 45 on my shotgun alt I got you.
---
Yeah... I was joking....
---
Lol true I also want a cool skin to put on my Gatling laser too as well as my 50. Cal
---
Mic yep, but still learning the game. Casual but wanna be meta bound
---
How about some LMG skins?
---
So you're telling me the gun displays I bought over my lunch hour but haven't put up yet won't... display guns? What a fucking joke.
---
Yep, I've had it, it's inconsistent, some levels will cycle through others nothing. The first time it happened, I thought I leveled a couple of times, completely unsure how I scored so many points, until I noticed it's cycling though all the levels.
---
Oh sorry, didnt see one while scrolling
---
Because people don't know if fallout will be a Xbox exclusive in the future.
---
I think 50 is a good limit for them. Maybe 40 for people. They don't feel too rewarding, but they also can be taken out fairly easy with your regular gear, even without perks. But yeah, the days of keeping an underleveled weapon for one shotting them is over
---
Yes it does. Unsure about fun interactions though.
---
Ok
---
Ok thank you

You actually turn those in? I just been collecting them without knowledge I guess.

With the instanced bunker system planed for this Winter, this makes sense.
---
I'll add you, I'm pretty casual now but used to use meta so I can help with perk questions or decent weapons if they suit your build. My psn is pretty much the same, just with an underscore.
---
There‚Äôs already a .50 cal skin
---
Really? Yeesh, I hope not. It's hard enough repairing everything all the time as a more casual player. 
---
I don't get a whole lot of time to play at night after work and dealing with the usual routine of keeping my house...I'd prefer to be able to play instead of having to do material runs all the time. Then again maybe that's the intention...push it a little more towards trying to get me to pay for convenience items...either way at least I have a few repair kits from events to keep me running for a while.
---
Cloth? the 3rd most common junk in the wasteland, after steel and wood?
---
Do you think poison resistance is bad because not that many enemies give poison damage?  (I don't even known which ones do.)
---
Sounds good, thanks for telling me. Maybe with Fractured Steel, since it's saying "New Weapons" hopefully some MG42 mods, like some sort of sight and some stock and receiver options.
---
Do realize I don‚Äôt care what you think or say about me?
---
I looked forward to the previous one, but having it again after a mere few weeks is indeed a bit overkill. Meanwhile I've missed Fasnacht twice now. Definitely setting a calendar reminder as soon as the next time gets announced.
---
I have no clue then.   Sorry about it happening.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt expect crossplay anytime soon.
---
Two rares and an uncommon, that's some amazing luck. Even considering the best possible scenario (uncommon from initiate, rares from paladin and elder), that's a &lt;0.04% chance to get something that good. That would include a lot more zeroes if you calculated the chances for those SPECIFIC three items and not just something of that tier.
---
For reference, that's about 1.5x as likely as unboxing a stattrak knife in CS:GO from a single case
---
Despite my warm tone to this post I did feel sort of thrown away. I admittedly spent thousands of dollars on this game and the fallout brand in general. And to have a mistake that I reported end up having me easily banned and the reason in the email was so damn plain and hopeless. Really felt trashed and disrespected. I hope their customer service changes.
---
Beth made a blanket statement that current gen 4 games will be upgraded for free when that happens and because its backwards compatable the gen 4 games will work on it in the interim.  Fo76 is definately a current game.  Can't link from my phone for some silly redit reason but google is your friend üôÇ
---
It sucks when all the prefixes are there, but the item itself gets cut off. "Unyielding reinforced combat armor left....." Like, left what? Leg? Arm? Nut?
---
You have to scrap 100 prewar money for the challenge. Just pointing out a efficient way to finish this challenge quickly.
---
Yes they do. It's not colossally but with a fully upgraded card it makes it better. Sometimes the weapon also isnt the best for explosive, like a semi auto rifle for instance
---
Oh, in that case, yes I remember that statement, and I think you've misunderstood it. They announced that two of their games would be getting free upgrades, and should any other games get free upgrades, those would be announced at a later time.
---
Well if people like sad posts technically you are rightü§£
---
ok, but is there any other games they do this method of gaming like i asked?

Yes. Hence why I'm not putting any effort into talking to you. 
---
Maybe if you were a little more observant you would've noticed. But to be fair I dont expect much from you. Goodluck. 
---
I genuinely have a bit of hope that maybe you aren't actually like this and it's just been a bad day for you. Idk what's going on but goodluck, you're absolutely going to need it no matter what you think.
---
Yes yes they do
---
Fallout 76 won't be, though.
---
The bull barrel has partially been in the game files since launch, and obviously has fully existed in the dev build for over a year since atom shop screenshots often included the bull barrel. Now, however, it's fully in the live build too. Not sure about any other attachments, but those would definitely be nice
---
Some people just don‚Äôt like to group and prefer solo.Other players can be at times more of a hindrance than a benefit.Some people only group to purposely sabotage things or find your camp to mess with it.Also to the one point you made many people just don‚Äôt care.

Gatling laser breaks just as fast. I found the best thing is to take the lucky break luck perk. They fire so fast that they repair themselves often.
---
ok, you dont understand, good.
---
Not familiar with that one

You can get them to work with effort. You have to stand at the exact right distance an angle for them to place. Its a little difficult but you can make it happen.
---
I don't even have the ghillie suit and just last night someone literally walked through the bush I was crouched in and didn't see me. They did turn around and come back again though, then they got me, but I had already passed the ten minutes and didn't care.
---
Yeah i understand that, but why give multiples of a non tradeable reward?
---
I hear you mr.G eventually I'll make that jump to pc I'm just trash at mouse and keyboard
---
Squirrel stew basically the same buff as cranberey relish
---
Only this plan is untradeable i believe
---
Microsoft also said they would honour any deals Bethesda has with Sony like those two exclusive games, Deathloop and whatever the other one was so it wouldn't make sense for them to do that and then  make Bethesda stop supporting PS games that are already out.
---
I'd be Pumped for even a Single Action of luck from the claims bot...and that's all my funny for the week used up in a couple of lame puns.

1. No. Once addicted, always addicted

2. Mentats, Day Tripper, Daddy-O, Alcohol, Med-X or Buffout
---
Aim for the chest and do a quick burst, the climb will pull the shots into the head on the 2nd round...I find doing quick two-three round bursts usually works the best for me and if I aim "center mass" the climb tends to get at least one head shot in.
---
I use an xbox controller plugged into my pc
---
Still pretty cool double the reward
---
One skin that‚Äôs only available in a bundle

Absolutely...gotta get a bunch of Western Outfits for when display mannequins become available. Use them to set up the folks in my Wild West town CAMP.
---
I answered all of your questions. You‚Äôre literally asking about crossplay/save for FO76 which isn‚Äôt a thing and won‚Äôt be a thing anytime soon. Then you ask about other games to do that with and I said the FO76 subreddit is the wrong place to ask that.

I do like grenades: selling them to vendors is cool.

Floaters grenades are useless though

Fasho fasho I‚Äôll add ya
---
This game is full of daily caps to keep you from enjoying yourself too much in a single day, and to keep you coming back. I see people asking to raise the limits frequently but they continue to stay the same.
---
You can get it outside of the bundle
---
I don‚Äôt think that needed.. lol
---
They still die in one shot to me. I mean I'm not using. 10mm but the scorched that cap at 50 still die in a single shot from my gatling gun .
---
I thought that perhaps Bethesda developers wanted to be nice and not expose me to the nuke blast zone, as that happened before, right outside the mine.üòé
---
You know I had the exact same thought today aswell, wee need dps training dummies like in world of warcraft, something static coz trying to figure which of the 5 different [50.cal](https://50.cal)'s I have is not easy on a moving/living target.
---
How? I always saw it in the bundle
---
Would be nice I have at least a week worth of legendaries I try and scrip the heavy stuff first so in the end I'm left with a bunch of light scrip in my inventory
---
That's still better than getting the Vault 94 jumpsuit 4 days in a row, like I have.
---
Scorchbeasts rarely attack my camp now. Every now and then one would attack. Even had a 4some once, more like a gangbang...on me..
---
You‚Äôre correct on herd and a solo public team.
---
It has been sold separately. I own it and do not own the bundle
---
ok, i try on xbox subreddit for other question then, sry, i thought here are xbox players too who are playing other games too and have some more experience about, sry.
---
Wait. What? I've not noticed anything about my camps being hit more often. I actually wish they WERE. Like conan exiles, wish enemies would raid my camp. Give me a reason to build defenses. Most people I know don't even bother to build turrets and save the budget cost.
---
This is my plan actually at lvl400 (I‚Äôm 202) for my final legendary slot I‚Äôm picking up legendary luck 
---
My plan is to move 5 base luck into chr to bring it up to 9 and earn those 5 missing out luck back with legendary luck perk üòâ

&gt;Buy those types of items (broken ones) so you can put in support tickets they can‚Äôt refuse. You get to keep the items, get your atoms back, and those items will probably be fixed in the near future.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I‚Äôve gotten countless free bundles that way and other individual items too. And still have plenty of atoms
---
Support ticket submitted. Method duly noted. You are a legend, my friend.
---
Are you close to capacity in your stash?
---
Damn I might need to get it when it comes back into the Atomic Shop we still do need more skins for the.50 and every other heavy gun tho
---
I have had nothing but horrible experiences with their customer service. Considering you jump from person to person each reply you could say near the whole department I have had bad experiences with. The seemed unwilling to help with or acknowledge anything but more so were unable to understand the actually problem I would try to convey to them, which was made obvious in their responses. If they can't understand the issue how can they help anybody if they are already unwilling from the start unless ladydev or somebody else gets involved. She shouldn't have to get involved so often to resolve things. I sort of feel bad for her how much stress she must be under.   
---
This wouldn't be such an issue if they would just hire people who are gamers. There are tons of gamers in this world now and how many people here in this sun alone would be in need of a job and would love to work from home for them? If I was hiring I would be asking that question "Do you regularly play games?" and "How many hours per week?" I'd bet somebody from this sub would do an amazing job because they would understand the game (or at least our frustrations at times) and would really help their PR on the customer service side
---
Hey, wait a minute. I know it‚Äôs a logical leap to even ask this but you aren‚Äôt remotely implying that the fuel economy has gotten better, are you? I can deal with the durability through the use of many different perks, sure, but are you not saying but maybe saying that the fuel/ammo economy for this weapon has become comfortably manageable without farming like it‚Äôs a second job? Because, if you are, I will spend a half of a half, of a half half of my left nut to get a good quality flamer.
---
Man my inventory is full of light scrip. And I'm maxed out still haha. I just can't bring myself to drop it.... But I find more every time I play. Wish we could turn stuff in for notes, then notes for scrip to help with the weight while keeping the stupid cap
---
"You'd be surprised how many wastelanders answer 'yes' to that question."
---
 I laughed the first time that Knight-Captain Cade asked that during his interview. Also, the terminal entry about the soldier who got an STI from a ghoul was hilarious. As I recall, symptoms included radioactive residue in the groin area.
---
Oh well then yeah I'm sure it stacks.
---
No other Charisma boost effect allows you to share a higher rank perk card.  Grape Mentats, Alcohol, Unyielding Armor, Armor with +1 Charisma, Charisma Bobbleheads. 
---
In the past, it used to have that effect. But they since said that was unintentional and they removed that effect. 
---
Nothing in the Legendary Perk descriptions says that it overrides that rule. Therefore, the lack of a specific rule means that the general rule applies. 
---
And that‚Äôs what makes it seem intentional to me.
---
I wish I could a gave my plan away. I have no intention of ever using it.
---
I don't recall.  But you'll want to be in a team regardless for empath I believe.
---
When it first came out i bought it.
---
It should be 250
---
Yeah would really love skins for my ult gats and gat plasmas
---
Pets are buggy in general and so are how things interact at camps.Scorch pets are really buggy.My turrets attack my pet or vice versa or they attack visiting traders.
---
Nope can't trade the actual glaive either. Tried to make my gf one.
---
If I knew it was a reskin I would have not bought it.
---
Yeah back when I had my legacy gat plas and now with my .50 I was so scared I was going to script it or something and I wanted a skin so I wouldn‚Äôt have any chance of turning it to script
---
Have you sent me a friendsrequest ingame ? I got one, but I cant accept it * sigh *
---
Whats your ign ?
---
Yes, this is correct.  In my testing there was a difference, but it was within margin of error.
---
Lol probably.
---
Maybe, just maybe, you could get cross-save.
---
Cross-play? 
---
Hell no - not until they get a handle on the hackers and cheaters on PC.
---
Ohh right might go back to carnivore sounds decent
---
Oh, that challenge
---
Except, all other Charisma or SPECIAL boosts are temporary, not permanent like Legendary perk card that allows you to equip additional perk cards permanently
---
Thanks.
---
The mods is 100% on Sony and them not wanting any new assets, especially audio since they use proprietary tech.
---
Yes, to my knowledge. It did so in Fallout 4 as well. I think it's because the effect says, verbatim, shoots an additional *projectile*. A shotgun fires multiple projectiles with every trigger pull, where as most rifles, pisols, and heavy weapons fire only one (obvious exceptions, like weapons with a splitter mod). Maybe there was some problem trying to implement a shotgun-only Legendary effect, maybe they saw it as balance, who knows.
---
Alcohol, mentats, day tripper, daddy-o and formula P (if you don't have the recipe, medX or buffout are fine, but I prefer formula P as it just incurs CHR penalty)
---
OP said all grenades, not just floater grenades. But I agree those ones are a little annoying.
---
I would love one for the minigun and DCG, if only to prevent them from being scripped or sold.  I somehow lost my Unstoppable Monster and I sure miss it.
---
Welcome to fallout 76 lol
---
I don't get why people seem to like this event........ but I'm gunna say it.....IT'S SHIT!   the events are boring the rewards seem to always suck with camp items I can't place coz ya know camp budget and shit, and I defo don't wanna run around as a chef looking like a health inspectors nightmare...and soon as a dickhead turns up and afk's I just stop and leave.
---
So I decided to test it again and empath and LW are essentially the same.  The difference of course is all the other mutations you can get as well.
---
No. Have thirty free.
---
if you got the plan, it's not worth storing them, unless you get some crazy leg version.
---
Gotta have the high ground.
---
They should at least make it so you can get 3* legendaries instead of just 1*, who thought that was a good idea?!?
---
Interesting, I wonder if that's intended or if it's bugged and one should be different?
---
Just use a flamer in the daily ops. I did that yesterday and came out with double what I went in with.
---
Yeah. I was just saving it for a friend for later. üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt see them doing anything like this.Lowering budget cost or removing it for turrets would just cost too many performance issues.Can you imagine multiple players on the same server with 50 turrets each?
---
Not months, YEARS. It never worked.
---
Didn't catch that wording sorry just seen so many posts about the floaters and despise them myself.  Lol things aren't even worth throwing at enemies
---
Still have no budget with a limited camp.
---
Uhhh.... flux vanishes if you die after scorched earth. Just vanishes, straight up.
---
Unless that‚Äôs changed recently.
---
Rng
---
I just literally re-watched that video and I don't know how you got this conclusion from it.  He states very clearly towards the end how the mutation actually works.
---
The mutation makes you take 25% more damage and your team take -25% damage.
---
This damage reduction is also applied to you while on a team.
---
So if you are on a team, your damage taken is reduced by 25%, but you also take 25% more damage so the bonuses cancel each other out and you take normal damage.
---
If you equip the class freak perk it increases the damage reduction to 33% and reduces the extra damage taken to \~8%.  This means that while on a team with Class Freak equipped, you gain almost exactly 25% damage reduction, while your team gets the full 33%.
---
Having another person with Empath on the team increases the damage reduction further as well, but this is a separate effect.
---
Considering that video was from June and Turtle still runs Empath as part of his bloodied build currently, I'd say it functions the way he described.
---
Thank you for the notice!
---
Its just to keep people playing and not getting all the good stuff on day 1. Keeps the servers full. Keep people coming back, etc, etc...
---
I‚Äôve put most of my pints in str which is at like 5 now, gonna start pumping int tho for the weapon upgrade perks
---
While I get the disappointment of getting two of the same thing, of which you can only use one, I think it would be more disappointing to get nothing at all and would personally find that more discouraging.  Just my opinion though, no idea why Beth does 90% of what it does.
---
I love these guys on here who think they're badasses because they can push a button and kill an imaginary cow.
---
We're all scared of you....
---
It would help if he was right though...
---
Mine has worked twice and in the daylight so it doesn't need to be dark like some are saying.  If it works it has a nice display of stars and moon.
---
Free up one more. Sometimes rounding error are present. with 31 you should be able to store it.
---
Don't forget about Stealth Boys too.
---
I am having frequent disconnects on xbox, never had a problem before this update
---
Well I've been playing off and on since it came out and never had this issue with the guns. I'm just wondering if something interacts with this. Like do mobs staggering me mid fire make me reload or something. I just can't figure it out
---
Legendary Perks are **not** permanent any more than a piece of armor is permanent. It can be unequipped for 1 perk coin. 
---
Someone gets their Charisma to 8. They equip the free +1 Charisma from the Legendary perk. They share a rank 3 card. They unequip Legendary Charisma for one perk coin and reattach their better choice. 
---
If choosing a Legendary Perk was 100% permanent, then I‚Äôd agree with you. But since it isn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt.
---
This is not a permanent effect any more than equipping an armor piece with +1 Charisma is permanent. It just has a minor cost to remove and no cost to reapply.
---
Uhhh....
---
Okay?
---
I can solo it in under 8 as a B HW/PA Build, as a B-Uny Commando, as a B shotgunner/melee, as a Junkie shotgunner/Melee...
---
The ops aren‚Äôt about kill speed until the very end, they‚Äôre about fast movement and survival. Until the last squad/boss.
---
Bad luck.
---
So are SPECIAL points since you can move them around for 1 level.
---
And you completely ignored my remark that you can equip perk perk points with it, which no other boosts provides
---
Which semi auto rifle?
---
I see no Problem, gamepass dont allow you to inject or modify file or modification as far as i know cause they encrypt the container the game is running in, even reading will for an wallhack be damn hard i think even its read only. You only are able to use ingame exploits, glitches and dupes they are still remain in the game and they will be fixed step by step. I see why not.
---
Yea. Take it into daily ops. I come out it with 3-4x the fuel I went in with.
---
Fun stuff? If you shoot at your feet, you can jump real high.
---
Is it a regional thing that I can't find you? Keep server hopping but getting the same three or four every time; and the in-game social thing never really seems to work, probably because I'm an XGPC player.
---
Any chance you are xbox? I always use my higher level characters to make bench weapons for my low levels with the mods I want. 
---
Handmade, combat rifles, fixers, almost every rifle, but levers &amp; hunting can be made automatic. You scrap weapons to learn their mods for the most part. 
---
10mm pistols &amp; pipe guns can all be made automatic too. I was a guerilla build when I first got into PvP. 
---
If you're xbox tho, when you hit level 15 I can make you a handmade and drop enough ammo to last a good while. Haha
---
The mini gun has 1 you can buy. And 3 you can get from nw
---
I know your pain only gotten Rare Rewards twice of all my Elder completions the past week luckily got Solar and Symptomatic sadly also The Gutter ü§£
---
They are there. I got my 6th grill just a minute ago.
---
alright thanks as long as they are still dropping i'm happy
---
It‚Äôs part of the game,it‚Äôs one of the few checks and balances we have left.Does it suck?Yes it does but a setback now and then brings things back into perspective.
---
I would actually prefer that tbh. Just another incentive that makes the grind feel worth it.
---
I didn't mind the two star and the three star level 100 mole rats I met at a primal cut event.
---
As some liked to say in the past "I'm from Missouri - Show Me."
---
Until they provide evidence that they could get a handle on it, it's a hell to the no on crossplay.
---
Yeah, I can one shot them with my rifles but I used to keep the 10mm for low level areas to save ammo, now it's not getting any use.
---
Wow, f those guys. 5-6 is more than enough to deal with Earle with ten minutes left. I just barely beat him with a team of 3 once.
---
Well just any in my opinion. Explosive is a good effect but I feel like it catters to high dps weapons or weapons that fire alot at once like shotguns or auto weapons. It can still work for semi auto rifles but it chews through anything on auto weapons
---
That's sweet, but I'm on PC.
---
Because fending off lightening and fire from the ground is more fun and requires more strategic thought than how to hover higher longer than the other players. ü§®
---
I have this happen a lot. The items have usually moved. Like stuff I've put in walls or ceilings randomly appearing in the roof .
---
Wait, what?
---
That probably would‚Äôve been fine. This was one of my biggest complaints about one wasteland, the other being that it actually made it harder for levels as they are no longer able to go back to an easier part of the map to get better before taking on tougher foes.
---
Any Alcohol works or a specific?
---
How is being on a team "directly engaging" with someone?  I literally never even wave hello to my teammates and I never run into them.  Casual teams are literally just for getting team bonuses while playing solo and that's how everyone uses them.
---
i just got the weapon rack, but yeah being safe lately ;)
---
It uses the Wendigo Colossus Vocal Sac to make a drink that makes you immune to the Colossus fear effect! Very eager to get that one myself
---
I think i read that if you are over lv50 you only get rare new plans.
---
I don‚Äôt like molerats* there fixed it for you
---
Think a lot of the reason the update doesn't seem so bad to me is the ridiculous abundance of ammo now. With ammosmith, ammo factory, and super duper I can make 1300ish bullets a craft for 5mm and .50 cal. I started chucking 10mm ammo a long time ago ;( no one even buys it
---
No it's a Public Event now. Meat Week is not a factor.
---
If you have WWR armor or Bear Arms perk, the weight shown in your pipboy is fooling you.
---
The Tenderizer is almost 20#, more if it has been modded.
---
I don't do NW so those are out.  I looked in the AS yesterday but couldn't find any, so I'll look again.  Thanks for the heads-up though.
---
this comment is the only reason i check this weekly xd
---
I had that 15 charisma once... tuned back to 9 bc there haven't been enough usefull skills and the points were used otherwhere. Also, I found myself sharing rank 3 skills even with 15 cha.
---
Basically I never rely on anyone helping in any event so I go in prepared to solo all of the time, and tbh I tend to get better results running stuff myself than in a group anyway coz I can do it my way with no distractions, also the ops stuff should should build a team from people waiting in a queue when a full team is ready it auto ports all players into event then they gotta try or leave, that might stop or deter people from time wasting.

---
Loving this idea. Personally, I've been wanting every train station to be free to ft to. I mean, where do the caps go anyway? Seems pointless to pay. We had to walk everywhere in the first place to discover areas, the reward for countless hours of on-foot treks should be free ft! 
---
I wouldn't mind a refund of all the caps I lost ft'ing to crater &amp; foundation before they made it free. ü§®
---
Used to be nice to pick up a crappy pipe wrench or gun and go to Morgantown airport, hell even just using fists...all gone now.
---
So because something mildly inconvenient *might* happen you eschew an entire aspect of the game and handicap your options?  Also what you described doesn't even happen that much.  Plus, they're rads.  Stand in a puddle for a few seconds.
---
People complain about the dumbest things.
---
I agree the bug should be fixed. In the meantime, just hit enter to confirm the launch location. Don‚Äôt move your mouse and click confirm.
---
I had that happen once, but am I the only one that‚Äôs actually having all my atom challenge updates go off üò≠
---
but then they would have to give us actual rewards, not happening unless microsoft steps in
---
Download it via gamepass, have a little fun, see how you like it. Don't let other peoples positive or negative insight shape your opinion before you try it.

And they only last for like three minutes... I really want 'em to last longer.

nope, they still drop

Extremely rare spawn in fort defiance. The hats a common spawn though
---
You get from fort defiance 3rd floor, but good luck with them being there!
---
Are you still talking?!?! LETS DANCE!!
---
They are going to make the observatory a fast travel point as well.So that is going to cover most the map by itself.so with crater,foundation and the vault as well it leaves only a few places worth it.North and west ash heap would be one.Mid mire would be the other.If you have fallout first between your base and survival camp  you can cover both those spots.
---
It‚Äôs exactly what I have been using.

3rd floor at fort defiance. Go up the elevator and check the rooms around the elevator. Good luck!

No which is super annoying.

Goodbye atoms its been nice

There is high chance that hacking will not be able anymore, these containers are closely linked to the operating system and in the patchguard (kernel patch guard) and you will need a properly driver to trick patchguard and boot up windows with modified patchgaurd, you need a driver, and its nearly impossible to do that as far as i know. It was possible in times Windows 7 came out, but now? No way anymore, but i can be wrong, im not into hacking or coding /knowldge that hard like anyone else maybe is.
---
But the way Microsoft is doing it is the best effective and at the same time mosteconomical way to do exactly this.
---
Hell, they don't even make a satsifying explosion sound, just a pathetic and annoying throaty grumbling.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, the game had a realllyyyy rock start.
---
That being said, the game is completely different now. A lot has been done in terms of stability and the game feels really good now. In addition to bug fixes, we have tons of content and a pretty modest endgame to keep people occupied. We‚Äôll only receive more content coming up in the future.
---
Honestly, I think now is a great time to give this game a try. Yeah there is a few bugs that you can work around but ultimately this game is completely different than a year ago.
---
I legit made a CAMP at the Brahmin Lake just below one of the train stations just to give me big milk yields for donut production, and it saddens me to see them dead sometimes.
---
Lol, just saying.  Curious, why lock your doors?
---
Nope. Exploding was the easiest for me. I have the fireproof perk maxed and just stood in them mowing them down. I will take them any day over fucking freezing enemies. Those pissed me off to no end.

It‚Äôs fun. If you have gamepass, give it a shot. Nothing to lose.

Bro people are selling them that much per piece??? I‚Äôve been selling them at 50 caps!

Did you even read the discussion?  What I described gives you at least 25% damage reduction and +3 to all special stats vs. 20% less damage and some AP regen.
---
That is the definition of "outclassed".
---
The new Gutter plan/crafted weapon has the same style of skin. Not as... extreme, but the same yellow hazard stripes. It‚Äôs terrible. Doesn‚Äôt even make sense on a commando assault bot blade!

Not sure why this post was downvoted, but yeah, that's the plan, as I've said, I have experience with games that other people would consider "disasters" or radioactive. I find myself having fun with them. I'm definitely gonna give this a look.

I mean, we do have accounts stocked full of PvP foods. Not wrong.

It used to happen a lot with SBQ.

+END is broken on underarmor and also legendary armor with +1END
---
I can‚Äôt believe there is seriously a legendary perk card for grenades. They need to be reworked so bad, like many of the weapons in the game. But as it stands now grenades are hot garbage and a waste of space. Massive buff needed.
---
No, I asked which semi auto rifle you are talking about.
---
Afaik there is no legacy semi auto rifle.
---
I disagree strongly.
---
I really enjoy the forest zone, its great to explore and hangout, but it gets outdated by level 15. But now its relevant and interesting to explore again. I love that.

So I‚Äôm sitting here doing Meat Week and figured it‚Äôs as good a time as any to do a test on food decay.  My first test started off with just a flower, it took 76 minutes (I think that‚Äôs intentional) for the item to spoil.  I also had made some fresh Firecap soup, and it‚Äôs been a couple of hours so far.  The food hasn‚Äôt decayed still. 
---
Now thinking that a day in the game is roughly 1 hour, in terms of realism, I have two day old soup on me and it‚Äôs still good, and has a few more days to it.
---
This is without good with salt, no fridge backpack, and not using the fridge at camp.  
---
What I‚Äôm getting at, is that really that bad?  You have over an hour to turn a raw ingredient into a final product, and it seems the final product lasts for a few hours.  By my estimates, I would have gone through 4 cranberry relish so far.  So does food really spoil too fast?  Or is it a matter that we if you get so into the grove with the game, you lose track of time, multiple in game days have passed, and it just *seems* that food spoils too quickly.
---
Anyone else getting the ‚Äúimage not available‚Äù message for the first and third screenshots?
---
If your PS4 I can build you one later if you like
---
Considering how easy it appears to be to hack and cheat right now, I doubt Microsoft will make any difference in the next year or so.
---
But it literally doesn‚Äôt let you take less damage. You can go find videos of that being disproved on youtube
---
That works for me. I was honestly surprised we got away for having free travel for the current factions without max rep.
---
OK. So I freed up thirty five in stash and it stored. Weird. It's not modded or anything and claims it's eight pounds.üòÇ
---
Thank you all for helping me.
---
I don't especially like playing on a team, what I do like is playing solo on a private server. I have no desire whatsoever to make bonds with other players, or to leave myself open to griefers or some moron that will destroy my camp. True, there are a lot of nice people playing on the public server, but I've encountered one too many, that I found annoying and on occasion, hostle.
---
 And since the update I've been leveling up just fine.. the only time I'll go on a public server and that is briefly, is to drop off materials for new players, or to create a team for one event. After that, back I go to my own world. I also find it annoying when one person thinks that they are the all-knowing authority about what everyone else should do, and then are going to debate everyone that has a different opinion.
---
90% of the new Vegas jack offs think 2020 obsidian is the same as 2010 obsidian. They aren't. Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.
---
We also don't know any details about the purchase. 
---
They could have signed a deal that simply said, you can own us but we are in charge of our franchise. Or we hold creative freedom of our franchise. Etc. I'd rather have a game set on the east coast continuing the story than going back to a very bland map in the middle of a desert
---
This can't be stated enough.  I get so many extra caps this way.
---
Does your character actually recline, or just sit on it like a toilet as they do every other chair?
---
This game is the epitome of "Long term players are either the best of the worse"  
---
Because yeah, once we hit high level we don't really need as much, and honestly helping new people is actually more fun than daily grinds.  
---
or  
---
You get people who feel like they've done everything and now go out of their way to ruin other people's fun.
---
Not really complaining. It's a slight loss of exp to gain not having to care about my rads going away. Both things could be considered a mild inconvenience. I also refuse to play automatic pistol build. Oh no an entire aspect of the game is lost to me. No pvp. Omg not another one. Two handed weapon. Why do I even play the game! Holy hell there's nothing left if I don't at least do trading in game items on reddit. That's it. I'm deleting the game. Thank you for showing me the light. Showing me that I'm not 100% enjoying every part of the game
---
Its true, way to many of the fan base wants a walking and building simulator with no danger or risk. Its why pvp went away and a lot of other features. Then when one wasteland hit a lot of them freaked out. Just how it is here.
---
Congratulations on joining the Brotherhood of Steel family.
---
don't be mistaken, I expect it will start in the next 3 months
---
A question, what is the game like in terms of multiplayer. I'm phrasing this horribly. Is there one open world where there's a ton of players? Is it divided into servers where someone creates a server or there's official servers you can join into (like Conan Exiles or Ark)?
---
Doubtful. The sale won't even close for a year.
---
Right, and it‚Äôs completely possible the deal falls through. There was a big announcement when my company was going to be bought out, everyone was worried about what it was going to do to our jobs and everything.  It was approved by regulators and everything.  Key shareholders couldn‚Äôt agree on things and the whole deal got cancelled.  
---
it‚Äôs always possible that between now and June of 2021, something happens and the deal falls through.  Microsoft could have to back out because of some weird Anti-trust thing.  Shareholders may not be happy with any stock buyouts or anything.
---
Thanks! I was going to try this later but wasn't sure if I wanted to run Herd myself and needed to find replacement mutations first. Appreciate you saving me a step!
---
Nope. I'm pc :(
---
A fire watchtower? Please, tell me more.
---
I would assume each event takes a couple days off each week, but not consecutive days.
---
I dont use that legendary perk on my main and the other day i saw someone test it on my public team. The two members who had this perk died to unprovoked pvp, while I was immune to the unprovoked pvp despite having Pacifist off.
---
I also got dropped from unprovoked pvp once on a character with that legendary perk equipped. Only ever happened on that character who has the perk.
---
My experience matches what everyone else reported, so I blame the perk.
---
Then why are you playing a multiplayer game?  Go play FO4 or something.  Hell, you can even mod it.
---
I don't think you'll receive plans that you already know.
---
yes, and that why it will be implemented in the gamepass and in its containers soon i think.
---
Playstation system will not be affected of any anticheat measures i think, never. But its impossible to jailbreak playstation as far as i know, so no use of modifications or any files too.
---
The only problem left is They need to vaildate new updates to sony, and that costs time.
---
But Microsoft have clearly the advatage now against sony in many many ways.
---
I‚Äôve picked up Chally‚Äôs backpack, the pepper tenderizer mod, and meat cleavers and I‚Äôve done 4.   RNG is RNG
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
from angry turtles testing rank 3 increases by quite a bit,
---
TBH joining an ops group then making people wait while you/they make ammo or stock up is a douche move, prepare your shit first then join group.....how would you like it if you phone for a taxi but it's twenty minutes late, but when it gets to you the driver goes " sorry I'm late I went home first to me a sandwich" your like "wtf why didn't you do that before you took the job?"
---
Sounds manageable. To be fair, I completely suck at this game.
---
Maybe you can do it on an alt but not sure if plans are player locked or not. Wish I could help
---
I waited for the reset and I was wrong...it's super mutants in "the burrows" with "freezing touch" on uplink.
---
I doesnt stack
---
hold the place button and use the movement stick
---
Sony released a list of games that will be backwards compatible (and also free for PS Plus owners) at PS5 launch. FO4 is among them. FO76 is not. The lack of info is concerning.
---
This is the realization I had yesterday night. I had a weightless anti scorched pipe revolver for exactly this situation, but between plentiful 5.56 ammo and everything being lvl 50+, its now slated for scriping. Not that I expect I'll get to the point where i'm willing to spend 40 of my daily scrip, to only clean up 1.5 weight of space any time soon, but...
---
no way??
---
All petkillers should automatically spawn into a fissure site.üòéüëπ‚ò†
---
Well depending on where it is I fast travel to that location first and then from there fast travel to the actual location for cheaper
---
I'm gonna open a ticket when I get home and see if they'll give me the plans lol. I know for a fact I did the quest. Dunno what happened to the plans.
---
Special points require you to use a level up to move. That is very different from a single perk coin. The cost is not the same. In fact, ignoring the XP requirements to do so (since not everyone has levels saved up) each level up averages out to be worth 3.6 perk coins.  So moving a raw Charisma point in and then back out uses two level ups and has a cost of 7.2 perk coin equivalents. 
---
That‚Äôs SEVEN times as much as doing the same thing with a level 1 perk card. 
---
Now extrapolate to a rank 4 Legendary Perk card of +5. That still only uses 1 perk coin to shift five points in and out.  
---
Doing that with raw Charisma would cost **36** perk coins equivalent. 
---
That‚Äôs a huge difference. 
---
And I didn‚Äôt ignore that you can equip perk cards. That just means it is an additional bonus. 
---
Raw Charisma gives you 100% the effects of Charisma
---
Legendary Charisma gives you all of the effects of Raw Charisma, except for one. 
---
All other Charisma bonuses only give you the secondary benefits of Charisma. 
---
This is why I believe it is intentional. Because it could be so easily cheesed for the equivalent of ***just 27% of a single level up.***
---
As has been stated 400 times already, you don't have to interact with people on a casual team.  Please stop using this as your argument.
---
so this might be a long shot but maybe higher level enemies have higher perception
---
Yeah good luck. Unless if I had one back when I never searched for outfits and didn‚Äôt know the prices of what they went for. But since my grind for outfits two months ago I have found every color a couple times except red and yellow. I have two forest which I know they say is second rarest. But I‚Äôll be damned if I can ever find the red
---
Tell that to my stack of grills.
---
i hope they gave you something as a thanks for sticking by them.  if it was me i would've demanded all my atoms and game purchase price back and would've boycotted the company after all theyve put us through with this game.
---
Lots of good advice in here so far.
---
Keep an eye out for the Leader of the Pack event in the northwest of the forest. It spawns three small groups of wolves, each with a leader that will drop a one star legendary item. It's fairly easy, it'll give you some early legendary gear, the xp is good, and you can cook and sell the wolf meat for caps.
---
For caps in general, cook and sell everything you kill. Once you get the chemist and super duper perks, making and selling drugs is profitable (radaway and healing salves are particularly easy).
---
Tag the scrap you need to make ammo for search (probably lead and steel). You want to pick up all of the lead you come across, and it's found in some junk that's not obvious like paint and pencils.
---
And finally... Don't get into a grinding groove too soon. Just have fun!
---
is it a 10mm auto pistol or the 10mm smg?
---
the smg is a commando weapon and the 10mm pistol is either a gunslinger or a guerilla weapon depending on the reciever
---
I think some of it has to do with the Console vs PC crowd.  PC players are used to this type of game and don't have any issues with it it seems like.  But console players are used to single player and have no multiplayer experience outside of games like GTA V where people constantly fuck with you.
---
I finally got my Sympto-matic today after a week of getting either the Valley Galleria signs or no rare plans, even if I beat it on elder. Felt good.
---
They might change now Microsoft owns them. Let‚Äôs just hope Microsoft doesn‚Äôt take a soft approach to the monetisation over quality bullshit they were forced to pull under ZeniMax.
---
They have lights on them. Did you look under lights?
---
I concur! I love him.
---
which bunker
---
Agreed! Needs to be 2 weeks long though.
---
You could try uninstalling the game and installing it again or even just leave it uninstalled its such a mess
---
They're magically less rare due to recent events *cough* *cough* try the trading subs
---
What perk card did you max out btw?
---
not happening to me on PC.. very rarely ever crash
---
Why limit yourself there? You could increase the stash limit while you are at it.
---
That‚Äôs from your armor or perk card lowering the weight when you carry it. But when it goes to your stash it shows true weight
---
Getting stuck in danger for no reason has been a thing for a very long time.
---
I'm on PS4 and having a similar issue. Maybe today's just a bad day with all the updates and events.
---
I swear I see you saying this on every person's post who's complaining about rng.
---
Months? try the entire modern franchise. It's never added health for items that add +endurance. Modders had to fix it in the previous games.
---
Full on recline - it‚Äôs slick
---
Smh should have waited i still havent bought any
---
Pacifist aparebtly is the fix for this and ur saying it doesn't matter?
---
Id rather use my imagination for a unicornvelociraptor. They're banking on people not giving up 1st for the stash space.
---
Ive had nothing at all the other day too, and this is actually more dissapointing because its almost like otbgave you something at least, then its taken away from you again since all you can do is drop it out of existence
---
It's to make us suffer with extreme carry weight. It's punishment!
---
Like Nuka Quantum grenade.
---
I maxed out electric Absorption which I like but I want to scrap Master Inflator and Power armor reboot.
---
Yeah tell that to my 4 alts that are all at 1000 weight and stash full and my main same thing other then the 1000 weight on character. I wish we could get vouchers for scrip weapons so I can get rid of them still. Usually I just sell them to vendors if I hit daily limit and don‚Äôt want them
---
Ok, then link one.  According to AngryTurtle's testing it does work that way.  And others have confirmed it to work that way.  So please, provide evidence of your claim.
---
Edit:  Searched YouTube for these alleged videos and I can't find anything but videos on how it DOES work.
---
Yeah, they'll still drop. I have a stack of grills, flags and backpacks and an extra tenderizer.
---
I dont mind getting it once thats fine, but muktiple untradable ones is the bs part, multiple anythings else is dissapointing but at keast i can hand them to people who dont have them yet
---
Tell that to my 13 meat cleaver plans.
---
Nay, good sir! A MONTH! A month long celebration of nothing but Mr. Pebbles and his journey into space!
---
He's a hero! You better.
---
It counts you as being on your own team. So with the right perks your team (including you) get.. 33% (May be a little more/less) damage reduction, and then you singularly get either 6 or 8% damage increase.  
---
I think you can also use Herd Mentality in a solo public team, to get +3 to all special with applicable mutation boosts.
---
You can use the bumpers on console to move the amount by a ton more, idk what it is on PC.
---
But ya currently we are stuck with what we have.
---
Oh, I do. I do.
---
If you're on PC, the Save Everything mod allows you to do just that.
---
That would be awesome. Shooting floater grenades 30 rpm ahhh...
---
If you're seeing this in Daily Ops, the enemies have a mutation that specifically makes them have higher perception so that stealth doesn't work.
---
It is exactly that + quite a lot of other heavies, ffr UGLs, railroads, sometimes gammas and melee, here and there... I've been killed by quite a variety of F76 weapons (which is great).
---
Yea scrap or swap would be nice if someone wants to try a different build later on. Some coins as a cost would be fine.
---
I'd have still had mine except I ate it.  :(  I just log in for a few dailies and to turn in scrip etc. so only a few minutes a day usually.
---
Yea. Unfortunate they don't have a system to see if you've gotten something already and not give it to you.
---
and give up all that FO1st ROI? now that's just crazy talk.
---
And use the legendary ammo perk like I do and I have it maxed out and crafting every ammo I get a fuck ton
---
My game just Crashed üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Not that I can tell.  If you mean legendary weapons that have the explosive effect, 95% sure they don't.
---
Same here. I might never be able to commit to any but at least I won't regret my choices üòÇ
---
My old gutter is still a rusty gray blade. I wonder if this is how all the new ones will drop like from the burrows quest or if this is exclusive to the plan. It's such a weird choice to tie it to (really bad) unique legendary rolls instead of releasing as a general skin
---
Sorry... Had a commie whispering in my ear. You are indeed correct. A full season of Mr. Pebbles S.C.O.R.E rewards, events, dailies, and themes are in order.
---
Yea I'm fine with that.
---
Someone said to look at the scoreboard before entering a world and that had worked for me in getting rid of it
---
No, and if you're carnivore relish does nothing anyway.
---
Its a bad post, even if it's factually accurate.
---
A good post would be to state what the better option in, and why its better. Just saying "There are better options" isn't constructive. If you want the karma for making a good contribution, put the effort into a post that contributes well.
---
Just go to Morgantown airport and do the event.  Checked in the box there and got 100 pre war money in a couple of minutes.
---
Any alcohol will trigger the same addiction
---
Especially when 99% of my camp is unlocked, including my water purifiers, an acid collector, and my collectron. 
---
I have a single 1x2 room set aside for myself. I have an ‚ÄòEmployees Only‚Äô sign right next to the Level 3 Locked Door. There are no windows to the private room. 
---
***Stay. The. Hell. Out.***
---
I know OP is joking, but I wish there were more level 100+ enemies. As a level 100+ player it's nice that one wasteland scales up enemies to not be a total waste of tine from an experience perspective, but It's dissapointing how many varieties of enemies are capped at level 50-60 still. Better than level 5 spawns but I would definitely prefer higher.
---
I've played an hour ago for around 3 to 4 hours and had no crash. Only one friend of me had a single one. (PS4)
---
Yeah, it takes all ultracite mods
---
Have you tested it?
---
Just put a infinite ammo box in the shop for 5k atoms
---
Now you're talking like a true patriot!!
---
I've been net gain on frags every day.. I use them for crafting and run ordnance express so the carry doesn't bother me... I went from 60 to 130 this week..
---
He's a hero for crying out loud!
---
I want a fo76 map in Microsoft flight simulator.
---
Yeah they do, theres a few plans that once youve learnt it you wont get them as a drop again
---
Where can I get the red outfit he asks so casually.
---
Bloodied or junkies or instigating or whatever the hell I can get Flamer, HERE I COME!!!
---
Also patch 22 changed a ton.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/428003/fallout-76-update-22-patch-notes-september-15-2020?language%5B%5D=en
---
It's a quad explosive 10mm pistol with a tweaked automatic receiver
---
glitch with the latest patch
---
It is still deadly as hell. The only reason I don't have one is that I managed to roll an instigating one a while back, and I use it for trash mobs and stuff, and it wasn't worth wasting legendary modules trying my luck for a bloodied.
---
I mean for daily ops.
---
I dont know maybe we will find Leslie one day mutated wandering the waste.....
---
Actually my camp has a defensive wall around it and the only way to get into any of it without flying is a lvl 3 locked door, but your way works too.
---
Can you tell it to your stack of Souvenir Beer Stein Plans?
---
How can I change the behavior? Is BOS version not able to change?
---
Yeah i know, thats why i made this post so hopefully they see it as a problem and rectify it at some point
---
Why not use bodyguard + heard mentality?
---
Empath is great too.
---
Noice. yea I run all th explosive perks including demolitionist. Frag I don't use as often as plasma and such. I wish they'd give me back grenades based on the ones I used like they do ammo lol
---
West Virginia.
---
Indeed. I just wanted to offer an additional option to those that may not like the event or have a few Claim Tickets lying around...or even forgot they existed.
---
Huh? I‚Äôm talking about steam and Beth launcher. Are you saying you think those are going away? There is no evidence of that.
---
Damn I was hoping 3 stars would happen now but you answered my question
---
If this is true, not wonder I didn‚Äôt like full auto on my pistol build. If it wasn‚Äôt working, that would really suck. Hopefully it is fixed soon if this is true.
---
I even double checked to make sure that it‚Äôs level 3 so someone with a Rank 3 or less Master Infiltrator card wouldn‚Äôt accidentally auto-unlock it.
---
Some people... lol
---
I can sort of speak on that, for me even the idea of being on the same team is already a direct connection. Then comes the worry that maybe that person will actually go to you/your camp and try to do something. Even the fact that people could see little hints of what I'm doing on their hud (the notes like [IN DAILY OP] [IN CONVERSATION], or seeing your health bar go up/down) is sometimes distressing. I only join groups for the "complete event in a group" challenges, and then it's always creating one instead of joining an existing one, and leave it right after finishing the event. I don't care about exp, if I did then I'd spend all day grinding west tek/whitesprings instead of playing the game as I do now
---
Yea I gotta admit if I got another war glaive when I could a got solar panel plans I'll be upset lol. Stop taking up chances when I already have it ;(
---
allright in that case its definitely a bug, i use an automatic 10mm pistol and it does work with guerilla
---
maybe try a different automatic reciever, 
---
sometimes recievers can be bugged, i had a problem with a certain .50cal reciever on a sniper rifle a while back where it reloaded after every single shot but it worked fine with other mods
---
/Sadly Laughs at my bloody explosive LMG
---
before entering nuclear winter just go to the atom shop and select whatever outfit you own to wear.
---
Hijacking so its seen without the big chain...
---
If you use Empath mutation, with the applicable perks to reduce negative and increase positive mutation effects, you'll be receiving 33% reduced damage, at the cost of receiving 8% increased damage. So a net of 25% decreased damage, using perk cards you may already have active.
---
You can also add herd Mentality for +2 to all SPECIAL (Maybe +3 with Strange in Numbers)
---
I‚Äôve had a few megasloths which are my favorite, it‚Äôs always a sad day when I come home and my pet is goneüò≠
---
Can I get an F for this poor fellow's cow?
---
Ya I had no idea it NEVER worked. For as much fun as this game is, some of the bugs are ridiculous. Especially ones since launch!!
---
It does, to an extent - it only affects the explosive portion of damage. Demo 5 on gatling shot with e.g. 100 normal + 10 explo dmg wil have the explo dmg raised to around 30-ish. Not terrible, not great.
---
Demolitions expert does effect legendary weapons. I see a big dmg increase with it on.
---
Any alcohol will do, but it's easier to get addicted if you have a stack of one type. Takes more booze to get addicted to a bunch of different ones. As for the drugs I use booze, daddy-o, day tripper, mentats and med-x. I don't like Formula P because it's a pain to farm and it's a -2 to charisma which when paired with the others is a big hit.
---
Or at least let us do something other then destroy the plans, i was gonna give them to my friend for his other character but nope
---
FYI, u/Ladydevann &amp; u/Valseek don‚Äôt get a notification when you tag them in the body of your OP. You have to have it in a reply, like this.
---
Also, I don‚Äôt think either of them are mods. They are Bethesda Community Managers, and this isn‚Äôt a Bethesda run subreddit.
---
That's a pity.  I really am excited to see what other modes besides Uplink they come up with
---
Awe man.. anyway around it??
---
I did delete the first and second because they were duplicates. Probably that.
---
You can also do hide and seek (nuclear keycard escort), turn in a pleasant valley claim ticket, and US government request aid (not 100% on this last one).
---
Lol ..dont stop!!
---
This new update is bugus, the higher level areas like the cranberry bog, ash heap, and the more are meant for higher levels people not a level 3 with a pipe pistol.
---
Thank you!  I did not realize there was a mod for that.  I saw it before but assumed it was just a protection against dropping certain items.  You just made my vendor experience so much better.
---
I just keep getting kicked from servers and then not being able to log back in
---
I don‚Äôt, but enemies went from being low to high. I‚Äôve got at least 4 spawn points in or right outside my ash heap base. I can defend it, but if I leave I come back to heavy repairs now.
---
Sometimes hit and miss, but I will farm the burrows and harpers ferry for legendaries. I will normally get 2 or 3 across the area. I have got up to 7 a couple of times and every now and then 0.
---
Ign?
---
It's not necessarily something that can be overcome. I spend 26 hours per week tutoring people directly, and although things generally go well and many of them are very fun people, it's still exhausting and a relief when it's over. Being able to get through it or even enjoy it doesn't take away the toll it has on you, some people will always avoid it when possible
---
I know.  Just stay away.
---
doesn't it cost 1 coin to remove the card?
---
Does it revert to rank1 once removed? (never paid attention to the perk card after I removed it)
---
I don't think it's "everyone". And in any case, there's nothing wrong with preferring solo (just as there's nothing wrong with team play). FO76 has a history of attracting solo players (me included),  from earlier FO games. There's a sizable contingent who want nothing more than to play FO76 like a continuation of FO4 (also me, at first). Plus, lots of folks (me, again) don't have any friends who play video games, much less FO76 so team play is kind of foreign to them (me).
---
Seems like Bethesda has been trying to convert the soloers into teamers from the get go, with varying degrees of success. I was hesitant to embrace team play, and in retrospect, my initial forays into public teams were completely embarrassing as I joined teams and tried to actually play side by side with others (sorry, to all of you). The names of the original public teams didn't really help. With 1W they've improved the named (casual, vs builder, iirc).
---
In any case, I've learned to appreciate the benefits of team play for the boosts. I've learned not to try and play with my "team mates" (except for Daily Ops... whole 'nother can o worms). I've even found that logging into a private server makes me feel lonely. Weird, I know, but there's something comforting about have all those camps, vendors, and yellow dots on the map. Plus the occassional visitor. 
---
And if you stop by my camp, give a wave, look around, then be on your way. And don't forget to close the door.
---
I said to keep the limit,which is ten. So that scenario didn‚Äôt cross my mind because it wouldn‚Äôt happen.
---
T r i g g e r e d
---
Yeah they should cap certain starter areas, or have enemies of a certain area have a level *proportionate* to your level rather than equivalent to it. It‚Äôs pretty taxing having literally every enemy be exactly your level when you‚Äôre getting to 50. I still think I prefer it to having constant encounters with enemies who are like 4 times your level, though. But yeah like maybe if they had enemies in starter areas be like 75-80% of your level, it would be a little easier to get started.
---
Okay, I'll check again when I have a chance.
---
do the scorched event at Morgantown airport
---
It happened to me, but I‚Äôd rather have this than autocomplete
---
You. You are the perfect example of the reason why I do not associate with people in this game. Your extremely spazzy and angsty comment history projects someone who is clearly in need of a nap and has been for years. You have replied to not one, not two, but three of my comments here and a small part of me thinks you actually expected to get a reply on every single one of them. 
---
I do not have time for a yippy Chihuahua, if you actually want to have a serious conversation about this then leave your emotional baggage at the door, sit your hyper ass down, and ask politely. Otherwise it‚Äôs clear you are just foaming at the mouth Again and in the throes of yet another emotional rampage and it would be a complete waste of time to even try to talk with you seriously. You are my problem, have a great day.
---
It's a game rooted in exploring. There is every reason to enter.
---
Safes usually have 10+, how much do you need to scrap for the challenge?
---
All Fridges, regardless of the appearance, confer the exact same benefit.
---
I use herd mentality.  Body guard is essentially useless though.
---
As a non-stealth user, no.
---
YESSS! I've been waiting for this to come back for MONTHS. I slept on it when it first came out. Finally, it's mine. I love the Walkman like accessory on the hip and the colours. It's awesome. Wooo
---
I‚Äôm all for that, but I‚Äôd prefer a different roof type altogether. Hoping they add a rusty corrugated iron look.
---
Maybe I need to check to see if I have those Free States warning signs unlocked.
---
Not my base.  You'll find no loot in here.  And I guess... you could call me an endgame boss.
---
I would like to her Pistol too, since we get a skin for Brickhouse's Shotgun.
---
I don't really know much about either carnivore or herbivore mutations. On the face of it I just though meh... but I think a little research is in order.
---
I tend to hop around with marsupial serum because I shoot myself in the face if I dont as well
---
I don't think it's anything you're doing. I just think it's a weird choice on the part of the developers. I have my BOS collectron set to gather weapons and ammo. It picks up ammo, plus simple weapons like knuckles and pipe guns. I scrap the wealons and keep the ammo.
---
Bigger mod caps?
---
Well when i run low i do the daily ops and come out with a few thousand. Sure it‚Äôs expensive to make but this post only aims at the durability. There have been post in the past that have covered ammo and durability i just want to focus on durability with this post.
---
Interesting.  I'll have to look into those.
---
Firing ranges at all major faction settlements and myrhh pls and craftable dummies so we can set up our own firing ranges, thanks
---
Or radstoms.
---
Yup, for sure.  Good call.
---
Exactly what I do.
---
The one thing almost everyone agrees on about 76 is that the community is amazing. In my time playing since beta I‚Äôve only met a handful of people who made me wish for the ‚Äúmiddle finger‚Äù emojiüòÇ
---
Good call! Headed there right now!
---
Have 26 tickets. Here's what I got...
---
* 4 red dress (Sell 1 scrap the rest I guess)
---

---
The numbers say yes, and it‚Äôs definitely better in sneak.  I prefer the handmade because it feels better.
---
I have officially posted this on forums to. Thanks for the tip
---
See, you have never gone to take a workshop from a team of 3 that you know is vastly beneath your skill level in PvP. 
---
The other day I boxed two of the players while hunting for the third that was wearing a stealth suit. They tried so hard! After about 15-20 minutes the workshop was a sliver away from being capped, so I decided to drop them 1K screws and dip out. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You're missing out, bro.
---
I bought some for 75 caps each today.  Pretty good deal.  I don't think I would pay more than 150 caps apiece, and only then if I was seriously desperate.
---
Or if your in a sqaud they can trigger it also i think
---
There's a couple good ones.. I run ordnance express and demolition expert 5. 
---
Plasma are good for "normal" use. They hit decently and soften targets nicely, flush cover, or kill.
---
MIRV are great but dangerous. They are heavy killers.. if you can land one under a large target, all submunitions explode simultaneously. If you mess up though, it's hard to escape the scattered aoe.
---
Nuka (not Quantum) are my preferred. Large aoe, nice satisfying fireball, powerful impact.
---
Vanilla frag is component of MIRV and Nuka so I keep a bunch around.
---
Pulse work well vs robots, but they're pretty smart at evading them, and the aoe is a bit small. Generally I'd use mirv or nuka to just as good effect.
---
The rest I don't care about. I carry pumpkin.. but always forget them...
---
I think he's calling em fat irl and he slept with his mum
---
It really depends on you. I have both, and for the recoil alone I prefer the handmade. The Fixer's bonus stealth is nice, but on my Bloodied Build, I don't notice a difference.
---
It's not worth 1250 gold unless you have nothing else to spend it on
---
I'd have to say though, one thing I like about uplink is that since enemies have increased perception, you can use it to camp in one location and just farm. Whether it's xp or ammo, for burrows, I just sit at the doorway of the first room and just kill everything that comes by. Friends can just sit and they'll have ammo drop for them as well as long as they're close enough.
---
Cargobot Crates &amp; Turning in Pleasant Valley Claim tickets are the two very easy sources.
---
How long does the pet stays?
---
Do they just leave or get killed by a player (with explosive bait?)
---
Yes it cost one coin to remove and it doesn‚Äôt revert back to level one (that would be devastating). 
---
It would be cool to be able to swap the cards for different builds. Say right now I run heavy gunner so i have max energy Absorption, but if I decide to run naked melee later I won‚Äôt need this perk any more, i could spend ten coins to swap it for the melee explosion perk at the same level.
---
Don't use Take one for the Team I think.
---
Thanks to everyone that has responded to this. I‚Äôll be looking at my setup for my berserker in the light of all this :)
---
Jes√∫s what are you using 100 power for
---
Once addicted, you can either run with the withdrawls or pop pills and drink all the time to counter the negative withdrawls effects, but also incurring the chems side effects.
---
Personally I am to lazy too maintain a constant high, unless its an Earle fight.
---
You're still limited to one, going around as Chally would be suicide once the round starts.
---
I installed an ssd after my original hard drive got corrupted and it‚Äôs made my load in times so much better
---
im bumping this for you in the form of the crushing blow to what i had hoped would be a lovely week of mischief to come again only to be gut punched and hear it would not be back.  
---
(I also think all those weapons would be really cool as legendaries and i'd use the hell out of them. goodness a flaming chainsaw!!!!!!)
---
Thank you for responding to fast appreciate it üí™üèº
---
Squirrels back on the menu boys! Love me that Tasty Squirrel Stew
---
Nothing is more useful than the black bear outfit*
---
You‚Äôre overthinking it, my friend successfully stealths with whole Enemy teams of 4 in the same bush and she‚Äôs running neon purple hair
---
Might be a bugged keyword on the attachment. I use the powerful auto one and I know guerrilla boosts it. Others are broken, I know the signal repeater on a gamma gun makes it automatic but it still benefits from gunslinger
---
Now lets talk about random things you found that you never seen
---
Challenge  accepted ;)
---
Same
---
Osrs: Huntrixs
---
It‚Äôs started a useful conversation that will help me improve my berserker so take an upvote from me
---
yeah - let us all play bloodied or junkies... not
---
i manage to get out of the event with a plus with the most weapons i use - instigating gauss rifle is a very good example, vampire plasma flamer is a very bad example
---
it clearly depends on the weapon but in this case: you get out with a plus, not everyone in every case
---
I was wondering/hoping it might have given a temporary boost to perception or agility (like the weight bench), but it doesn't sound like it does.
---
Likewise. Do you happen to know if there is a reason it's the only untradable plan/weapon?
---
I dropped the 290 or so prewar money that I got from only 11 claim tickets. Go turn them in.
---
Yup, actually why I was Cha7, my buddy would share magnetic and our team would be sharing 2-3 level 3 perks.... Alas...
---
I think you misunderstood what that list was. It is for the games that will be free for PS Plus owners, yes, but that's it. It was not a list of games that would be backwards compatible. 99% of PS4 games will be playable on PS5, and there is absolutely no reason to think FO76 would not be one of them.
---
Yeah that bot is deadly
---
2 shot imo
---
I am a confessed Cow Killer. But...but...it is only because those cows are at overpriced camps and I feel the cow is suffering from inflation.
---
‚ÄòPvper‚Äô or ‚Äòraider‚Äô or whatever that can remotely make them feel somewhat powerful
---
I wanna run into you. lol
---
Supposedly fixed with patch 22
---
There are 7 or 8 different colored mining helmets in the game, and although they often bug out in your inventory menu, they keep their color and can be displayed. Hard hats, however, come in a large number of different colors but always default to a blue-green one when you pick it up. The exception is a handful of specifically named ones (i.e Blue Hard Hat) which can be purchased in foundation or looted from the raider quest where you go through the steel mill
---
handmade stays on target better, fixer increases sneak and can use .45 or .38 ammo. I try to keep a handmade and a fixer/combat rifle on all my commando characters to make use of all three types of ammo. running the numbers it looks like fixer does about 5-7% more damage, or around 211 handmade damage vs 225 fixer damage (.45 ammo) with same mods/perks/legendary effects (powerful automatic reciever for both). At those damage numbers 14 fixer shots equals roughly 15 handmade shots.
---
Well the problem with pc is that there are and probably will always be some pretty nasty hacks on it.One example would be the camp vending bug where other players can just buy things out of your stash that you don‚Äôt want to sell.There are a host of other fairly nasty ones as well.
---
PvP I‚Äôm this game just suck in general, I only play nw for the daily‚Äôs because it‚Äôs very annoying
---
What is "two boxing"?
---
VATs? Definitely the Fixer, ADS it is a bit more complicated, with no universally correct answer.
---
Nothing fo76 related delete this nephew
---
lmao
---
not sure what game youre playing but vats is neither underpowered nor seen as unnecessary
---
some people dont like it, but pretty much every meta build except for heavy gunners focuses on vats
---
You generally can't stack the same stat buff from more than one food/drink.
---
Thank you, I will try that.
---
Hopefully it's in the SW quadrant of the map although more than likely I expect it to be in Cranberry Bog. Still, a relay is a relay.
---
asking the tough questions.
---
I play on Xbox and have no such issues
---
&gt; unload caps with Smiley
---
Oh crap.  I think I forgot to do that last week.
---
I tried both. Prefer the Fixer. Play how you want.
---
This is exactly the reason legacy weapons are "super cool" the red asylum outfit is worth heaps and the clothes vendor is a lucky find . People do feel better when they have stuff others don't.  I want the leather long coat but I'm not gonna grind for it and I'm not gonna trade for it so when I see people have it I'm impressed by their luck or determination.
---
Do you want everyone to be given all top tier items straight out the vault or the rare outfits because  "other people have them"  
---
This is an mmo after all and its part of the game ,
---
Battlepass is an OPTION if you don't like the stuff don't do it if you like the stuff do it.
---
Like most things in life you put work in ,you get stuff out of it.
---
Or pay for them idc its your wallet.
---
Yes. Fixer is better than handmade in dps. But not by much.
---
If your pacifist is on the glitch wont affect you
---
Yep, mod not backpack. The information seemed at least moderately relevant.
---
I had that very thought just 2 days ago.
---
45 for lever gun atm
---
I have only run a PvP build for over a year tho and never had ANY issues with PvE. If anything, the PvE became waaaaay too easy with a PvP build. 
---
But we all different, I guess.
---
got another tenderizer and grill plan today
---
Ah, i thought you mean Bethesda Launcher standalone, yes, i totally forgot about Steam, thats problem nr. 2 for them,   shortly beforehand they threw stones in microsoft's path, omg
---
I suppose all this is to say: I don't make assumptions. They have not announced FO76 as available on PS5, and I cannot wait until they do.
---
What is fact is some PS4 games, namely those that have been announced to come for free and some which have not, and some PS5 games, have been announced as being available on PS5. 
---
It concerns me that FO76 has not been mentioned, and no amount of assurance from a peer will change my concern. It is *likely* FO76 will be on PS5, sure. But that is an assumption, speculation, nothing more. 1% could encompass a *lot* of games.
---
I kinda feel like it‚Äôll be fort defiance but I also don‚Äôt like the layout of that building but I‚Äôm cool with whatever
---
Had the worst time trying to place one but finally after a lot of fiddling I managed to hang it. You gotta be use to these silly bugs if you come from FO4 building.
---
Yeah there is I don‚Äôt have a link off the top of my cursor but search around ‚Äúseason tracker‚Äù in th sidebar or sumn
---
I have that issue as well. I have considered moving my base but I haven‚Äôt found a spot that I like enough to take the time to move it.
---
I like the fact that you have to weigh your options because there's no turning back once you spend your coins. Much better use of the "Legendary" moniker.
---
Yeah forgot about that one ü§¶
---
Two shot is 25% increased damage with big accuracy and recoil penalty, and it breaks twice as fast.
---
Furious is max 45% increased damage at max 9 stacks, without any penalties.
---
Kinda clear choice if you ask me.
---
I'm just tired of running out of 50 cal ammo all the time. 
---
I've stopped using other weapons, they don't do enough damage.
---
Dang. I feel this. I have a really big PvP group, but at this point MAYBE a quarter of us are still playing this game the way we used to. We have been recruiting a lot of newer PvP players that are down to continue fighting through all the nerfs, but it has been a sad few months as most of us start exploring other games.
---
Seems tougher but you don‚Äôt have to worry about all the little enemies no more, just the big ones. So no chasing mole rats to complete itü•≥
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Build? (https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks makes this easy)
---
Weapons being used? Any legendary weapons/armor?
---
You don't even need prime meat to be successful at the cook out.
---
Why not use your magazine and select real time targets to figure out what you expended and then figure out your own DPS?
---
DPS dummies are just that, dps under the best circumstances which rarely happens.
---
If you are looking for an EGO boosting dummy, then I can see the want for one.
---
Thanks, will do.
---
People are having trouble getting prewar money? its like the most common scrap in the game though?
---
I‚Äôm almost positive they died defending my camp. I don‚Äôt have many spawns around my camp but when something does attack it‚Äôs mirelurk kings and mirelurk hunters so I think he just gets poisoned to death
---
I'm glad someone cares.
---
Hell yeah i want his overcoat in the game
---
it seems like clean anything would be rare af, but no it's just world clutter
---
No.
---
Haha dude my last experience was great divide kill the boss and I was running for high ground
---
Im on xbox and im having the same issue
---
This part; if you‚Äôre having a hard time it‚Äôs prolly time to invest some more thought/effort into your build
---
I‚Äôve found infiltrator more convenient, if only for the fact of freeing the need to use the standard perk cards. I‚Äôve yet to see Power Armor Reboot do it‚Äôs thing. The most useful legendary perk for me, hands down, has been the ammo one.
---
If you're comfortable with believing that there's a chance FO76 won't be playable on the PS5 even though we know FO4 will be, then there is certainly nothing I could say to calm your fears.
---
I can see why they used Piercing Gaze for the Uplink mode too, yeah.  If you could effectively just crouch stealthed next to the Uplink the whole time it wouldn't been really require you to be at the controls except to go to the next point and to kill the boss haha
---
Eh I can understand that part. Make people have reasons to run them
---
Vats underpowered? what? With concentrated fire every hit is more likely a head shot (doing extra damage) and it‚Äôs pretty much how you get crits
---
When your hips are 22 inches larger than your waist, so-called "unisex" shirts which are straight up and down look really unflattering ;( They're usually huge in the chest and then skintight across the rear... 
---
But if shirts designed for one gender are unisex then it should be pretty easy to make women's shirts and all the guys can just wear those ;)
---
Just seek and fight back. You'll be fine.
---
100 exactly
---
I'm still in the low 20s and it's starting to get really annoying when I get killed during nearly every encounter with a wandering beast, super mutant, or feral ghoul as part of PvE.
---
I'm usually not one to complain about stuff like this with games since I'm generally fine with playing the game as its presented to me. But, I feel like they didn't really do enough looking into balancing play in PvE especially for characters that are still at lower levels.
---
Yeah, totally not worth it... with Daily Ops now, you will get many multiple returns in ammo by doing just one op a day even.  That and the new legendary perk card for ammo...  
---
I think selling ammo is all but dead now too :(
---
That would be nice to have a midrange port option. Though I find the BOS distasteful after reading about them and then listening to the broadcast, they seem like bad people.
---
And the Paladin in the radio broadcast sounds like the church lady in the salvage broadcast event....I wonder if they are sisters?
---
probably could just use last years, since it's the same exact time frame and point system.
---
doesn't matter what outfit you have on when the team of high levels finds you.
---
I just went through Fort Defiance the first time this weekend... that place is a damn maze
---
I'm not looking forward to it, but then again, my camp is directly next to one of the Sites.
---
I losted it. ;.;
---
Well I casually got it the first time
---
Ok relax
---
Screw molerats in general.
---
Thanks for continuing to reaffirm my point and prove me right. Lol if this is how you normally pvp, you must lost a lot.
---
Depending on your layout and needs, it might be more budget effective to do multiple solar panels. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think the cost of a generator is only double what a connector is. So if you're running 10 connectors to move 5power.. could be easier to just build a new gen closer.
---
What gun are you using that breaks that often?!?
---
Daily quests reset at 5pm our time so I try to get on soon after 5 but I will be around at 8. Quests usually take about that long.
---
Don‚Äôt even worry about it bro, just stick to the objective. If you die, don‚Äôt wait for the stimpack, just respawn. Run to each objective first, don‚Äôt worry about killing anybody until you‚Äôre boosting sites with teams in the daily ops. After y‚Äôall kill the boss, you can loot all the bodies easily
---
Two shot, especially if the bullets explode.
---
What is meat week and why is it so important?
---
I won't be on for a few hours but I can give you some ammo if you need some
---
Just join a public daily ops team
---
They have a nice warm and well-diffused light. Working very nicely in my new house.
---
that sums it up perfectly, yes.
---
It can definitely take more than 2 days to get going... and although it's very possible to do it solo, it's a lot easier to get started by playing with other people and then go off on your own after that...
---
I usually start a casual team so you get 1 intelligence point per person and go about playing solo. I'll go help any low levels that join if I see them constantly dying but that's about it.
---
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME!
---
I hope the pumpkin camp decorations return!
---
Yes the bunker was finally fixed after a few weeks. But with the fix they made it smaller an a different shape.
---
Lol I'd be getting like 100,000 caps if that were the case
---
No the hat
---
Just make them weigh 100 pounds each and drop nothing
---
i dont have to worry about the 100 mole rats or other stupid critters but as a bloodied build they just need to blow my way and im dead xd
---
Would defeat the incentive to actually do Daily Ops. Bethesda wants you to make teams and have fun in groups. It's not everyone cup of tea tho..
---
Same ü§£ They'd need to pay me in installments!
---
Do what I do and make your camp super mobile and plant it down on a led node for a few months
---
Wow that‚Äôs a major bummer for 5x the size.
---
So we can‚Äôt give presents to each other? That‚Äôs not really in the spirit!
---
no shit. And the drops are poor at best.
---
Deffo need a "piss off". Good shout my man.
---
You underestimate their power!
---
Add craftable and tradable gifts that give a random teddy bear or toy?
---
So with you on this.
---
Unfortunate... hopefully all those jack-o-lantern plans come back somehow though so we can still get festive!
---
If you start playing the drums or turning the spots before the event starts, you start out with the progress bar partway filled.
---
Hold the back button.
---
I like the challenge that one appalachia brings to the game, but there is no feeling of achievement/development in the game now - you just dont feel powerful when you come back into the beginner areas
---
every hour on the hour
---
I guess for flavor it can be fun,  but by the time you throw and wait for an explosion you can drop 2-3 enemies typically anyway if you have a strong build. Would love to use them, just extremely inefficient dps wise.
---
Maybe I‚Äôve just become jaded from running blooded and explosive weapons for so long.
---
I got them all! except the one(s) that didn't exist....
---
he's saying they removed it, i think?
---
So exactly like Faschnacht, okay thank you
---
I did that.
---
Not working anymore.
---
I'm voting for the Grafton mayor. He can't be any worse than our 2 choices now.
---
You dont even have to do it. If you go and the drop box is already there you can simply take your money away.
---
Thank you. First time around my group never got off the ground
---
I couldn't agree more. I just reached lvl 30 and I used to be able to do quick in and out scavenging raids in the towns around the started area, blasting away the low level enemies and get some easy junk to scrap. Now I consume more resources with repairs and ammo crafting than I'm able to scavenge thanks to the stupid leveling system making sure virtually no enemies I encounter are below my own level.
---
Grahm will say something about that, if you stick around awhile.
---
Running PA and electrical absorption, that's what I essentially do on one character anyway, an easy solo-elder run lol
---
[They know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuc6yy/health_scaling_and_the_biggest_problem_with_one/g5m4n4q/?context=1000)
---
According to the OP, 
---
&gt;Between level 14 and 23, enemy health triples.
---
It's easier to die to stuff when it takes much longer to kill them.
---
So now it's just a matter of when they decide to fix it...

---
I‚Äôd take just about anything at this point. It‚Äôs a little crazy they haven‚Äôt added it.
---
Cheers bro, I'll drink to that
---
You can certainly use your PvP build in PvE with great success, I fully trust you on that. No one said you‚Äôd have issues as you‚Äôre trying to imply. The point is optimization - if you‚Äôre optimized for PvP, you are not for PvE. Period. They‚Äôre just 2 very different games the way it‚Äôs implemented in fo76 atm and require different setups. That‚Äôs why NW is a completely different game conceptually.
---
And if your PvP build made PvE easier for you, I‚Äôm sorry to say, but your previous setup must‚Äôve been really bad.
---

Me too. Lvl 43 and still have so much to learn. Don't know any other players yet. Would be happy to team up with you. I'm Species2560, playing on PS4 most evenings AEST.
---
yea, i know everyone wasnt a good choice of a word but thats how i feel about this game.   i can careless either way.  play how you want.  
---
i've just be online gaming since the late 90's and through multiple game forums and this game is the first community that brings up social anxiety a lot.
---
shit i myself am a bit socially awkward but teaming up with random strangers in an online game never bothered me.  if i didn't like the group i was with id just leave.
---
i've met some really cool people that i still game with.
---
Thank you. I think you are right. I had a perk card that reduced melee weapon weight.
---
Mr. Fuzzy mining helmet?
---
Yeah, I just saw another PSA about it.. lol thanks
---
I‚Äôm not bloodied but it‚Äôs all bugs that get me. They‚Äôre just so tiny and annoying
---
agreed, vats isn't absolutely necessary, but the ability to target heads is not underpowered. VATS plus shotgun equals big damage.
---
They left me with some atoms but I wouldn't say it equaled the torment. I could do all of that but I'm not playing the game for or against them as a company. I genuinely like the brand and the stories across all of the games. I'm a fan boy.
---
Lol np
---
Storefronts? As in there is no picture for it that would display it in the atom shop?
---
Hopefully they buff the spoil rate
---
Why are there so many topics about specific ways to get pre-war money, its so damn common lol.
---
Thank you for the advice! Quick question on the topic of food. I was noticing that even cooked food has rads? Is there a workaround to this or are rads just an unavoidable burden unlike fo3-4
---
and grim reaper sprint at level 2 gives a 25% chance to refill AP on a kill.

---
Have you ever wondered how the nuke codes get solved so fast every week? Sometimes within a minute or two after they reset? You can to thank /u/eckserah for that, instead of being obnoxiously rude to him. He and his friends were also responsible for telling Bethesda exactly how to fix the inventory stealing hack last December. Bugs are constantly being found and reported from the data that simply wouldn't be found otherwise. It's true that not all of them get fixed fairly quickly, but a **lot** of them do. 
---
Ever used Map76 to find exact locations for almost anything that can spawn in the world? Or looked up the exact drop chances for rare event rewards, accurate to one hundredth of a percent? Datamining is what makes all of that possible. Eckserah's dedication to keeping xEdit updated is what keeps all of that going. So, no, it's not only good for showing you "funny hats" before they're released.

If anyone is interested, I have some radstorm wallpapers for Wallpaper Engine

If it wasn't the sole thing in the entire list (I believe?) I would say that is probably the case. I don't mind running them daily until I get it, really, it's just a shame that I won't be able to buy/trade for an Instigating one at any point and will be at the mercy of RNG.
---
Doesn't matter. If you have the perk equipped and in a public team it can trigger regardless of pacifist being on or off.
---
bloodied commando here , i always use chineese stealth suit , even if it makes me overencumbered

Pretty much all food has rads. You can counter that with radaway, with an endurance perk that removes rads over time, or by drinking brahmin milk.

Weekly reset just happened. If you can't knock it out in one day, how are you going to complain there is nothing to do?
---
Try changing your icon. Most of the time that will resync you.
---
I've done a handful of Primal Cuts events today and I've gotten varying amounts of Prime Meat based off of location (I think), so that hasn't been changed. I also think it changes the difficulty of the enemies being spawned, a lot of honeybeasts and snallygasters in Cranberry as opposed to rats and wolves in the forest.
---
Interesting! I was aware of rad away but good to know!
---
Communist Commando uniform and hat. I want that!
---
Then i want the normal Chinese Assault Rifle skin and then the Chinese Pistol as a brand new weapon!
---
Grahm only has one 'a' in his name.
---
I'm a rifle build with some stealth. I just hit 75 and finally starting to get good weapons and gear. I love the hardcore events and love running around the bog and mire. And after blowing all my ammo and stims is go back to the lower areas to explore and resupply. Now I'm stressed just for leaving my camp. I gave up playing after I got killed by a couple ticks in the mire. Couldn't keep AP high enough to vat them and it's super hard to hit them with a freaking rifle when you can barely see them. 
---
Before I was able to maybe one or two shot the first mob and take out the next one or two before I get swarmed. Now I can maybe one kill off before I'm swarmed.
---
I didn't follow a specific build but I did toss as much damage as I thought I could into rifles. ( I have all the riflemen and a couple other damage perks but I do keep some QoL like salt and weight cards on me. )
---
All I see on this sub are 100+ saying just get more ammo, just buy ballistic fiber, just do the ops. I'm not made of caps am I missing something here, it takes hours to find the materials repair and sell for caps. And if I I'm already scared to leave my camp &amp; don't have enough ammo to begin with how the hell would I go do ops to go get more ammo. Like even tea time the easiest freaking event ever I have to think do I have my gear fixed, do I have enough ammo and stims for.
---
At the very least can trash mobs just be trash?
---
Oh, that's great to know that they're rethinking this one. I had missed that post. Thanks for the pointer to it!
---
76 is basically like New Vegas if you arrived in the Mojave AFTER all the interesting stuff happened and everybody died. All the factions have a neat interconnected story, which we only get to experience secondhand thru logs and environmental details. No real choices to be made. The finale is also a(n infinitely repeatable) colossal ammo sink at this point.
---
The stuff Wastelanders added is also connected to this to an extent, but it can be boiled down to helping out a pub owner/pre-war drug kingpin and choosing to help 1 of 2 factions run a heist. The impact you have is whether very specific NPCs live(most are immortal if not wholly invincible) and managing your rep with 2 factions.
---
Fallout 4's main story had potential, but it's a bit sloppy and has some problematic implications. Far Harbor is really, really good. Nuka-World requires you to become a raider or miss out on 90% of it's story. Automatron is a joke to justify unlocking robot blueprints.
---
This usually happens cause as your clearing mobs right after the event it tends to be pretty packed
---
What does storefront mean?
---
The weight bench was disabled for the time being as there was a glitch with stacking the strength bonus. 
---
No clue about the foosball table.
---
May do, my build now is really tightly budgeted, no space for new things.
---
The servers are down (of course) as I got kicked a couple of minutes after a Meat Weak quest.

---
Yeah I know after you get through it the elevator is activated but it still left a bad tast in my mouth. I‚Äôd like to see that fort you turn in the technical data turned into a base
---
My boyfriend and I play Fallout together and I was so excited for us to play more and enjoy the wasteland. The past week has been grueling and frustrating and I‚Äôm PISSED that I bought a year of FO1st if this is the case üòí
---
Man I still gotta do the Possum Badge involving Kill 30 Robots w/ Assaultron Blade... I'll get BASHED trying to use a melee as a ranged build on L50 Liberators who're arguably the only 'easy' robots to kill. Perhaps the Farmhands arent too strong....
---
Where is the turn in? Station , top or bottom of slope?
---
I think it is a wait and see sort of thing.In the beginning Microsoft wanted consoles gone specifically the PlayStation.That did not happen so they made the Xbox.Then they tried to eliminate the used games market.Sony made them look bad with there ‚Äúthis is how you share a game on the ps4‚Äù presentation.Now with the next gen here we are again with game pass and digital downloads.This time people are going for it hook line and sinker.Pay a flat fee get access to a bunch of games but you don‚Äôt actually own them.In other words they have control of game flow etc.Bethesda always favored Microsoft over Sony.In fact they have treated PlayStation players like second class citizens on more than one occasion.So I don‚Äôt believe for one minute the Microsoft we embrace all consoles and all gaming spiel.I fully expect the other shoe to drop on this in the future.
---
Mine too. Business in my vendors is booming though.
---
The cutting fluid plan?
---
I'd like an event that culminates in us firing a cat into space in celebration of pebbles
---
Ah good point - I didn't know a Halo show was in the works. Yeah, with properties at HBO and Amazon seems likely they won't be striking out with their own service.
---
Sweet congrats
---
check the free section ;)
---
I'm on PC.    
---
Go to the wiki and note what items that have them. This game is a huge time sink but you can reduce it somewhat.
---
Today I did have 2 crashes in two hours. First at my camp, second during daily ops end boss battle ü§¨.
---
I am on Xbox
---
I am kind of shocked there are people who still haven't heard of the weight bench thing.
---
I don't want to know how far back you had to look to find that post (or why you were looking in the first place) but lol, who could have known! Although I will still be correct until it actually happens ;)
---
PC, sorry.
---
I recommend you look in one of the subs that allows bartering. This one doesn‚Äôt.
---
Its actually faster to just throw them as grenades.
---
Thank you!
---
Pleasant valley ski resort, talk to the bellhop in the basement.
---
Yes, but not enough for it to be worth anything. The explosive effect does 15 extra damage. Demolition Expert only adds an extra 7 to that.
---
Ngl that‚Äôs pretty neat. Does my head in running in fear.
---
When did that happen?  I used that last night without issue.
---
Yeah, me too. But I know not everyone is on the sub as much as others so I'll be patient. Lol

They just want to show you that a bad game is good because of great community. While it's nice I prefer to play alone and suffer silently. Lets hope Microsoft will come with some money to make this game technical side better. I want this game saved.

Not on Ps4 so can't help you out but if you jump into a Colossal Problem event you'll get plenty of screws from all of the wendigo spawns. I usually manage between 250-400 per event, the more you do you'll be swimming in them
---
It seems you have a Colossal Problem sir.
---
Thank you for the award. It‚Äôs my first one!
---
I was actually wondering this. Primal Cuts is awesome but by weeks end I was having to solo them as people stopped doing them. No biggy.
---
Now I don't think I could get the Forest one done very quickly as everything's spongey and theres no stealth.
---
Might even just do the hourly cook and waive the Cuts events.
---
WOOOOO!!!!!! üôå
---
Or unplug him lol.
---
I admit, it made my cynical heart smile
---
Furious and One Man Army on a 50 is dangerous. 2 shot on a 10mm is asking for reload troubles. have fun.
---
Ive received 2 which I sold straight away. They arevwort some nice caps. I dont care for them but um still trying for plan rewards.
---
Otherwise my run of Abandoned Bog Town, National Array and Research Center usually amass about 100 per run of 3 sites
---
oops  one gun army.
---
Shit i got mine on my second op!
---
If your cow didn‚Äôt look at me the wrong way and talk that moo moo sh*t, I wouldn‚Äôt have sent an artillery strike on his a**.
---
because he moved to Berkeley Springs.
---
Well then..
---
I bless you with good fortune on your next run.
---
Waddled to Berkeley springs train Station. Super mutants set up a ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù and tried to tax his sales.
---
I used it earlier today and it was fine.
---
well because he's not there anymore. try the old purveyor location at berkley springs station.
---
You‚Äôre not a paying client so they don‚Äôt take a disease cure first. If you paid up, they‚Äôd go farming and take the twenty caps is twenty caps route. But you‚Äôre not worth farming for if you‚Äôre only practise.
---
Ghouls could be wearing all manner of outfits, vampire costumes etc.
---
Stealth shotty build with but with bloodied perks such as dodgy serendipity amd nerd rage and adrenal reaction serum. I use a AA50L15C pump* no bloody one yet :(* You can see the visible chunk when you crit em in vats which i can do 3 times in one clip. I've solod earl with that shotty but it took like 15 mins
---
On PC.    
---
More instability after 22. Disconnected twice and right after Meat Weak at this last hour. Server was down and not supposedly 'fine'. It's Glitchesda.    
---
Hopefully MS will greatly improve 76 with a new engine (among other fixes) and maybe a Fallout 3, NV, 4 trilogy remake.
---
I think you're doing the Daily Oops instead.
---
You can still use a 10mm. Just sneak a little bit more. VATS headshots
---
Me too :-( This is almost as bad as when they made junk items unsellable to vendors the week after I discovered how profitable it could be (only did it once, but man, so much steel and glass went in the trash since..)..
---
Where's the good stuff? I want to spend my atoms damn it!!
---
You‚Äôre looking at it from your perspective, not theirs...
---
Because they took away one of the most core elements from Fallout and most players felt it was a bad move, the developers seem to have come to the same conclusion. So we got wastelanders.
---
Not a strong week here.
---
2 shot explosive handmade :) hate it and love it at the same time also kills me alot tbh xD
---
I highly doubt bethesda has the technical ability to do it.
---
This is worse than the time a raccoon got into the copier.
---
I‚Äôve never been there, I‚Äôve just looked on google, any enemies I should worry about?
---
Well i also used to like going to high level areas and trying to get through at a low level. It was definitely an accomplishment at level 25 to clear out an area full of high level enemies by using stealth and strategy. 
---
Now everything is level 50-100 everywhere. No breaks, but no serious challenges either.
---
I think having levels as a percent would be good. Half your level in the forest, double in the mire or cranberry bog. Maybe on par in the other areas.
---
and remember the drums are meant to be beat and the meat is meant to be cooked, not the other way around.
---
So I get what your saying but I mean after a few runs I would think they would be ready.  I just don't get joining and never showing up that's all.  Like I posted I did have fun I found out I could solo one that was pretty cool.
---
No thank you. Those of us that acquired them legitimately and saved them to give out to friends would prefer to not have them nerfed any further. 
---
The scrip was already removed. Stop trying to take even more away. 
---
Yes, it would hurt dupers. Then all they would do is switch over to the other duping methods that are just slower. 
---
In the end, you only slow down the cheaters at the cost of hurting legitimate players. 
---
Again, no thanks. Bethesda needs to address the duping problem directly and punish those that violate the rules. Not those that didn‚Äôt break the rules.
---
of course one of my first visits with FS was to Appalachia, almost everything is hills with trees but without the fall color. The great bridge is generated very briefly, one day I will make another visit
---
Weapon Artisan is what will repair your weapons up to 200 %, gunsmith will just help when you craft them to begin with IIRC. But since patch 22 I have certainly been repairing armor and weapons a whole lot more frequently!
---
it should not be breaking that often, unless you are firing it a ton during events, which you should not be doing.
---
There are Mr. Gutsy stations at the Miners Monument car park, so it is possible
---
Yeah I get that I forget shit all the time
---
DUDE!! This Doc is AWESOME!! Thanks for sharing!!
---
It‚Äôs dissapointing how the one time I want a level 100 Yao Guai it spawns at level 60 or even 50 just to spite my tests. I do perk and weapon tests on a level 100 Yao Guai, due to their health.
---
Some scorched but you can usually visit the train station without being bothered.
---
So when the future leaks come and show us the storefront pictures of the R91 skin. Then we can say that the skin should be ready to be released to the Atom shop?
---
And here I‚Äôve been doing it wrong all this time...
---
Choices have consequences - üò®üò¨üò≠    
---
"Some people" want the game to change b/c they can't handle that.
---
Ah ok! Thanks for the help!
---
Anyone want to run some daily ops in an hour? I‚Äôm only a level 42 so I will need some carrying. the solar panel looks sweet I‚Äôm prayin to the rng gods haha
---
Excluding the collectron which is a special case, they likely won't be.
---
Appreciated.
---
Ahh my apologies I read over that part.I still don‚Äôt think they will do it though.If you want more solid defense there should be a sacrifice in budget to do so.
---
those are only skins, you still need to buy the plans for the jetpack at the whitespring bunker
---
I bought a legendary module last night and got nothing for my hard earned scrip. Murmrgh is a con artist.
---
Just think, there is someone out there who gets a rare reward every time.
---
Less for the game and servers to load, makes it smoother. The engine doesn't do well when it has to load too many assets.
---
Not only that, between 20 and 35 the DR gets increased by about 750%.
---
Yea I know, I'm asking for a freind who does not have Reddit I think It could be an idea but I'm good I might just grind out to 350 so I can upgrade survival shortcut
---
I received a plan for some signs the other day and when doing the ops today it gave me the exact same thing
---
The only issue I have with that is that I'm a level 39 and dont have good weaponry
---
Correct, there‚Äôs no perk card value over 15, but you do get the effects of added strength, just like you would from any other strength buff. Only Charisma is ‚Äúbroken‚Äù in that you can‚Äôt share over your base skill. Even skill points with the legendary perk doesn‚Äôt count towards sharing.
---
Could I be dm‚Äôd some specific spoilers
---
Just recently realized that there's a Liberty Prime PA Skin... I so need that, hope it comes back soon.
---
As for the rest of the items, meh. I guess they're nice if you're really into decoing your CAMP. I'll just be saving my Atoms for new PA skins if they ever come.
---
Ok that makes sense thank you
---
The beasts are not the problem, the fucken rats are.
---
I'd rather fight graboids than rats.
---
Same to you
---
I also play alone for the most part every now and then i will join my cousin but just random people will approach me and start handing out stuff. I like the game a lot reminds me of skyrim
---
For the best chance of rare reward you need under 8 mins. I have never received a rare when over 8 mins
---
You need to buy the plans from the white springs bunker first, then you'll be able to craft it and apply your skins.
---
That makes sense, just reading up on herbivore and cranberry relish provides 20% XP with mutation, 25% XP with Strange In Numbers. If I only I was privy to this information earlier, came across a vendor selling the mutation for 150 caps! Needless to say I didn't buy it.
---
Some would say you had it right all along.
---
Cook out every hour, prime meats every 15 minutes. Make sure to check map as they don‚Äôt always announce.
---
Did you claim your free Steam copy? While playing on Steam I have no problems but there are some people running around without names just with alphanumerical strings.
---
The first two are like a 5 and 15% chance or something. Elder tier is an 80%
---
That‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs AA with 50 limb damage? I have one (forgot the 3rd perk) but I thought the gauss versions are stronger (also with limb damage). Maybe i didn‚Äôt look close enough.
---
If you happen to be on PC, I could lend you a 1* bloodied handmade. Would help to see if its TSE is missing shots resulting in less overall damage. If you don't run the dense mod on your chest, TSE may be hurting you along with enemies when they're up in your face.
---
I don't see anything inherently "wrong" with your build. Adrenaline would be helpful as a perk to have, even 1 rank in it becomes a nice damage damage boost as it ramps up.
---
Could try using PA w/ emergency protocols for events as well.
---
it also makes it so they break slower tho and i know about weapon artisan i equip it everytime i repair a weapon :)
---
That's not nice :c I just finished making myself a TZMap and I placed his cap sign on the town, now I don't have the source files to fix it anymore...
---
Help me understand, I thought mods weren‚Äôt supported or something? But I keep hearing of people having mods
---
The guy is saying he is joining random teams before they are ready and instantly going into the daily ops and starting the timer. Theres no telling how long they been sitting for that last spot they could have been doing other things so it makes sense as to why he got kicked.   
---
Your thing is much different of course. This was only against 99 who sounded like he was joining Ops and then starting them before everyone was ready.
---
This.  I‚Äôm sinking caps into serum recipes every week.  Not many left to buy, guess I will be buying crappy mod plans next
---
I tend to throw when they stack up or when I need to reload or take cover.
---
I get your point though, unfortunately I'm betting "strong build" means bloodied, which is the premier damage build still. I run junkies and I still find that one nuka is worth a whole reload or so..
---
Edit.. I can read.. yeah can't beat bloodied.
---
I dont think they have a silencer. You can charge em but miss out on consecutive 3.75x stealth shots at night or 2.50x in the day
---
only reason i would fire it a ton if there are a ton of enemys chasing me xD
---
got to get it done in under 8 minutes if you want the best chance for the rare rewards.
---
yep we need a insect sprayer or something like that xD
---
it‚Äôs so popular in my country that every region has it‚Äôs own name for it.
---
I once won a ‚Äústripfoosball‚Äù match against a girl in a pub. she played topless for a good while. ahh, the ‚Äò90s!
---
I've found after stealth was kinda gutted a bit that Legendary Specials are the safest bet. I haven't regretted any of the 3 I picked.
---
You can't go wrong with extra perk slots. Even if they're QoL ones. I now have Bandolier in STR to bring weights down along with Blocker etc, and now run Fireproof full time also. Not to mention another 3pt card in Luck which rocks.
---
I sincerely regret taking and Max'ing Follow Through. Just like a fart, follow through is the last thing you want.
---
5% for tier 1, 10% tier 2, 80% tier 3 and all 3 can roll at the same time if you get elder on the first go
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
---
I use both. My fixer has less vats cost and my handmade is explosive. They are within 10 dmg of each other. Kind depend on what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Having ti as a reward for teh first tier could be good
---
sorry I mess read your comment I do actually agree with that.
---
Just remove the caps. The only broken issue with the first seasons present at this point is the caps. It‚Äôs just a way to dupe caps at this point and bypass the 30k cap limit.
---
Elder is really easy to run if you‚Äôve got a good team, and it rolls multiple times if you get elder first try. I got the plan for the symptomatic and the Caged Bulb Lights at the same time for today‚Äôs daily op
---
Fantastic sequence here...
---
I mean, I do socialize in the game. But that isn't the  only reason that I ALWAYS play on teams.  You have to be pretty high level to max out all the legendary perk cards and I want to do it. So max XP every day, all the time is a priority for me. I guess not a lot of people care about the perks.
---
No they cancel each other out. I think.
---
They're not supported, meaning that if a mod breaks your game, Bethesda ain't gonna help you fix it. But they're not blocked, either.
---
Only because everyone seems to have a massive hard on for legacy Gatling Plasmas. Personally I think they‚Äôre incredibly overrated. 
---
I‚Äôll take my Flamer every day of the week. The per shot damage is so damn good. At this point I only use my GP to change things up. The Flamer is always gonna be the best option for when I need to kill a big bad.
---
Only thing i pop is stims and psychobuff. Then unyield/powered armor with stealth mods and what not
---
No it definitely did. I have to move real cautiously now instead of walking right up to peeps.
---
Also, ranged? My damage drop off is massive at long range even with Long Shot and doesn't 'kick in' until they're much closer. Was long shots range extension multiplicative??
---
On the verge of going short barrel with Tank Killer and not even engaging anything until it's infront of me and *needs* to die.
---
Yeah; you can dress up everything **below** the rafters to be all fresh, clean, pre-war, pristine.
---
Then your eyes drift up, and .... bare rafters.  Ugh.
---
Correct there‚Äôs no suppressor for the gauss shotty, but their damage numbers are quite a bit higher than pump and combat shotty, they also benefit from demo expert.
---
Weren‚Äôt they talking about the animated perk cards scrapping for more coins?
---
That would totally negate a majority of high end armor  and weapons and make vats builds ridiculous.
---
Sole item that can't be traded, yeah.. but also the sole unique weapon, vs camp plans and cosmetics.
---
The same is true for Gauss weapons too... They trying to make sure you're "playing the game" rather than play the market i guess...
---
Bug or feature?  Who knows.
---
Says a guy with no gifts.
---
Huh. So they‚Äôre not against the tos or anything then?
---
But how did you "set " it? My terminal has no options?
---
Not atlas observatory that we‚Äôve donated a ridiculous amount of materials to build up for them?
---
Needed for modding/crafting, Int will also have some higher lvl perks you'll dig... And it helps lvl you up faster.
---
full health: vanguard is still a very good option for regular gameplay.
---
daily ops: a set of troubleshooters armor for the robots is very helpful.
---
Oh good point. I forgot about that thing.
---
Furious. Only time ts would be better is if it is also explosive and also on the 50cal.
---
But you can sell them for $$$! Don't forget about the $$$!!!
---
also game bar is disabled, every says that causes issues but still nothing.
---
Use to people got mad though and disapproved of it. So they made it equal
---
Excellent! Which dogmeat are we talking about though? The dogmeat who has major problems dealing with the force fields at a certain Military Base, or the dogmeat whose puppies keep showing up when dogmeat goes to ‚Äúlive‚Äù upstate?
---
Hopefully someone will chime in that can help you out then. I can't vouch for the leveling that was supposed to take place with latest patch allowing lower level players to access full map and enemies scaled back to their level. Best of luck! I'm sure you'll get a kind hearted player to drop some for you
---
I hadn't seen one of those yet, my buddy got one though. I was hoping it would be more like something to put on the roof.  :(
---
I guess not many people care about the legendary perks. Typical answer I hear is, "I'm level 250. I don't care about XP."  
---
I'm thinking, congratulations. You now have 50 more levels before you open up all six slots and hundreds of more levels to fully level all the perk legendary perk cards. 
---
I have maxed out four out of my six legendary  cards, with two points in each of the other two cards.  I want to fully  level them up which means I want every last bit of XP I can get. But to each his own I guess.
---
I feel like you could just do the math yourself.
---
There are client and server mods.
---
Server sided ones are not supported. That's a feature that's been talked about for private worlds.
---
Client sided ones are only available for PC.
---
I was just about to say the same thing. It shows up often on Georgian style buildings, though it typically has more pickets to make up the pattern. This is a more rustic, simplified version.
---
Here's an easy [Google image search](https://www.google.com/search?q=chippendale+railing&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS810US810&amp;oq=chippendale+&amp;aqs=chrome.4.69i57j46j0l5j0i271.6194j0j15&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).
---
I have one of my characters set up with vanguard and he does well enough. I was thinking about troubleshooters actually and I have quite a few pieces.
---
A full set with ghoul slayer, troubleshooter, etc is pretty powerful if mixed over 5 pieces.  You are basically reducing damage from everything by 15 pct.
---
Using something like the SS armor that has high DR anyway and this is a very versatile set.
---
I'm trying to build an ultralight troubleshooter combat set that I can use for silo's, imposter fights, and the daily ops.
---
1000 of each kind that I use
---
What‚Äôs the difference between the giant letters and neon one you can buy for no atoms?
---
Basically they are and could get you banned, but ...
---
Oh I see, thanks for the info. I may have to look into some quality of life ones
---
I dont doubt their power, im just saying it works.
---
I think I carry way to much
---
Much smaller... Before the patch, I had all my workbenches, a PA stand, and a fusion generator all in the same bunker. That's no longer possible to comfortably do which defeats the entire point in me purchasing the damn thing. I've had a ticket in for 4 days now with no response. I was fine with items floating in there and not having the power pass-through that it was pictured with, those issues were annoying but whatever. But making it have a much smaller interior without warning? Now I'm a bit peeved.
---
What about having the Rusty Pick free/ at a lower travel price.
---
There are quite a few on nexus.
---
You'll especially like "save everything" "better inventory" and "perk loadout manager".
---
I agree with this too. I miss just 1-shooting with low level stuff, walking around.
---
I just got a hold of a magic shotgun, so now it's back to strolling through areas and one shotting them in the face... just doesn't feel the same though :(
---
Furious is always gonna be better than 2 shot. Especially on a weapon with a high fire rate.
---
Yh, that's what I have for a marine set which seemed pretty good. 
---
I'm also thinking about troubleshooters for the daily etc. Just needs to be matching as I hate mismatched armour...
---
It's fine the way it is.  
---
If you can simply swap them out like the others then it will make any player who has at least 3 over powered.  
---
Someone did a video on which ones are best and for the most part I agree.  
---
All ranged characters should have Ammo Factory even with the Ammo Maker, Ammosmith, and Super Duper R3.  
---
Luck tends to greatly increase criticals, crippling, and VATS performance so IMO making it as high as possible is good for any build.  
---
The Ranged attack % increase one is on my sniper. Along with the Rifle perks and Concentrated Fire R3, I'm still doing a good amount of damage despite the hit.  
---
I'm no fan of grinding. What you upgrade in these is per character no by account. That wouldn't be good for the same reason. New and -50 characters being superpowered.  
---
Glitchesda wants you to play this for long periods with little reward. You have to beat 76's MMO mechanics b/c it is one at it's core.
---
I believe your true opinion is vampire's.
---
One lightbulb for you. Better build a second reactor if you want to light up more than a 1 room hovel. You could maybe try and find some led bulbs but those are super rare now a days.
---
All of it.
---
anywhere from 1k to 5k .45, 500 to 1200 shotgun shells, and at least 1k U2cmEC shotgun shells.
---
I haven't got rewards for elder completion the last 2 days. I'm just chalking it up to bad luck.
---
Might be an issue if you have/had a 2nd monitor or a turned off 2nd monitor that is marked as primary for windows - FO76 always starts on the primary. 
---
Usual generic advice if this isn't the case - verify game file integrity via beth launcher or steam.
---
I'd like to help, my gamertag is Brightwolf123.
---
I agree.  I have about 120ish and all collected legitimately or traded for back when they offered scrip.  I already feel cheated from the scrip being removed.  
---
The only fair way to get rid of them would be to set a reasonable limit to how many a person could have and then announce a deadline to open excess gifts well in advance.  If they aren't opened by the deadline.. poof.  
---
The weight of them was already increased 10x a few months ago.
---
This is the way.
---
Neither Anakin likes them.
---
Since the legendary perks came out, about 10K 5mm, 5k each of .45 and 5.56.
---
Guess I‚Äôm buying an Xbox then hahahaha
---
I'm on a laptop, and tried the verify function, says the files are fine.
---
Me too. Lol.
---
If nothing else it gives me another set to build and shop vendors for.
---
5K-10K of: 308, 50, 5mm, 2mm, fuel.
---
10 plasma cores for robots daily ops.
---
I use both maxed bandolier and batteries included.
---
I have tons of ammo but I dont carry them... I like to see the amount of ammo I use in the hud...  if you have over 1000 it just say 999
---
Typically several thousands(10k or so) for .50cal, 1-3k of most, and currently about 10k fuel since I picked up so much.
---
im indeed on pc :) now im really curious about the bloodied handmade haha and yea my handmade kills me a lot but i love it it was my first ''god roll'' how my so calls it and  i will give adrenaline a shot :)  i really really dislike power armor tho ... so i would rather keep dying tbh xd thanks for your advice btw :D
---
None
---
2.5k of 5mm for my gatling gun, 1.75k of .45 for my lever gun and fixer, 500 2mm EC for my gauss shotgun
---
Over 10000 but it's 5mm.
---
What's interesting about exploring an area that hasn't been updated since the Morgan town tweak? There's nothing new, just a new struggle.
---
Got a prime event earlier with molerats and radscorpions at the same time. What a combo.
---
Turn on pacifist. That negates the bug.
---
perfect opportunity to wear an outfit to cover up the mismatched set.
---
I don‚Äôt know how powerful the generator is, but explosive railways are awesome. They aren‚Äôt legacy yet but I suspect at certain point they can be. Good power and only needs steel for ammo, it‚Äôs like screaming ‚Äòlegacy me‚Äô.
---
This is true. I read that there were people knew bundles were broken and bought them anyway to ask for a refund because they knew a broken item would result in essentially a free bundle. A broken item can eventually be fixed, but who knows when it will come back to the shop.
---
Yes
---
Yeah you right
---
hmm, i have 15 k in 2cm, 10 k in .50, 15 k in .308, 10 k in cryo cells, and 63 Fusion cores üòÖ
---
Currently I have about 400 ultracite plasma cores, with the rest stored elsewhere.
---
Yes!!! Absolutely!!!!
---
Agreed.  I intend to open one every hour tonight for all you knobs who happen to be on my server.
---
Cool
---
VE gatling plasma all the way.
---
I mean jeeze. Make all the locations a free fast travel spot while you're at it.  Since when does the cost, even without Perk cards, actually impede anyone over level 50?
---
Ya that‚Äôs what I do, cool
---
Stop killing this Guy's cow
---
I love this so much!
---
Only a cultist deals in absolutes
---
Nice
---
YEAHHHHHHHH
---
I used it last night without issue. Maybe his server is stale?
---
hah that's fun! Nice build! Thanks for sharing this! I love seeing creative camps!
---
Is this just going to be a daily topic of discussion for us now?
---
That's exactly what I'm doing now :) I'm two limbs off of a full set of marine zealots!
---
checked this this evening and i could change 1 thing so it has a 3 mm length longer durabilty bar now xD
---
15k +
---
I had 18,000 5.56 go in one transaction. Bloody startling as I hit 30k straight away and quickly logged out lol.
---
I don‚Äôt use much vats, never ‚Äòcrits‚Äô, so all I have is Bloody Mess and Serendipity.
---
I can't do that... :)
---
Don't forget starched genes and class freak.
---
Yup everyday we shall meet on a random post and discuss pa vampire builds lol
---
as much as i can find/craft 
---
rifleman = 2K+ at all times
---
commando 4k+ at all times
---
5K or so of everything that I use often, 10k 5mm, plus 10 of each type core.  Batteries included 3 and Bandolier 3.  I don't keep any ammo in my stash.
---
I thought this post was about Ark for a second, not gonna lie.
---
Damn you guys with your 5/10k ammo.... I take around 100 .308 and 200 10mm. I'm guessing nobody goes looting whole towns at a time for scrap? 
---
Clearly my level 28 knows nothing of the endgame struggles üòÜ
---
Heads up: everything you build in a private world, like at a workshop, will disappear after you leave the server unless you return in 20 or 30 minutes. camp stays the same.
---
Wow
---
Heavy gunner?
---
240. 240. Trust me on that number.
---
Well they already got all those old Doom characters they can pull reference from...
---
Ouch. This sucks
---
You're stating the obvious. Nothing in 2020 is the same as it was 10 years ago. The point is that Obsidian is still a good pick for the work that is at least possible now. Microsoft is going to get its money's worth and now they have their hands on Doom, Elder Scrolls, and Fallout. In addition, we already know Microsoft acquired the ownership of The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Wolfenstien, Quake, Doom, and others. The price tag alone tells you the franchise density was part of the package. Remember how Xbox got its flagship game at the start... buying that company that debuted  two games at MacWorld back in 1999. That company showed off Oni and Halo at Macworld (which lead to many more titles for Halo) and if this acquisition is anything like that (promoting the Xbox/Game pass) you can be sure those IPs wont be collecting dust. Though this is also obvious, since anyone who think Bethesda is doing it right is just delusional.
---
UPDATE.
---
I've since slowly gotten back into the game after taking about a months break oh I also got the platinum trophy so yay me I  guess xD the new season of the battle pass is alright so far so I'm optimistic at least :D
---
This is the way.  *puts mandalorian pa helmet on.*
---
Did you repair it to 200%?
---
Cool I‚Äôve been crafting and I have like over 20k of 5mm and we‚Äôll over 15k for 50cal
---
What gun? Are you running gunsmith?
---
Good idea
---
Yea I always have those and bloody mess on. It's just how those remaining cards and points should be used
---
Pretty much, though it just means it can get released, not will.
---
I've gotten  some repeats. Getting worried ill miss the panels and bos suit. Its only been a few days but im still nervous.
---
Oh, okay.
---
You know you have to press Y to crit in vats?
---
No I was at nav
---
This is good advice, and it does work. I got the communist and grelok bundles refunded for their issues and it didn't take much than submitting a couple of tickets and then bumping them for a couple of days and they did let me keep the items. Unfortunately, it is starting to make me resentful of the game. Wish they would just do a better job after this long and not stick to the stereotype quite so accurately. Also my friends list has been broken since August 22nd...
---
Since I switched to Heavy Guns, I keep between 15k-20k
---
Get fireproof rank two my dude.
---
Yeah its bound to happen. They don't have duplicate protection. Ive also got no rare twice.
---
Yeah, I crafted about 2600 total.
---
Perhaps the "Follow Me" emote?  Would be hard to miss the connection on that one.
---
Good to know!
---
Well I mean if you get a build you like and max it out you don‚Äôt need to carry tens of thousands of ammo but near game end it‚Äôs fun to have
---
Both? I use a Quad HM in daily ops with ADS extra damage and for its reduced muzzle climb, and Fixer for overland due to extra stealth and higher single shot damage.
---
Fake Omega ü§£ü§£
---
Don't run gunsmith. Use fix it good to repair to 200% an use those 5 points elsewhere. Just use it when needed only 3 points.
---
To that I say boo
---
So, I‚Äôm new to this game guys. How can I get a cow?
---
Yea on PS4 it‚Äôs triangle or something.
---
Dang it ! That last op was soooo close. 1 second!!  I was permanently staggered and frozen, couldn't Do much üòÇ 
---
Anyway, it was fun. Hope you had some fun aswell :) good night.
---
There‚Äôs your problem.
---
Same!
---
Not complaining. I been selling it at scrip prices and people are buying it up!
---
&gt; bad news if you just want the stuff
---
I don‚Äôt play much but I bought my way all the way to tier 76 just for the BoS bunker because I‚Äôm a simp for BoS so if anybody else is like me, that‚Äôs not an issue. Lol.
---
You need to be lvl50 or over for the new plans to drop
---
How do you get rid of the ammo in your stash? I've even labelled it free in the vendor and nobody buys it. Just wasting space at the moment. I had to band up loads of scrap and sell it at a train station to make space.
---
Turn on pacifist. This will negate the bug that lets them pvp. As far as destroying your camp, it was probably a hacked gun that shoots explosive bait.
---
If not pc, was your base right next to a workshop that you owned?
---
Ya I been crafting 450ammo for 5mm and 50 cal is nice
---
You dare challenge the true leader of omachron perseid 8????
---
Daily Ops has made it so easy to farm certain kinds of ammo when running solo. As a group, you can have one person kill everything, everyone gets ammo, and rotate through.
---
Ssme
---
hmmm.....stay in first person?
---
While I can miss  2/3 times  with a 65-68% chance....
---
sometimes i get too much steel and lead now and i just craft tons of 5 mm and .50s and sell them for 1 cap xD
---
Just repair your main weapon as needed, you've got a week.
---
Instigating guns and vats headshots are pretty casual in any scorched or ghoul areas. Stress free murder is still possible.
---
Ya same man
---
I've got about 70k ultra 556 and 30k ultra 45 from max ammo factory I sell 1-1 to anyone I do a daily opp with if you happen to catch me on xbox
---
Laptops sometimes have special function keys to manage screens - make sure it isn't set to multiple displays. Right clicking somewhere on the screen and selecting display settings should work too, your built in screen should be alone and display a 1
---
If they're just crappy low level non-legendary stuff don't waste resources repairing them. Just pick up a new one from something you killed and scrap the old one.
---
As a weekly--yeah I'll defs hit that.
---
Pretty sure I have been getting them all along. 90 percent but not 100.
---
Well I mean just got to have patience well selling, also you can just drop it or grab their two bandolier and drag along with you
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs a bummer time to pop some lunchboxes and grind some beat week lol
---
For real though, my xbox gamertag has Omega in it, along with many people in my friends list, as we started as a halo clan, and kinda moved to other games as halo5 kinda died down.
---
You have a chance to win caps ,scrip, or treasury notes
---
True story. Nothing new to explore because the enemies are a little harder. Now it just costs more bullets and time.
---
Yes, anyone soloing is losing out on a lot. Casual teams are a must!
---
You can still fully solo on a public team. Just mute if anyone starts talking (rare on PC), and everyone still pretty much leaves everyone else alone for the most part. Far more benefits!
---
To add insult to injury you can't even trade the weapon once you craft it or get a drop. I got the tenderizer plan for meat week the first time around. I can trade the plan and the weapon that comes from it, or any legendary variants I get dropped. The plan at least should be trade-able for the glaive
---
Broken items have forced me to stop buying from the atom shop . When the things I pay money for directly don't function (that includes if I spent atoms on spaces for the boardgame) that to me is a problem and not one I'm willing to overlook any longer.
---
It was meant to bring balance to the wasteland, not leave it in darkness!
---
If you are on xbox and you want to join up we wouldnt be adverse, you arent the first person who had an omega name before knowing about us ü§£
---
Good to know, so if you also stack Weapons Artisan you can repair it to 400%?
---
My minigun holds 500 bullets. I'd like to think 20 drums of ammo isn't excessive.
---
Not on Xbox but this was more of a question about what‚Äôs the Average ammo carry but cool anyways
---
Lol they are capped just capped depending your level. The Forrest is capped at 50
---
Yup. Last week they made changes to the Communist Bunker. They changed the inside from being a room with round walls to a hexagonal shape. In doing so, they fucked my [weapon display bunker](https://i.imgur.com/VVB7XQB.jpg) that took me a long time to set up because of the bugginess of the displays. The change made the interior smaller, and every item, including my stash box, was inside the wall and not visible.
---
I got the Communist Bunker refunded not because of the interior change - which wasn't bad. So, I got a refund... but not because of the changed walls. But it was because I had to redo my weapon display and that's just a goddamn chore.
---
I bet it requires a wire
---
Lol I'm sorry it died down. I bet you guys killed it back in the day. You'll have a chance to come back together with halo 6 though
---
It‚Äôs a chance.
---
Multiple of 3 and 5. Perfect.
---
found it out, your suggest help a bit. my display runs at 300 hz refresh rate, turned it down to 60 and start right up. thanks man.
---
Why be so nosy?  Everyone on the server doesn't need to know what others are doing.  Some people solo them and some play with a small group of friends and might not want extra people joining.  Some people aren't even in public groups, wouldn't be able to force join them anyway.
---
Heard mentality only works on a team lol
---
Also, 18 dmg and energy resist for 1 point is legit. It has really bad diminishing effects, but worth a one star slot.
---
Used to be a 30 sec or less quest... now into the 1-2 min mark LOL. Still one of the best fast quests around... battle bot and fly swatter too.
---
I came in once too late and the quest ended/failed. Mad Dog was still hanging out, so I killed him. You can actually loot him if the quest is already over.
---
Bingo!
---
Does this not work with canned meat stew? Thought that had a similar xp buff. Not checked it since the last update though.
---
or it could be the death knell.. too early to say for sure....
---
240 is a multiple of 3, 5, 15, 24, and 40. On top of that it‚Äôs easy to squeeze in a bunch of 9 point armors as well and still claim every last scrip. Try and get all 250 with just 3 * weapons. At 240, you can just shred 6 3* weapons and be done.
---
See this is the thing. Fast travel cost is a pointless way to remove caps from a game with a cap limit. You can avoid it completely by smart playing. 
---
There‚Äôs parts of this game that are literally built around knowing a lot of gamers have gotten lazy. As in, spending a few minutes traveling which is just pushing things on a controller, is just the worst thing to have to do. 
---
People should be asking for better cap sinks and better things to spend caps on than whining for a new free fast travel location to save 5-10 caps.
---
That‚Äôs why this post is nothing but preemptive whining.
---
I'm essentially always on a team so...
---
With how bad damage doesn't apply correctly right now an rubber banding does it really matter? Would be cool dont get me wrong. But damage seems so broken right now. I headshot stuff for 800 dmg an see it legit die and rubber band back to full hp.
---
Dropping is a good idea actually. Pretty sure I've got loads of other misc crap to drop too from old quests. What's bandolier? Is that a perk for ammo that I'll get available later on? Haven't seen that yet
---
dont go it alone in the east yo..
---
not unless you got your min/max game totally together
---
-edit: oh, lol.. ash heap.. what lvl are you? im arouns 110-140 on my toons and get 60s in the ash heap
---
Mr. Pebbles deserves to be the protagonist in the upcoming Starfield!!!
---
100% this.
---
Thank god, my 1,100 notes wasn't enough.
---
Ya it‚Äôs a perk which reduces the weight of ammo by 45% then 90%
---
If they‚Äôre not going to up the scrip per day I wish they‚Äôd let us lower the levels of legendaries (not gonna happen, but why not). 
---
My stash is full (and I have fo1st). My character is near max carry and I‚Äôve gotten all my scrip for the day. 
---
Only option I see is to drop them someplace. And I wish I could do that in a lower level area for folks starting out. But it‚Äôs all level 50 for me, so that doesn‚Äôt work.
---
That was all before the changes. Things are different now.
---
This is about the weekly challenge, I forgot to add that.
---
Gunsmith slows the rate your weapons break. Weapons artisan let‚Äôs you repair above
---
Yes please add a DPS meter so we can shame everyone who is doing less DPS than we are and totally turn this whole game into a homogenized efficient raiding machine via peer pressure.  
---
/s
---
They‚Äôre animals and I slaughtered them like animals!
---
I think of that too. Work out how many mags I have left after each building before deciding whether to continue or head back and rearm
---
Anybody get the dungeon door?
---
Is that laser shooting gallery thing a minigame or just decoration?
---
I did daily op but didnt get a rare drop 
---
That norm ?
---
I think i‚Äôm replying to the wrong person
---
I've spawned into the fissure, random ditches in the nuke zone, the glass cavern entrance, etc. It happens even when I try to fast travel to the bunker instead of the event marker. If I die I can respawn in any random location in the nuke zone.
---
It's pretty rough if you're bloodied, because you can take lethal rads before you have time to do anything about it.
---
Definitely try to get the dense mod on your chest piece; that'll help with the self damage from TSE.
---
My in game name is Mutinyofthemind. Just pulled that handmade off a mule onto my main; no rush, just next time you're online and in game. Or just PM me when you've got time.
---
Lots of XP though. Played for three hours and gained six levels!
---
I honestly thought I did lol, I'm lvl 160 bloodied commando build, using a aa auto fixer.
---
You get actual rewards for participating in PTS stuff?
---
No it was not near one. I‚Äôm always at the substation near Watoga
---
Delete this. I don't want more people showing up an taking my XP!
---
As commando just switching from Heavy Guns, I take 2k for my bloodied explosive combat rifle, 3k for my quad handmade, and 1k shells for my vampire shotgun. I used to carry more guns and ammo but I‚Äôve found out that this is about what I need for my usual play sessions, to replenish, I use the Raider collection gathering guns and ammo, the ammo creation machine from max raider rep, and daily ops runs. Haven‚Äôt had to craft any ammo in a long time.
---
Possibly.  I use herd mentality, but not body guard
---
Yep...shouldnt take too long
---
this is the answer.. id add a reminder to not repair past 100% until after the challenge
---
Do we want advice for efficiency? This last time around almost every cookout I went to was over in less than 3 minutes. Several times I travelled there as soon as the notification popped up and it was over before I loaded in.
---
They‚Äôre functionally not capped until you‚Äôre over level 50. If you‚Äôre level 30, there‚Äôs nowhere on the map you can go where the enemies are going to be under level 30, which is pretty unusual for an RPG. It‚Äôs really not something that bothers me a ton. Earlier enemies like scorched are still a little less bullet spongy regardless of level.
---
Can they be listed in the common rewards when obtained ?
---
If i see i got nothing in the rare rewards section i just leave without bothering to check the other rewards. Just in case i might be missing them without knowing.
---
A lot of 10 mm , .50cal , and fusion cells
---
Gotta keep my weapons fed.
---
In my experience, four leaf clover and psychopath have a fairly low chance to process.
---
Don't forget about crit savy, it's probably the best crit related card IMO
---
Theres oodles of time. The Ops are going to be around for a while yet even if they change type.
---
I like the way it is now. Game has been far too easy for a long time. One Wasteland brought a challenge to the game and made low level events viable for high level players now, rather than the same events over and over. I do feel like it could be tweaked in areas though, as it isn‚Äôt perfect.
---
TSE guns break 4 times faster iirc. The AOE reduces durability even more and Two shot aswell.
---
Used a TSE Handmade before patch 22, broke really quick even with Gunsmith 5.
---
I'm too lazy to do that sorry
---
Mole miners should be a good source.
---
Yep
---
Also got a level 100 sheepsquatch at the end.  Beat it, but it‚Äôs tough with all of the burrowing enemies
---
uranium fever...or if you only need 3 then toxic larry's.
---
Hahaha well I can‚Äôt be mad at that
---
Fuck Zenimax/ZOS. They're the asshats behind the circus that is ESO.
---
If Beth did to this game what ZOS does to ESO regularly, the 'I quit' posts would be COVID scale. They routinely fuck with skills, classes and gear which renders them useless. Couldn't power balance themselves to save their lives. 
---
Imagine grinding out that SS Uny set for next week Beth to say 'Yeah we're nerfing it. It does +1 to each stat and doesn't exceed the +15 Max for a SPECIAL.' No compensation for the time or mats lost. Just stash it and pray one day they wisen up. 
---
ESO loved to just nerf hammer whatever end game set they felt, particularly Monster Sets (RIP Earthgore, RIP Symphony).
---
Anyways back on track - OP I approach it like 'it cant be any worse'.
---
You turned them against me!
---
I dont understand why you wouldnt! They're so cute, warm and fuzzy
---
That's why i have my junkies death claw. Change a few Perks then fist everyone to death.
---
I think it‚Äôs a bug, I just deploy another power armor chassis and then I‚Äôm able to exit the armor I‚Äôm in.
---
Nah, the trade off isn‚Äôt worth it. It was way better to have a big chunk of the map be a low level zone that high levels could waltz around in. Great place to build a CAMP to avoid high level enemies, and enjoy the scenery.
---
The Riding Shotgun event has glowing mongrels
---
I will try my best to get the mod and I'm online right now in game name is nuhvok_kall
---
This was the first time they did anything like this.
---
Usually we don't even get replies to our questions or suggestions or bug reports...
---
I finally made it today. 8:01 :D and learnt few tricks to help me to rush.
---
I dont ever recall a large number of glowing hounds at west tek and I use to farm that place daily. Go to the mines where uranium fever is, should be a good amount of glowing miners in there in the path to the left after you see the two dead glowing miners.
---
Yep.
---
That dress is a bug. They're not supposed to have bonuses
---
i got over 100 just doing radiation rumble
---
I will continue to kill cows until people stop picking my camp locked doors.
---
With OW I'm hoping to see more people in the bog and fewer in the Ash Heap. Five meats vs two and the mobs are the same. üòÅ
---
Make sure to shoot them in the legs thays their weak spot even though the numbers dont pop up yellow.
---
Yeah, basically. It should get better. SHOULD. We‚Äôll see.
---
Very true. We‚Äôll see.
---
If you have 3 points in INT, then its better to have 3 points in Gunsmith, than none.  Then repair as needed.  Plus, without Gunsmith, you‚Äôre lacking in what you can mod...
---
Directly east of Monongah power plant, could just follow the railway track north from top of the world for a long but easy route.
---
Mole miners are Uranium Fever are probably easiest. Also the Autumn Acre cabin usually has a few glowing wolves around it, then you can stroll down the hill to Toxic Larry's which always has three glowing snallygasters nearby.
---
These are all just band-aids instead of cures. It lets Bethesda shrug off their responsibility. 
---
And considering that there is a current **non-exploit** that allows players to get infinite caps (meaning it doesn‚Äôt use a hack of a glitch or violate the ToS, etc.), all of these suggestions that are intended to ‚Äòstop infinite caps‚Äô are not going for stop the dupers.
---
I believe he‚Äôs referring to the pictures you would see on the Atomic Shop associated with said items.
---
A bug since the game launched? Damn I want more of these "bugs" for other outfits!
---
What does the table have to do with the game? I play with my computer on the fucking floor. I bet you have running water too you dork
---
Yes, thank you. I figured it out later, by accident lol
---
Not that I've seen, but I've gone through all of three legendary miniguns in 391 levels.  
---
In general, that spinup is the same no matter one.  
---
Best I can suggest is get a good handle on how long you can spin before it starts firing and basically keep it humming on most occasions.
---
There needs to be one area in the game where lowlevel enemies are capped so theres a place low levels (and high) can grind for challenges or xp and Morgantown would be a good spot. So many atom challenges require using a specific weapon etc and that just got a whole lot harder to achieve
---
Maybe a legendary perk along the lines of master armorer?
---
Wat r the rewards
---
They patched the other one with the Free Radicals mask
---
Soo.. Is my TSE Dragon a legacy? I never knew that, had it in my vendor forever.
---
I may not need to but I might want to because I enjoy playing all the events
---
Are you suffering from the plight of Earle as well?  So many screws!!
---
They're dead, every single one of them.  Not just the rabid mole rats, but the brood mothers and the scorched, too.
---
No. They break at the same speed. You're just sinking more shots into enemies.
---
This little one's not worth the effort. Come, let me get you somethingüç∫
---
There is a plan you can get for a bramin pen, and it will be located under the resources tab in your CAMP build menu. I believe it costs 4 razorgrain and 1 steel.
---
15-25k 5mm ammo, I also carry 80+ fusion cores.
---
How did you acquire such 10mm?  Lol.  The problem with 10mm is that it‚Äôs similar in crafting costs to 5.56.  So people will 9/10 opt to craft that (likely a much higher ratio) 
---
I do roll around with a 10mm.  But post patch 22 - I‚Äôm using a lot more ammo than I‚Äôm finding.
---
between 7 to 10k of 5mm and generally around 25 plasma cores.
---
Thank you buddy!
---
Easy to patch them out... why not add them in? Something wrong with me asking?
---
There are actually 38 times zones, 27 are hourly offsets, crazy right?
---
Fuck
---
I'll buy it
---
Being a massive coward and/or lazy, I've taken to seeing which Primal Cuts event everyone else on the server is going to, then join that one. It's just kinder on my ammo stores (and to be clear, I was doing this in the pre-One Wasteland meat week too, for the same reason).
---
Yup totally agree. No one is on top of the world oneshotting everything any more.
---
I wish they would realise that game difficulty can be different than just opponents that can take three clips of bullets a pop... I mean damn a wolf that can shrug off five point blank blasts to the head with a shotgun is just a tad bit broken...
---
Technically? Maybe? All I know is if they want to ban me for making it so I can type numbers into a box, I won't miss playing their game.
---
They want them to be cosmetic only. Also adding buffs to the literal hundreds of outfits takes a long time and they're not fans of doing work like that.
---
With the way the outfits are set up, they'd need to make new magic effects for each combination. There's a lot involved.
---
Lol!!
---
I don't know if I could go back honestly. Their pretty much giving away xp now, and I kinda like it.
---
No, what needs to be tweaked is the DR increase in the lower levels. It's just asinine to think that lvl 20-35 can cope with a 750% increase in mobs' DR.
---
That will only net frustrated players.
---
Your suggestion might fit you play style, but I am happy to finally have higher levels all over.
---
I hope you only play on one character then.
---
Those were the first two things I got. Then nothing for a few runs. The. Back to back BOS suits.
---
All they really need to do is adjust the cap based upon the area. 
---
Forest 30
---
Ash heap/toxic valley 50
---
Divide and beyond 75
---
Just this would help a lot
---
Speed demon mutation might since it speeds you up all around. Otherwise, not that I'm aware of. I've just gotten in the habit of starting to fire before I need to and keeping a Gatling on hot key if I get swarmed.
---
Came here looking to find out if it was just me...
---
Its not and i don't have butchers bounty on
---
That's absolutely lame and lazy.
---
GitHub still uses AWS so I don't see why Fallout would be different. Moving from one cloud to another requires some code to be rewritten so staying on AWS will be easier.
---
How about trying it with at least 1, 2 others? Getting you to elder and the best chance? 
---
Or is it just to much to ask for 8-9 minutes with a group?
---
High Level doesn‚Äôt mean lots of experience or knowledge. I had to point out to a few people that there is a multiplier in the uplink meter.
---
Technically yes but hopefully not forever. It doesnt make much sense on why they would totally remove these weapons from the other drop tables and like I mentioned I dont believe they ever gave a reason why... Im not sure if it was intentional or not
---
If I am waiting for an enemy, I feather the trigger in a way that allows me to be spinning the barrel without firing. It allows me to accomplish what you are describing.
---
&gt;But what I really hate and I really cant understand this: a team of high level players running towards the enemies and leave the uplink. Why do you guys do this? I understand you are trigger happy but this so fucking stupid. Is it because you want the kills? The ammo/stimpack drops? Why do you do this?
---
morons farming mobs for XPs..
---
Yup, Demo Experts 100% adds damage to explosive guns.
---
If you get the friendly fire perk( heals teammates with fire) it works with pets. I have saved mine couple times with that.
---
If your vendor prices are insane, then the cow gets slain.
---
Heck yeah mate I hope you can get it all down
---
Mole Miners outside of Blackwater Mine usually have a few Glowing, IIRC.  Even if Uranium Fever isn‚Äôt running.
---
No. You just spool up before you need it ie you have to learn how to set combat pace on your terms.
---
It's also good to quickly visualise order of attack so you maximise your attack burst before you spool up again. It may require you to reposition before you fire so you're line of fire isn't blocked. 
---
Likewise, melee as priority targets do you don't get rushed down.
---
If you do all of the above the delay is a non issue.
---
And they drop the best loot üòí
---
Yess! I want a gold fiddy!

---
They could simply go to westtek
---
Technically, no. I believe that she married Bryce Garrahan, and they had a kid shortly after the Great War. They're living in a vault after she convinced the dwellers to admit them in exchange for fixing their vault door.
---
She only mentions her daughter to Paige but tells the Vault Dweller that her family is in the vault, so Garrahan's fate isn't exactly confirmed to my knowledge. Regardless, they're unlikely to see one another again.
---
Absolutely agreed
---
I can go at it in a few hours! But sure! Yes! Thank you!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Primal_Cuts
---
There‚Äôs three rolls per character per day. 5%/10%/80%. Which means it‚Äôs possible to not get anything due to RNG.
---
My CAMP is just south of that lake and i start each day by walking over and killing all 3. I only dine on the finest Ribeyes, yall can hav those gamey radstags
---
There's a perk to increase your reload speed but there isn't any way that I'm aware of to shorten the spin up. The gauss minigun feels like it's shorter, but that could be psychological.
---
I have been using it for over a 100 lvs and it definitely did not break this fast
---
or anywhere on the map because 1wasteland...
---
thats what makes them morons..
---
1200 ish rounds of ultracite.45
---
... Ive done Ops multiple times a day with teammates and solo and never been ejected out of my power armor while activating those things. How is it happening to you so frequently.
---
Its mostly people running off to loot the ammo. A lot of people have been able to leave with more ammo than they invested and don't care about the 8 minutes after their first daily run.
---
Saaaaaammmeee
---
Too many people who play have A.D.D...Daily ops shows who those individuals are
---
One thing I‚Äôve done to remedy this ever so slightly: 
---
If you are ok with a flat roof, you can somehow build a stairway up there, the bottom of floor tiles is still wood but much less decrepit. The wire mesh ones also look good as roofs. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for glass roofs for this precise reason!!!
---
For every minecraft, there's a halo. That franchise got steadily worse over time.
---
This is true. Some people have high levels with very little in game hours. Resulting in little knowledge about how to actually play the game
---
Take off Better Criticals and replace it with Critical Savvy.
---
Better Criticals just adds more additive % damage, which all got heavily nerfed in the recent patch, so perks which give extra % damage are pretty weak now and have severe diminishing returns.  
---
Critical Savvy allows you to spam off crits wayyy more often, which gives you a much higher dps overall, much better than a small amount of extra % dmg per crit.
---
Angry Turtle, - while he hasn't done a video on this specifically (not yet anyway), - has hinted in a couple of videos that crits are apparently much more effective since the most recent patch. Previously you could get away with never using them, not anymore.
---
This plus 6k-10k for heavy auto.
---
It gets better.
---
I'll give that a shot, it seems to work best on enemies who shoot at you. Wendigo's n molerats are a pain. I think I'll just use it for supermutants. Maybe sbq.
---
Same.
---
You realize how good ESO is right..? Currently one of the, if not the best MMO currently out. It‚Äôs got a healthy player base (at least 10x that of FO76), scheduled content, loads of story and loads of fun. Idk what sob story you have to try and justify your resentment to ESO but I can assure you no one shares your hateful feelings.
---
No Fort Defiance.
---
It will be ATLAS observatory. We were donating junk for weeks. Go there and speak with NPC here so you will learn more from him. Basically this guy is making preparations so BoS will take this place as their HQ in Appalachia.
---
As a West Virginian I want them to add more stuff that makes my camp look like a trailer trash meth lab.
---
Eh I dunno, this would make fighting any group of enemies feel pretty inconsistent. I think it just makes sense that some creatures shouldn't scale, and it's okay to have some specific enemies be lower level.
---
And they fuck children just like Padme.
---
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit together at the table of brotherhood. - MLK
---
Party on, week!
---
Don't expect your team to help you.
---
I do. They give me lots of xp and die easy!
---
Probably depends on how much money it makes and how many active players there are. If it's bringing in enough, I can see them putting more money into it to keep that cash coming which would be good for the game. The other danger will be if they decide to shutter any of the individual studios to lower overhead as often happens in mergers. If the Austin studio gets shuttered, then 76 likely will too.
---
The tesla meta is absolute shit
---
Pvp in general is boring
---
 jump Tesla jump tesla
---
 if not teslas its railways if its not that its someone using magic weapons
---
The real issue is the clean mining helmet is just like the dirty one.
---
I‚Äôve never completed a daily op lower than elder and I‚Äôve never gotten a rare reward. It just be like that sometimes.
---
i'm pretty sure your right, 100 percent not 90 ;)
---
You just watch yourself! We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
---
Tato salad!
---
I have been away for a week. Let me hop on and join in.
---
Well I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs because people are doing the challenge.
---
NO BLASTERS
---
Luckily the ops can be done as a single player, so if one or two players wander off, I can usually still get elder. Get a full team of people on the ball and you start to get those low 5 minutes runs.
---
i thought it was recently added, but it's a chance i guess. i would have no idea, that's for sure
---
I've been playing on an SSD the whole time and load times have been decent. Not blazing fast, but not too long either.
---
Shame!... Shame!...Shame!...
---
Boy are you in for some disappointment
---
One option is a 50 cal, which has no spin up
---
You‚Äôll meet a lot of those ‚Äòhigh levels‚Äô if you frequent Radiation Rumble. Once a legendary ghoul is killed, even though just one star, three or four ‚Äòhigh levels‚Äô wielding duped gat plasma would rush to loot the dead ghoul and just stand there like some kind of ceremony, while six more run pass them and whack the scavengers to death. Don‚Äôt get fooled by the levels, high level idiots are still idiots.
---
&gt;  I mean, where do the caps go anyway? Seems pointless to pay.
---
This exists to take some caps from players. This thing also exist in Guild Wars 2. 
---
This is exactly the same reason why we receive only 90% of caps when somebody buys something from your vendor.
---
Biv! Tha dudesh aweshome. ü•¥
---
Mort or another ghoul would also be cool.
---
haha i'm a fan of them because i play on all 5 toons, but i know what you mean if you have a ton of them already. are you buying all your lunchoboxes with them?
---
What platform? On PC the game struggles to hold 2,000 players every day so that‚Äôs most likely the reasoning, don‚Äôt doubt console has those same numbers. (I‚Äôve seen a few PC players here complaining about it)
---
Okay then. Thank you for your contribution.
---
4 levels in one hour
---
There's 2 different versions, the one looking up (the better one imo) costs atoms, the one looking down is free.
---
It's weird how they weren't in a free bundle, but that's Bethesda greed for you.
---
thanks for the info!
---
You mean you don‚Äôt just have 3k vault steel in your scrapbox? Noob
---
I constantly spam the come here emoji and it works pretty well.
---
I don‚Äôt even shoot the initial guys, run to the repairs run to the uplink then start shooting. So annoying. But it‚Äôs never taken me more than 2 runs to get under 8
---
Good point. Wendigos stagger a lot and rush. Mole rats used to be bashable with the shredder barrel mod. Not so much after one wasteland, though
---
Ops have less damage to durability of weapons and return exactly the same ammo used. It is a better xp farm than anything else.
---
Those who used to grind (like myself) did it for two reasons. To get the rate drops and to get extras to trade/sell/give to friends. Between this and the last one most people have gotten the stuff.
---
Plus many people are probably spending today doing daily/weekly challenges. As the week goes they may become bored and jump in a few.
---
First one I did by myself and it was a tad brutal.
---
Oh what I would do for that
---
How are you finding it for farming .50? I find I actually *lose* ammo when I do an Op with my .50 cal. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or what, but the enemies don't seem to drop much of that ammo type.
---
Maybe some love for the plasma. Like old-school F3/NV.
---
10mm pistol too please?
---
Hello! And oh! Right I'm on Xbox. It seemed weird. It doesn't bug me that I failed the event. Just very loenly XP
---
I don‚Äôt like molerats period.
---
https://youtu.be/Sa1D_YDWQEQ
---
Haha I noticed the change when I walked in my bunker and everything was half sunk into the wall. Ultimately I prefer the change but I also didn't have weapon displays on my wall i had to reset.
---
In an ideal wasteland this would happen.
---
I played today and it was pretty busy. Cant complain.
---
It‚Äôs still less of a grind than it was running the three vault difficulties every day. Honestly I think the solar armour is an underrated set for full health builds but you‚Äôre right the jet pack kind of makes all other armour sub par
---
Sounds like a controller problem not a game problem
---
Haha sweet! I'm on Xbox XP it's been pretty lonely :'( :P
---
Bandolier fans unite!
---
Check the patch notes, I would provide a link but im lazy.
---
Or you can check my comments its a couple back.
---
No I won't be disappointed. I'm not entitled to anything, I'm just not afraid to put out some ideas for how a corporation can better serve me for my dollars.
---
This is the very reason I sell things at 10% more than what I would if I traded directly. A majority of my wares are 22 caps, that way, I get 20, which is how much I'd want directly. Stoopid taxes!
---
I‚Äôve never ran it solo. I‚Äôve gotten elder with only one teammate, so I know that is doable. Have you been able to get elder by running it solo?
---
Alright i get it now.
---
Yes.  I get elder solo every day.
---
I logged on for an hour earlier today and did three Primal Cuts and a BBQ, on PS4 all of the events were highly attended and the BBQ ended in less than five minutes because everyone was actually doing their thing.
---
the BOS one is more or less the same, but with an extremely rare chance to also get ammo and stimpacks. So no need if you have the BOS one!
---
The primal cuts events are near impossible so I think a few people gave up there and the rest got everything they wanted in the first round and aren't gonna do it again
---
Eh.  You know your own number won't lie.  I looked at one chart and it was off.
---
Yea but I had no idea Fix It Good also does the job.
---
Why anyone would downvote a post that gives an idea for how we can be better served for our money, is beyond me. Enjoy the corporate boot.
---
Hello! Ah I been split between doing the meat week stuff and then also the daily stuff as well. It's alot to me personally :P
---
I have a lot of ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù massagers that use a lot of power myself.
---
Imagine my FO76 playing as decent as my Skyrim. Hm.
---
I guess I‚Äôll have to try. I wonder how long each signal takes to boost with just me. Is it something like ~2.5 min?
---
My heavy build: 37k 50cal, 28k 5mm, 237 plasma cores, 13k .308
---
Just made some bullets.
---
It‚Äôs for armor. Also white knight reduces the cost to repair
---
For these types of challenges (there are some in the World/Combat IIRC), I buy from low level players if they have damaged gear and check the vendors. Or I just repair what I pick up before scrapping it.
---
By yourself??? Golly I tried doing it all myself and it was terrible XP I was like a headless chicken runnin around
---
Haha nice! Happy for you then buddy (:
---
The rats are so easy to kill 2-3 shots from a gatling gun and they die (without any damage cards)
---
So in June of next year you can start asking for.this kinda thing.  They haven't handed off the keys yet.
---
Should be 2 minutes flat.  2 per signal, 2 for boss and minions, and 2 for everything else.
---
Lol you're truly foolish to think I care enough to click that video link. 
---
Its sad really, your original comment made it seem like you actually knew what you were talking about.
---
This is all pointing to fixing pvp the was a huge aspect of the game the took out for no reason now you got grief era finding exploits
---
RIP. AND. TEAR.
---
u/LadyDevann u/Valseek u/LoneVaultWanderer please PLEASE pass this one to the devs. This has been broken since day 1 and it really shouldn‚Äôt be.
---
Yes. Why can't we start discussion now?
---
Ah... I understand. Beth should change this to normal to stop those peanut collectors from exploiting this funny game mode.
---
Thanx for the info. I will be trying this next time I log in :)
---
Honestly they need to make it where after a couple minutes of not joining your team in the OP you get kicked and a debuff preventing you from doing group stuff for 30 minutes.
---
Man, maybe it's just me then :'( haha XP you're getting the most out of your time isee!
---
99% of the hounds at WT were glowing and would drop glowing meat.  They still are glowing visually,  just no longer have glowing in their name.
---
It's a weekday, so people are working, and school's in for many. It'll pick up in the evening hours.
---
I have high luck so my crits already recharge quickly. I think Grim Reapers Sprint is the best for vats
---
Not sure what half of what you said meant. But griefers have been around since day 1. Lol I remember when they used to destroy my camp just after beta and I would have no idea how.
---
Even being a PA user I never use a jetpack, marsupial is enough for me.
---
You just have to run from point to point.  No lollygagging in between.
---
Yea I agree. for some reason it was fun to get your damage super high and one shot everything. Now the game seems like a chore of something similar. I used to LOVE this game now I dont even feel like playing it much. Sad times
---
I wouldn't blame them if they did. I know it was a struggle for a few people the last round of meat week. I can only imagine how the feel now. Haha d:
---
I honestly don‚Äôt care if everyone farms xp when I am doing an op run for time. I can get under 8 min solo, so whatever they want to add to that is just fine. Usually even if they are farming they hang around the link points some and speed up the run some.
---
Just random weapons, ammo, and common plans. There‚Äôs a small chance to drop power armor part plans
---
Between 250 and 600 5mm EMC. I don‚Äôt go anywhere where I have to fight anything with less than 250 and having Over 600 is pointless cause I‚Äôll never use that much in one go
---
Even at level 555, level 100 Queens scare me
---
Kill scorched or mole miners and fix what they drop. Breach and Clear by itself should do it.
---
Maybe to celebrate Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrins landing on the moon there could be a limited time event where the residences of vault 76 build a little memorial in the shape of a rocket and then at the very end the rocket goes off in the space
---
same
---
That went right over my head. Very true as well buddy!
---
You mean starfield, elder scrolls 6, fallout 5, and doom 2021?üòÅ
---
It‚Äôs never happened to me either. The only way I
---
can see it happening is if you‚Äôre facing the uplink but it doesn‚Äôt actually say ‚Äúrepair‚Äù with the circle press timer... and you hold down the button anyway.
---
I knew there was a reason I was keeping 70 lbs of vocal sacks...and they said I was crazy.
---
Umm, several *years* of burning sets over and over thanks to nerfing and changes, respecs after each of their 'updates'. Whole class/race changes after passives got 'reworked' last year. 
---
You clearly never had to post a DPS parse to run endgame vet trials content did you? I bet your some unicorn riding douche collecting flowers in the wilderness. The kind in zone asking for help with world bosses.
---
ESO is trash. And for once I can say I'm a *played since launch* kid. I can tell you more people have left ESO in the last 12-18 months than you know. My old crew is almost totally gone. 
---
Thank God ZOS is out of the frame. Clearly you know fuck all.
---
Do you know if this ones drop T-60 plans/mods?
---
Events that give a legendary for completion, so things like Encrypted, Earle, the Queen.
---
You like them just fine. Now finish your redstag stew.
---
all the links here and stuffs
---
Guys. It was an acquisition. That doesn‚Äôt mean any changes are happening to products in the portfolio.
---
Me!!!! I couldn't bring myself to buy the bundle just for the flamingo. I was so hyped we get a free version! I love it, it's so cute
---
You'll see a likely uptick as the week progresses. There's just so much to do right now in game it's become a bit exhausting lol. But if you can get at least a few people on the meat event it should do fine.
---
My man a subscription like FO1st is in every single MMO RPG, ESO, SWTOR, etc. they don‚Äôt have to give you anything.
---
Half those cows drown on me when i build there and floating dead Brahmin are so sad!
---
So a bigger corporation buys another corporation.   You go Microsoft fanboy and we are the one under the corporate boot?
---
Burrows is by far the hardest to do elder solo. The link points and boss spawn are more spread out.
---
You're doing God's work.
---
The relationship between Bethesda and the current zenimax is a little different than other studios as it was founded by the same people that founded Bethesda. And honestly constant nerfs and rebalance are the norm for mmos that it was missing made it sting more when it did happen but.... what can you do. And anyone who‚Äôs been playing Bethesda games a while knows if there‚Äôs one thing they are constant about it‚Äôs bugs.
---
I‚Äôm sure I can do that. I‚Äôve familiarized myself with the pathing on all 3 locations now. 
---
‚ÄúLollygagging‚Äù lol. I like using that one and also ‚Äúgrab-assing‚Äù. As in ‚Äúhurry up and stop your grab-assing!‚Äù
---
They do. They can edit the loot pools from them just like when they removed scrip from them and added the gorrilla plans to them
---
You are the most negative person I‚Äôve ever met on this subreddit.. find your calm man you‚Äôre stressing your body out with all this anger. Also no, ive also played since launch, I think I‚Äôd know ‚Äúfuck all‚Äù.
---
I've gotten elder everyday and only have cage lights and  one type of signs, but I thankfully got war glaive today. I've got nothing like 3 times.
---
My level 20 character solo‚Äôd daily ops yesterday without any legendary gear. It‚Äôs not that bad..
---
Jump onto a building and shoot them from safety. Run into Meg‚Äôs interior to get away. 
---
There are options. What level are you?
---
You just need a build dude, check out builds online
---
Yea I enjoyed that too, I'd pick up a random weapon from a scorched n use that in the area. :) One wasteland is better overall though especially the fact you don't get low level legendary drops now ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
How am I a Microsoft fanboy for asking for more value as a consumer from their purchase. I'm saying because they have now bought Zenimax, consumers should get more benefits from it. I own all platforms and ask for more value any opportunity I get.
---
About 30-40k each of 5mm and .50. It's excessive but with bandolier rank 2 the weight is insignificant
---
I just ran through Huntersville and green ash-piled everything. *You're welcome.*
---
Wtf. I don‚Äôt understand why you are getting out of power armor.
---
All of this could be avoided easily if we had a proper text chat on all platforms, so you could directly ask people what's up.
---
Definitely works great , you can even have a friend harvest some for you from him and as long as you scrap them it counts
---
Best way to get rewards is when you‚Äôre not playing (at work, school, or sleeping). Get on the drums or the meat spits and pull up camera mode. Now rubber band your controller and plug it in. You‚Äôll get a lot of legendaries, plans, and outfits for doing nothing, yet still contribute to the events
---
According to the post below that tested all three it's more like 1.7x.  It probably used to be 3x.  It does look like AA is 95% of Junkies.   I'll have to pull out some of my AA weapons and check it out.  It would be nice to have less thirst, etc.
---

---
Personally, I would rather be Junkies or AA than dying in critical moments.  Can't count how many times my Bloodied friends end up being downed or kill during Earl while I sit there and pound away on him, spamming stims every so often.
---
Oh I figured it out, you play Fallout 76 on PS4 and don't want GamePass members to get more value.
---
Radiation Rumble
---
That‚Äôs fine and all but I still can‚Äôt buy the subscription in the first place
---
Yeah but on a pa character you‚Äôd miss out on emergency protocols if you don‚Äôt have a jet pack arm and they‚Äôre not as maneuverable as the ss one since pa is clunky as it is. Without pa there‚Äôs no downside to having the jet pack and it def changes how you move about the world.
---
You don‚Äôt have to kill everything.  If you are shooting it with shells that‚Äôs a str build, and .38 is a perception build.  This patch is forcing people to focus on their spec early on.  Pick one and go with it.  If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll give you some shells or .38, but pick one path.
---
Looks like I missed ya while making dinner; see ya offline.
---
me as well. just kind of tired of everything at this point üòÅ
---
Thank you all for your answers
---
I play on XBox and I think your request is unreasonable.
---
Of course they don't. I can sure as hell ask for more value for my money though.
---
Sitting unfinished in the game files
---
Yeah I hear you, to be honest I'm not even bothering with it this time. 
---
I really loved the Halloween event last year and I really like Faschnact, but this has never been my favorite anyway. I'd rather spend my time running through daily ops.
---
I'll be careful. 
---
YOU'LL BE DEAD!
---
Than they're doing it wrong, because I essentially don't die as bloodied.
---
I'm just simply asking for more value, and everyone is losing their minds. Not that I even expect them too, just throwing it out there.
---
Totally went through my mind!
---
Cheaper jump to other locations, just like 76 and now crater and foundation. 
---
When I get "buried with honor", guess where I FT first?
---
Update to comments. 
---
No repair options, or items moving.

Example. Turret placed on building, been there for a month, wires are still connected but no turret. Even the wire connection still floating in the air where the turret was. Logged in a few hours ago and now all but one of my locks are gone.
---
Yes I noticed the same thing as far as accuracy and detection.
---
Sorry got hella busy yesterday, but i been trying t find all the mods for the hunting rifle, short gatling gun, and the two shot tactical handmade
---
levitating Yao Guais sound interesting, now where do i hide üòµ
---
Lol dude you are so delusional, I have 4k hours on this game. I know it in and out better then anyone. First of all, there are no worthless specials, only worthless cards. Only a total noob would say that. I can 100% guarantee that youre completely full of shit, just like your build. The video is a pvp compilation I made. Browse my channel, sort my reddit profile by top of all time. If you're on xbox come get some. But to clarify, I will not waste my knowledge of this game on some chump who thinks charisma and ENDURANCE are worthless specials. Now, kick rocks ravioli lips you dont get well thought out and knowledgeable responses you get the snicklefritz. Foodie
---
I dont think i do? Whats en eta??
---
Pls tell me it is not only meet
---
You can't really trust damage numbers, but yeah, regardless bloodied is still best.  They also may have been controlling for mutations and stuff.  
---
EDIT: yup, they ignored nerd rage and adrenal reaction, so there you go.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt get that. 
---
Just because the sign says ‚ÄòUnder New Management‚Äô doesn‚Äôt automatically mean the prices are going to change.
---
This post boils down to ‚ÄòI want more than I originally paid for‚Äô.
---
I believe t-60 is the Cranberry Bog maps

Right!!!
---
How come you get multiple of these but I'm stuck getting 4 burrows sign plans out of all 8 I've done so far.
---
If your goal is just to farm XP and not shoot for a timely completion, send your team mates a message saying so before you start the op. I would have been down for that; I was just confused for a second. You didn't have to remove me from the team and boot me from the op.
---
Edit: not referencing the thread creator there; just talking about an unrelated experience from yesterday.
---
The green house glass ceiling pieces are gonna be amazing ! I‚Äôm totally pumped about getting them after this grind
---
That's fine. You don't want any more value for your money?
---
I too am awaiting this. I thought it was datamined as a skin for the AR. So I started trading and buying various good roll ARs. That I as at least a couple months ago. 
---
I guess I gambled that the data mined skin wouldn‚Äôt end up as cut content.
---
I got it on ps4 and have gamepass and own a pc.  Nice flex I see you working.
---
It would seem he's doing a pretty poor job in this dystopian future.
---
When will the 10mm pistol skin return. :(
---
I AM THE MOLERATS
---
VATS has been buggy since the beginning. Often a 95% hit chance when you first target something means you will miss. Back out and try again and you will usually register your hits. Gauss weapons are way worse for this but all rifles do it some.
---
Actually, I think it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs two different ones. One you buy and one that‚Äôs free.
---
Yeah, killing them is no problem. They just always concentrate on me and stagger hit me and make me a target for the other mobs.
---
Two or three are not a problem, but they come in hordes.
---
This.
---
My friend I'll take the bugs of Fallout 76 compared to the arbitrary and spasmodic 'balancing' attempts of ZOS.
---
I'm glad this isn't a true MMO and can't get to that level where you'll need to post a vid of a dummy being assaulted to join a Daily Op. People should be grateful rather than wish this is ESO, as at true endgame it was not an inclusive game at all for non meta types.
---
You are right. What's wrong with that? Isn't that the entire point of the service. To provide more and more value over time?
---
What do you think pays for all this fine infrastructure?
---
*another part of the monorail collapses*
---
I think im level 72 or 73. A build i used before the update was a stealth ranged thing. I had all three rifleman perk cards maxed out and was working on the stealth portion of it. I really didnt focus on a build until after level 50 or so. I have a legendary assult rifle that does double damage if the target has full health and i think its critical hits do double damage too. So that's what I've been banking on for the most part but i keep burning through my 45 ammo. I've noticed that my stealth have been really bad since the update.
---
Makes that shiny new ss under armor a bust for sure.
---
I would love to have the R91 back as it looks far better than the current AR. Hell I wouldn't mind a service rifle either.
---
May rngesus bless you in all your activities.
---
Sure. So you just like paying for a service that is stagnant and never provides more value?
---
That‚Äôs not solo
---
i use like 20 different light sources and still don't need more than a 100 &gt;.&gt;
---
I will get on again was watching a show
---
The plans only appear in rare rewards.
---
There are like 3 skins Atleast that I have for the 10mm?
---
I've been kicking the idea around of starting a new character and trying a new type of build but not really sure what to do with it. I've been wanting to get into PA and heavy weapons more but it would take a lot of levels to make that change on my primary character.
---
Just did one for the first time. That was some party. Fog crawlers, scorpions and of course a behemoth.
---
Can I just join your private world?
---
Hard to get much lower than that solo. Basically it‚Äôs how fast you can run between locations, which depends a lot on the map, how lucky you get with spawn locations of the final squad, and how fast you can kill the final squad/boss
---
So far I got:
---
* Plan: Vault 94 Jumpsuit
---
* Plan: Scavenged Solar Panel
---
* 2 Plans: Whistle in the Dark
---
* 2 Brotherhood Special Ops Suits
---
* Plan: Burrows Signs
---
* Plan: Valley Galleria Signs
---
* Recipe: Liquid Courage
---
I did dailies since day one and two times I got nothing. The only thing I appreciated so far was Jumpusit + BSO suit (I collects all outfits) and Liquid Courage so I can finally get rid of those Wendigo collosus sacs. Hopefully I will obtain this symptomatic and war glaive.
---
I have only experienced 1 and about 3 rainstorms
---
In open spaces I would believe that because you can use sneak and high ground.  But in confined spaces like daily ops and Colossal Problem I'm willing to bet that you die way more often.
---
if you're struggling that badly against 2 yogi's it's your build not the game. 
---
Use this to make your build [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and post it here if you want people to help you out. mention your weapons and armour as well. It'll help
---
Good stuff!
---
Sell that quick, I got 7500 presents for the helmet
---
Of course!
---
Are you referencing me directly? Or just talking in general? Because I‚Äôve never booted anyone. I‚Äôll leave the team instead. I also don‚Äôt do ops for xp. I do them for elder completion. I‚Äôm also on PC so I can‚Äôt send messages (unless I use a chat mod, which I don‚Äôt)
---
I don‚Äôt know about mods but there‚Äôs a chance to get the power armor pieces that are pretty rare
---
I don‚Äôt want the Tent or Scrapbox to be exclusive to just one part of our community. That‚Äôs divisive. 
---
The tent (sans Scrapbox) should be a quest reward, like I originally recommended when I proposed it. The Scrapbox should be a standard in game feature. And FO1st should have the enhanced tent with both.  
---
I don‚Äôt support anything that divides the community based on console choice.
---
     Watch this video to might help you out. https://youtu.be/eO5BqNaucbw
---
You also get a bunch from the key card drones as well
---
Chill out.
---
I don't know where you are coming from, but your whole post history is that of an entitled Karen.
---
Thankfully this community has been spared your ilk.
---
If you want f1st services, pay for it. Simple as that. There is no legit reason for you demand free beer when other have to pay for it.
---
On my way :D
---
No worries. It was a general comment about some of these posts.
---
Should I avoid gunfu and adrenaline and nerdrage too?
---
deploy another one.  switch from first to third and trym  then back.  open pip boy.  look at perk cards.  one of them usually works.  always happens to me in silo from jetpack "Shorcut" cuz i am overencombered in my  jetpak ultracite pa.
---
Yeah! I love using stealth and patience to clear out an area. Having better AI and not just swarms of bullet sponges running at you would be more satisfying I think.
---
Not sure if it's a difference in play styles or perk cards or gear, but my Berserker Build seems to be thriving in the new environment.
---
The purpose of Game Pass is to allow you access to the base game.  Not to get extra features that require separate cost.
---
And it‚Äôs divisive, as I said in my other post. I don‚Äôt support anything that divides our community based on platform choice. That‚Äôs shortsighted and selfish, with a splash of vindictive.
---
Now this I can get behind. I'm just talking about he current state of Fallout 1st and how I think it would give tremendous value to be included in Game Pass. I do think the scrap box and the tent should be basic features, not paid privileges.
---
No one likes lvl 100 mole rats.
---
 No no no, just adding another general guideline and a bit of a personal anecdote from yesterday. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Im jus waitin for dem astroturf floors to be back
---
I had this exact build and the ammo was the entire reason I‚Äôm now an explosive shotgun build, I do a lot more damage and I like the build in general a lot better, its really fun and after the update I only lost 10 damage total sense I didn‚Äôt stack a bloodied or junkies on top of anything, I did use mutants tho
---
I usually mod items because I have (almost, I‚Äôm looking at you robot legs and Radium rifle) all the mods for every weapon and armor I usually Atleast throw the best dr/er combo on armor and mod it to be ultralight so It doesn‚Äôt eat up as much stash weight. Didn‚Äôt realize it was bothering people so much
---
Edit: (I just do this because I know not everyone has/has friends that can mod out everything for them. I‚Äôm kind of a nerd about learning plans and mods)
---
Still one-two shotting everything except the bosses mate, check your build.
---
Time to adapt, friend. I wish you the best of luck.
---
Enemies are bad
---
It seems like they added more ants also.
---
At least Charred ghouls are easier to deal with nowüò§
---
i didnt know you could turn in prime meat eitherüòÇ where?
---
I started a new character and it's a pain in the ass for me with legendary weapons and armor and being able to supply him with 2 other characters(level 210 and 300). I can just imagine doing a first play through now.
---
Hahaha. You know what - fair enough.
---
Yah it was the sheepsquatch primal cuts in the ash heap with the crickets, radscorpions, and molerats.  I completed it with over a minute to go I think.  My weapons all seem shot after doing a few primal cuts now.  I‚Äôm constantly repairing my TS and E shotguns.  Ran out of adhesive repairing everything lol.  My shotguns used to be effective against the sheepsquatch but not so much anymore. I used to be able to complete primal cuts pretty easily.  I think I‚Äôm going to fully invest in a shotgun build soon instead of wielding a rifle and shotgun.
---
Not even worth the effort to kill.
---
The value is that tent, the scrap box, and the private world.  It would be nice if they did something but I dont get hyped over a corporate transaction that won't be finalized till Q2 or Q3 of 2021.  And then they are gonna focus on es6 and the new IP's.  Im sure they will send some bean counter in to run a cost analysis on austin and see if they can stream line it or boost staff and mix.    But I wouldn't expect actual changes till very late 2021 or Q1 of 2022.  And I would be 3 years into a game and I doubt there would be much that peaked my intrest.
---
It wouldn't give anyone anything different based on platform though. It would just give more value to be a Game Pass subscriber, rather than just a Fallout 1st subscriber.
---
I feel like if lvl 50 enemies stress you out, you need to pick a weapon and use perks for it.
---
Well, I just fought a guy with tesla on PC; something that hasn't happened for months, rare sight indeed. Weird. But fresh!
---
The strength bonus is still pretty nice.
---
same &gt;.&gt;
---
Very true
---
If the scorched or the ghouls don't get you, the rads will.
---
If you‚Äôre high level with a barely decent build, you can still waltz through the Forest.
---
doubtful :/
---
Thats what im thinking too, I never really thought of working towards a build until around level 50. Not until then did i start interacting with the community more and found this subreddit. The "build" i was using work wonders for me from levels 50 to around 65. I currently use the stealth armor but have been wanting to change it up.
---
I got the Valley Galleria signs yesterday, but the Daily Ops didn't reset to a new one today, it still had the same as yesterday with it being completed.
---
I think it would be better of they implemented that only the leader is able to start the ops.
---
Usually 50k 5.56 and 25k .45. But I have one character will over 100k 5.56 and another 50k in their stash.
---
I‚Äôve seen the spawn in there too
---
I did the burning mine solo in 9 minutes. I'd never done it before and got screwed up trying to find the signal repeaters so I easily could have done it in 8 minutes if I knew what I was doing.
---
COSIGN!
---
Entitled Karen lol. I pay for these services and will continue to as long as I enjoy the game. It would just be nice. You are the one who needs to chill. This is a platform for shit posting and spouting random ideas. Its a simple suggestion.
---
You can blow the whistle on the Harpers Ferry train.
---
The grill that‚Äôs in the middle, in between the cooking spits and the drums...has a yao guai cooking over it
---
If you are ps4 i can give you 5k 10mm.
---
If nw isn‚Äôt your thing you can always load in at the corner of the map with a friend (not on the same team) and box eachother to get it out of the way. I love nw but I understand that some people really may struggle with the kill a player challenge
---
Lol now who's triggered again? 
---
And i know you didn't just call someone out for pvp and then say you're a console player. Lmao
---
A video of your pvp footage, wow that's conceited. Especially since pvp in this game is a joke. Make you look even worse. 
---
You have no knowledge of this game besides what you look up on YouTube. 4000 hours my ass, there's the real bs. No one gives a shit about your reddit profile either. 
---
Lastly, you must not be able to even read. I never said that End and Cha were worthless, just that they were the worst overall S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats to invest into. Which is undeniably true in terms of worthwhile perks for actual good endgame builds. Pvp is in no way endgame at all for FO76. Git gud at a real pvp based game and then someone might actually give a shit when you bring pvp up.
---
You said to give FO1st or the ScrapBox to GamePass members. 
---
GamePass is not available on PS. 
---
Therefore, it does give something to someone based on their platform. 
---
There is no other way to view your statement. This is simple and basic logic. 
---
Claiming otherwise is simply ignoring basic facts and logic.
---
I fully subscribe to taking the Legendary SPECIAL, as I believe there's tons of utility in it. Whilst many of the new perks are pretty cool, I've been able to add considerable damage and damage resistance thanks to these.
---
What about rad rats?
---
All the damn time a legendary scorchbeast comes and destroys my whole damn camp and i cant hit it because its hiding behind trees
---
Then i finally do kill it and it gets stuck in trees i cant reach up to
---
Scorched = Bad
---
New weapons confirmed in the new roadmap;)
---
Fair enough.
---
I don't think I've died at all in daily ops
---
True, true. Its less about trouble getting them, and more just knocking it out quickly so you don't have to worry about it later. Plus, the sooner you do it, the less chance you have of it bugging out later and auto-completing...at least that's how I'm viewing it.
---
*laughs in QE magic double barrel shotgun at level 140* honestly it‚Äôs OP as shit considering I can kill the final ops boss in 3 seconds as long as I have AP
---
The stew gives more xp%
---
they aren't any harder then level 50 molrats
---
Yeah, it's been like that for awhile now
---
I milk those brahmin so that i can Super Duper spam bake Faschnact donuts with their absurd ingredients. Everyone seems to like and/or want them so it's good business.
---
yes that would work
---
This is the direction I‚Äôm heading as well after being a rifleman.  Just doesn‚Äôt do much damage anymore, shotgun seems better.  I have a collection of shotguns going now, a tse, mu e, ts, and an instigating.  Acquired all the perk cards last night now just have to move my points back over to strength so I can apply them!
---
Mine had Scorched everywhere....
---
I think it previously increased the range.
---
Because we all know how great the auto-grenade launcher is for sniping.
---
Agreed on that! That whole area was great to farm steel and lead for ammo and just one shotting everything with a crappy combat knife or whatever melee weapon you had handy. But that was yesterday, and yesterday‚Äôs gone.
---
GamePass should **not** grant any paid benefits for free since this would be divisive within the community. 
---
I am not budging on this position. Either everyone gets the same in-game benefits for the same cost or not.
---
You‚Äôre welcome to have a different opinion. But your position is clearly biased and selfish.
---
Just because Fallout 1st would be included in Game Pass, doesn't mean it would cease to exist on other platforms. Just like how EA Play will soon be included with Game Pass, but you can still get it on other platforms. You need better reading comprehension and knowledge about Game Pass.
---
&gt;we should be ready to run the daily op when we join or create the team.
---
While I agree with this, the contention is that some people are also expecting you to STAY ready, just sitting on your hands, as you wait for more people to join. To me, that seems silly.
---
I think if you join and there are now 3 or 4 people, feel free to head right in. But expect to wait a minute or two in that little lobby area for other people to wrap up what they're doing and join in. If they havn't shown up after 2 minutes, check the map to see if its an event they are maybe trying to wrap up, and then make a call about start your own team and wait again, wait longer in the lobby, or just begin with whoever is in the op already.
---
&gt;once we are done with the op and do not plan on running it again, leave the team
---
Or just change it to casual, if you're the leader.
---
If I get burrow signs as a reward again, I swear I'm done.
---
Yeah, get any armor with ‚Äú40% less damage while blocking‚Äù or something like that and all shotguns will be magic while you wear it, I have a QE/1A double barrel that does 200-300 damage per pellet in vats, headshot criticals from point blank usually do 400-700 a pellet, I can show you my build if you want, just DM me, and on top of that, the lowest I have 1 perk is 6
---
oh, i knew about that, but i always just turned them in to help the event thou. All this time...
---
26 tickets and you didn't get the legendary shotgun!?
---
It's basically a pump-action with more capacity but no moddability, so you didn't really miss out on that.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it reset 24hrs after your first run that day. (Like the shops and scrip machine)
---
Someone else's CAMP.
---
I'm not farming .50cal in daily ops but from what I've noticed, most ballistic ammo usually only drops around 6-12 rounds a kill. It's not all too efficient but one way to farm it is in a group like I had mentioned. Since everyone in the daily ops session will be an a team, as long as you are nearby the enemy when they die, you'll get drops even if you didn't deal any damage. 
---
Another simple way would be rush through with a weapon to 1-shot most enemies and then right before the boss dies, swap to a weapon that uses .50cal rounds. The moment the boss dies, you'll usually get 200+ rounds of the ammo type of whatever weapon you're currently holding. I've gotten a little over 400 rounds before but it can vary a bit. I'm not sure how many 40mm grenades, cannon balls, or any of the "heavier" ammo types you get but from my experience, using mini-nukes, missiles, or core-type weapons will cause a random ammo-type to drop.
---
Gun Fu is useful for its auto-switching of VATS targets (if you're lazy like me). That one is personal preference.
---
Nerd Rage gives you extra DR and AP refresh, so leave that one on.
---
Adrenaline... well, I noticed it a LOT before the patch. When I was at max adrenaline I could one-shot most mobs (as a *commando*, not rifleman).  
---
But now, adrenaline is barely noticeable. I can't tell the difference when I have it on or off. I've left it on for now (since I have tons of AGL), but it's up to you.
---
The meat you turn in to help The event is in a shopping cart next to the cooler for the plants. That‚Äôs different than where you turn in prime cuts
---
Or better yet, your own
---
Hmm...sounds like some bug is giving them the Resilient Mutation from the Daily OPS. T
---
I am a Game Pass subscriber so of course I am going to be bias, in that, I want it to be as valuable as possible. Are you a child?
---
Its the curse of the post-war baller...stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks comes with a price, so to speak.
---
Canned Meat Stew gives a base 5% (10% with Carnivore / 12.5% with Carnivore and Strange in Numbers). 
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew is 10% base. 
---
Herbivore tends to be better for folks that mainly use guns while Carnivore is better for melee, because of the damage buffs from a number of meat dishes.
---
They ONLY ignored nerd rage and Adrenal reaction for Junkies and AA.  So, yeah, the numbers are lower for Junkies and AA than the could be vs Bloodied.  
---
In other words, if you went with a 40% health Junkies build you could take advantage of Adrenal Reaction. and bring the numbers closer.  One of our group has this build on one of his characters and it works quite well.  His main character was full Bloodied but he had some nice Junkie drops that he wanted to play with.
---
Lmfao, down voted because ? The Fucking argents on here just makes me laugh. Fucking sociopaths. ü§£
---
Yeah im not wrong, durability is calculated by enemies hit or smth instead of projectiles fired... read this somewhere so might need a fact check
---
It's a measure to prevent vats from being even more op than it already is.
---
Yeah I liked that my fireplace was sunk in the wall, but all my wall decorations were just gone
---
i found out it's just a chance to drop :/ sorry for the mis-information :/
---
beer served in a growler
---
Dang, a that work. Haha. I been thinking about changing to a shotgun build actually. Well be safe! And see you around Appalachia probably XP
---
Yes, fucking yes to this feeling. And why do packs of Molerats now haunt my dreams?
---
You bet your caps he does!
---
It looks like a villain who'd be called "chopper" and fights with propeller-shaped swords.
---
If you're not going 100% health, just use bloodied.
---
Slightly more damage. Better is a matter of preference as the damage advantage is minor.
---
That‚Äôs very kind! I will try to find you - what‚Äôs your game name?
---
Seriously!
---
On my heavy 15k+ each of UC .50, UC .308, UC 2mm EC and UC 5mm. 
---
On my commando 40k+ each of .45 and 5.56.
---
It popped up in the previous meat week, but with dmg recalc I suppose it would be more... Fun
---
nope

plan is though

Lol did I read this? Nope, peace out girl scout. And if i may.... ahem, t r i g g e r e d

turn on pacifist.  pvp is a joke in this game.
---
I get this a great deal of time during an event. I will be on a team during the event and my game crashes. Upon trying to rejoin game, it automatically wants you to rejoin the team you were on. Then you hit that exact void, black screen, environmental/ambient music playing, and that vault symbol. You are stuck unless you reset, or wait for the event to be over. Very frustrating.
---
Oh I see, thanks a lot
---
Last night a new player joined and I dumped a ton of ammo and plans. Helped build his camp too. Ran him through some places to level up a bit. It was fun. I wish there was some kind of program that encourages helping out new players. The latest update kinda made it harder for new player's to stay interested.
---
On PS4, if you don't let the progress meter fully fill up even though it shows it at 100% it will reset and you have to repeat the process wasting precious time...so you have to hold it a split second longer for it to register sometimes ejecting you from your PA. Doesn't matter if it has not ever happened to you...fact of the matter is mapping a button that does this with PA is problematic.
---
You definitely read it, every single word. And once again you failed to come up with any good response.
---
OMG the reason that we don't want to play on a team, is because of annoying people like you who try to tell everyone what to do!! Not everyone who prefers to play solo is struggling with the game... Or the update. I agree that for some getting on a team will help them. But going on and on, about why everyone should play the way YOU think they should play is ridiculous.
---
I won't be able to play as much on this meat week than last time because of work, does anyone know how I can stay in the game while afk so I don't get kicked for inactivity? I'll obviously play the drums :)
---
Sucks that you can no longer play the way you want and forced to "adopt a build".  The above feedback is copy/paste, but true.
---
Do some events.im drowning in water bottles usually just drop 50 at a time
---
I‚Äôm well versed in how GamePass works. I have it myself as well. 
---
I never said it would ‚Äòcease to exist‚Äô on other platforms. 
---
It would be a benefit that costs X amount for PS users but less than that for GamePass members. 
---
Or are you suggesting that GamePass have an increase in price?
---
Post says why. If you are repairing or interacting and something bumps you or stands in your way briefly...holding X (ps4) or A (XBox) you eject yourself from PA
---
YOU‚ÄôLL BE DEAD!!
---
Radtoads are the new Mirelurk Kings.
---
Well... You have, in a way, a perk enhancement.
---
See, if you choose an extra point in endurance, all your outfits are now giving you +1 endurance. 
---
What I mean is, there are several ways in which to get your stats a bit higher.
---
My turrets have disappeared and I can‚Äôt rebuild them, it happened before, so I rebuilt my entire camp somewhere else, they stuck around for a bit, but they‚Äôve disappeared one by one.. Anyone else have this happen?
---
I have a bloody .50cal, a furious .50cal and an anti armour gatling gun.
---
The furious outdamages the bloody till I drop to 50% health so I use my furious till I drop to 50% then switch to my bloodied.
---
The gatling gun is for farming as I have 40k ammo for it  any build can use a gatling gun too as stabilised is 45% armour reduction just throw on a set of power armour and equip stabilised you don't even need the damage cards for heavy guns as it hits so hard already
---
Prime a gatling gun, craft 1 magazine of ultracite ammo and run a few daily ops, you'll be swimming in ammo for it as it takes at most 5 shots to kill enemies excluding the boss and you get upto 90 per body when you loot them and upto 600 as the op reward plus upto 400 from the boss

Blocker with reactive plating on power armour means 75% reduction in melee damage taken no matter my health
---
I had a pack of high level Blood Eagles spawn at Foundation. Pulled out my Final Word and gunned them all down in seconds. Left nothing but a pile of corpses. üòà
---
Watch out for giant flying bats, they have an attitude.
---
Thanks for admitting your bias. That was my entire point here. 
---
You want a feature for free that other people cannot get for free because they are on another platform. 
---
You believe you are entitled to something solely based on your access to GamePass. 
---
Children believe they are entitled. Adults know that it‚Äôs critical for there to be equality.
---
I agree here, because I use the forest, ash heap and toxic valley spots for material gathering, and sometimes you just want to one shot everything in your path as you frantically stuff typewriters into your backpack. 
---
I think everything east should be the one wasteland zone, everything west has a lower cap. sometimes you don't want to dump extra ammo. 
---
I suppose the wasteland is a cruel mistress and it is what it is...
---
Nice. I had the same issue and got today solar panels, burrows signs and vault stash recipie.
---
Really? That's the first thing I'm doing next time I log on.
---
Yea but the xp is sexy however if one more brood mother tries to crawl up my ass
---
Camp making is so frustrating. Skip.
---
You delivered a joke and failed immensely...
---
You have to buy it from the white spring bunker. In the medical wing
---
Left mouse click to attack
---
Do you still need the plans? I collect them from the event so that I can give them away to people down on their luck. Let me know please. :)
---
It was said that you would destroy the molerats, not join them!
---
You paid for GamePass. But now that you‚Äôve paid, you want more features added. 
---
That‚Äôs like paying for a steak dinner and then insisting that a glass of wine should be added ‚Äòjust because‚Äô. 
---
Are you willing to ***PAY MORE*** for your GamePass to get this added benefit?
---
Ok, I see what you are saying. You think its wrong to give the value to Game Pass, but PS players would have to pay the full subscription. That's an ethics problem. Businesses need to function in a competitive way, so I don't have a problem with it, as long as it provides value. The same reason I buy a PS for blockbuster exclusives. All platforms need incentives. I see nothing wrong with it.
---
Yeah, I kick myself sometimes because I tried to build around a gun I got early in the game instead of what I wanted to play. Took forever to re-do all my abilities and I'm still working in getting the last few perks I need to finish off my build (literally just need 5 more levels and I'm finally done).
---
I read somewhere that they're working in a bit of a different respec system, but there's been very little info on it.
---
Keep your eye out for a good 50 Cal, no delay or spin up
---
if you have friends then you can just fast travel to them instead of having to walk and find every location
---
I'll be careful
---
Correct, using my build-specific weapons and ammo. Before I had a Handmade named ‚ÄúFlyswatter‚Äù that I used in those areas, allowing me to drop enemies while using a worthless ammo that I stockpiled. Now Flyswatter is useless.
---
 First time I ran into one of those after OW, got killed fairly quickly. Learned that I cannot simply face-tank everything anymore and that small amounts of strategy are now required. Made me quite happy, to be honest.
---
Your camp will floweth over with Sac Juice!!
---
I really appreciate the custom animation on the recliners, a really cool purchase imo
---
Lmg need some love too. If they have made a skin which made it look like m 60  or browing 1919 it would definitly break the atom store by sher ammount of people buying it.
---
Hmmm, if only  there were some way to move your camp....
---
Hes correct. All my anything explosive or two shot degrades twice as fast. 
---
If you ever did "repair a crossbow 3 times" youll remember you had to make "hit" to degrade weapon. Degradation is calc based on hits made not shots fired.
---
I have no tse' s but 4x would stand to mathmatical reason.
---
As a Carnivore, this even has kept me from starving. I've had to replace action boy with thru hiker, though, because all that meat gets heavy.
---
Harder than Earle or the Queen is bit of a stretch my guy but definitely a creature to be feared.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me on and off
---
No way! What? This has been a great change! Not ONE person that I know or have played with has mentioned wishing for a low level area. 
---
I thought One Wasteland was going to be a nightmare, but it appears as something they've done very well.
---
Let me guess, some sort of explosive weapon? Right?
---
&gt; straw
---
Well, i think it could be possible. But it also could be that Chinese Chippendale railing...
---
They don't test anything they just release everything broken.
---
It's just the rainbow bridge.. Er... Nukashine. Chally loves her some Nukashine
---
**Are you willing to pay more for your GamePass if FO1ST is added?** ***Yes or no?***
---
Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go = 3x glowing snarlygasters
---
Yeah thats gonna be a no for me dog
---
Every reply to my comment is assuming that I am placing the blame solely on the CMs, whereas I am actually blaming the entire heirarchy. They are part of the same machine, and the machine is to blame. The other guy gets that, at least - although admittedly all parties have spiralled out into irrational bickering in the end. I know CMs don't fix bugs, but I also know they are about as useful as a basic chatbot.
---
Not really! Common to find and get
---
This is beating a dead horse at the moment.. they don't listen at all.. they dont test anything.. if we all quit i gurantee they would listen...
---
I've had a molerat attack me on the second floor of a building, is that just me,? I really hate molerats.
---
I used to run that one solo b4 patch 22 and it was a blast.  Zero interest in that now.  Worlds were noticeably empty this weekend.  Played for 4hr on Sunday and not a single nuke launch..  Suspect peeps are no longer playing this game.
---
You only get them every 5 levels, and it might not start till lvl 5 or 10.
---
Only thing worse is radscorpions I hate how they can basically teleport
---
Yes, I agree. I actually do exactly these things  when I create or join a team. And it IS silly for the other teammates to expect other teammates to wait unreasonable amounts of time just for them to finish vendor hopping or whatever.
---
I agree with your input and I implement them already. That‚Äôs a good sign that we are on the same page. That means that possibly, a lot of others are too and my post is irrelevant. Which would be great :)
---
&gt; for elderly
---
Those BoS are indeed getting old.
---
It does three main things.  It lets them have a fairly high drop rate for casual players but still prevent people who play for 20 hours a day from being done with the game in a week.  It promotes selling them to other players for caps.  It also lets them keep prices low to buy things like modules.
---
No, its not the same as a steak dinner. Horrible comparison. Game Pass is advertised as an evolving service. Not a product.  Services are meant to change and evolve and offer more value over time. This is clearly a strategy that is being used to market Game Pass, more games added constantly, EA Play being added, all Zenimax games being added, etc. It's meant to evolve and give more value, it could not be more clear.
---
probably the hardest enemies down there and you can only turn in 3 at a time
---
Had the same thing yesterday too and it drove me nuts as well. Im hoping next time i log in its gone and its just one of those intermittent/random bugs. The last thing I did before i logged off prior was do the Nuclear Winter daily. When I logged in again later is when the bug started. Dont know if that applies to you
---
What is with the fireworks? Haven't heard that one yet.
---
The Lv100 Yao Guai can also drop double scrap.
---
Dun ask Bethesda anymore. Now its.. Microsoft.
---
War glaive and symptomatic are the two I'm going for, I'm not even a melee build but the war glaive is too cool to pass up
---
And where is it written that a service is expected to provide more for the same cost over time?  That right there is an entitlement bias.
---
Don't worry about ammo, go in with 20 rounds and come out with 200
---
Killed enemies go boom boom
---
Sadly, no. Its one of the reasons I stick with Final Word over my Gauss Minigun. Final Word does about the same damage as my current one Two Shot one (need a better roll) without any annoying charge up time. Plus, I can craft like 10k ammo for it without much trouble (the ratio of .50 cal to 2mm EC ammo is about 3x better for the mat cost).
---
The most I carry is about 3500 total. I rather have high dps and damage avoidance.
---
Oh shit I meant 50mm for the minimum lololol my bad !
---
That would be great! I can sign on now if you're on PC.
---
I'm not entitled. Entitled would mean I believe I should have it at no cost. I pay for a service that's entire point is to provide more value over time. I am just suggesting a way, in which they can do that. I will continue to pay for the multiple subscriptions either way, as long as I enjoy the services. It would just be nice, like with EA Play to be included in Game Pass. Which I also pay for.
---
I'm on if you're still willing to give me the goods
---
Probably only that hard because I don't have funky duds in my build tbh. Earl and the Queen can't really do enough damage to kill.
---
Yah I used to run them solo too.  I noticed it was also a little empty this weekend at times but it‚Äôs really picked up now.
---
There is a good spot along the river outside of Morgantown where if you get it just right you can have quite a few large purifiers look for the crossroad before you get into Morgantown headed from the bar.
---
Tenderizer 3 is underrated
---
Honestly any large body of water on the map works, just need to be able to fit multiple industrial water purifiers, best place imo are the ponds near the Pleasant Valley station/Top of the World since thats a really central location in the map
---
This is me and the golf course. My CAMP is right by it but I love to sometime watch as the low level Scorched run into my high level Turrets.
---
Aww it got deleted lolz I LOVE cleaning out unlocked purifiers just for shits n gigs :D
---
Freezing Robots in The Burrows were the bane of my existence on the PTS. The place is a maze and they hit hard. Need to reload when frozen? RIP.
---
Same. The changes really haven't affected me too badly, but I liked being able to just wantonly slaughter creatures when the mood strikes me.
---
That one was a blast to do solo before patch 22.  RIP fun.
---
It worked. Thank you. What shotgun do you use?
---
Vendor hoping sounds... super annoying to wait for. My personal rule of thumb, is that the next place I fast travel is into the Op, unless I need to like, dumb a bunch of junk in my stash/repair a weapon, in which case I may make an exception for my CAMP, then into the OP.
---
I had this issue on PC. I had to look at the scoreboard and make sure all of my rewards were claimed.
---
Depends how much. Obviously.
---
I've got a junkies lmg but it doesnt shred like this.
---
You have done that yourself!
---
Have you seen any of the marketing for Game Pass? Are you telling me Game Pass is meant to be a stagnant service that never changes?
---
Right?! I didn't even realize it happened. I finished an event, went to fast travel and saw that I magically had 26k and almost all the ammo in my vendor was gone.
---
Sad that this is your only joy
---
Come join me gt is kingsites12
---
Unfinished how? Literal unfinished code / mesh, or just missing some working parts?
---
What system you on buddy? Fuck the foolish person and just wait til you meet the good ones bud. Sorry that happened
---
pretty sure you can mine aluminum ore in big bend tunnel, follow the side tunnel in the big open area where you fight the blood eagle captain.
---
After having the scoreboard counting in the middle of the screen all day, I would welcome this bug.
---
Tell me how much of a monthly price increase you think is appropriate for adding FO1st to GamePass.
---
I already had flamingos though. I mean, they didn‚Äôt have lights, but ..
---
Wish I held on to it, scripted it when I was a commando sadly.
---
I see camps that have it and just laugh because it's bulky AF and gives the same power as the fusion generator.
---
Someone glitched through the wall and soloed him before you got down there.
---
Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!
---
My GT is the same as on here. I ended up having to do stuff after work. So it would be a few more hours before I'm on. If you see me on just send me a message that your from reddit. I always have 45 on me
---
 I‚Äôve dude, makes it all feel worth it, tomorrow we will both get the glaive BP. ü§û
---
Repairing doesn‚Äôt bring them back? Or relogging
---
You don't see a problem with the fact that bugs "wouldnt have been found otherwise"? He is being equally rude, and all based on the assumption that I'm blaming one cog in the machine, rather than the machine in itself. And hell, I'd rather *go without* his contributions than bow my head and bite my tongue for someone who thinks they can pull rank just because they tell us what is inside our Christmas presents before we unwrap them..
---
For those who have multiple characters and a reliable way to transfer items amongst them that can help.You can increase the cap limit by 2 to 5 times in a work around.Then the only thing you really have to worry about is scripting the gold bullion legendaries that might pop when spending.Script those on the one toon and transfer the rest.Not the best system but at least it is some kind of workaround.Especially if all your toons are 50 or above.That way if you get something good for one toon on a different one you can get that legendary to the proper one.
---
You can exchange it at the ammo convertor if you have it and leave the points in the convertor for future use, instead of redeeming them for ammo.
---
I have it already. Keep in mine you only have flat roof and slanted roof. No corner roof or any other style. It limits the roof but so far I enjoy the look of the sunlight coming through the windows.
---
He probably runs a water farm.
---
You mean besides a lot of the Wastelanders quests being based around that biome?
---
It should b unlimited scrip n also bullion trade in... sick of asking n justifying. Hope Microsoft changes this and make this game as big as fortnite.
---
Whats your GT? I‚Äôll be on later and can help carry us thru some primal cuts!
---
Speaking of Division 2, if you haven‚Äôt checked already, the new update released today. The skyscraper mode has been fun and seems like the loot rolls are improved.
---
I was in Pacifist mode (before the new patch) and someone came to my base and killed me and attacked my base destroying walls and all for no reason. I had to move to another server and I had a dog in camp that ended up dying but to be fair I don't know if he was killed or what happened. However, I did have people kill me before and it that one person did do damage to my base so not sure what was going on.
---
I crash about once every 6-8 hours (xbox). Disconnect about once every 2-3 hours. I always hard-quit the game on the home screen before starting. Crashes seem more frequent the longer the session.
---
Oh that was me! Can you please return it? My ign im_just_kiddng_itreallywasntme üòÖ
---
Cos whoever define the sizes seems to b looking down at his pants...
---
*Cries in PS4*
---
Newb question, but is there some market reference available for pricing stuff out? I would hate to sell something worth a ton for nothing, and something worth nothing for a ton...
---
No. Such technology is reserved for high end gaming machines like the Commodore 64.
---
I'm stuck using my legendary shot gun that only does big damage in vats. I played solo most of the time that's pretty much over.
---
I agree. I accidentally upgraded my intelligence instead of my luck yesterday and lost 50 coins.

Don't forget how good tenderizer is.

I‚Äôm on PS4. Thanks, I try to be one of the good ones cause I experience this stuff too much x.x
---
Never did I say that.
---
You are stealing my screws with that magic weapon legacy plan of yours. I plan on a nice long drawn out struggle while I harvest screws from endless wendigo.
---
Gt: xchris95 . Im a pretty high level. It's just some sometimes I can get overwhelmed you see XP
---
Yeah Yao Guai and death claws can get to you on raised positions.
---
Everything. Around 10~20K
---
I was about to log out last night but I was like "lemme see if anything good is on the map, first" and saw PP with 8 people. We crushed it; all animals lived. Went to check my notes: Plan: Stimpak Diffuser! Wooooooooo!
---
lmao why do you care how people play?
---
Not everyone plays for exp, you know? Sure, there are much more benefits if you're on a team ( let's not forget about all the extra camps and tents to teleport all over the map you get) but you can't blame those that prefer solo.
---
For example, i was once solo and for one hour i only stayed in my camp, changed some stuff, did some cleaning and scrapped some perks.
---
Considering they added EA Play to Ultimate which is 14.99 a month, for no additional cost. Fallout 1st being over priced as it is. If they included Fallout 1st and ESO Plus and called it Game Pass Ultimate + Bethesda Pass, I'd pay 24.99 a month for it. The value proposition of Game Pass Ultimate is exquisite don't get me wrong. I just find ESO Plus and Fallout 1st way over priced in comparison, for what you get.
---
My crew doesn't get on till later, and I've NEVER found anyone on any ops that doesn't suck! Walking in front, starting to early, or just picking up ammo and not helping out. Their probably the ones that complain they can't finish top rank or they didn't get anything good from lvl 1. I'll now wait for my friends, instead of doing 90% of the work. P.s. fuck every afk person on the drums @ meat week. Ya your helping but your scumbags!
---
Buck up buttercup!
---
The 10mm auto tweeked reciver is affected by gunslinger perks, not guerilla. It's a bug.
---
I want to see something for the dirty LMG and .50 Cal.
---
Let me help you with it. I'll kill it and get the legendary item n pass u his meat to cook. Deal?
---
I'll take your word for it for the population uptick, but will be sitting this one out   Meat week was always an ammo dump and realized I was mostly the only one doing the killing in events, which was alright, community and all.  Now, its not just ammo, but mats for armor and weapon repair.
---
*So if you believe FO1st is overpriced,* **then why aren‚Äôt you asking for FO1st to be reduced in price?**
---

---
Agreed, common reward drop.
---
You can dump 20w out of your stash by scripping Flyswatter and just use your normal gun.  Put on your big boy pants.  Lvl 50 enemies are plenty squishy.
---
With all the god tier weapons. Mischief nite will b over with 1 person looting n the others failed to get anything. Meat week it shall b...
---
Congratulations on the drop though, lol
---
Well, it was fun playing you like a fiddle,  but I have to go now. You be careful out there, not everyone is as nice as me! Q
---
Just remember to put the faster barrel on that thing and piss everyone off as you melt the queen and earl.
---
Dont fret. RIR has post apocalyptic racing!
---
I really really really wish this game could be played offline. There's too many good things in this game but also too many things I'd love to mod/change about it. I'm almost level 50 and I've yet to join a group because I want to do my own quests
---
Oh you went from being the team police, now to being the game police? ATTENTION: IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED, BY ORDER OF DECREE, ISSUED BY LURKIN, THAT ALL THOSE WHO ESCHEW PUBLIC TEAMS AND PLAY SOLO, MUST RETURN TO FALLOUT 4.ü§£
---
Fixer. I got a dozen in my stash
---
no they do not
---
Probably depends on the day and time of day but yeah it‚Äôs been quiet out there.My friend list has been dead since the 3rd day after the update so the game probably lost a decent amount of players to it.
---
Server I'm on has nonstop action
---
Probably coming with Fractured Steel. Would make sense a bunch of US Military people would have it in surplus
---
What console?
---
Lmao, nice one
---
I know. Auto-correct changes Grahm to "Graham."
---
Every time I go to the Colonel Kelly monument there's an insane battle royal involving rad stags, yogis, snallies, honey beasts, and...a couple of plucky radroaches???
---
Gt NOOBKilZA
---
Its what I'm thinking. I almost wanted to drop the game for a while. But I stick around for the armor ace thing :P
---
But explosives are a big part of my build üòî
---
Me too, dude.
---
Prime meat gives a good amount of legendary scripts which is nice, also the exp gainned from it is outstanding i gainn 10 levels today easily
---
Just expect some sort of damage to happen instead of a shitty low yield dirty bomb.    Like when you bomb MIT in 4 or megaton... a crater broken buildings just something ya know.
---
Nope. Thankfully.
---
xbone. If i was on my main it wouldn't have been a problem as they're a badass invincible motherfucka! But this alt is not quite there yet.
---
Say hi to Snowball for me.
---
You got it. You should probably subscribe to Angry Turtle on YouTube, easily the best 76 build test videos. Captainoob for weapon testing, too. And maybe JuiceHead or InnovSurvivalist for news.
---
Because, if I can save as much money as possible. Why wouldn't I? If I could have all 3 of those subscriptions put together for a reduced price, how would that be a bad thing. There is this thing called the big ask. You ask big and settle where both parties benefit. Obviously asking for all 3 for no additional cost is a huge ask. The idea evolves and we get something like what I suggested. Game Pass + Bethesda Pass that comes with Fallout 1st and ESO Plus for 24.99. I think that would be a great deal.
---
I've not been able to use wall display cases since patch 22!
---
Bethesda is still a publisher, Nothing has changed in that regard.
---
All meat. 
---
Meat week. Sweet meat. Week of meat.... something else.  Forever and ever.
---
 The green dude will let you know all about his meat.
---
Its a two shot combat shotgun √∑33% vats.
---
None of the other combat shotgins I have is as good even bloodied with faster fire rate.
---
Ideally I want to get a instigating, +33% vats combat shotgun with a base dmg of 280~
---

Daily ops can be so trying, i always run to an uplink to save time, the other day it took them 1 minute to just repair the uplink and all i heard was shooting for a straight minute, another time there were 3 of us and our "leader" is too busy trying to kill everything so never comes close to the uplink for a boost, than they start the event right after its done, instant leave team. You know pretty quick what kind of teammates you have, failing the meat cook though i failed 2 of those last go round and it is very fkn annoying to fail while 5 people just sit on the drums.
---
This is not accurate
---
I would say ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù but not rare.
---
Honestly that‚Äôs what prompted my post. Was exciting to finally use it and it blew my mind that this bug was still around, figured it had to have been fixed by now. Still decent bonuses on other stats, but the +end would take it next level.
---
They're somehow doing more damage to me than lv 100 Rad Scorpions!
---
I'm Xbox, but thanks anyway
---
Stop telling people over and over how you think they should play the fucking game, it smacks of insecurity.
---
Seriously.
---
You missed my point. 
---
You think FO1st is overpriced. So instead of just saying ‚ÄòHey, you should lower the price on FO1st for everyone‚Äô, you choose a request that doesn‚Äôt benefit the entire community. Only part of the community. 
---
That‚Äôs the selfish part.
---
Also, why should a GamePass member that doesn‚Äôt play Fallout 76 have to see their monthly cost increase just so you pay less?
---
That‚Äôs the other selfish part, now that you‚Äôve said GamePass price should increase of FO1st is added.
---
Great starter rules that make perfect sense. What's the etiquette if you created a new daily ops group that filled quickly and got elder on the first try? Elder is my goal and I'm not going back for seconds. So do I leave my own team I created or do I change it to a casual team for intelligence boost for the rest of my gameplay?
---
It's good to explore when you first start out but seasoned 76rs... nah. I often hop teams to a close location.
---
I would adore some Pebbles themed rewards :) cosmetics, clothes, camp items, things like that. I know there's stuff in the atom shop for him, but I mean beyond that.
---
You just said " where is it written that a service is expected to provide more for the same cost over time? " This is what Game Pass has been doing over it's entire existence.
---
LOL
---
Most casual teams are "alone, together".
---
If i could name teams mine would be "Solo with benefits".
---
Think I saw that somewhere in the build menu, nice one.
---
There is often a settler chopping wood behind my camp. While I was cooking meat I heard loud gun fire and growling  that lasted about a minute. Suddenly the hypnotic plunk of axe splitting wood resumed.
---
I went outside and there were four dead mongrels scattered around a settler too happy to offer me a few bundles of wood.
---
Very true.  My equipment is breaking a few times in a very short 2 hr span
---
Currently at work unfortunately. I will be home in about 8 hours. May I ask what timeline you are in?
---
Ya gotta have Fireproof and Adamantine Skeleton when dealing with Splodey guns.
---
I think I‚Äôve gotten it from ghouls or SBQ before but I could be totally wrong
---
I asked a question. I didn‚Äôt make a statement.
---
I don't care if it's selfish. That doesn't bother me.
---
They are not stacking
---
I think that's what it shows in your pip boy whenever you get a big dose of rads. Maybe it got stuck somehow? Are you taking rad damage still?
---
It does seem scummy but lost income might be the only message they'll receive.
---
Then you should buy a lotto ticket you lucky son of a bitch. That thing is rare af, and you could have traded it to anyone for literally any weapon/legacy.
---
I think it's around a 1 in 100,000 chance of it spawning.
---
Not a joke. You want outfits to add special points? Previous Fallout games did that. This game offers the possibility of wearing armor under the outfit, so, the other bonuses were removed. Plus, you can add more bonuses by wearing, for example, a shielded piece.
---
It would be nice to have a battle rifle I got alot of .308 and I'm not to found of the lmg.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be happy anyway , better then just the wood for sure
---
Not to sound out of place, but they kinda had a year to resolve it, and make it work. But nonetheless I do hope that they attempt something this year. I really enjoyed dressing up as the Dr Satan last year, scaring the living piss out of the newbies. Mind you I will still make the best of it this year.
---
No, queens only give you the blight and ghouls give parasites, blood worms, rad worms, bone worms, etc
---
Nope, I‚Äôm on Xbox btw, they‚Äôre just gone, nothing left but the power line, floating in mid air, attached to nothing...  I‚Äôve got camp budget too, but when I go to replace the turret with a new one, it says build limit exceeded...
---
Interesting. I thought that was a spawned in item (cut content), but you are on ps4. Either there are spawned items on console or it really is in the game now. 
---
Kinda confusing that it‚Äôs named ‚Äútroubleshooter‚Äù, yet doesn‚Äôt carry the legendary effect.
---
Either way, very interesting post :)
---
Hah, okay, I have plenty screws so I didn't think about that one. Hmm. At this point, should I ever need more I'd probably buy them in bulk at the Whitespring. But okay, that's a legit but minor downside in my book. (Didn't downvote you btw.)
---
Hmm then I‚Äôm not sure sorry friend
---
For aluminum my go-to is the mountain of ski poles at top of the world. If you're big on dailies, grab the aluminum containers and industrial oil canisters in Biv's basement on your way through. Beyond that, the surgical trays in medical facilities can be a good source as well. And if you like workshops, Red Rocket Mega Stop has 3 aluminum deposits.

 Inflicted by a diseased wendigo, or exposure to toxic air without wearing a gas mask
---
Wish I could‚Äôve met someone that kind. I think I paid around 14k caps for the Fixer plan. Got tired of Encryptid wasting a lot of ammo and stimpaks and kept coming up empty.
---
On the plus side I make caps so fast that about every two weeks I‚Äôm getting near the limit again and looking for things to spend them on.
---
And there we go. That‚Äôs what I knew all along but just wanted to see you admit. 
---
Have a great night. We‚Äôre done here.
---
I‚Äôve sent you a friend request, ‚ÄúDigital Press‚Äù. Always looking out for other frustrated players to team up with!
---
Those Bears can spawn every time you fast travel there.Happened to me several times last week.
---
It‚Äôs from a current glitch. Don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre fine with it in your inventory but I don‚Äôt think you can get it regularly.
---
Thanks, I'll have to go the wendigo route, as it's looking like toxic air is bugged for me.
---
To buy or to place
---
All this helped. I made 7k today. Thank you all
---
Wendigo

To place

Nobody seems to bring attention to another overlooked positive aspect of being on teams. The constant stream of caps coming in from teammates completing quests. It's not much, only 15-20 at a time but when it happens multiple times per hr, it adds up to a few hundred passive caps every day. Freee money
---
If everything scales with One Wasteland, then why isn't my Moo Moo lv 100?
---
You need to look up the definition of a service in economics, and try to understand why someone would continue to pay for a service if it never increases in quality, or refuses to stagnate.
---
It‚Äôs both a serious response and /s. Some people can‚Äôt handle a sense of humor on the internet and going looking for insult. No worries on the downvote. I got 18k karma. I can handle some downvotes.
---
I'm reading your comments and I'm coming to the conclusion that if I were ever on a team with you, I  would immediately go to my settings and take off pacifist mode. üòÇ
---
lol. You too kiddo.
---
Oh, you missed the part where we are done. 
---
**You admitted you‚Äôre selfish and that it doesn‚Äôt matter to you.**
---
That‚Äôs all I wanted. To force you to admit that you were simply selfish. 
---
Have a great night.
---
It seems like every gets a repeat reward. Someone keeps getting Whistle in the Dark in the sams thread. I always get the War Glaive and you get the Burrows sign.
---
Waiting for the day, I'll take anything enclave.
---
I'm on the east coast of the US, so it's almost 8pm here
---
Yeah I have been thinking about taking a long if not permanent break for a while now.The update almost made me do it.Right now I am just logging in each day for the new season and bullion quests then I am done.
---
Hi. Casual player here who may have been someone else‚Äôs village idiot this week. 
---
A lot of first for me in the last week. 
---
I finally hit Level 50.
---
Finally got a powerful Big Gun. 
---
Finally got to use the Ultracite PA that had been in my stash for a few weeks.
---
Feeling bold, I join an Uplink event. 
---
Me and one other guy. Super Mutants. Sounds easy enough. 
---
Recommend Level 50?  That‚Äôs me!!!
---
I had no idea what it was about. Kill bad guys, right?
---
So I get in there and it‚Äôs obvious I will quickly use up all my fusion cores. The big gun is eating them too quickly. I have to switch to a laser pistol that‚Äôs pretty good for regular super mutants. Not so great here. 
---
And while I‚Äôm trying to kill as many SM‚Äôs as possible, the other guy keeps running to an...
---
Oh you have to do something with a terminal in this event. Right...ok that‚Äôs why he kept running off. 
---
Wish he had a mic...
---
Anyway we finished the event but I felt like dead weight. 
---
I might try again tonight.
---
lmao, imagine not looking it up first &amp; instead asking people first so that you waste both their time &amp; your time
---
101
---
Three times a day, tops. That's the nuke limit per server per day.
---
Far from it. But even if I was, I‚Äôm a ‚Äòkiddo‚Äô that proved his point and used logic to force you to admit you don‚Äôt care about anyone but yourself. 
---
That‚Äôs classically a childish and immature viewpoint. 
---
Again, have a great night.
---
I'd be on the spit and then 2 people would join me so i'd go to the drums as nobody was on them. And the bar clearly goes up a lot. Then it goes down because the 2 people on the spit have joined me on drums. So i go on the spit. For like 3 mins.
---
Ooo this is nice
---
That shit needs to be fixed.  I thati n the middle of my screen in the middle of events,  superior fukin game design.
---
Im still swimming in notes from the last meat week as well as legendary items that i need to scrip, the reward pool is still exactly the same which is not an incentive, esp if you already got everything or are just chasing the tenderizer plan. Plus half the people there are communist AFK'ers
---
The goal is to prevent others from joining an ops team that isn‚Äôt going to run ops.
---
If you leave the team, at least you‚Äôve done your part and hopefully others like you will join suit.
---
If you change it to casual, then anyone else on the team that wants to run the event for various reasons can join a different ops team or create a new one.
---
Either way, both of those options that you mentioned are viable. Also, there are no hard-drawn lines on public teams, so this post merely presents suggestions or guidelines.
---
Did primal cuts in ash heap, also the totem doesn't stop the high level rad scorpions from getting you either..just a heads up any brave soul who tries that primal cut
---
Yes I think there is overlap. I am playing with teams for XP because I want to fully level up my legendary perk cards.  I'm thinking that people who don't care about XP don't care about getting the most from their build, which is why they are getting wrecked.
---
Lol. I cant quit melt anything yet, still changing my build. It's tough to change now with legendary perks.
---
Huh. I think I had that, but I was using a truck bed item as a platform so just stored it and they came back with everything else stored. Try to store any floor or item they are sitting on?
---
I enjoy it a lot. I'm rank 74 but am just not good at fighting.
---
Sounds like the cranberry bog one... did that   earlier. Was alot easier than the ash heap one
---
I think I have maybe 35-40k on me right now? Multiple ammo types though, lots of .45, 5mm, .50 cal, and 5.56
---
No, you‚Äôre just selfish, as you admitted. 
---
;)
---
Some servers are okay and pump out events for a while, but then I feel like there are none for like 30 minutes or more
---
finally someone who made good use of the rail car.
---
Happy Cake Day! 
---
Yeah, got the burrows sign 4 times and the solar panels 3.
---
Floor decor
---
You get a cap when you drink Nuka-Cola.
---
No sir, I had them on bedrock this time...
---
Sneaking up underneath ya what nots
---
They seem to check this(Reddit) more frequently than forums.
---
Lol you‚Äôre a looney
---
I like the way you think, we start begging now for a free fast travel point so that way we can slowly whittle down their resistance to our pleas beforehand
---
Yup me too and there was no glitch.
---
Enjoy bud
---
The Mire has toxic air as well, and I recall getting it from a diseased enemy at Heart of the Swamp once. The only times I've gotten it were in The Mire, at any rate.
---
Yeh she or he seems like a great person lol f that.
---
Hows about a 3 star anti armor anti material rifle with explosive damage and 25% faster fire rate, that says "it just works" after a crit, or a kill in vats.
