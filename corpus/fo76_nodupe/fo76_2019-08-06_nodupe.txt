Yeah I was annoyed as well that screws weren’t obtained through scrapping things like weapons that would inevitably have dozens of screws in them.
---
---
---
Yes, happened here also on PS4. Imagine the outrage if they never showed up!
---
Then we'll just raid your home with a T51-b Knight Squadron
---
If you notice, the BoS doesn’t have the best track record either....,
---
Yeah, basically made a lot of people mad with nothing good to distract them. Not the best business strategy, really. But we're working through the Betheada stages of patch, kinda like the stages of grief. We're passed the initial shocks and complaints, past the people quiting and canceling fo1st, and entering the part where people start pushing back and making light of the complaints, concerns, and people who have issues with anything Bethesda does. Business as usual really. This patch is  kind of a kick in the junk though.
---
Todd Howard: It just works
---
I use a tse for everything, I find more than enough to keep me going
---
If they let use trade weapons when we’re at max script.  There’s no reason we shouldn’t be allowed to take a loss this way also. I’ve wanted to do the same myself a few time.
---
We also need a "convert all of X ammo" option in the ammo converter. The only reason players convert ammo in the first place is because they don't use that ammo type, so why would anyone want to only convert like 10 or 100 of that ammo?
---
So you only want to play the game if you can cheat?  Ok bye!
---
*The Prydwen has entered the chat*
---
Yeah, I carry an assaultron blade for close combat. But it was fun to try to get a shot or two in before I have to switch, in case I can take it down.
---
I dont disagree but you missing the point, I'm providing information. Take it or leave it, but please dont shit on someone's doorstep using euphemisms. Bethesda is ultimately to blame, but people who choose not to PLAY the game and only to RIP it apart... that doesn't deserve support or respect when it affects thousands of other people. Dupers have destroyed a huge aspect of the game for a lot of people. Please try to understand this.
---
Very awesome of people in the comments to be rude and condescending to the community manager. Way to show them this sub is a respectful and friendly community.
---
Very good point. I got the game as a gift. I paid for a year of first, so I've spend a total of $100. I don't know how much I have played, but even if it was only 200 hours, thats 50 cents an hour.
---

---
The last time I went to the movies it was $20 for an hour and 45 minutes. Video games can be pretty high value, but people expect massive things from them.
---
Did you read it?

I think a point needs to be made about bf5 if we are talking about EA. the disaster of the BF series, a series I played the absolute hell out of (3-5k+ hours ever game post bf2).  Rocky launch, controversy at every corner since the trailer dropped, launch features not put in until 2 months before support ends, terrible balance in a pvp game.  Left to drown and die with failure after failure post launch.
---
I can honestly say beth is handling 76 far better than EA handled bf5.  F for old dice, I'm glad those devs got out when they did.  (I do agree that beth needs work, a lot of it.  But to say EA and the failure of BF5 is better than Beth is a bit much)
---
Upper management didn't create the abortion that is the ammo converter, just to use one example of many.  If one thing has been made abundantly clear over the past few months, it's that the devs don't play the game, don't give a shit, or both.
---
Wow, that's a quite bad "quick fix" since it doesn't really fix the problem, but creates one more instead.
---
To be honest i was thinking of leaving 76 anyway before this but now ? This may be the final nail in the coffin for me , Personally I don’t think this game is gonna get better as bethesda can and will ruin the next. Update then the next and over and over What is the point being excited for an update if it ruins the game just a bit more ?
---
True. Cheaters, dupers, fucking morons hold much more responsibility of game problems, then developers. Players, who unbanned, still exploit the game (I read some discords) actively. Example, they wear Dutchess outfit. Or have thousands of modules for crafting. Do you like it? Or you angry. Post your opinion in comments
---
It won't do anything. They will be added no matter what. This event is just a shitty build up.
---
Lol, so true. I had to mash the B button to be released from its inescapable grip.
---
Um... no
---
Is there another way to have double sided walls?  If not, then there's the problem.
---
Don't quote lines from another faction, son.
---
And unlike the Ammo converter, we actually provide useful items.
---
[deleted]
---
Well, this explains a lot.
---
They said they put them in but they are nowhere to be found.
---
Bloodied?
---
I saw someone post that if you fix the fuse box first then it will take the blood samples. I haven't tried it myself.
---
Yes...
---
Platform?
---
Cancelled. Also, just gonna paste my comment here from a similar thread:

If you are on Xbox or pc, try the game pass. So many great games that will only take you between a day to a week to complete. It’s so great getting a nice fulfilling game experience without feeling like you have a second job. I’ve been playing these live service type games for so long now, I had almost forgotten what that’s like.
---
Same here. I think I prefer the old version too this doesn’t feel like much of an improvement.
---
Totally agreed. Substituting one grind with yet another might work for some, but the benefit of it is doubtful considering how scarce adhesive and aluminium are.
---
BROTHERHOOD OF BITCH
---
Hope it helps
---
xbox one
---
Its plainly and widely known dupers are the driving force of the majority of patches.......... why do I have to say this for you to understand? Youtubers posting things like this on youtube is literally giving bethesda a To-Do list of things to break or "fix" for the fallout community. Watch the video, read the article. It's just information I'm providing the community.
---
That's just reddit baby
---
Just hold b
---
Sadly you cannot sell them for caps either
---
Back in the beta it was a camp object. It was removed during the first patch and left as workshop only. A few players who placed it during the beta at their camp still have it. But due to trap camps it was removed, or so the legend goes.
---
Why? Works great for me
---
I guess to each their own but I can understand anyones frustration with either of these games and I for one grew up with warcraft and WOW literally gave me an education on online gaming and community which I personally wouldnt trade for anything.
---
The bos look more like an invading army than an ally now. It’s not like we need them.
---
There really isn't a single thing on the reward list worth giving up that amount of scrap for. Is there even a place to check the global progress?
---
 It’s for real on the current schedule
---
Dude loves his walls.
---
First of all, that was an analogy, not a euphemism.
---
Second, I unequivocally give credit to all those people on Youtube, ESPECIALLY the ones that showcase Exploits like duping. 
---
They're bringing flaws and lack of quality to the public eye, despite whatever intentions they may have. By showcasing just how poorly put together the game is, they make people like us, on Reddit, hound the Developers to fix things.
---
If they didn't do any of that, the majority of people would be completely unaware of the majority of the flaws present in this game.
---
Wanting them to keep quiet and suppressing information like that would do nothing but hurt the game more. At least by showcasing all of that, the Developers can try to fix things. Eventually. Months later.
---
Idk.  For some reason I can just never remember then and than.
---
Can confirm this on PC. Also seems to remove Herd Mentality from your effects list on the Pip-Boy when you're not in a group.
---
You do better
---
I just want to build freely. That's all. Dupe what you want but leave my walls alone!
---
Same here, its my only issue though.
---
1. Double sided walls
---
2. Half walls and half floors horizontal and vertical (for building round camps)
---
3. Triangular roofs (to snap together for round buildings)
---
4. Wallpaper for roofs
---
Just a start on my Christmas wish list lol.
---
But seriously and more importantly, thank you for acknowledging our pain and frustration with this. A LOT of us love building and spend days building up the perfect camp. Please help us as soon as possible to keep being creative. We love it. Don't take it away from us. :)
---
Haha thanks dweller!
---
They tried fixing what wasn’t broken. My understanding was it worked ok, but they changed the requirements of it and now it doesn’t work at all
---
Enclave Enslave
---
Ha ha that's adorable. 😂
---
I had this on PC too, and I spoke to team mates in the event and they had it as well. Most notable event for frame loss was radiation Rumble. First time I've ever had it and I would of thought the issue was my end had others not corroborated it.
---
IVE DONE IT I’ve cleared space in my inv and in my stash thanks guys for the help
---
Let’s call a spade a spade, it’s not intended for us to build those structures, period. Just because you can, doesn’t mean it’s working as intended. Just because Bethesda is too incompetent to do anything about it, doesn’t mean it’s not a cheat.
---
If we were supposed to be able to build them, we’d be able to get the plans for them. We’d be able to scrap it without it messing up our camp budget till we move camps.
---
It’s still a cheat even it they do squat. Just admit your cheating and that bethesda doesn’t care.
---
Exactly.
---
If you purchased the game for full price at release (or, egads, the collector's edition) despite all the early warnings from reviewers and beta players, plus bought atom packs and subscribed to their premium service (for a retail priced game) for a year...
---
...then congrats, Bethesda already won, they sucked you dry. You're probably in the top 1% of their most profitable Fallout 76 customers.
---
Some guy said he played upwards of 160 games most of the time placing in final 10
---
I'll check back with you when they screw up critter spawns again, thus breaking parts of it. Or inadvertently make the drums and cooking spits unable to be interacted with.
---
I didn't pick it up, it was from the event conclusion reward, and yes those are 2* only
---
Or just turn it into a vendor machine just like the other two that you buy Ammo and Stimpacks, heck just let us sell them to any robot/NCP vendor and call it a day. It’s seriously bugs me that ammo have cap value but we can’t sell them to anyone besides a Player.
---
Exactly. I'm alright with people giving constructive criticism but lately all I seem to see is just negative remarks and complaints that oh no I'm getting stuff I don't want. I don't get it.
---
shut up before I call the institute
---
That's 11 more than fo76, or at least it feels like it
---
So when the Brotherhood practice aggressive expansion it's fine, is what you're saying.
---
The Brotherhood, despite already knowing about the Master's supermutants, required a third party to push them into actually reacting to them. They didn't do anything towards the West Coast Enclave threat, and the group of them who fought the Enclave on the East Coast had been cut of from the Brotherhood explicitly because of their desire to actually help people.
---
And actually I did double-check. Winthrop in Underworld explicitly says the Brotherhood "see us and shoot on sight." and that they miss most of the time. Note the use of word 'most'. And your defense of them is still that they haven't actually hit anyone, they just shoot at them.
---
The Brotherhood started hoarding tech because the NCR reminded them that their only claim to power is that they have power armor and laser guns and, remembering the time the Enclave showed up and completely outclassed them, they feared becoming completely obsolete and pointless outside of their bunkers.
---
They don't care because ps5 is coming soon
---
But but - 'beefy' is in your name....
---
Why beefy? Why have you forsaken your namesake?
---
me too
---
They probably just broke it "fixing" something else or it could just as well be cos todd has a tiny penis. They never communicate so we will never know.
---
While the ammo converter no longer tracks the ammo you have on you (or in your stash for that matter), what they did charge though was really great.  The interface is much simpler and the amount options are much better.  I was able to go through all my extra ammo in minutes.  Personally I am grateful for it.  
---
Instead of whining about what you don't get and what you don't like about completely free add ons and updates that they don't actually owe you.  Showing appreciation will get the right changes quicker and better then constantly screaming and threatening the developers.  Imagine you were in their shoes and ask you read were the demand, complaints and trolling of your hard work, day in and day out.  We do not need to act entitled!
---
The developers are human and they are doing their best.  No one is identical to another, so the team at ESO might be better but that doesn't matter because they aren't in the development team for Fallout 76.  People make mistakes, bugs happen but in the end it all gets fixed.  How long do you think of constant complaining someone can take before they stop caring to put in the extra effort.  Especially if people like OP are always going to complain.
---
The point being is let's appreciate what successes we get in the changes.  Express our appreciation and follow it up with what could be tweaked to make it better.  
---
TL;DR The ammo converter works, it's great.  Thank you guys for listening and making in better.  Ammo is no longer being tracked, could that be fixed?  Awesome work guys!
---
Hijacking this comment to say that if you're on PC, you can hit Escape once and that should do the trick.

Pretty sure the only people working on 76 is the 3rd string team of unpaid interns and the janitorial staff.
---
Same. I had no issue hunting down weapons for steel and just enjoying what I'm doing.
---
While you're at it can you properly fox all the other issues in the game that have been plaguing the game since the beginnings? How many times can you introduce new items of "patch" pre-existing things that lead to duping glitches and other ways to cheat the game before you realize that you're doing something wrong? Or ban, then unban people with a shit ton of cheated items without taking those away from them. Its like you, as a developer, care more about what makes you money than fixing fundamentally broken issues in the game.
---
I do like to see all this hate for the BOS specially from the Enclave guys, dont you guys have a vault full of people to murder (vault 13) or a entire state to poison with FEV (capital wasteland)? "aH aH ThE bOs ArE DiCk aNd ThEy FaIlEd tHeIr MiSsIoN hUe HuE" Did the BOS frell up? Oh yes, but every single group did the same. After the BOS got wiped the Responders got wiped and we can still hear their the cries for help, The Enclave well they wipe themselves (bravo), The Order Of Mysteries was betrayed because one of the older members  as "dancing the horizontal mambo" with a raider, and the Raiders.. well take a guess about their fate.. so please get of your high house and stop being a jack ass.
---
Good luck calling nuclear waste
---
there will also be a blue version sold in the atom shop as well. but the one in the build menu now is a planned free reward, along with a dirty chally mascot outfit and the tenderizer plan.
---
Ok thx for the quick answer, but are you sure? This means you will  need 1000 xp from 0 to 1, but as I just one a match on a mule a few days ago I leveled up to level 4 instantly with arround 1300 XP. Did I something wrong? (I'm bad at math)
---
🤣 facts
---
Anthem exists...
---
because you're exaggerating a lot
---
hol up lemme call the prydwen
---
oh wait
---
Thank you
---
thanks so now we know it might be like this on all platforms
---
Ye, already preordered for that one. I preordered 76 too. Still great to me
---
Wait, you can scrap bulk items?
---
Really?
---
My whole life has been a lie up until this point.
---
I'm saying no Meat Week is something I'd complain about
---
I’m not OP, but I did not do it in this order. After the blood sample has been input, that’s it. There is no do over. You can log off and on, hop servers, doesn’t matter. The game will only let you install the T-fuse. It exists in a state where the game will always treat that as finished, but the quest won’t progress because it can’t see it as finished. I know this, because it just happened to me, making it the second game breaking feature on my character. Hooray!
---
E: The first feature was that the Enclave bunker is permanently locked for me and will not respond or open to me despite already completing everything and launching multiple nukes
---
They don't have a phone number tf you gonna call
---
how much time could it possibly save you? Like absolute max. 10 seconds? 5? a whopping 15?
---
To me this response feels like:
---
I can hear you all complaining, but we're not going to do anything about it, we may claim we'll discuss and look into it, but really we just are try to save face.
---
Please prove me wrong.
---
Use addictol to remove addiction to alcohol, lol. Or get addicted to 5 chems and become junkie.
---
but I got that hoe Ingram on speed dial
---
So you guys better not  to monetize the double sided walls. That is really disgusting.
---
It’s ok. Is English your first language?
---
My apologies then, I misunderstood
---
Do you have a lot of crops, turrets or lights? Those take up a decent amount of budget themselves. Turrets are practically useless, if you have any id suggest just getting rid of them.
---
There exists a Fallout 4 multiplayer mod that is being developed by 2 people. The building mechanics in that mod are surprisingly smooth and allow for much creativity without too many crashes.
---
This means that the concept of a less restrictive workshop/CAMP is theoretically possible, but is probably never going to be implemented as Bethesda is not really focusing on CAMPs
---
Got lucky today and spawned within the vicinity of 4 creatures. 
---
But yeah, normally this challenge absolutely sucks.
---
Better than the one where you actually have to kill a player in my opinion, though. With that one you actually have to have some semblance of skill, which tends to be where I... don't excel.
---
It does seem to be in a bit of a death spiral. I'm going to keep playing until cyberpunk comes out, nothing else to do in the middle of a plague. Might go back to Witcher 3 before that, just getting bored and annoyed at every aspect of this game having something bugged or just badly designed.
---
To be fair, the 800 stash limit is too low now. The game constantly has things added to it. Weapons, event specific drops, collectable items in the world, unique quest item rewards, etc. are pushing the limits of stashes. Ammo should and aid items need their own specific stashes imo.
---
Says who? You? And who are you again?
---
Seems to me we can but its broken, just like many aspects of this game are broken.
---
If we weren't meant have them then why have them a valid target while in build mode.
---
I didnt do any kind of glitch or hack to make the blueprint so you are at the very least, ignorant to the reality of the situation.
---
Ingram hard asf to get
---
They might say “Added double sided walls” in patch 33 but then not do it like they did with SS Pocketed
---
Same as well I had a camp built from the double wallpaper glitch and it deleted my camp and didn’t store anything
---
You basically outlined my conundrum perfectly. Interestingly, my last MMO i spent major time on is also BDO. I want to have a main character in any MMORPG, but in my Fallout/TES history, as they are not mmo, I get bored playing the same build/style for about 50-100 hours or so. 
---
So if I respec my main to strength build, I'm bound to get bored of it and get an itch to play stealth sniper again. 
---
The introduction of legendary perk is what really caused the conundrum in the first place as unused perks and level up actually serve a long time purpose in character progression, hence is best if I don't waste level up willy nilly out of boredom.
---
Well, you must be using it in the most efficient way possible then. And by that I mean no SBQs, no attempts to shoot SBs while airborne, no "spray and pray" in.general (which is part of the experience/fun for many who use heavy guns I believe). And it mostly should be close quarter combat using (vats) headshots with maximum probability. Am I right?
---
When I used all sorts of bloodied (ffr, explosive, you name it) heavy machine guns, I felt the necessity to feed 'em every once in a while with newly crafted ammunition.
---
Not that I’ve seen. It’s a lot though.
---
It’s a good game and all, and I agree that some bugs are quite annoying such as VATS and other things but also people should consider that there are so many people arguing about so many glitches and broken parts of the game that the update teams could be a bit overwhelmed. Certain aspects of the game getting changed lead to more glitches and accidents happening. I’m not saying this to anger anyone, just to point out that (perhaps not putting in 100%,) Bethesda is still trying to improve the game, and sometimes it can be difficult or overwhelming to do.
---
8th.
---
Newsflash, buddy. That "multiplayer" fo4 is never gonna get released, and will inevitably be abandoned 1 or 2 years down the road.
---
Power cycle the console. Works every time. Bug? Power cycle. Game crashes? Power cycle. Divorce? Power cycle got your back.
---
Overseer rank, nor season score
---
That's how you get them into the scrap box. But it's also just a good way to split up just to give to a friend or sell too
---
I can't speak for all of the pylons, but I'm pretty sure that most of them have always just activated lights within a radius like some sort of electricity wizard's tower.
---
Sweet, I'll take a possibly usable 2* SS armor piece from queen
---
Great. We are just as tired of these petty drama posts. It’ll be great not having an entitled whiner around.
---
ik she a bitch but it's better then codsworth
---
I do think about this a lot. Like why not make a bigger representation of the already made factions? The responders? Fire breathers? They could have been flushed out way more by now. Cultists have been a fan favorite since day one and they barely have added to them. Imagine a real pioneer scouts that wasn’t just completing challenges. Bethesda really just walked by all of their original content mostly, just to add new stuff and to me it makes it seem so all over the place now. Like there is so much happening at once imo. Love the game, but it does make it hard to immerse in the play
---
Well than nothing to apologize for!
---
True true
---
Keep drinking.   That’s what I do.
---
Dont get me wrong, I love the Fallout series (3 onwards), but especially for players that have been playing this game since launch, it has to be clear that Bethesda has been adding updates (mîni DLCs) and been making patches (which all could and should have been done in the first few months aftrr launch) to a bare minimum because this game has been dead and moved on from atleast a year ago..
---
Wastelanders was fun for a few days (unless you grind mindless dailies and events for not-so-satisfying rewards from earning billions and what else).
---
Still play it tho...
---
This reminds me of the bullshit arena rank from gta 5. Apparently there are 1000 ranks and it would take you about 17 years of non stop playing to unlock a rusty tractor. Only modders and hackers unlocked it
---
Yeap my bad, I probably had a stroke while reading it
---
If youre using vats with a heavy gun, just stop
---
I feel this in my soul.
---
I love playing, but I feel unsupported by the game. I know things take time, but my patience is thin
---
First is a great deal being able to have a private server, but we haven't had any cool new First Only vanity items in a LONG time. Piper's outfit could have been a great First only item (Although, SUPER HAPPY that we can all have it...but only if you PAY)
---
The building dynamic feels WORSE than Fallout 4. HOW COULD THEY JUST IGNORE THAT is beyond me. The in game economy is garbage. Legendary Run was fun for the first couple of weeks but I feel like progress has been throttled.
---
I love the environment and the game has vastly improved since Wastelanders, BUT I feel like playing this game is a chore. 
---
I'm ready to go back to super modded Fallout 4. I won't get nickeled and dimed to death and my food won't spoil.
---
And a level 68 won't kick my level 206 butt just because I don't understand the armor/weapon/SPECIAL builds...
---
I think it's time to pack up my CAMP for good.
---
It's the build up. If you have played since beta the whole story has been like a " Kickstarter ride" for a game. Only it's from a major studio and a major franchise. Broken promises, or delayed promised features and content. The game they pitched was not the same game at BETA. No open world PvP, no rebuilding Appalachia, no joining a faction no real sense of doing anything. Yet, there was potential and the basic gameplay loop was good. Then they gave us survival mode and I had hope. Then it was two steps forward give steps back. Hell, I still remember when they nerfed drop rates at white springs, and stopped energy weapons from dropping with explained mods. Yeah everyone has them cause of duping. Explain shotguns which can be gotten legitimately are nerfed now across the board though.. which doesn't make sense because you would think it would be the reverse. I like many others have just had it and are upset. We stood by and defended this game and played everyday and rolled with it and supported each other and Bethesda as they slowly broke things and gave us things we didn't want, and promised things that were never coming. I spent more money than I could ever tell my wife to get face because it is embarrassing. Yet, they continued to let me down... So now I'm at this point. I have nothing really to grind for.. do I have the best guns for my play style in PvP or pve. I stopped shopping in the reddit market earlier this year because I have owned and experimented with every weapon except an explained flamer ( which I don't even really care to purchase or trade for) there is nothing left for me to do. There hasn't been anything to do except hoard more junk? I earned my Mr. Fuzz suit which took me a year and a half to aquire and I unsubbed this month, gave away my legacies to friends and have basically retired. I uninstalled the game once but drunkenly I reinstalled the other night. I don't know when I'll play again but I really really hope they turn this around. The game has so much potential it's like they have relegated it to Jr staff while they all work on star field or something... I dunno.. I finally have given up though..I defended the game this long along with other fans but now it's just a joke. I'm bitter and it's unhealthy but I guess it really meant that much to me. It was really something special and they just mucked it up. It could still be saved but you'll need way more work than than it seems they are willing to invest.
---
Pretty sure the bonus score and additional challenges came after the hot fix but like I said you want to reach for the bad side of things to make your point seem more valid. And the changes are barely time consuming if most can be completed in less than an hour.
---
Once again not defending if you had read my disclaimer, I'm just an optimistic person and I try to look at the bright side of things instead of always assuming the worst. Makes my life more joyful instead of dark and depressing but you do you lol.
---
If I'm delusional for being optimistic than so be it, at least I'm not acting like everyone's out to get me.
---
When I saw the rewards I was like cool. Stuff for Caps from vendors = me scrapping more weapons and armor for more steel, wood and cloth. It all adds up. Over time.
---
I’ve thrown away so much cork
---
Lol talk about made up drama.
---
No, I'm just kidding. Its my native language.  I guess for some reason I thought it was more complicated than that.  You changed my life.  I always felt bad for not knowing.
---
imabout 3 months ahead of you on this. tried so hard to like this game and give it many chances. but nah, its trash still.
---
Hmm I'll see when I get on
---
Indeed! He needed attention I guess.
---
I know, I leveled yesterday to level 80 and need a little more then 3 wins so arround 3200. But someone here already got me the formula of the cp system, basically the same as the score one.
---
I was stuck and restarted the game
---
Lol!!
---
Whatever are you talking about?
---
I'm a fking surgeon with my Vampire Gauss shotgun, only thing that ever kills me is when I blow myself up.
---
Make sure to roll with 5 demolition and you'll be good to go.
---
Oh my English isn't that bad lol
---
Not many can actually be bought from robot vendors. Most are exclusive to the Provisions/Pails/Gifts. Deathclaw extra Claw Plan, Sturdy and Heavy metal Armor plans. And some that are so low of drop via other sources they might as well be exclusive - Plasma Grenade and Mine Plans, Tomahawk, All three levels of Raider Armor Plans. Prime Plans only drop form the Queen. Power Armor Plans are rare drops from Treasure Mounds. Issue is the gifts were duped to high heaven so all these "Rare" plans got left in suitcases and cigarette machines all around Appalachia or put in Player vendors for cheap so those that care about plans already have them unlocked.
---
Confirmation of an enemy is usually a good idea before starting a war with it, hence why they needed more info before fighting the mutants. Also, you're using the East Coast as an example both for and against your side, you say they killed sentient ghouls in DC, yet, that they were exiled for caring about people, so, which is it? Are they villains or good guys?
---
The Brotherhood did take part in wiping out the Enclave on the West Coast, as did the NCR, replay NV, Arcade Gannons questline. And the last statement is pure conjecture, not actually confirmed or with evidence.
---
And it's not like we're forced to do this. It's a community event, we're helping out each other in a way, why people can't be happy with that is beyond me.
---
I will do this then this. 
---
I like to do that more than that.
---
I've been playing for 4000 hours and an additional 1200 on a second account. I've supported Bethesda with my wallet too many times to count and I've tried to defend them on multiple occasions but this last patch was the one that broke the camel's back. I'm done. I'm holding a clearance sale to clean out my mules and I'm uninstalling the game. The game is changing but not for the better, it's just turning into a cash grab by a company that doesn't give a shit about it's player base anymore.
---
Holy fuck. Maybe later in the week when stiff has been built up!
---
And for update 21: how to make the game worse (please keep giving us money) :)
---
that's what we can agree on
---
Lmao
---
And still it's been a known "feature" since b.e.t.a. probably. They just don't care.
---
Just like the ripper, chainsaw, Mr handy saw, paddle ball, the electric drill.. All interesting weapons that could be really cool but are seemingly useless and don't get touched by the devs.
---
What happens if we don't meet the requirements? That's my question
---
I'm a new player, only hit level 50 a couple days ago, and even I don't see the incentive to waste my materials on this
---
The ultimate flex-ride
---
Have u considered maybe not throwing ur resources away?
---
I have loaded into the game in the same spot as the foundation of my camp. Forcing me to fast travel to my current spot.
---
When the brotherhood of steel requires more cork than steel, is it truly a brotherhood of steel or a brotherhood of cork
---
-confucius
---
I mean, I had a stroke while reading the title, no because of bad English but because I didn’t read it properly, no offense good sir ! I am a kind man 
---
Lot of love on you, thank you for your understanding 
---
(Not native english and pretty late here sorry)
---
after the "fix" to the ammo converter I scrapped it from my camp and went back to dumping it all periodically.
---
With my bloodied build if I shoot it in the face with a bloodied combat shotgun with all shotgun perks or my ultra 2525 sniper it usually dies instantly or cripples it. But I def know what you mean when I went to help Ra Ra and in the vault raid they downed me because I did it at a pretty low level and didnt have zuch op weapons that I have now.
---
That's defeating the point of nuking it. Screw the event.
---
The tractor is amazing, too bad i'll never see it/ride it
---
Same, I'm German, but I was just joking, all good
---
Make sure to scrap the bulk at a workbench because sometimes it doesn't register if you scrap it with the scrap box.
---
I honestly havent looked into the event. Just knowing something was going on was the fun for me
---
Yeah.  I guess I didn't realize it before then.  Itll be easier now, though to use it than before.
---
I'm sorry but like N U K E
---
I think they just confused it with legendary run
---
The rewards aren't even worth the time. Add the fact that I'm not a Brotherhood fan and...I'm in.
---
I’m gonna start selling golf balls in my vendor
---
Who was talking about the last dupe exploit? Bethesda is patching things that were wrong 6 months ago, seems like that's how fast they work
---
My BE flamer begs to differ. It's basically a vats sniper rifle that oneshots everything I usually farm for xp (ghouls and supermutants). Literally, 1 fuel, 1 kill. Sometimes two-three kills if they're close enough. And it's quite ap-efficient I must tell you.
---
Yo don't forget ward doesn't wander now. Totally fixes the game for me personally.
---
Whoa so my only reason for logging in this week is now gone. This sucks I really want to play but my wife didn't complete her Apex battlepass so guess I'll continue to do that since its mildly rewarding.
---
And fuck those little liberator things. They're annoying asf
---
This is pretty cool i was thinking of making a pirate ship and wearing my pirate outfit but i dont know if its possible anymore.
---
This makes zero sense
---
this will be fix next week dont worry...
---
Yea im not donating shiitttttt!
---
O M G THANK YOU YESS FUCK THEM AND THE HORSE THEY RODE IN ON
---
I’m completely aware of how the glitch is done. I’m also fully aware it’s not intended. 
---
You’re trying to play the ignorance card, try that on a competent game developer.
---
No, they did not. Season started June 30th, Double Score was announced [July 2nd](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates). Hotfix to implement tracking didn't happen until [July 16th](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Oabso5vKN6XF3xr1AL6Ag/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-challenge-update-community-showcases-and-double) and the actual(hopefully) fix didn't happen until this Tuesday. 
---
&gt; And the changes are barely time consuming if most can be completed in less than an hour.
---
Why does anyone have to spend that extra hour in the first place when they should've been receiving SCORE this whole time? I keep asking you this question and all I get back is false claims.
---
Thinking that a multimillion dollar company did something that went through multiple stages of planning and implementation in multiple departments unintentionally is delusional. You can keep twisting it as positivity, but it's plain delusion.
---
You might say you aren't defending Bethesda, yet you continue to dig for excuses for this nonsense and use false information. I can only conclude that you're either ok with it or are paid to do so, considering the amount of effort going into providing these false claims. Especially while trying to make it sound like asking for something to make up the lost score not being locked behind a ridiculous amount of uncommon material is some sort of paranoia and someone is out to get someone while saying you're sure about stuff that can be easily disproven to make yourself sound more valid. There were no weekly extra challenges. There were no extra score events. You can ignore these facts after claiming otherwise, but they remain facts. No one is out to get anyone. Just a corporation doing corporate things. And shills defending it. Nothing new.
---
Now you’re getting it!
---
and no one missed them....
---
MILDLY, have you killed a wc yet?
---
No problem playing off XBox Consol
---
Can confirm on xbox one as well. If felt like my character was swimming underwater IRL and then everything turned into white dots.
---
It's not about the time. It's about randomly loading into stuck in a wall or foundation or off the side of a cliff.
---
I guess I must have been sick on that day of 2nd grade, lol.
---
They want us to finish the event. That means we'll have to donate to finish it, if we don't, they'll have to change the rewards in order for us to donate and finish the event.
---
Ya, had to grab that after posting a request for it a few weeks ago.
---
I've been called a lot of names for having an opposing view here. When I defended devs from players saying they want to slap them calling them hateful names etc I was downvoted into oblivion. This place loves to hate. But I still try to put up a reasonable discussion.
---
Bethesda will never be comparable to EA, due to the simple fact that they don't have a trail of corpses behind studios they acquired and shuttered.
---
It will be difficult on a brand new character. If your "new" character is already over lv 50 and you have a main that can transfer gear over, then I'd say its very possible.
---
The trick is to stack intelligence to insanely high levels.
---
U can bin the cork if u like the, steel u can be turn into any ammo u want, no lead, no gunpowder. Rather slowly but yeah. How much 5.56, .308, .50 whatever u use would u give the BOS?
---
As the seemingly only explosive build in this game, can I just say that I like missiles and floater grenades as rewards? They get used up reliably, but I really don’t wanna buy the bullion plans or use my mats crafting explosives - the rewards are a steady way to keep me flush with ordnance (plus every other train station has a paper bag with the stuff 👀).
---
Just wanted to say that there are SOME weirdos out there who are into this stuff.
---
The steel event ends in 2 days
---
I believe it's only visual.
---
Related, Food buffs from from Herbivore/Carnivore are similarly not consistently showing as boosted by 25% via Strange in Numbers. Cranberry Relish as a Herbivore shows 20% XP boost typically, but it's supposed to be 25% with SiN. I've seen it show up once or twice but hard to reproduce.
---
Make this thread hit the top of the sub
---
I wanted to make my treehouse again but I guess I can’t anymore
---
Did you get the Wolf and Mole Rat blood samples to?
---
Might expirement later, I've only ever had the 1 toon since beta. But I just started the legendary run 3 days ago so I'm already content with knowing I won't get all the way through. But I still have a chance for the ghillie rifle and backpack, just impatient and want it sooner rather than later.
---
There is another way, but it's much jankier, and you can't remove any floors once placed so you have to be perfect in your building!
---
They don't gaf, do you really think donations are being tracked? This company can't get anything right but I'm supposed to believe they coded donation tracking correctly, yea right
---
it is XP gained, not Levels gained. better done with a high level with as many XP boosts as you can muster
---
Lol it really is crazy that it feels like only 3 people actually work in this game instead of a triple a company
---
That was updated manually last night. We have lots more than that.
---
Given their track record on everything else, they aren’t going to be forced to fix shit.
---
Yeah, I killed one with the wife as the first weekend they were out by the waste disposal site mountain range. Than one day I was doing the raiders daily on public when someone nuked top of the world and I got to fight one by myself. Very cool fight.
---
move your camp module around. You should spawn in roughly a northern direction of it
---
For sure I got a little confused on the wording. Scorch beast brains are back on the menu it seems
---
I've never seen a community overreact this much over fucking *walls*.
---
boo hoo.
---
Thought the Steel donations ended on the 8th?
---
Escape Artist, Radicool, Nerd rage, Adrenalin. Enjoy!
---
Just give us some god damn sliders or convert all option it's not complicated
---
When that happens I just sell them. The caps will probably end up being more useful anyway. No need for more bash damage nocturnal broadsiders
---
Can people just stop with this drama. 
---
If you don’t like it, don’t do it. You won’t be missing anything.
---
Everything in the game doesn’t have be about amazing rewards.
---
Especially for something as easy as collect, scrap, donate. The easiest thing in the game. 
---
There’s been a new influx of players who don’t have all the plans you do. 
---
Stop being greedy and selfish.
---
7th iirc
---
Honestly was kinda shocked about this..
---
This patch contains a “Colossal Problem” but you can’t play it because it’s a colossal problem.
---
It's not just about the walls, man.
---
It's nearly two years of jacked-up crap from Bethesda.
---
The walls are merely a tipping point.
---
Carnivore + SB Brains + Leader Bobble-head + Tasty Squirrel stew + Well rested is what i use
---
Hold O for a few seconds
---
Sad part is, Obsidian wanted to share this engine with Bethesda when they pitched fallout Vegas 2, but Bethesda said "nope" gotta use the antiquated/broken creation engine. This is why Outer Worlds was created. Bethesda really needs to use or create a new engine. Technically Elder scrolls 6 will be on the same engine as Oblivion and Fallout 3, just updated version.
---
Not that I don't like the event, just wish the rewards weren't the same things I've had for a year
---
Yeah, that’s what I worried about too. Honestly, I was kinda hoping Wastelanders might be equitable to 1.20, and it really seemed like it might be for a bit, but I’m getting skeptical about that.
---
I would say they are. The BoS are a faction of US Military deserters. They seceded from the military and are therefore traitors to the United States government (The Enclave). To make matters worse. They are occupying United States soil as a rogue militant presence making war with them, not only justifiable, but also necessary I’d say from the point of view of a government.
---
How so?
---
I found 10 and still does nothing
---
I think the public teams and other not-so-recent updates have brought us together around events and workshops more. But I am excited for a REAL community event. Fasnacht was so much fun.
---
The Fallout 76 News tab says 4-8 of August
---
Didnt transfer creation club currency or purchases between platforms, why were you shocked Atoms wouldnt?
---
I put in rejuvenated, but it isn't really doing much.
---
must not want people to come back for events.. im still playing but i think i'll drop a few resources just to help the community event and not look back.
---
Yeah the fight is cool... but unrewarding. Hundreds of shotgun shells or thousands of bullets just to kill it for 2 stimpacks. No. Just no. I don’t understand how bethesda expect 10 people to kill one in such a tiny area (Monongah mine). Players, wendigo spawns, wc and explosive particles = laggiest event in the game.
---
Keep in mind that I'm not a builder in this game, and therefore don't have an extensive amount of experience.
---
I would just try to maximize how much budget you're using, and I would keep track of what you're using it on. Others have told me that different types of items use different amounts of budget, so if one decoration takes up a sizable chunk of your budget, maybe think about how much you actually want that in your C.A.M.P., because it's probably going to prevent you from placing other potential decorations.
---
This kind of goes without saying, but if you're not using it, scrap it, don't store it (unless it's something exceptionally valuable, like a decontamination shower).
---
I've also heard of a glitch where the game believes that you're using up more budget space than you actually are. Most people say that relogging fixes it, so if you find yourself a little skeptical of what the game is telling you, then try server hopping really quickly to see if you magically have more budget space to utilize.
---
Lol. People like you man. Your comment was constructive thank you. Mmorpg .com has it listed as an mmorpg. ERSB has it listed as an "open world role playing game". Plenty of gaming site reviews list it as an mmo. 
---
Where is the quote from Bethesda? Well there isn't one. Because they probably don't even know what kind of game it's supposed to be. 
---
You have a right to defend a game you like but I also have a right to be upset with the game that lacks engaging content that other games in it's similar genre do have. 
---
If it's not an mmo, mmorpg, mmo-lite, looter shooter, or an open world adventure, what kind of game is it supposed to be? Questing with friends or questing with strangers in a world where you can't even trade items with each other? Give me a break.
---
Then don’t do it. It’s really that simple. But people don’t need to keep making the same post over and over again.
---
You don’t need this event to give you better rewards.
---
Yeah don't forget you get a vocal sac lol
---
What bugs are these?
---
Well let's hope they dont fix it and we can have one of each machine after all. 
---
Lotta cry babies will feel pretty stupid.
---
Till then I'll just enjoy having ammo and laughing at people that are so full of themselves. 
---
As if you never cheated at a game. 
---
I'm sure you have duped weapons and pretend you dunno know.
---
The ammo machine doesn't effect you in any way but you cry about it. 
---
Why.. so many bigger problems in this game.
---
SS is king
---
Literally addressed that already
---
Someone gave an alternate character of mine duped stuff (I think) a long time back and I haven't logged on it since. Would I get banned if I logged on it?
---
Didn't think about the mine limitations btw. But I guess that's why I was looking forward to this event as I thought it was hyped as the new queen fight.(As rewarding as that is lol)
---
“This is your president John Henry eden”
---
Wow. Similar story and experience for me too, but I jumped this marvelous train on Fallout4. Loved it. Even bought mugs, t-shirts, hoodies, posters and hundreds of toys about the Fallout universe. The artwork is something that caught my attention deeply. 
---
I was (am) an Assassin's Creed franchise fan and was going to shop for the latest one when my friend suggested Fo4. I bought Blackflag and Fo4. I thought: let's have a look at Fo4 and then play Blackflag, that's what I wanted. But I couldn't stop playing Fo4 and "finished" it with all factions over and over again.
---
I've pre-ordered 5 copies of FO76 (for my wife, my brother in law, myself, and two friends). We were going to form a great squad (didn't know it was 4 players, but no problem). We did play a lot but by the end (nuke time) I was alone because everyone didn't like it. LOL. Well, I nuked the queen area and kept playing until level 138; "years ago." It became too boring for me too. And I had new Assassin's Creed, Farcry and Tomb Raider to play!!!
---
Years later, because of Wastelanders and Covid-19 lockdowns, and the delays with Cyberpunk and Watchdogs Legion, I "had to" play FO76 again. It was great! Imperfect but enjoyable, until the grind began. I am level 420 now with another 155 character (I resurrected and largely "improved" my wife's character) and a new char level 55 just so I can scrip the hundreds of legendaries we accumulate daily.
---
I suppose we just have to watch Netflix and wait for Cyberpunk, and Obsidian and Ubisoft to release their nice games. Bethesda is s.C.R.A.P (and grind) LOL.
---
PS I've subscribed to 1st but am canceling right now.
---
Good luck to all players here!
---
75million steel so far out of the 125 million
---
Not that I am aware of, I got fo 1st in March, and since then had amassed a surplus of 4k adhesive, 3k  aluminium, and 6k plastic. Just buildup over time. Which are huge amounts compared to the gunpowder and lead I come across without intentionally farming for them.
---
Honestly we’re better off nuking fissure
---
The Vault Dweller had to get the info for them and then still convince them that they should actually do something about it. After the Brotherhood tried to get them killed. And if you don't understand that a group can both think they're the good guys, and even attempt to be, while also being shitty or at least doing shitty things, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
And what the Brotherhood, and the NCR, actually did was wait for other people to put in the work then clean up after them. It was years after the Enclave's master plan was stopped before the Brotherhood got involved. You can't show up after the fact and then claim to be the hero.
---
I mean if you think using a Gatling gun in 3rd person is cheating then I don’t know what to tell you
---
Ah if you have been playing since beta then you’ll follow the logic on why its possible.
---
Each int gives approximately 2% xp increase.
---
Unyielding set - 15 int
---
Character - 15 int
---
Brain bombs/scorchbeast broiled brain - 8 int with strange in numbers
---
Herd mentality - 3 int with strange in #s
---
Berry mentats - 4 int
---
Egg head - 8 int
---
That gets you to 53 int if I'm counting correct, or about 110% bonus. (If you used 6 pieces of +int gear, that's another 12%!)
---
Now, you get about 20 lunchboxes throughout the legendary run. Each lunchbox is 25% xp bonus. That's around four to five additional opportunities to get *another* 100% bonus.
---
Then you also stack tasty squirrel stew (with carnivore and strange in #s) for 25%, well rested for 5%, for another easy 30%
---
You should be able to roll around making 240% of base XP doing this. 
---
Server hoping or just farming Super mutants should make the rest easy
---
It also doesn’t work in PVP. Like if I lock on to a wanted player in VATS and hit them with a 95% shot it does zero damage. I heard it works with energy weapons but I know for a fact it doesn’t work with ballistic weapons. It wouldn’t be as annoying if everyone just didn’t use Tesla rifles now which is basically even worse than VATS lol.
---
I tried them when they came out, realized that the AOE is ridiculously small and every one I've gotten since goes straight onto the ground.
---
If it did not happen the others 10 times why do you think it gonna happen this time? Derpthesda keeps frelling up and people keeps giving them money... I've been boycotting Fallout 1st (love the irony of that name) since day one and I will continue, will change anything? I doubt it but it is what I chose to do.
---
&gt;placing walls "in front" of foundation blocks for a more aesthetically pleasing exterior
---
That's an awesome idea that I never even considered.
---
How does that keep people out of there is armor for protection againts radiation
---
As well as double-sided inner walls. Been sitting in their meshes archives for months (if not since release. I only found out about these .nifs several months ago), still not a part of camp building system for some reason. A wild guess would be that they're planning to sell 'em as a 2000 atom bundle eventually.
---
Go claim a workshop and play around with building there.  I use Wade airport all the time for stuff like this.  Huge open spaces to play with.
---
Never bought fallout 1st, only bought atoms twice since beta. I would say I'm technically making a point but I never gave them a notable money in the first place and never will so I assume I can't help or hurt because bethesda wouldn't notice. 
---
I feel horrible that I can't help cause all I see in this sub is what I can only describe is pain and regret while I play on like I always have, not having any less fun. 
---
I feel like I should be ashamed for doing so, honestly.
---
I must admit, now that I’m actually playing NW at least once a day, I’m starting to see improvement. Very slight improvement, but some nonetheless
---
I would never pay money for a broken game, FO1st will never be an option for me
---
Yeah, they never actually seem to be embarrassed by all the embarrassing mistakes and missteps they make.
---
I as well on pc cannot enter the mine; I've even tried an uninstall reinstall.
---
I loved it even more when I did the wastelanders/ally questlines and every damn reward included an auto grenade launcher and 10+ 40mm grenades.  All of it went straight onto the ground.
---
Oof.gif
---
Sad shit man.
---
I believe there is a Fallout76Custom.ini fix for this. Something like bSteamEnabled=1. Not sure exactly what it is but it was posted on this sub a while back iirc
---
Not use pistols. 
---
Seriously, they just don’t scale with end game content like rifles do.
---
\-corkfucius\*
---
If your talking about the fatigues underarmor it's no longer considered underarmor due to a glitch
---
LMFAO
---
This sub has a "tipping point" once a month.
---
unyielding armor + building team = more intelligence
---
more intelligence = more experience
---
What’s “building group” and “lunchboxes”? I assume the cranberry cobbler is just a food that’s easy to make?
---
Wanted to run with u/sleepyhollow8492
---
Fuck the BROTHERHOOD
---
Have to resupply after the first bunch of rewards.
---
Apparently they changed it so you don’t need those anymore. Probably broke the quest (again) in doing so though
---
Just make them available in the camp structures
---
Yea could be. The one really lagged had a lot of meat piles in one location, when I walk near them the lag was terrible, but when I walk away it went back to normal
---
I built my new ROUND camp (the Observatory Bar n Grill) 2 days ago to the right of Atlas. 
---
That might have been not such a good idea now lol.
---
😕
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
Well shit I think I set my intelligence super low not thinking I’d need those skills at the beginning. Guess I can start increasing that now.
---
Talk the Overseer into it
---
As of last update? Since it was introduced it's been stupid slow on One X.  It's a 2d gameboard how taxing can it be?
---
It didn’t.
---
You select it to set it as your preference in the atom shop.
---
hes been on this sub all day trying to start shit with people, pay him no mind.
---
It's a drop bag skin. 
---
It replaces the paper sack when you drop things.
---
It's a skin for your drop bag
---
Except the camps they showcase use the glitches too.
---
Makes as much sense as bandanas being effective at it. And I don't think that is too P2W given that it is already easy to get an item for this purpose.
---
I won't touch those challenges; I'd rather just grind XP than screw around with that.
---
I'm perfectly happy to AFK and watch a movie during Nuclear Winter, but I'm not going to actively play a game I don't enjoy just to get points.
---
It’s under where the loot bags are. Under skins.
---
I’d invest in getting more luck if you’re serious about getting this to work. You need as much crit as possible to really get pistols going.
---
Ahh yes I was. What about the vault jumpsuit even that isn’t showing up in the options to modify it or even the raider one.
---
They changed the menu options in the terminal... now it no longer shows you the ammo you have available for conversion...it just shows you a list of all ammos and you choose the ones you want to convert instead of just showing what you have available like it did before...so I had to keep backing out and looking at my inventory to see what I have to convert. Just more tedious nonsense.
---
Not sure about those but I do know for sure that the fatigues are bugged
---
you say you are tired of these posts but you have been trying to start shit in every one all fuckin day. you arent tired of this drama, youre part of it.
---
I’m working with stealth and chems. Working pretty well so far. Black powder is helping me punch above my weight when necessary.
---
What's it's a reference to?
---
Between the matchmaking, plus the (way too long) lobby time, plus the load time, plus the time spent looking for enemies, 10 minutes may be an exaggeration but it's not an extreme one.
---
Your*
---
Also no, i won't. I found a way to farm easy af steel and i intend to give it to atlas
---
\*\*ultralight build intensifies
---
I imagine portions of the wasteland could have died out completely, but there would also likely be areas in which there was enough scientists left that they could’ve developed their own inoculation to the scorched plague. I do think if the residents hadn’t killed the queen and performed exterminatus on all the scorched, they would be a much more common sight in the wasteland throughout the years. Perhaps there would even be dead zones where scorchbeasts establish migration patterns and mega nests, guarded by hordes of scorched people and creatures that got infected along the way. Would be cool to see like a mile wide fissure prime with hundreds of scorchbeasts flying around.
---
Yes, its in Bethesda events. The link is somewhere, just dont have it in my clipboard anymore. I think it updated at the 12 hour mark and showed us at 75/125
---
Ah okay thank you. I appreciate maybe when my xbox gets the update it will sort itself out lol
---
Not true. I sell all kinds of plans.
---
Not my Overseer....she ditched us for over a year.....we risked our lives saving and reclaiming the area, while she was chilling in her Sutton Hills Mansion.....Make Appalachia Great Again 2104.....recall petition is circling....she needs to go.....
---
You can just bulk your scrap to get it out of the scrap box, then scrap it again for the turn-in. 
---
But sure ok.
---
Do you feel stupid for sending Bethesda more money now?
---
Grafton Pawn Shop. There's 5(?) case files. In a room with a operational yellow light. Click the spaces on the wall and it removes them from your inventory.
---
You found a way to farm the easiest material in the game to farm?
---
Yet the ability to stack mounted heads and other stuff remains. Which means, they did fuck all to actually fix the core issue. Bet an interior wall bundle is in the Atomic Shop in the next 2 months.
---
Yes on the food, just find Cranberries. The lunchboxes are rewarded from the legendary run and a building team is just a public team you can join/create that gives a bonus to Intelligence.
---
You do you man and enjoy your elebenty hundred bottles of shitty virtual booze and stacks of plans you already have (and so does everyone else)
---
Freaking auto correct not knowing my intent.
---
Good luck wasting your time my man
---
Yeah hopefully, but you would think it's gotten the update when you redownload the game
---
Found it, only the one update, not "live".
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
I never said I never cheat. I never said I had a problem with people doing it or that i do things like report them.
---
I’m just not going to play stupid and pretend it’s *not* a cheat
---
Yep, gives me some cork too. Win win
---
The latter ain't gonna happen unfortunately, it sure looks like a subscription-only feature to them. Just like scrapbox, which should've been day 1 base game feature.
---
10.5%
---
That's my best offer.
---
I sell every plan I get for 10 caps
---
Exactly why I did it but according to my Xbox it’s version 1.0.0.42
---
Ah, i was wondering, why in the hell i cant paint both side of the wall. So i spent extra hour trying to place my walls right way ...
---
Indeed and they will only listen once we start voting with our wallets and take our money elsewhere! They don’t deserve our money, fuck em!
---
Maybe try and force a update
---
These posts make me happy that people are enjoying this game compared to the things that people have problems with. Thank you.
---
Bro they’ve said that same thing a while ago
---
I am still stuck with it...
---
If only we could make custom Protest signs.
---
A lot of people's main issue are the daily limits (scrip exchange, gold bullion, cap vendor limits to an extent), which makes it pretty grindy. Plus the lack of endgame besides of Scorched Earth. The unaddressed bugs that make the game infuriating as well.
---
Baller AF!
---
I’ve seen that happen
---
The joke will be on them probably because that shit weighs a lot if it stays in their stash/inventory. I dont think theres anything you can do with it either
---
I noticed the same, I usually only used grenades to make the floaters come out of the ground, since I started using floater grenades I’ve got to throw a few of them to make that happen.
---
lol
---
China will most likely be the ones dropping the nukes.
---
How would I do that?
---
because both are PC even though it's different disturbers.
---
At this point I’ll try anything
---
Thank you for the response
---
Anyone manage to find a fix for this yet?
---
Your Atoms don’t share but the things you purchase do. If you plan on switching permanently, just spend them, or log back in and spend them when you see something you want. Whatever you buy will be available across those platforms. 
---
Note: This is NOT the case if going from console to PC.
---
95% != 100%
---
Not sure about Xbox but I know on PlayStation you use the options menu I believe
---
Does it just remove the client? so it things it's still windows? I am not sure how that would work?
---
😆 I’ll take anything
---
So you are enjoying the game and you want a bunch of internet people to ruin for you?
---
Anyway, I think the main complaint I see is the daily limits on the endgame grind. After you complete your build and finish the story you'll decide whether or not you want to grind out the Wasteland gear or just come back periodically to play any new content drops. If you decide to grind you'll be capped on how much you can progress per day. Some people find that offensive, others don't really care.
---
Ok not the point of the comment
---
Yea I have to re-download 76 on Game pass then going to buy whatever and uninstall just thought it was kinda a shitty choice on Bethesida's part.
---
You don’t need legendaries until lvl 50 anyway, keep the good ones, sell the bad or heavy ones.
---
Good for you, for posting your opinions.   There are many that are long gone that feel the same way you do.  
---
Ignore the the apologists, there are many less of them now but they are still here.  There is value in feedback, and Bethesda does read these forums.
---
Part of their 100 year plan...check it out, kinda crazy
---
Finally someone who gets it. And we havent even talked about what she did to her poor stupid fiancee.
---
Long live the Enclave. Long Live America!!
---
What... it’s always something with you guys
---
I got Assault rifle plans, baseball bat mod plans, free range plans, shielded under armor plans, left over treasure hunter plans, backpack mod plans, tadpole badge plans, Halloween costume plans, barbed walking cane plans, but I’m not selling until these Ultracite PA limb plans sell first!
---
Something similar but less likely to lead to people duping, people stealing forgotten ammo and people not pressing BIG RED BUTTONTM. They could change it to work like venders or the treasury note machines.
---
I took it on and off and it started working again.
---
Same here. I think it's the time gating as it takes 5 minutes just to move the cursor around thus more time in the game
---
I finally got my canvas bag yesterday. For free... In the atomic shop.
---
&gt;So you are enjoying the game and you want a bunch of internet people to ruin for you?
---
Lol!
---
This is simple....
---
Load input Bin with junk ammo, hit Process button: Presto all ammo converted to their "points"
---
What some ammo, select the menu and pick.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I personally would just convert the ammo upon hitting the Process button but I can see some use in having the ammo points so you can select what you need when you need it.

I exclusively have Fasnacht Plans in my vendor, some of which I have 5+ of, and I've yet to see anyone else even selling a single one.
---
Sure, a bunch of people probably have most of them, but newer players don't, and I only charge 200 caps a piece.
---
Oh okay, awesome! Thank you
---
Pc (Game Pass) - can't enter either. What a great update!
---
Yeah I figured lol. Every method I’ve tried only works until I log into a new server and then it just respawns back into my inventory. Maybe one day they’ll fix it 🤞🏻
---
Ditch those magazine and bobbleheads displays. 
---
You can have 10 turrets, but if you really need that many they will eat budget. Maybe it's easier to move and defend less. I have only 2, plus my Collectron, Ally and a local Settler also help out. 
---
Don't go mad gardening or collecting water unless you really do use it (or you like a 'green' camp build). 
---
A dozen display cases with rare or unusual objects may look impressive but you'll also need to have good lighting to make the most of them. Again both eat budget.
---
Don't be afraid to rebuild or remodel occasionally. I seem to have a permanent 10% in storage that I can swap in and out without worrying about limits. 
---
Scrap common items rather than storing. Why keep excess walls and floors when they are cheap to craft? Do you need a dozen dazzling spotlights, or will a few selected lamps provide much more efficient mood lighting?
---
And if you are still bored of your build raid the vendors for unusual plans and have a good sort out - Whitespring in particular has lots of unique/rare items you won't find in drops. And carefully peruse the Atom Shop. Some items/bundles you will see by the dozen in camps, maybe being a little more selective will pay dividends.
---
*just have fun, experimenting costs nothing*
---
Adrenaline is NOT fixed for nuclear winter either....
---
Yeah it's a new greifing thing now apparently
---
That is true, the Emperor does protect...
---
Hypocrisy much lol gtfo 
---
They unbanned the dupers and let them keep the duped items. You all are crying about the wrong things.
---
I'll just do me and enjoy the ammo I got without cheating. Idc if they fix it.
---
Indeed, I tested it because I wanted to build a Mansion (lol... ;\_;) for my Mistress, and discovered it there, mentioning it in passing. I hoped/figured it was a quirk of the PTS.
---
Ok so now on top of every other goddamn bug I have to worry about, I have to be extra careful with my junk I put away too?? Thats a paid feature and it doesn't even work correctly 100% of the time?!
---
I love these posts and how ironic their requests are.
---
"Don't play the game to waste time and grind for materials, Play the game to waste time and launch a nuke!"
---
Either way, you're still playing the same game.
---
There’s a part of the site on bethesda that’s supposed to do it, last I checked we were at like 80mill
---
I can't either. I just wiped all my saved data hoping that would help, but no dice. I should ahve googled before I lost all my pictures but live and learn. Hope they fix this issue soon, would be nice to finish that quest.
---
*Cries in assaultron helmet *
---
Dude, it should be 10% per mutation.
---
Line it up with Junkie's and Bloodied as a super viable build.
---
For me didnt work with the wood, thats my experience
---
I agree, there’s really no reason they can’t make it share across all platforms, just figured I’d toss out the workaround.
---
You are absolutely correct!!! They are trying to setup a model like Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto were it is so difficult to collect the good items people will pay for it. The previous system with atoms was too generous for the profit margin.
---
I didn't use wood because it says collect wood. Not scrap to produce
---
My amount of plans for sale attracts people, the low prices make the people my customers.
---
To all the people that are canceling Fallout 1st (the irony of that name) good for you guys hope that derpthesda wake up and start punting more effort in the game its just a shame that it take all this time for you guy to see the train wreck that this game as becoming.
---
Once I finish the Legendary Run, I’m done until I see good news on this sub. Actual developer responses and concerns that have been a problem for years are being addressed.
---
[I dunno. I’m going off of this](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Same here! Knowledge is power in the Wasteland, and I want ALL of us to be powerful!
---
Or let us bulk ammo and then sell the bulked ammo to a vendor for ammo points, exactly like how we get legendary scripp and gold bullion.
---
Did you apply the camp module/suitcase skin?  If so that bugged you camp display.
---
Nobody gives a shit
---
Sorry I am ignorant, what exactly is wrong with it?
---
Maybe they just didn’t release the update for xbox yet. I can’t update it. Just when I was liking the game
---
Did you apply the future tec skin to it? If you did, remove it. It’s glitched.
---
Hmm...conflicting data?
---
Mmm yeah maybe is that. Good point
---
It should have been out yesterday
---
Main problem: Bethesda
---
My plans/recipes sell quickly, at one cap each.
---
Ah. Guess that was during a time I wasn’t playing.   I stopped for a while because I got super busy.  And came back after wastelanders.
---
Who downvoted a fact from my experience, I say it for others to know and gather more info
---
Bruh
---
Save resources, sure. 
---
Save time? L O L
---
The ammo converter GUI is a nightmare time sink.
---
I price mine higher than that. Some plans like mounted heads I don’t.
---
You shouldn't be
---
-confucusover*
---
&gt; updates that they don't actually owe you
---
No, they totally don't owe anyone a working game we paid for. Main quest is broken, but no big deal. Raider's Ra-ra quest also broken, but so what? Half the weapons are broken, but it's ok. Getting robbed of SCORE, not their problem, right? I could go on, but I'm pretty sure they owe us a fucking game we paid for with features working correctly.
---
I expressed my appreciation enough by paying for FO1st for several months after buying this game for full price. I have every right to complain about having about 10 levels of SCORE wiped out with no compensation.
---
I have a theory that bug fixes meant to stop exploits will never be telegraphed, to avoid a wave of legacy blueprints right before.
---
Yes I do have the camp skin from the legendary run selected. Dammit, I have rebuilt my camp 4 times in the past week because I messed up and couldn't scrap the mistake. Thats annoying, but thank you for the insight.
---
Go to Grafton Pawn Shop. Upstairs and find a room with a clickable board. It removes them from your inventory.

Man I wish you recorded it. Would have been cool to see and maybe draw some inspiration from

im having this problem too everyone spam bethesda on twitter and such so they can fix this buggy piece of shit also submits as many tickets u can to bethesda support
---
I did actually!
---
**Please make it so you can apply a different wallpaper to each side of any newly introduced two sided walls.** 
---
I know it might seem obvious but I just want to nip that in the bud. I can just see it, the triumphant addition of actual two-sided interior walls, that... are the same wallpaper on both sides due it it being one item/mesh. This is actually going to be a genuine issue they will have to figure out a work around for if they intend to go that route, because technically I believe every wall/wallpaper is a separate 'entity' in the toolset.
---
God forbid, solutions of such complexity would require the full team effort to warrant q4 2022 release. (Only to postpone it to q2 2023 because it'll most definitely entirely break something like shooting guns or moving around right on release)
---
/s
---
Every time Bethesda fixes a problem, 3 more pop up. Particularly after updates and hotfixes, it'll run all choppy and buggy.
---
Just bot sure how to link it, this sub Reddit doesn’t allow videos
---
Both junkies and bloodied have negative drawbacks though, if you had that it would be totally overpowered because there’s no negative effect to it
---
Well put.
---
I cancelled my FO 1st sub after this patch
---
Thank you for addressing the issue
---
So frustrating. Just spent like an hour searching for a fix and seeing walkthroughs mentioning 3 blood samples and worrying it was only me. Here’s to hoping it gets fixed soon. Should we all submit support tickets?
---
The issue is solely because Bethesda thought people would want to work together to get a reward for everyone. 
---
Only a small amount of people will donate because they like the idea a community lead event. Even if this one isn't the best. The vast majority will hate it because if the barret and flag was a plan in the ATLAS creates they could get it themselves and show it off to people who didn't.
---
Not noticing this, my carry weight goes up like normal and my bird bones makes me practically hang in the air when grouped as normal.
---
Maybe a YouTube link?
---
I don’t actively farm for it, but I do pickup all the weapons I come across while farming xp and scrap them for steel, which I turn in when I have a 1000ish on me.
---
What a useless piece of shit. You can gather 100 dirty water in 20 seconds by just spamming collect on a river. 
---
For it to be anywhere near useful it should max out at 5 and produce boiled water instead of dirty.
---
I'd rather hope they're working on a new camp item that is a double sided wall,leaving only the wallpapers for the atom shop.
---
I think the problem here is having different wallpapers on each side,not a double sided wall x se.
---
Have atleast 1* full unyielding
---
I thought I was a Grade A Hater, then I discovered r/fo76. I’m actually a bright ball of sunshine in comparison.
---
It's pretty nice to have some positivity around here, I suppose. Especially with the whole debacle surrounding the patch.
---
My buddy and I have been doing exactly this for weeks, except we are herbivores.  I have my INT at around 56 with all the boosts and on a building team with Herd Mentality/Strange in Numbers.  We each open 1 lunchbox together for a 50% XP boost each hour.  Leveling and Score come quite quickly.  1 pass through my favorite XP spots nets me at least 1 character level (I'm in the 400's) and about 75% of a legendary run level.  It was more at first, but when you get into the higher levels on the board it takes 3.5K+ score to level up.
---
I am skipping the event. Too busy doing the legendary race. And  reputation on 4 characters.
---
It's very low effort on their part, that's what it is.  They do not have much money assigned, so very few development resources assigned, to the game.
---
As much as people are bitching, new players are finding this to be very good.  The plans are useful to them and steel they got from scrapping for mods mostly just takes up weight and vendor space not selling so now they get something for it.
---
Woah woah hold up. When will they update it so that the SBQ will have sex with us? That’s an update I don’t want to miss.
---
That analogy is straight up perfect
---
It's actually part of a "quest" that preceded Wastelanders.
---
[onedrive maybe?](https://1drv.ms/v/s!ArK5MAWAaDaGj30p9uAdFrxWBFHv)
---
It’s part of the quest from pre-wastelanders DLC to introduce you to vault 79. 
---
You can choose to do the quest, but it really has no other impact on the game.
---
Yep. I must admit though this place was cancer when it first launched. It's much more balanced. But come update time I'm reminded of the good days 😂
---
Gamma gun or salvaged assaultron head for rads management when you die. Both guns give 50 rads per shot. Gamma gun is lighter but fusion cell is more common.
---
They don't even load the game.

Obviously you do because you just had to comment. Go back to whatever shithole you crawled out of.

Sure

I belive there are 6 of them.  The shop is a pawnshop in Grafton.

As a proud member of the local Appalachian Enclave detachment I feel it would be *most befitting* if we aided the coming Brotherhood’s arrival by depositing some advanced technology in and around the ATLAS grounds.

Specifically, *plasma mines.*

I hope cork gets replaced with fertilizer.  No fucking way that much cork is happening.

If the community goal is met, yes.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events there's a tracker showing how much so far

I have more videos they’re still uploading
---
Its due to gauss having projectiles instead of hitscan i think
---
it just works
---
I do so wish we could build ourselves a city/player hub around vault 76, something so heavily fortified and defended we would clearly be the dominating faction. City 76 needs you!

Bro the Michael J Fox line had me rolling 🤣

It definitely let's people know, probably the owner. Normally a different person between lvl 200-400 will come for the bounty. I haven't seen penalties for property damage when I try but I don't have the perk.
---
I'm on full ignore.
---
Considering how content-poor this patch was its genuinely troubling that so much went wrong.
---
I have Fallout first, but  I had zero steel saved up in my stash when the patch dropped. I used it all up crafting ammo for the  colossal problem event (that didn't drop with the patch).
---
Bye.  
---
You had countless chances and you are being dishonest.  If its not about monetizing double interior walls and eliminating 'tricks' so you can monetize those 'amenities' to the architecture as well in the atom shop later, then prove us wrong and fix the parts you effed up royally and keep whatever part you 'had to fix.'
---
However, this is *exactly* your aims because you failed to make enough viable content, so rather than work on that, you introduce a BS junk grab event that favors fallout 1st memberships and destroy cool CAMP workarounds the community found so that you can sell it to us later.
---
Shame.  To all of you, remember back to when you wanted to be a designer, a producer, a coder, etc.  Did that dream begin with 'I can't wait to make money my priority, forget making a great game/experience'?
---
I'm guessing no.  Think back on that and decide if this is the direction or company you want to be tied to.  Do you want to be real, viable artists, or corporate shills who place money above all?
---
Again, its just...shameful.  Shame on you Bethesda; you'd have been better off remaining silent than offering this empty post of BS.
---
If you run low hp then wouldn’t it be convenient to decontaminate and then collect water until you’re back at your desired rad level?
---
I'm not saying she in particular as an individual isn't doing her job properly; I'm saying as a representative of Bethesda, they're not putting her where she needs to be.
---
Yes but the fort would only have wallpaper on one side of the walls now.
---
I don’t think it came over yet. Even after uninstalling it and everything. My game size is about 70gb. With this update it should be about 85gb
---
Do you know the name of this quest so I can google it? I’m 500+ hours in and don’t remember this quest.

I’ll have to try it again last time I checked it wouldn’t work but I’ll let you know.

I cant use VATS at all, i have my primary and secondary mouse buttons swapped through windows ( Because i'm a lefty). Pressing Q will bring up vats but i cant fire. Pressing the aim button (your fire) will close VATS.

I am going to turn in what I farm as I play.  I do want to participate. The website says that 75 million was turned in on the first day.  I
---
I'd like that too. However the way this 'fix' was implemented kinda points to "hey, we figured out how we could make lag a miniscule amount harder to achieve and also pave the way for an Atomic Shop interior wall kit."
---
Also check to see if items are actually in the vending machines. There are some glitches that Empty the machines back to stash. See if the machine reads 0/30.
---
I don't think it's necessarily about the things in this update specifically. 
---
The C.A.M.P. walls issue definitely ticked off a significant portion of the community, yes. However, by itself, I really don't think that this would have caused such a big issue and such a big uproar. 
---
It's when you add this to the game's almost two-year history of development that you start to see how it got to this point.
---
All of the complaints may be currently directed at the things that came with this patch; the C.A.M.P. walls, the Brotherhood of Steel's less-than-satisfactory rewards, the somewhat-fixed-somewhat-even-more-broken ammo converter, and all of that. 
---
However, I believe that the source of the complaints really comes from the issues that led to these developments, and the developments before that, and the developments before that, and may potentially lead to developments later in the game's life. Like you said, the real problem is the lack of communication between developers and players, and I think that's really what all of this is about, even though they don't specifically say it, and even if they don't specifically know it themselves. 
---
Players feel like they've been dealing with this kind of stuff for almost years at this point, and I think that it just took a moderate issue, not even a really big one, to get the playerbase to freak out.
---
Finally, someone has the courage to say it.
---
Poor Russell. He died as he lived; just *glowing* with enthusiasm.
---
And also you monster. You didn't even manage to take out any genuine BOS. Just a wannabe fanboy who is probably getting kicked out on his ass anyway.
---
I love Meat Week
---
Well, we’re already at 75 mil out of 125 needed, so clearly someone is participating.
---
Because there's so much in this game that needs fixing and Bethesda are more concerned about people placing double walls and floating camps which don't negatively affect anyone.
---
Here’s what you do. Return the game. Buy more alcohol with the money you got from the return. Be happy.
---
Create a problem, sell the solution.
---
You just argued for a case of mediocrity ie yeah it sucks but we’re getting what we asked for. But we didn't get something worth having.  It's not just an outlying opinion but the majority.
---
It's the case with the Atlas event, same with the ammo converter &amp; a bunch of other things.
---
To put it in perspective, say you wanted a burger. However the burger you got was burnt &amp; soggy &amp; barely edible. Your saying yeah it sucks but at least we got what we asked for.
---
Do you think a burnt, soggy, barely edible thing is what people asked for? Do you think the current Atlas event is what people asked for?
---
People have a legitimate case for complaint. Saying we got what we asked for is a pretty dim-witted perspective on the issue.
---
That camp budget glitch has already been patched so it can't be done anyway, I've visited 600% budget camps before, that wasn't enough to cause any lag at all on PS4!
---
I didn't say don't play, I said don't donate. Differences lol
---
That's fair. Mutations have drawbacks too, but Class Freak all but nullifies them. And I can't imagine any running a Mutation build without that.
---
Im pretty sure they are all there, but I'll definately check
---
I'm not bothering with it.
---
To be honest the interface is more annoying now. Before, the option to sell different ammo types disappeared if I didn't have that type. Now I need to know exactly what I have and how much.
---
Why couldn't they change it be like venders? Or hide the options I can use like before...
---
Plus the exploit wasn’t even that big of a deal. Im pretty sure it was people being able to DDos the server but I’m not sure. Either way stupid move.
---
Uninstall it for maximum happiness
---
Rain drops fall 60,000 feet before landing in a rain collector. The drops collide with all sorts of particulate matter floating in the air during that time. Dust, bird farts, smog, etc.

I’m not saying don’t cheat, I’m saying don’t pretend what your doing isn’t a cheat.

I might do one turn in, just to say I helped, but that's it. Steel is precious

I found that out a few weeks back.

Would be doing that now...if the challenge didn't auto-complete the minute I'm on a server!!!
---
Yeah it has been building up for awhile, I just hope that people stay pissed until the big problems get fixed.
---
Yup, don't waste your junk
---
Two sided walls?!? What?
---
They did change it awhile back to where you had to do a certain amount of damage to her to get the loot, though I don’t remember the number. I assume it was becuase people were complaining about low levels coming, taking one shot then hiding in the bunker, making more adds spawn and making the fight significantly harder.
---
Same. Beyond frustrated.
---
If you're on Xbox, lets go do a few runs through white springs. Should get at least two levels per run. Running the quests are fun too, and they push you to explore early and often.
---
Treasures Unknown.
---
I believe the plan is to nuke Atlas as often as possible ...
---
I’m doing it, because I eventually want the BOS Collectron.
---
I donated 250 steel for the cause! I don’t have fallout 1st so I just bought bulk steel at a train station and dumped it in the bin. Had to scrap it first as it doesn’t take bulk steel for some reason. That’s effort enough for me
---
"I'm doing my part!" 👍
---
I'm sorry, do you live in some fancy 3D realm or something? Our walls only have one side here.

Thank you!

Get fucked lol

This comment explains why socialism has never and will never work lmao

Oh. Sorry. I misread your post as “the newly introduced two sided interior walls.”

I quit when I realized a game I was playing in 2020 looked and felt like it was made in 2010.
---
Awful loot, loot system, combat, bosses, "end game".
---
Bethesda took a crap with Fallout 76.
---
And you've just taught more people about it. Smart.
---
I think they made that change due to some of the building community posting exploit vids with it for duping on YouTube. That makes it a priority.
---
They would put salt in it the bastards
---

Do I get a participation trophy? 🏆

Exactly. What if I don't wanna kill cultists? What if I want to know about the Mothman? There's just nothing but red HP bar enemies of some guys praying.

I just did 250 steel and now I'm done. Its pointless. We will hit the milestones regardless.

Honestly that sounds kinda badass.

---
Using a gun in 3rd person view is not cheating, exploiting a bug with a certain gun that allows it to fire much faster than intended is whole another story though. No offense, I guess this is what they were talking about.
---
I honestly haven't seen an legitimate criticism about the ATLAS Project. Mostly just people complaining about the individual rewards and how it's not what they wanted, without adding what would be better without making outrageous demands.
---
And comparing this to buying a burger is quite a bit different since we're not paying for this. We got it for free. So it's more like if someone gave you a free burger that was a bit charred and then throwing back in the face of the person who gave it to you. It makes you look like the dick. But that's just my opinion.
---
If you have anything else to add maybe try helpful criticism instead of just name calling.

---
What's good? I just cancelled my 1st subscription and I'm over this stupid game.
---
It was, this is 100% to eliminate the double walls and other exploits used to make unique builds, likely to be used later as atom shop content.  Bethesda's Wastelanders was super promising out the gate and after its first month, failed to hit the target.
---
Then the Legendary run looked promising, but the number crunches realized most non-grinders (people playing daily @6 to 10 hrs a day) would need to pay for some levels to get the coveted white fireplace door and that soured many on the Legendary Run.
---
Then once everyone saw the drop on the BOS intro, lots of grinding for a flag and a beret re-skin was the final straw for many.  One common theme for many here still playing is our builder community.  Now its my theory Bethesda still needs to recoup more money out of FO76 before they move on to ES6 and Starfield.
---
8 steel, 1 pickaxe pilsner, random plan (mod plan for an axe probably), 1 stimpak.
---
Hell no! Who wants to go around being called a vault dweller? Tunnel Snakes Rule!!
---
It's so terrible that were hopeful that people will work together. I mean why be nice and help each other when we can all be selfish and do everything on our own. This sounds like problems with society and not an oversight by some devs.
---
Actually, the high council of the 76 will swiftly enable full mod support upon taking control...God save the wallpaper!
---
Please let us know this great cork gathering method!
---
That's a fair statement. I did blow up their zeppelin in 4 lol
---
I wasn’t whining about the odds. I just calculated them. And I don’t think having to trade for your dream weapon or trying at the purveyor 55,000 times (which someone who doesn’t know about using the internet to trade weapons would have to do) is justifiable in any way shape or form. It’s not laziness. The only reason my grandad has a BE25 lever action, a BE50 handmade, a BSS40 ski sword and a 2* set of Unyielding heavy combat armor is because I’ve been able to set him up. Without me, he’d still be using that 2* exterminator’s hunting rifle and a mutant slayer’s ski sword.
---
So..I hear you have some stable flux to donate?
---
yes, 100%. i don’t give a damn about a beret or a flag. i want my materials.
---
Preach!
---
I think they've affected the only stable, generally-happy player base who've financially invested in packs, wallpapers and cosmetics etc and something simple as being able to use two wallpapers was arbitrarily taken away, thereby making these packs and cosmetics half-irrelevant.
---
They've got a right to be pissed. I was surprised on day 1 when I couldn't apply it to both sides naturally. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
So yeah- that's why the furor is a little louder as these peeps were generally content the whole time.
---
Lol nice. Always puts a smile on my face when the game delivers some instant karma.
---
The only reason I don't buy that is because the main rewards are community wide, not for any individual. Plus there is no scrap box there, like at all.
---
If I was there trying to get people to donate their junk for no reason to increase Fallout 1st subscriptions. I'd literally add a scrap box in plan view... That's all I'd do. The seeds will grow itself.
---
So you picklocked at someone's workshop and became wanted. Where's the mystery here? Red or white, it's not your workshop. Now you know.
---
I only sell ammunition out of my only store at my camp. People keep buying out my 5.56 and .45, as well as my .50 cal. Ty for informing me of this shortcut as i will likely be using it to stock up my store more effectively.
---
Lifesaver right there. I was literally stuck there right now. Had now idea how to get out without the Exit dialogue displayed on bottom of the screen. This new UI update made me laugh so hard.
---
[Winner getting the rest of the prize](https://1drv.ms/v/s!ArK5MAWAaDaGkAAWxvxpfYvqyPW1)
---
Thanks. They took money *while my account was suspended* (but not banned, they did eventually reinstate permission to play), then they completely wiped everything. My atoms, all five of my characters... Everything!
---
it doesnt work, just tried
---
They're talking about interior walls
---
&gt;First, this is, in a way, something the community has asked for since day 1.
---
Yes, I remember everyone asking for a stupid chore that awards the community with lazy reskins of existing assets, that's been on the top of everyone's wishlist forever.
---
Yeah, but it didn’t do that for other white containers. So is it random?
---
Fallout 1 we helped the vault dweller defeat the master, Fallout 3 we defeated the enclave. Lets face it, we both know bethesda will give us the canon ending in 4 or at the very least leave us alive. Our track record is pretty good. Now lets look at the Enclave's trakc record. Fallout 76 killed by their own AI, fallout 2 some random tribal, Fallout 3 lost to the brotherhood.
---
if you join a group do you see a jump in your special stats?
---
Believe it or not, everyone didn't start playing this game at the same time you did. 🤯🤯🤯
---
Our Brothers and Sisters from the 101 hold a special place in our hearts and will always be welcome at our mountain retreat.....Long live the snakes!
---
Haha awesome. Take my upvote. Thank you
---
That's why I phrased it the way I did. I said in a way. I didn't say this is exactly what we asked for so we deserve what we got. Sorry if the English confused you in that statement.
---
Oh, so we get back 8 steel per 250? What a deal!!!
---
Guess he forgot legendary robots explode
---
Thats at the 12 hour mark, i think. Could be wrong as it doesnt really move and it was displayed at 9 I think my time.
---
Are you fucking kidding me...
---
Shouldn't need to be talked about
---
Ah the solution is simple then. Add a water converter machine that allows us to convert 1 purified water into 1 boiled water by navigating 4 pages of a terminal each time!
---
That may not be exact but essentially that's about how much you get.
---
I’m almost desperate enough to go *there*...
---
You read my mind, most of today has been running about collecting keycards.
---
&gt;And comparing this to buying a burger is quite a bit different since we're not paying for this. We got it for free. 
---
Umm... That's just straight up false. Everyone paid to play this game. People continue to spend money on the game to support it so that we can get more content. 
---
Just because there isn't a direct link between the money spent &amp; the event doesn't mean that it's for free. Saying it's free is a misnomer. It's not free to everyone, just to those that paid for the game.
---
Once again, an argument for mediocrity.
---
&gt;If you have anything else to add maybe try helpful criticism instead of just name calling.
---
Also you:
---
&gt;It makes you look like the dick.
---
It's astounding how tone-deaf you are. Not an insult. Just a statement of fact.
---
Wow, already halfway there after just a day and a half... That's pretty crazy
---
I mildly looked at the math for using arrows to convert to 5.56 and .45, and I don't think the points were really worth it. .50 cal has a great conversion rate though!
---
This sucks man, I’ve done forbidden knowledge countless time and have only obtain initiate and paladin. I was really hoping to get the rest on this event. #thanksbethesda way to care for your loyal fan base.
---
Unlocked containers are free game. If you picklocked a safe, then you robbed them. 
---
For instance, I picklocked a safe at red rocket workshop that was owned by someone else. I got 10c bounty. I have no idea what you did.
---
maybe those issues are easier to fix? nvm that doesnt make a good reddit comment, they must be hitler 2.0.
---
As someone who had been using a VATS sneak rifleman build since day 1, I say to those just discovering the mess that is VATS. Welcome to my hell.
---
I did the “quest” already so everything is already on the board and I can’t interact with it. The holotape is just stuck in my inventory until they hopefully fix it. I submitted a ticket to Bethesda about the issue a couple weeks ago and all they said is that they couldn’t help me.
---
Idk I liked doom eternal
---
All members of our Homeland Defense Team will be required to have Lvl 3 Home Defense slotted at all times.....quite certain we will be the Shining City on the Hill (just above the Meat Cook)
---
The reason I decided to make it was that I looked for this source in this Japanese map that was localized in the Japanese community.
---
I tried to contact, but the thread is locked, so I created a new one. Therefore, we apologize for not being able to contact you.
---
&gt; *Edit: Actually looking at this site it's not actually real-time mapping anything.
---
I agree.
---
To the end, the purpose is to "lighten the display", so the coordinate data is not included. As you said, it is simply extracting the differences and layering them. 
---
I've confirmed that there was a topic in the original topic about specifying legend colors.
---
It is a societal issue. If one person can find one reason to show off or one up someone they most likely will. 
---
Its not a big/deep issue here though. There is a agreement to be made about why should someone with no interest in the rewards should join in. The value of these reward will be destroyed the moment we have them as everyone regardless of donating get them.
---
Good thing here is we seem to be over half way last time I looked up the progress. People will stop complaining after they get rewarded for what other people did xD
---
there are mods that exist for PC, but none of them are Official
---
I was having this exact same issue; crash to desktop on any event that spawned multiple/numerous meat piles.  I updated my video driver (I was three versions behind which can happen with how fast certain manufacturers spit them out) and made sure my DirectX was up to date. This has not only fixed the meat pile problem but also smoothed out other little hiccups I was having while playing especially when sprinting, jumping off something tall or fighting extremely large groups of enemies.  I believe this most recent update made the game not optimized for the older drivers.  Unfortunately from what my console playing friends told me the update also made it not optimized for consoles.  While the PC crowd gets a lot more troubleshooting to do on any given problem due to the varying hardware we have, at least we have the ability to troubleshoot whereas the console crowd is just going to have to wait for either the manufacturer of the software or the console to get on the same page.  
---
As far as I'm concerned this patch can go down in history as the un-patch.  I've never seen a patch fix so few issues and create so many not to mention claiming to fix things that are not yet implemented.  Couple that with the recent steam issue where anything on sale showed up as not owned, this has been a relatively frustrating few days.
---
The boycotters should go all in and not collect the rewards at the end of each phase.
---
F U C K YOU
---
It's just a visual glitch. It says I have -4 str, but my specials shows I have 6 from my normal 7 str. So it IS working properly.
---
You would've had to work for that score in the first place so if you want to make up for the score you'd have to put in the same amount of time sorry for the hassle lol
---
&gt;. I can only conclude that you're either ok with it or are paid to do so
---
&gt;No one is out to get anyone.
---
These two contradict each other. You can't assume I'm working against you and then try to make me believe you don't think someone's out to get you lol
---
And I will repeat once again since obviously you keep choosing to miss it. I. Am. Not. Defending. I'm just being positive about it. Sorry if my opinions aren't facts I never claimed they are, they are just my opinions if that hurts you then I'm sorry I can enjoy what I've been given and don't have to tear apart everythjng we've been getting for free just because I have a grudge. If I smell shit I'll call it out, but since I didn't pay for this it's all extra to me.
---
Yeah, people have been asking on and off for more budget/stash space for a while now. Although I suppose I'm thankful that it's better now than it was at launch - Stash used to have a 400 lb limit instead of an 800 lb one.
---
Wdym DoNT WaSTe YoUR JuNK???   
---
1. It's steel it's pretty common (sure you could say that about the Cork, Glass etc. but who cares) 
---
2. You're donating to the BoS so it won't go to waste 
---
3. If everyone said don't waste your junk the progress would stay zero forever.
---
Emmet mountain: kill all the scavengers, take all of their weapons, scrap em and get tons of steel and some cork. Also a lot of mods
---
The choices they make as far as changes go.  They add grindy stuff, they nerf fun stuff, they've let known bugs go on for way too long, and when they do fix bugs they have a tendency to unintentionally break things that are working fine.
---
Naw I gave her plenty damage.  It didn’t even give me rewards for the event either
---
Thanks. I haven’t played since the update, but seeing that you guys actually care a bit compared to what people are saying puts a smile on my face.
---
I use them. I throw them at peoples camps that annoy me. I am in passive though, so it just makes noise and scares them at the first time.
---
The mutation isn't missing or not working, I'm just passing on that its being hidden when the positive effects aren't active.
---
Isn't that true. You give a man a free event and they'll complain that they didn't want it lol
---
Happened to me earlier. I just changed server and it was back to just handing the lost item in for east scrip and treasury notes
---
Oh man, decisions decisions...250 steel for a goody package of maybe something good or just keep it, hmmmm
---
Everyone’s having that issue Bethesda patched it.
---
I noped out of that one yesterday haha. It was 2 am and I was tired. I rarely get a player kill. :/ it happens but it’s rare.
---
Do you use PA?
---
[This perhaps? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i41fjw/it_makes_me_so_sad_that_they_patched_the_adrenal/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Yeah I remember but when you have to repair weapons and stuff it’s hard to have enough room in stash for legendarys that you wanna sell, or other weapons you still use, outfits, even camp display stuff but the camp thing mostly is Bc of how I can have an animal but you have to have room for them two
---
It’s ridiculously long. I knit scarves while I wait in the lobby. NW is what I play when I need to get some knitting done haha.
---
Accept it, and immediately talk to him again to progress as if it was completed. Bit of a hiccup, but still functional.
---
my brother was having the same problem. seemed to work for him by leaving the game and plugging in the T Fuse first, then analyzing the blood. just keep server hopping and doing that until it works. good luck everyone!
---
Literally the dumbest patch.
---
Like anything good, its better with moderation. Eating a cheeseburger wont kill you, eating a cheeseburger 3 times a day for the next 30 days and youll probably have a stroke at the end of the month. Before "anything"    developing games by big game developers is about generating money. You shouldnt be suprised, everyone complains about how Bethesda just wants its hands in your pocket, but you know what Obsidian is gunna get when you play the new Cyberpunk Game?.... your money. If Cyberpunk fails, there wont be a Cyberpunk 2 becuase the game company wont invest its money and rescources into something not alot of people are going to "buy". I think alot of FO76 players get burned out becuase of content overload. Not to be insulting to anyone, but people who play FO76 constantly, everyday, sometimes all day. Yes its buggy as shit and has an ass ton of flaws, but they become even more apparent if your always looking at um. Dont quit, take a break.. even with its developing "mobile game strategy" FO76's most enduring quality is its player community. It always sucks to see a good player leave.
---
&gt; for free
---
SCORE is a feature of the game we paid for. It was broken, but it sure wasn't free. So is the  main quest that's broken in multiple places and tons of other bugs and glitches that are a part of the base game we paid for. Asking for those things to be addressed and compensation is normal. Not to mention all the broken shit in the Atom Shop. All those things are not free. The fact that you use that as an excuse would be baffling if not for all the other things you've said here to excuse this.
---
&gt; Contradict each other
---
Those two do not contradict each other. You aren't working against me simply because this is a discussion, not some battle. But it's funny to see you think you're "working" and take it so seriously, almost like a job...
---
&gt; You would've had to work for that score in the first place so if you want to make up for the score
---
Most of the score challenges can be done by just playing the game. People that were just playing the game while being affected by the autocomplete glitch were robbed of that score. Now they are behind with many not able to make up for days they lost because not everyone can be online completing those challenges daily.
---
Everyone please upvote this. This is a lifesaver.
---
Also, if you're on PC, you can just hit escape once.
---
That’s Bethesda for you.
---
Keep practicing whatcha preach my nigga!
---
What other mutations and perks are you using? Are you on a team?
---
You might be stuck in down the sights / aim mode. I usually switch weapons and views to get me out.
---
Bashing helps sometimes.
---
I agree
---
Gotcha, those type of games I've always liked. IDK if you hate that type of game but pillars of eternity is a really good fantasy RTS.
---
Wait, do the brains and the stew stack?
---
Radaway or a decon shower.
---
thats so cool!
---
It goes away on its own, radaway will help it go away faster.
---
So don’t play. ?!?!?
---
This. So many things pump bloodied melee that weapon choice can be a matter of preference.
---
Think this happens when someone has stranger in numbers equipt
---
Hahah yes, lucky for me this event is good timing. Over the past mouth I made 2 characters which meant a lot of scrapping weapons and armour which means ungodly amounts of steel hahah. Without Fallout 1st I was happy to just drop around 45K steel just for more stash space.
---
I have literal TONS of cork, over 100k. But I won't be able to turn any of it in because ill be on vacation. Soooo if anyone on xbox that has F1st wants to take my cork and donate it, let me know. Lol
---
it always been there, combination of marsupial, bird bones and strange in numbers
---
but is it /s?
---
I’m trying 😂 just can’t seem to find one
---
Thanks!
---
Tip for any PC users: use the giftbox loot pile replacer from nexus. I had the same problem but this mod fixed it for me. Here's a link and be sure to endorse the author since he made that for free. (not me) https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/648
---
Oh. I only opened 5 and got mostly booze and stimpaks.
---
I have marsupial but not bird bones, and I’m not using strange in numbers/no one is sharing it
---
I’ve dropped everything in my inventory out of frustration/ remade every piece of power armor and nothing. I’ve gotten used to avoiding using it but my build kinda needs me to be in it. Low health and extreme rads heavy weapon
---
Funnily enough, I actually saw a post on here about this exact same issue \~30 minutes ago. If you want, you can sort by new and probably find it without too much trouble to see if someone has come up with a solution for it yet.
---
I'll do the same really quickly, and I'll link to it in this comment if I find it.
---
Edit: [Got it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4h9qh/game_glitch_an_ounce_of_preservation/) No direct solution in the comments, but people are theorizing about the cause. I would keep an eye out on that post for further responses, as well as this one.
---
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
---
We need a sticky for current known bugs. Granted, the damn thing will need its own search function at this point... but it would be quite handy.
---
I also forgot to mention that when i kill a ghoul, the option to takenblood isnt there, which means i already have the sample.
---
Get yourself a 2080ti and play the gamepass version, don’t matter what specs you have if you run the game in windowed mode your capped to a half-cinematic 12fps
---
This game is getting worse. Just released fallout 5 already
---
Get the Party Boy/Girl Perk as soon as possible. It will double or even tripple the effects of prewar booze.
---
I've got some 17 years (on and off) invested into WoW, so it'll always have a place in my heart and on my HD.
---
PS4?
---
Obviously server stability was an exploit we were abusing.
---
You have it wrong, I would give a huge amount if it was a real community event. It's not, this is a pr stunt of nothing.
---
Unfortuantely, this quest appears to have become bugged after yesterday's patch.

This is just a way for them to get a good portion of the duped junk out of Appalachia. Well played Todd... Well played!
---
Tip: play something else.
---
Nah. Xbox
---
Current offer is 3 missiles, 14 technical data, and 1 mini nuke.
---
Lookin pretty good, she’ll go quick.
---
I've known it for a long time and I still forget. The time delay between when it dies and when it explodes has greatly increased since fo4 so you tend to forget
---
Maybe we can start a movement and loot the Bethesda headquarters? Hell I bet even if you successfully loot Todd Howard you only end up getting a 1 star out of him.
---
Try it out and see for yourself
---
Most of the loudest defenders on here say it's a freaking MMO.
---
It's not. It's obviously not. Not even remotely.
---
It's a halfbaked and very poorly implemented looter shooter with a great theme and a formerly great building system. And even that last point was a buggy mess, but fun.
---
Maybe you don't understand how it works. Yes we bought the game. We didn't buy the updates they keep adding, or the events they put out. The atoms and fallout 1st are their own thing. You can't just say because you bought them you're owed something extra. That's not how life works. You can complain about what's been giving out for those things on their own but it doesn't entitle you for more stuff. So yes it's free in a certain implied context to those that understand that. If you're going to pick apart everything I say just to make yourself feel better go for it, but it doesn't make you right. 
---
&gt;Once again, an argument for mediocrity.
---
&gt;Also you:
---
&gt;It's astounding how tone-deaf you are. Not an insult. Just a statement of fact.
---
I was using you as a generalization, I'll make sure you make that a point next time. Sorry you misunderstood the language.
---
Hm. Probs right. .50 cal should still be worth stocking. Someones bound to buy that more than arrows or cryocells yknow?
---
Like Nuka Cola and general atomics?
---
If so it's under posters for me.
---
Sure, that's why the modders were able to fix the problems that build system had. But base FO4 build system is still superior to FO76, for all the problems it had.
---
The build engine design is not a single vs multi-player issue.
---
And you were right.
---
I did, against my better judgement, and I regret it.
---
I \*AM\* part of the problem, all the while decrying it.
---
I know xbox pushes their patches out on Tuesdays..  you have to pay an additional fee to microsoft if you want your patch pushed out on a different day than tuesday
---
I dipped out when a pay to win subscription was introduced and this insane subreddit defended it. I remember saying the slippery slope with the collectron and refrigerator.  Came back for wastelanders. Played the entire thing in less than 2 days. It was hollow. Immediately uninstalled again after seeing how grindy bullion is at end and how empty wastelanders was. 
---
I still follow this reddit. I get laughs from seeing the posts. They always follow a cycle. Complaints, minor fix, everyone becomes content, 'to the player I saw at..', hotfix complaints, new patch, world falls apart again, and repeat.
---
So ill be that dick. Maybe you all should stop whining. You guys wont admit this, but I know you all know it deep down. Youre still gonna play. Because youre whales, and addicted to the empty sandbox grind. You all stayed after pay to win. You all tried to defend it. Justify it. Rationalize it. So just stop.
---
Youre still going to eat this shit up. You all know it, and I know it.
---
The fact you havent left yet. Thats how its obvious.
---
Thank you. I don't know why everyone assumes we all play on PS
---
Words are cheaper than bugfixing. Woulnd't get my hopes up.
---
People have already said how to get rid of that in this thread, but I thought that I would chime in and say that you can find a decontamination shower in that same building, just past the lockers immediately when you walk in. 
---
At least, that's what the wiki says.
---
This is true for all terminals.
---
Good to know!
---
Hanging up my building gear...
---
Deathstar unfinished
---
Same this just happened to me
---
Yep especially if you are not bloodied.
---
I would try unequipping your defensive perks and armor pieces and the swap servers then re-equip everything. Usually that will solve most issues at a patch.
---
Anyone playing this game hoping for real pvp stopped playing a year ago. 
---
Now the only players that steal are new players that don’t understand that it flags you on the map.
---
The only people who hunt down flagged players are level 400+ people who live and breath this game. 
---
So you have a level 15 making an honest mistake while exploring and learning the game get pummeled by a level 400 slob who self identifies as a white knight. 
---
What is worth stealing anyway, 5 purified water? 20 steel scrap? Nothing.
---
You’re right, it would. But I really do like the convenience of having the water well right at my camp, and being able to use it without getting rid of rads. 😬😬
---
It's cool. I probably should have worded it 'dedicated interior walls' but sadly I'm sleepy and not type or think gud rite now.
---
You can fix that with an .ini edit, find ipresentinterval=1 under the display section of the prefs.ini, change that to 0. if you cant find it then add it in.  It would normally be in documents/my games/fallout 76&gt;fallout76prefs.ini, it may be somewhere else for gamepass or named project76.
---
The game was made by junior devs in the first place
---
It’s was in the Atomic shop
---
Not my internet.  Never had a problem before the update.  Why would I buy  ps4 pro when the ps5 is coming out?  Many are experiencing this after the update but hey go ahead and be a smartass.
---
Seconding that switching wall types is too important to take away like this. At one point it was the only way you could get wall papered windows.  Build wall, apply wallpaper, change to window.
---
It was in the Atomic shop
---
I heard the brotherhood was looking for some 2 gazillion stable flux.
---
This, ive never wanted to be bloodied. So i changed my crap tse vangaurd build to half unyeilding half vangaurd junkie and its well worth it. Theres not a place in this game im not hesitant about going now.
---
249! Lol...no
---
Sell it for 200 in your vendor. Its funny how many times someone buys it
---
I don't think a counter is that hard to program in and honestly I don't care either way. I donate to hopefully gets plans i want but mostly for easy caps beyond the normal 1400 vendor limit. Its a bonus that I get easy stuff like booze and grenades to sell for that 1400, too. I just give all the extra stimpacks, radaway, and purified water to low levels. I do wish the loot pool was better but I'm making the most of it. I don't plan on donating any plastic though, i need that for ammo. May or may not do cork.
---
Edit; forgot to add that I kind if hope we get the rewards regardless of what the community does. I want that collectron.
---
That wasn’t the point. The point was that it’s a functional mod that works surprisingly well. The fact that it was created by 2 people means that this technology should’ve been implemented by Bethesda in the same smooth way as they did.
---
Yeah I figured this out immediately. Like I understand the hate for it but it's not *as* bad as people think. The conversion rates could be better though
---
I'm confused...so Life-giver is not working now?
---
I just managed to roll a weightless SS chest today. No mods on it.
---
Still breaks Chameleon. WTF, can't fix this in over three months.
---
I had quite a bit of success by updating my outdated video driver and DirectX 12.  Something else latest patch the de-optimized the game for a lot of setups and settings.  it seems to be most noticeable with events that spawn numerous meet piles to loot but I also noticed some crashes to desktop when jumping off high places or sprinting extremely fast between mob heavy areas.  I don't have a suggestion for console players unfortunately but if you are on a PC I strongly suggest getting the latest if not even the beta version of directx and your video card drivers.  While I'm not calling this a 100% magic fix I was able to complete guided meditation radiation rumble and line in the sand after doing this whereas I had multiple crashes to desktop on those events prior.
---
why is every event after spooky night kinda lame
---
It was used to dupe Strangler Heart power armor. Which I grinded the Vault for, then they wipe it along with my entire account and all my atoms. After taking another £11.99 while I was suspended.
---
Lmao, sure man. Let's get 28 people in a peer to peer connection that these guys and see what happens to the game world. You guys are stupid asf if you really think they're gonna pull a funtional multiplayer fallout that works flawlessly.
---
It’s a shit sandwich and we all have to take a big bite.
---
Glad he didnt know about fireproof
---
It nearly worked too.
---
Thanks man. Honestly, the more I scrolled down, the more depressed I was becoming. This post lightened my spirits a bit.
---
After level 50 if you're still hooked and start picking up extra perks that you don't want to use all the time but are still very helpful (like green thumb, scrapper, hard bargain, travel agent, picklock, hack, weight reduction, etc) download and install perk loadout manager. It is life changing.
---
I absolutely loved Witcher 3 and all the DLCs. Awesome open world architechture. Great story lines. No house building but lots of crafting armor, weapons, etc. I played through at least 5 times to get different endings.
---
Im not sure but i do know thete is an npc in the wayward that tells you if you get on the bad side of either the raiders or settlers to go talk to her.
---
It's sad. How BGS can be "okay" with a huge chunk of their player base leaving after an update is beyond me. There needs to be more done than just a "thank you for letting us know." There needs to be action.
---
I kinda wish if you bought stuff with your scrip then a portion of your spending could partially restore your scrip availability (kinda like caps at npc vendors)
---
It's absolutely terrible. I just tried farming flux at white springs on my private server and lost two nukes after I entered the zone , frame rates dropped then crashed. Didn't even get the first flux mat. Think I'm gonna have to take a break from 76 for a bit. I'd be pretty happy if they just undid this patch.
---
Or you can just pull it out of the scrap box! The subscription is mostly so people can gather enough resources.
---
It's a feature in a FREE season pass. Something most games make you pay for. In case you missed put the past couple years, there's these games now that call themselves games as a service which means you psy for content which we are essentially getting for free as an add on to the base game. So yes in turn that makes this free. I'm saddened I have to explain this to so many people.
---
Yes call me a shill after claiming I keep detracting ftpm the point. It helps drive your argument so much closer to the point.
---
It might just be selective reading but I don't think you've asked anything. You've made statements, to which I've given an opinion o  that I felt deserved it and if I've honestly missed any of your questions I must've felt I didn't need to justify them with an answer so sorry for your luck.
---
Ew. Have you played the outer worlds? No thanks.
---
"fixes"
---
I believe it.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Going off Obsidian’s recent title, they’re not THAT great either, The Outer Worlds was a bland, overhyped game, plus I think most of the people who worked on NV have since moved on from the company.
---
My best friend is stuck in the 80's.  
---
He loves everything about it. He loves computers. Gaming not so much. He loves technology and we're both the same age so seeing how games have evolved from what we grew up on to now is just mind-blowing.  
---
Even the newer Diablo isn't all that interesting. FF7 was one of two games I got when the PS1 came out. It is turned based and I got SO SICK of most of the sounds and music.  
---
If you can freeze time by waiting your turn in effect it's exploiting the sytem. Fallout 76 and the FF7 Remake have revamped it to slow-down time which I'm good with. I prefer 3D large open world games that are largely story driven.  
---
I'm not knocking them overall but for me those types are not for me. I've never heard of that game and I'm very picky about what I do play.
---
I’ve tried both those but nothing
---
here is a link to the tracker, if its like the last event it will only update once a day and it will not update on the weekend
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Not if I launch all of them first.
---
Canceled my first after their utter refusal to help out with lost score and their disgustingly rude support system that just auto locks every cry for help!
---
Can someone TLDR this for me?
---
:D
---
An atlas like event except where we get to build our own version of vault city, populated by our old vault 76 robot pals, with vault theme rewards for completion would be very cool. 
---
Especially if there were a few npcs who come and visited now and then, like roaming vault dweller traders, or people like the guy at Foundation who says he came from another vault.
---
The cherry would be if they give us a terminal at that town that lets us select a repeatable quest, with the ability to use our items/scrip/treasury notes/caps as rewards, for fellow dwellers to take on.
---
Yes, though from what i've seen it's quite difficult to go hostile with a faction, but i've read if you get to the point of being hostiles with someone you can acquire reputation with someone on the Wayward.
---
IMO, while little changed about the gameplay with Wastelanders, there was a massive change in *context.*  There is now an expectation that we, the Dwellers of Vault 76, are meant to help whoever comes along.  No matter how condescending, no matter how rude, no matter how much we'd rather tell them to get out.  We're stuck doing the scavenging and the hard work while they sit on their butts.
---
It was funny when the only other signs of life were defective robots.  They were stuck in a logic loop, tirelessly carrying out their original programming long after the world had ended.  That was fine.
---
But when actual people are making demands of us, the expectation that we *will* help, and the inability to tell them off, drastically changes our role in the game from being self-motivated happy-go-luckys to appeasing snobby NPCs.  And it gets to the point where I don't *want* to help these people.
---
Paige was the original example.  Ward came next.  Now we have Russell Dorsey who scoffs over how "clean" we are, as if we haven't done any "real work" or "real survival" in the wasteland, unlike himself, of course.  Now go and fetch me 125,000,000 units of Scrap Steel please!
---
Yeah, no.
---
&gt; It's a feature in a FREE season pass.
---
Which is a part of the game we paid for. The mental gymnastics are amusing. Just because other games do it and charge for it, this one half assing it for free is ok? Most actually don't charge you for the Season Pass as you once again wrongly claim. Most have a Premium Season Pass they charge for that provides EXTRA rewards. It's a feature of the game we paid for and it's expected to either work or to be fixed like they fix shit they find important because it costs them money - in days because it is costing us time and, potentially atoms which have a $ equivalent. This type of mentality is exactly why this shit happens.
---
&gt; I keep detracting
---
You keep excusing it with false claims and things like "this was unintentional". Your disclaimer is just as meaningless as saying you keep detracting from it after you spent the last several hours digging for excuses for all the issues above.
---
&gt; might just be selective reading
---
Might just be. *Official* Bethesda community managers on here seem to suffer from it too... Should reread maybe since I won't bother repeating myself for someone who has such a deep case of selective reading.
---
&gt; if I've honestly missed any of your questions I must've felt I didn't need to justify them
---
Should be the new Bethesda motto.
---
Yes, it's worth it. Nice pull!
---
Please do yourself a favor and [listen to the genuine, hard-working people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEewLWDpscA) that pour their hearts into games like The Outer Worlds. They actually sound like they know what they're doing when it comes to making a game.
---
Sure, The Outer Worlds may not have been a cult classic like Fallout, but it is still far more flawless than Fallout 76.
---
Side note: Budgets for The Outer Worlds was smaller than the Budget for games like Fallout 4 or 76. If you take this into consideration, you would see that they have done a better job on a game like TOW than Bethesda did on 76.
---
Swing and a misssss.
---
Hark!  A single downvote!  I wonder whom it could be?!  Haha
---
They lie so much, I'd be surprised if Fallout 76 even existed.
---
You must be playing on computer because on console, I haven't a clue as to what you're talking about with weapons broken and quests broken.  Any game will have glitches and at this point largely anything that was wrong from beta has been fixed.  Sure there are new bugs but it sounds like you never played any Bethesda game ever because...there are always glitches and bugs.  Still bugs in Fallout 4 today.  The game is completely playable and very solid.  Complaining about every little thing just drains the joy out of life.  Relax a bit, and focus on what you do have not what you don't.  You'll enjoy everything a bit more. 😊
---
Usually under Wall decorations
---
Canonically would they
---
Last thing I remember
---
I was running for the door
---
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
---
"Relax," said Bethesda 
---
"We are programmed to receive
---
You can check-out any time you like
---
But you can never leave!"
---
I tried but nothing. Is it cause I have starched genes equipped?
---
No not even Obsidian. This ip needs to bought by the borderlands guys or the farcry guys
---
My opinion, they could probably keep track of it if they wanted to, but they use faulty code and they know it, and they also know that half of us are cynical bastards who don’t think they’d bother to count, so it’s pretty even odds.    
---
I also don’t care whether they count or not, as it’s almost guaranteed that we’ll get the global rewards either way, and to me, it’s at least something else to do, no more monotonous or pointless than any of the other stuff I routinely do in the game.
---
Yeah but that's as much a bethesda game as new Vegas is
---
Mine stuck after doing it again and another reload.
---
I think the A squad is working on different titles.  If I had to guess it's likely a skeleton crew at this point holding things together, but just barely. 
---
I feel bad for the people in the trenches tbh.
---
I’ve had it where I got the loot from the queen, so I obviously did my damage, but no rewards for the event. I figured it was because I was in the area already and didn’t “join event” from the map. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
There is a laundry list of bullshit that they prioritized over pertinent issues that have existed for months. There are dedicated players that do comprehensive lists of bugs for the devs, but barely any of it is attended to and instead they do things like break camp building for no reason instead. Quit boot licking. They can be criticized for a shit job.
---
I only use Marsupial and barely play in a team that shares Strange in Numbers, this is definitely caused by server lag.
---
Yeah I usually don't see anyone with a bounty over 5 or 10.  The level 400's really go after them? Do they drop more than Junk or something or is it just because of the white night syndrome you talked about?
---
The brotherhood of steel can suck it.  I’m interested only in the Brotherhood of Moose.
---
u/TheMangyMoose82 can back me up as I can’t shoot well.
---
I don't mean to overhype TOW, I mean to compare the polish between the games. Let's not forget how transparent Obsidian was when it came to who was developing the game and where they came from.
---
The progress wouldn't stay zero they cant afford to have events like this fail it would just automatically complete to avoid the ensuring pr nightmare
---
Wall decor. Scroll right when you're on one that looks similar in style to see all the options.
---
Somehow they felt the bar needed moved underground, lol.
---
Yep in the same boat. 
---
I think we are sinking buddy.....
---
What? The brotherhood is present? Where how? Why? I’m just a casual player, I don’t even get half the lore in 76, please explain more?
---
Yeah. Enterning buildings or during fast travel. I'll notice its will go black and the 76 logo in the corner isn't spinning. I have to quit and restart. For me,  it happens only a once, maybe twice per session.
---
I prefer my full hp build but I'm currently bloodied for the season (XP grind). So go back to full hp if I want to use this then?
---
TL;DR:
---
u/Aldosaur2a8 feels that Bethesda is not giving Fallout the attention that it deserves, and indeed requires, in order to be as good as other Bethesda titles such as The Elder Scrolls. He also noted the lack of communication between players and developers, and that Bethesda's priorities in terms of what to adjust in updates seems to be a bit off.
---
Yea like they did fine in that game but its so...unoriginal and boring. I'll definitely say they can write some good stories but the world sucked, the main story sucked, and it felt just as dated as any Bethesda game. They met the standard to be a fallout successor but didn't exceed at all
---
&gt;The mental gymnastics are amusing.
---
This can go both ways. Just because you don't understand it. I don't understand why you're so pent up about this. And once again we can enjoy free shit and also give constructive criticism, which I still have yet to see from you.
---
At this point in time this is devolving to finger pointing and since we're never gonna agree I think we're done here. You believe what you want you and I'll do the same. Enjoy your day.
---
Not yet, but someday. There is currently an event at atlas observatory where we donate scrap for crap rewards. Check the last patch update notes or inside the vault for info.
---
Sure, anyone. Just anyone that has the time and resources and love for this game better than BGS has now.
---
Only other thing I can think of trying is a nuka grape bro.
---
Someone doesn’t have a livin lover.
---
I don’t need to listen to them. I’ve played the game. It’s a boring talking simulator with overly simplified crafting mechanics and a linear story (Albeit some good choice and consequence). No thank you.
---
I did as well and I only got 5 plans, granted I did get 3 I didn't know yet but still.
---
There's 2 versions of campfire tales one where the boss come to the beginning 1 where there's 3 waves  It has always been like this
---
I just want displays/weapon racks/magazine racks/bobble heads not to double dip into my camp budget AND stash.
---
I noticed this almost right away after servers came up. Nerd Rage range or full HP. I get chunked even by like lv10 super mutant's potshots. A lv50 scorched melee slapping me with their hand, with 3\* Blocker, 1 shots me at Nerd Rage HP.
---
I do have Adrenal Reaction.  
---
I do not have Life Giver or Rejuvenated. 
---
I have around 300 DR/ER. But it feels like I'm running around in my undies.
---
Aye
---
You're not wrong there. I do have sympathy for the skeleton crew that has to work on this, but we can't oversee the fact that BGS fails to care about them, let alone the game.
---
Ward tells me “finally somebody here to help” which means he is about to tell you to go and search for it. Just accept the mission. And then immediately turn it in. It still works, it just us to say the original conversation first.
---
what do you mean? it was always like that, you either get a boss or 3 waves of bugs. I think it depends if you find all items that belong to the missing guy
---
Brains are a Boost to INT, the stew is a static XP bonus. they do work together.
---
lmao pulled out the magic word 'bootlicking'. This is a video game with software development. Look at the comments above yours for some insight beyond pissing and shitting all over the walls when something you perceive to be a simple fix is not actually a simple fix.
---
Have you been paying attention at all?!  Yikes dude.
---
How Bethesda of them! They just screw everyone over and don't care.
---
I just want a fallout with the modern feel of fps and performance to match.
---
That’s what I’m say n
---
&gt; This can go both ways.
---
Hardly. I've sourced every claim I made here while you've used false information to create excuses. No mental gymnastics on my end, just facts. Can you say the same after claiming they had several double SCORE events to make up for all the lost ranks or those weekly challenges you say they added?
---
&gt; constructive criticism
---
If you think I haven't provided any, I have nothing else to add. There's plenty in my comments here, you just chose to ignore it. For more, see my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4435t/bethesda_this_patch_is_embarrassing) on the front page. Plenty of other things in the 500- something comments there if the post itself is not enough for you. Enjoy the rest of your evening.
---
LIES!  YOU STEAL YOUR FICTION FROM REALITY!  lol
---
Man, I sooo wish there were an 'oops!' emote. Better yet, an 'oops' emote that drops whatever legendary you got.
---
I have a gause shotty that normally rubberband and just cripple gouls. Which is perfect for Radium runs. But, my load out was off and it one shot them. And it was only a few of us, so couldn't swap out without dead miners. 
---
Fuck.  I hated all of it. But was super limited on time and had to complete the event.
---
An event would be great. For example, I missed Fasnacht last year, so this spring was the first time I had seen the event. I ran it as much as I could, so much that my daughter (she's 5) and I started singing the music. It was great fun to see everyone act like we were in the parade, everyone put on a silly outfit and mask because "that's just what you do!" It kind of typified the FO76 "event" and the silly spirit of this game. Granted, BOS is one of the less ridiculous parts of the FO lore, but I would definitely be into an event that supported the Atlas goal (I haven't explored that, yet).
---
So, if a person continues to take advantage of you, is pointing that out 'being negative'?
---
If so, most abusers would love to date you.  Lol
---
Yep.  This has been one of the worst patches yet.
---
For the past 1yr I've only ever had the boss show up, this is the first I've had the 3 ways. Thank you for the information
---
I’m actually doing research on this now because I’m pretty sure I can file a lawsuit against these cunts and win, but I’m not 100% certain.
---
The steel part of the event is only three days long. Half way there means we are exactly on track.
---
In games like borderlands where it can  take days to get the perfect roll I can see duping an item for a friend cause the games are all pve but games that put people at an advantage its not right.
---
If you're still playing Fallout 76, Bethesda knows there is literally nothing they can do that will cause you to stop playing. They could send your Social Security Number to ISIS and you'd still be like "Ohhhh, if they do this 7 or 8 more times I will STRONGLY consider playing slightly less!!"
---
Ok, so have you experienced this mythical 'crashing servers solely due to wall stacking'?
---
Honest question.
---
Wait wait wait ... if I take some purified water from someone else’s purifier at their C.A.M.P. I get a bounty??!??
---
You will get the collectron regardless if you donate or not, unless they don't get to the goal, which i doubt
---
I mean at least they said something
---
“dRaIn ThE mIrE!!!”
---
Die and respawn.
---
The camo SS UA looks cool with sturdy camo combat armor. Just need the linings to work.
---
A lot of builder babies as of late.
---
Wouldn't we all? I pre-ordered 76, I've loved every other fallout. But this? Bethasda what is this?
---
I wouldn't say you need FO1st unless you love hoarding unnecessary amounts of junk. I did the whole story before it was an option and had no problems. So wait on FO1st.
---
Yeah I am still stuck on the quest, have been running around doing other stuff but I really want this quest done D:
---
I never saw the point of it as underoos. I hope the steel dawn fatigues looks like this because aside.from some clipping I'm digging them as an outfit. 
---
I buffed up my officers suit for the perks and just had the fatigues in my stash as a collectable until last Tuesday.
---
So wasteland dogfights? It would make sense.
---
Well Bethesda did copy fallout 1st from eso... So Bethesda is well aware what eso is doing.
---
No problem
---
I didn't download the update with the legendary run to save space for other games on my ps4. Now I see I did the right thing
---
Yep.
---
My mans just probably tryna defend his base from intruders not understanding how the game works
---
Hold your back button, it is like the PA exit.
---
Man.. So many people comment shit like this. It just goes to show how little they actually know about Bethesda and this game. It's not even Bethesda Gaming Studios that's working on this game... It's Bethesda Austin (formerly Battlecry), a smaller studio Bethesda bought to work exclusively on this game. Outside of producing, Todd Howard doesn't have anything to do with this games direction, it's Jeff Gardiner baby.
---
It will be patched because it saves you time. They want more time spent in game. It’s better for their analytics. So if they can make you spend an extra 5-15 minutes trying to find items with x in them, that is good in their book
---
Exit your PA. Open it's "bag" and manually remove the fusion core. Put in a different one. Get back in and see if it's moving normally again.
---
Yea but there would be like high level creatures in there only. Cus if ya got a deathclaw and a dog, ain't no one gonna pick the dog. So like a deathclaw, behemoth, Mirelurk queen, megasloth, etc
---
yes, they do not trust you with the good stuff until you become drinking buddies. even if your drink of choice is milk
---
Whose even buying the shit anyways? Theres so little of it that ive always had more atoms then I know what to do with since the beggining. Only thing I can think of is some people must feel compelled to get literally every single item that pops up in the store cause otherwise idk how people can blow through so much, god forbid if they also are getting atom from 1st
---
If you're talking about the visual effect a re-log will fix it.
---
What we wanted: score for completing challenges.
---
What we got: challenges auto completed and our cries for help locked and ignored!
---
If they are friends, they can join without a invite. If they are not friends and just joining,well thats for sure a issue they want fix.
---
Wait that actually worked
---
Shits are ass.
---
Half the time, I leave workshop resources unlocked. Only together, can we survive the wasteland. Just stop killing my fuggin cows
---
No because Bethesda will auto-complete them regardless
---
You’d better.
---
The only winning move is to not play.
---
Playing on PS4. Score autocomplete happened on all platforms. Ra-ra quest is broken and has been for some time. Now they also broke the main quest by trying to fix something that wasn't even an issue in the first place. Plenty of threads on the sub talking about both. As for weaponsz YouTube is your friend. Angry Turtle is a good source for all the broken weapons and other broken shit in this game.
---
Paying for something and expecting it to work as advertised is a basic expectation and this type of apologist mindset is unfortunately why it keeps happening. Between score autocomplete happening for a month and other issues above, this is not a product that works as advertised.
---
Sure, people might just drop plans that you don't have there.
---
Pulling/crafting a ‘god roll’ weapon , will make you think twice about your build. I know, I never thought I would try out bloodied. But after a MONTH of crafting gauss miniguns and getting total trash, I finally hit a bloodied ffr lvc gauss minigun. So I switched my build around, and haven’t looked back.
---
It's bethesda
---
If you find out you can ask your lawyer to look in to finding others to join your lawsuit, because I would bet they have been doing it to others. Bethesda cares about the money right now and will do anything to get it.
---
Because they know that people have an abundance of them so they purposely withheld them to make you grind more.
---
Yeah, it's been happening for awhile... Since the the update that added in the mutation sound effects.
---
Those originally sacked have been sacked again.
---
I’ve had that with uranium forever now.   Can’t mine uranium anywhere.
---
They can with atlas freeze the entire region like a new ice age
---
Milk builds strong bones.
---
People tend to use them as defenses against wild creatures that may attack but turrets do the job far better so cant rlly understand either. It only bugs me cus your character makes the "UGHHH" sounds when they step on it and my controller vibrates lol
---
I've seeing a lot of posts about this one - it might just be bugged unfortunately
---
Didn't even know you could get cows, or that people could kill them...
---
Agreed!   Thank you for your help.
---
The only other benefit I can think of is Molly the bartender sells you the Pepperoni Roll recipe when you become neighborly.
---
Yes! I'm not sure if it's just a gauss thing, but my god, it takes SO long to kill anything. Super Mutants have \~500 HP, my Gauss Shotgon does \~850 damage, and it takes 12+ shots to kill one. Even in VATS, if it's not a "magic" gun, it takes 3-4 hits. It's so weird.
---
What was it before?
---
Yes and now in profile it looks like it's magically floating by a single contact point on your upper back. 
---
It's like they're aliens who've never actually seen a hoomun bahkpahk.
---
As far as I know I’m the only one who’s had their account wiped. It’s like I’m in no mans land here, because they’re usually either permanent or been left alone completely with the occasional inventory wipe.
---
This gets posted every day. Every. Day. They are not listening.
---
Yeah, also when the pc version dropped it took about -3 days for data minors to discover and spawn (on a live server)both human npcs and the big ass air ship I can’t spell that begins with a “P” . Later backed up by a “ama” with devs, “the brotherhood is watching Appalachia very closely..”   duh
---
Theres too many "Top priorities"
---
I get you have to say a baby blanket statement
---
But the game has had so many defenders
---
Those stalwart ones
---
Are now deciding to leave
---
You dont have much life left in this experiment
---
I havent seen anything about it recently, so I'm really thankful for you telling me! :)
---
Why would a car be a generator?
---
I did not know this. It was a friend and I didn't care just didn't know this could happen. I thought they had to be invited?
---
I am happy with improved repair kits, just go to kill the queen when she spawns and shell give a few improved repair kits, i have almost 100 and thats with me using em constantly. i actually even use them if my weapons fall below 100% sometimes just to reduce my weight without trashing anything
---
Yeah I don’t think anyone here actually knew what you were talking about. I’ve had this happen before.
---
What do you mean how do they track it? They just put a flag to record every time someone donates. It’s not that difficult.
---
The scorchbeats was not surprising either. A lot of people play this game.
---
Or all the other shit that was advertised with FO 1st like persistent workshops and free stuff.
---
Hah, the BoS can eat my BoASS 
---
I think what we are looking at is the finished product of a AAA coordinating a major patch/update via zoom. And boy was it yucky.
---
Overwatch regularly has unlisted changes on their PTS. I know this because for some friggen reason I get notifications every damned time it happens and some gaming website does a piece on it.
---
Meanwhile, this change was meant to stop some exploits. If bethesda suddenly said "Hey, in a month, we're going to fix this exploit," the result would be a month of garbage as people use the exploit as hard as they can before it is fixed. I could not care less... except apparently this was a server lag exploit, which is no bueno.
---
Most of the vehicles are power by small fusion engines. Hints why they proceed a shroom cloud after blowing up and give you +1 rads.
---
I’m glad you responded to us about this issue, but there are so many more that need to be addressed. We love this game and the community, but both those things will dissipate if the overwhelming issues are not addressed. I hope over the next few months or so, the development team will get to fix up this game and provide an exceptional Fallout 76 experience for everyone.
---
The game is poorly designed and underdeveloped. That's the core problem. Hard core fans are going to over compensate whenever the game pleases them, and when the game messes up, they quite justifiably flip out. 
---
The best solution would have been to let FO76 die on launch instead of humoring them with whales buying from the atom shop and 1st subscriptions being filled.
---
Yeah I have B2525 of every gun so I never went after the guns you can get with gold. And I have a full set of the ss Unyielding armor with buttressed. I was hoping for ultra light or pocketed or something useful to spend the gold on. And I still gave a ton of notes. Hence the 5k gold burning a hole in my pocket. My agility is 39 😃
---
Thanks !
---
I’m legit stuck somewhere I don’t want to be because of scorchbeast attacks, but I can’t move because I’m not reverting back to box building. Fuck me.
---
So you trashed a noobs camp because he used defenses that you don't approve of? Class act.
---
It's a *really* fun game until the endgame grind. I played for hours every night for months and only recently stopped because I got all the stuff I was gridding for and there's not really anything to use it on. You've got a while til you get bored of it and hopefully by then Fractured Steel delivers on its promise the same way Wastelanders did

The walls thing still works. New method of doing it now. You're lucky you got plans with those box present reskined reward bs. I opened 15 and no plans. Just aid items I didn't need or want. Mostly alcohol. Yes, reward system is terrible. Grind and grind and get nothing close to what you want. Everyone on reddit claims to hate dupers but I guarantee 99% of all legacy weapons in game are because of duping. This game is designed to be pay to win instead of play to win. I also gave up on it and stopped playing till I joined a community of players like you. Dedicate their time to helping other players and becoming a "God of the wastes." Having that makes it better to play this game. Dont tap out just yet. I recommend you do what I did. Take a break and come back to it later and see how you feel. If that dont help, at least we can hope FO5 will be better, if we ever get it.
---
I cry
---
I'm level 193 with 2\* Unyielding Marine Armor on and I'm getting 1 and 2 shot from level 15 ghouls... Doesn't feel like a perk card issue, but who knows with this game really.
---
Imagine if we actually got a free skin every time the monthly one came out and something to make us stand out more since we pay for this shit. Or even a bigger camp budget!
---
A lot of asshats who can't help but spout their shit on other people's posts.
---
No this is happening in 2\* Unyielding Marine armor
---
I would like to see this list.
---
How do I join and get thing next to name
---
Lol?
---
I am truly weeping. I was so looking forward to that.
---
And it would make base in the middle of nowhere feel more atmospheric with have a beat up car giving off power and not that fancy dancy fusion generator we got now
---
Do we have any real proof Todd Howard is in fact a real person
---
Whoever is responsible for the game needs help and it's very clear to us now, if it wasn't already clear before.
---
&gt; bigger camp budget 
---
Which was also promised as part of private servers.
---
Let's have every player adopt this mentality, and see!
---
Very true. (Also how get cool enclave sticker next to ur name)
---
they sell unique stuff. specifically camp item plans you can't find elsewhere.
---
Depends on if you get the box of insect pins or missing campers backpack. The girl or her brother, both have themed endings
---
it's worse than you think. a lot of the positive reception wastelanders got in this sub was just wishful thinking, people hoping that's what was going to put Fo76 back (or just) on track, finally.
---
yes, we get a lot of "first time player here" posts but those people usually don't last. and the posts throwing a fit and quitting the game are just as common. truth is, both this sub and the market one are getting deader by the day. I've mentioned this before but even youtubers seem burned out of the game. you can only push mobile monetization so far before people start noticing your bs.
---
Fo76 is a game of "what straw is going to break the camel's back?" these past weeks I've seen multiple people who used to staunchly defend whatever F up on Bethesda's part, gradually grow jaded of the game. or outright quit, at least this week.
---
Maybe congregate this building gripe into a single or fewer posts instead of littering this entire subs feed with echoing horseshit.
---
Yeah, I pretty much recognized this 'event' for what it was as soon as they announced it.  Not going to pay a sub fee, ever, especially for just a reskinned beret/scrapbot and perv sales/xp weekends.  With nothing new but added grinds since wastelanders 4 months ago, this one is just more busywork filler to hide the lack of actual content, and keep people logging in past the atom store daily.  I'll just let the timer expire and see what happens, as they can post whatever progress they want, and won't let it 'fail' because it will make them look even worse.
---
I dont think its a bug. I tried to mod it at the work bench
---
This game has its own genre, and it has so much potential. But they’ve fucked up waaaayyyyy too hard to get anywhere with it now. I’m seriously considering boycotting Fallout 5 when it comes out (if it comes out), because I live and breathe Fallout. I know Washington DC better than my home town. I know the Commonwealth better than my house. But I hate Bethesda with a passion. They have taken money for Fallout 1st while I was suspended, then the very next day I get my account back, with zero atoms, and all five characters wiped from existence.
---
I'll probobly post it sometime
---
Ten bucks they programmed that bar to just progress with time and that it is in no way linked to actual donations.
---
True, but as much backlash as I saw on here, I'm just surprised there's that much.
---
Even if I couldn't sell them I'd love to be able to buy some to turn into ultracite ones
---
I'm somewhat confused, it shows me that you can get 500 points for 150 rounds of .44 and you can get 5,000 for 1500 rounds of .44 which are correct.
---
Anything worth looking into?
---
I said f it a couple months after launch. It took lockdown to make me give it a second go.
---
the donor's boxes seem to have the same list of items as the mole miner pales, minus the taxidermy heads
---
That's pretty funny when most of the posts before were about how to improve a broken game.
---
It seems like a pretty bad power source even assuming the fusion core in it still had power, but I can't deny that does sound like it would look cool.
---
To be fair, I'll keep playing, but I've just canceled my FO1st.
---
I refuse to pay for something, and keep paying for something that the devs clearly don't care about or actually play themselves.
---
It's a shame because it really does have a lot of potential if only it was about the game, and not about how much money can be made from poorly applied 'patches' and useless new grinds that have no other use than to deplete peoples resources and make the ocd people like me, feel inclined to grind more to restock.
---
Until then Bethesda, you can have my scorn, not my cash.
---
Hope its bankable.
---
Edit: a word.
---
You whooshed the point. There’s no issue removing items from scrap boxes. It’s to drain the build up people have collected.
---
Example: Player Bob uses an average of 10% of his overall gathered resources in a month. So he cancels sub after month 1. He will not need to resub for about 9 more months when he might run out of most items he has stored. This event will help to drain that. Player Bob is now out of stuff. Gotta resub to refill that Scrapbox. This was the point
---
Ya, it was a let down for me too I was waiting for a couple more atx items to drop pull off the some cool effects now just a pipe dream 😒
---
My points are at 13 but with the full set I’m at 39 something also. It’s fun. I don’t have b2525 I got a bloodied fixer with 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage which I’ll take it. Only other one she gave me was a zealot and a mutants. And I only learned plan a month ago. And the night I got my fixer she must’ve been High because I got a bloodied lever action first then the fixer and I walked away scrapped last gun I could to get one more roll and for a bloodied Tesla. Freaking nuts. But I feel you, that’s why I ended buying all t65. I was going to buy both thorn and solar but I figured I would never use it and I’m already a hoarder. I have my character carrying 580 almost all the time and that’s what I can carry without being over encumbered and my stash is full. I have just started transferring stuff to my beta character my sons and a new character and they all are at 700 carry weight. Lol so I’m trying to cut down so I can for one use the t65 when need be without being encumbered and also so I can get some of my strength points over to luck. I’m at 15 strength 11 perception 4 endurance 2 charisma 3 intelligence 13 agility and 8 luck. But wanna put more over to luck and perception. But anyways sorry got off topic, I wish they would add better stuff to it. They added dumb ghillie skin and then that ugly camo in atom shop. They need to show more love with the skins and mods to this stuff
---
Only if you picked the lock. If it's unlocked and you took the water, there's no problem.
---
I donated 1k and that's probably going to be it. I'd rather give steel/upgrade player's weapons than donate to Todd's Black Hole Vortex. 150k steel is better used for the players.
---
Private server?
---
I just wish there was literally ANY warning that collosal problem wasn't coming in 21. That was literally the only reason I still had the game downloaded, and the ammo converter fix that was laughable. Plus the whole debacle with removing double sided walls. Plus the problem with not adding the mods for ss armour. Plus class freak breaking. I guess people are mad that it took a month for Bethesda to break the game even further, while literally rerereleasing the same rewards that nobody wants. Even the pails had some fun plans, the boxes are barren of any brotherhood related content.
---
Bug. Never had it happen to me. Usually stuff respans after 10-15 min. Only time the robots attack is if I accidently hit one. May have had a bullet go stray and catch one
---
I probably won't take anything, nothing really catches my eye and I already have 2 collectrons 😂
---
Op I’m with you. I sunk 100’s of hours into the previous titles. I’ve literally been treating the legendary run like a job, I log on and knock out the dailies as quickly as possible and sign out. I’m not enjoying the game anymore but for some reason I keep playing in hopes it will be great one day.
---
Be fair. That was pure exploit to get a valued commodity (screws) for almost nothing. I am bummed too about it, but if anything I am shocked it took this long.
---
I didn’t know it was an exploit. The reason I’m not happy about the fix is that I like to make realistic looking house-style camps, for myself and for anyone who asks - I liked to make interior walls and wallpaper both sides. I had no idea that it was used to cause lag or anything but, assuming that everybody is pissed over it because “it’s just what the haters do” is kinda odd in my opinion
---
Yes, lol is fine
---
?? It’s a bug that it got changed from under armor to apparel.
---
I see your point I just feel like they could've done more then a stash box with it.. it would also be cool if have to change the cores on fusion generators anyways sense you gotta have one to make it.
---
rad resistance? but even with something like SS you'll still take a ton of rad damage from things like ghouls.
---
it's mostly just for environmental and consumable rads, really. or just use lead belly I guess.
---
Anyone else had their mouse scroll stop working? It only controls volume now????
---
I’m going to assume you got the right perks but what type of armor you use?
---
There’s be a few work arounds developed here and on YouTube that may work for you. Know you have at least one fan looking forward to what you pull off in contempt towards Bethesda 🙂
---
Ok
---
Are you on a private server?
---
Why... are you being downvoted? Is this a trap?
---
PSA: nobody listen to this goober
---
It literally says "sell 100x: +5000 points for -1500 rounds"
---
New method for dule wallpapers. They tried to "fix" it but failed at that too. Video is on youtube. Search camp glitch after patch 21.
---
You mean the legendary effect? Unyielding
---
But what successess have you achieved by being solely aggressive about complaining?  Getting the information across to get things changed is important but it's how you go about it.  Rage filled aggression isn't going to get the grass to grow any faster.  Just make sure the lawn is watered.  That's why honestly it's better to appreciate what you have and get the information that needs to be changed out without causing all this unnecessary stress. 😀
---
Damn that's very impressive
---
Yea my bad but that’s weird you shouldn’t be that bad what type of bloodied heavy,commando,etc?
---
I don't think one wasteland has been implemented yet. if anything, that implies servers are dead enough that no high level players have been hanging around those places.
---
I’m so sorry that after your consumption of a nukashine, this is where you’ve ended up!
---
Whew. I had thought I was being a good guest, drinking offered water. :-)
---
Bethesda, thanks for addressing this.  This isn't just double walls though.  Being able to change walls into doors and back allowed for the freedom to make round buildings and custom stairs made from roof pieces. Its a shame some people had to lag out the server and ruin it for us passionate builders. Considering how upset people are, I do hope these fixes are very, very, high on your priority list.
---
I was hoping it'd be a trap that exploded when damaged.
---
You say gently used but I guarantee you slammed your fist into that terminal keyboard multiple times out of frustration.
---
Commando. I use a deathclaw and a power fist.
---
they forgot to actually add it.
---
Fine, if it's broken play something else till it's fixed. If you're unhappy with Bethesda, cancel your 1st membership but spare the sub with the same repetitive "cancelled" posts. I think we all get it. You builder's are not happy and want your glitched walls back
---
Ghouls and gamma guns are the bane of the bloodied. You can do rad resist mods and perks, lead belly, aqua(dweller), things like that, but running bloodied is all about micromanaging your radiation very carefully.
---
It's not saying sell 100 rounds, it saying sell 100 times the increment, which is 15. 
---
Sell 1x = sell 15 rounds
---
Sell 10x = sell 150 rounds
---
Sell 100x = sell 1500 rounds
---
I don't know why I bothered to type this out since it says the exact same thing in the game but fuck.
---
Someone commented on the Patch 21 post stating they were missing as well
---
The best thing I can say to use for rads then I’ll say is rad shields
---
They must love the BoS and hate the BoM. 
---
Or it is just Reddit.
---
They talked about adding a set world to private where only you can get on it, if they haven't already. I haven't been on my private world in a very long time. But ya only those on your friends list can join. Hope they add more private world features but not sure what there doing anymore. Hope this helps.
---
The game is suffering pretty badly. Surprised it took this long
---
Does Rad X stack? I only have 7 Radshield, Rad X however I have around 200 lol
---
My friend got this bundle, I'll have to ask him when he gets on.
---
EDIT: His is invisible and the icon above his head is invisible too
---
Exactly this
---
You just walked up to some guys camp and destroyed it because you didn't like his punji board?
---
I have a hard time getting into some of the convos some time as I have only been playing since Feb of this year, I like it enough to think about playing while I’m at work...for now. I was not around for the Christmas event and the mole miner event was garbage. I know players don’t like to hear it, but they have to keep things new for the new player base they have and continue to get...so yes while you are getting the same plans...someone who just started playing a month ago is getting them for the 1st time...
---
Call me greedy, but I need the screws and ballistic fiber, I got my collectron oand junk collector lock picked and received no notice. Is it a vicinity thing? Like my camps by the Crater but I’m at Foundation it doesn’t trigger?
---
I would recommend Venezuela then my friend
---
Carry some toxic goo... When you get too much radiation eat a diluted radaway... If it pulls you out of Nerd Rage drink a toxic goo. But honestly I wouldn't worry too much about being at exactly 20% health. As long as your in the range you'll be fine.
---
I’ll turn them to diluted since they stop mutations for like a min and I’m not sure if they stack actually
---
The perfect response
---
Nope
---
I've killed many raiders before and lost no reputation with them and now I'm trying to get their rep up again, idk if the same applies to the settlers :/
---
Anyone else get stuck and not able to back out? I converted some 10mm, but when I tried to leave the machine I got stuck in an endless loop back and forth between selecting ammo or cashing it in.
---
Do you see any aggression in my post? Whether you do or not, I've inarguably achieved plenty by making it. Considering the 500 - something comments of discussion this spurred which brought it to the front page to ensure that Bethesda employees present on this sub see it. My post along with others voicing our concerns is what prompted a response from Bethesda here that is now pinned on top. Without these posts, we'd never get any reaction.
---
Besides all that, what aggression? Am I insulting anyone or promoting violence? I listed issues and asked questions about those issues. Without any insults or aggression.  Don't mistake frustration for aggresion. Sorry if expecting something I paid for to work and asking questions about its broken features and reasons for it is aggressive to you.
---
Nope. For scrapping, grab Scrapper under Intelligence. For bulking junk, there's nothing to help.
---
Also, Super Duper doesn't affect making Booze or anything that requires Legendary Modules.
---
Food, ammo, serums, clothing, regular weapons and armor, chems and all that are good to go however.
---
Edited for clarity.
---
Goober, it been awhile since I’ve heard that one. 😂
---
Life’s gotten crazy lately, thanks for running with me!
---
Ya the new update across the board has really screwed things up. I would try every no and again to see if it works.
---
Much appreciated. I'm going to poke around to see what I can find 😁 👍
---
Thanks for the post
---
No, I'm completely out of the loop.
---
id love to pelt ferals and scorched with snowballs with grenades tucked inside of them
---
But they are not asking much, i completed it in a day just playing like i always do. The only difference was that i used the scap perk and I put the  "tag for search" thing. Is a weekly quest, you don't need to do all in minutes. is more fun the long way, imo
---
Yeah, tell me about it. I thought I was going to kill it in that awol event, kept getting killed by the bots...
---
If they’re on display like cases they can not be taken
---
And a lot of them have.
---
Stop complaining and pay for fallout 1st. If we just keep giving them mone, they will totally fix everything and give us a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
A high level player dropped a weapon for me while I was visiting his camp the other day, so yeah, anything dropped can be picked up. If you put stuff in displays they’re safe though
---
Yep, you are correct, I dumbassed this one, thanks for the reply, will delete... goober was a little harsh though :/
---
El Oh El.... since when do you care about doing anything correctly? What a joke - Bethesda should have just stuck with making single-player games.
---
A moose once bit my sister.
---
Dropped items show as bags and can't be used for display and people can pick up dropped items.
---
Funny thing is when I was crafting my 80 legs for unyielding secret service I would have super duper on being I just got done cooking and it would pop like it happened. But never received anything. Just thought it was funny it would always pop in left corner like oh it worked but nothing.
---
Items transferred to a display or other can't be touched by others. Items dropped in the world are fear game for all to touch.
---
I came here looking to see if anyone has the same problem the menu is fine till I click press any button to play
---
bro what?
---
tl;dr
---
"How do we get people to resub for infinite stash room?"
---
"I got it! We get them to get rid of some of that junk they are stashing!"
---
"Out*standing*!"
---
\-\_-
---
Someone else mentioned trying to drain duped materials from the game. At least that goal makes some sort of sense. I don't know why the hell anyone would dupe steel, third most common thing in the game aside from ghouls and stupid, but who knows, maybe they felt like adding a second step to duping all that ammo.
---
I was under the impression that additional weapons were added to the loot pool. Star rankings were unchanged.
---
Hey, uh... where do I get brotherhood power armor and a fixer?
---
Dude your comment had me dying, I always kill them while at vending machines and never thought one about the owners😂
---
You’re gonna look at the pretty opening scenery and like it!
---
Oof, yeah. Those anti-armor popshots from a Gutsy are terrible to any build, but all it takes is one to connect for a bloodied and it’s all over.
---
Lol,can't be mad at a great, witty reply.  Take your upvote, ya filthy animal. Hehe
---
That would also be dope.
---
I've never seen Todd and me at the same time... holy shit, am I Todd?!?
---
Well I know I thought rankings where upped to and I’m guessing juice head thought so to but I have no proof as I have not recurved any from any events I’ve done. Not even one stars
---
If the BoS want steel - we should be able to donate Black Titanium to the Enclave... those tincan boyscouts can suck it
---
I’m so often one of the first one to try to give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt. But this. I don’t even know what to say. It’s like they just don’t give a shit.
---
There was no glitching involved. Did you even read the post or look at the pictures before commenting? Spare the rest of us from your shitty comments.
---
What the fuck makes you think your happiness is more important than the rest of ours? If you don't want to read these posts go to another sub or don't even bother opening ones like this. I and other people who are upset with the updates can post whatever we want. You don't have to read them.
---
Haha cheers
---
I think this is part of the "stop taking so much screen real estate" fix.
---
TLDR; Ran Radiation Rumble one shotting everything because my perk cards weren't what I was used to. Felt like absolute shit one shotting legendaries, but there was only three of us, and they were eating the miners. 
---
It all happened so fast.
---
Take it up with u/bit-by-a-moose.
---
Yeah, I've been working on a SS set too. I had it on for the first bunch like you. I'd check every time it proced, but nada as well. Others have said it works, but no one can prove it. I gave up adding it...sick of my hopes being dashed. That's what real life is for.
---
This is actually annoying I just wanna play
---
Kill thirteen SBQs, 50 legendary enemies and flip the bird to Ward. Then navigate to user flairs on this sub and take your pick.
---
Ha. Yeah I mean it doesn’t matter really. I’m level 520 and can solo the Queen in 4 mags with the B2525 Fixer. I’m at the end of my Fallout 76 time. I’ve been hanging on forever because I love the Fallout franchise but there’s really not much left for me. Maybe try and solo her with my B2525 10mm pistol. 😃 Cheers tho mate...
---
Ain’t that the bloody truth
---
Destiny’s subreddit is basically the same. It seems to be the bane of “live service” games- they get people addicted, but then fail to keep up the expected amount of product to satisfy the junkies.
---
This is my first month of FO1st and FO76. I've had so much damn fun with this community and honestly with the game itself, but I can't find any reason to pay for this kind of service monthly (and no I don't think limited stash space is enjoyable so it's either this or nothing). 
---
If this current product (with FO1st benefits included, of course) was sold for $60, at this state, I'd honestly say it's a fair deal. I've had way more fun this month than with many other games I've paid $60+ for. But this is 2 years into the lifecycle of this game, and this is what they have to show for it?
---
From what I see its months of bugs, lackluster patches, zero communication with the community, despised changes, and neglected fixes.
---
Ffs, didn't a modder make perk loadouts? And they are asking FO1st subs to wait how many months to get a basic feature in the game after 2+ years?
---
How do they think sprinkling tiny bullshit patches each month is worth a  subscription? Do they honestly value themselves so highly they think this is worth a high quality MMO sub fee?
---
I'm sitting on this sub trying to find a reason to add another month, but this company does everything it can to ensure it's not worth it. It's both absurd and hilarious.
---
Nah,  I'd rather play a whole game as BoS or Free States.
---
I was going to stream rebuilding my camp this weekend with the new stuff I snagged in the Atom shop but now, now I'm going to have the exact same camp forever because I don't want to lose my nice wallpaper. Of all the fucking things to mess with.
---
Flip ward the bird?
---
Same. Stressful long ass day at work. Got a little bit of time before bed. And this.
---
Ah ok that makes sense. I’ll take it. And good to know I should just hop off and on until it’s doable, I guess.
---
I too though this was a good way to do perk card and gear testing but there are definitely things that don't function the same in pvp as they do in pve.  Bethesda might have just removed lone wanderer functioning vs player damage.
---
Now that I'm not certain about. I've had a locked extractor picked and seen nothing, but there have been times when I've seen a notification that someone has become wanted and they're nowhere near my camp or me. A data miner could probably determine the exact mechanics.
---
It literally crashes everytime i get passed the click any button to play and can’t play code mw cause the dam updates are so huge this sucks
---
Now he is gonna be like: so i got this nice square box! :) *Spends 30 minutes to find a way to attach power wires without clipping it through walls*.
---
I wonder if he was made aware of this update, or if they massively screwed and limited him with it too..
---
And if there were better rewards - it would have worked.
---
The whole game is embarrassing.
---
Please don't,  that's my favorite part of the map.
---
The original quest also had players collect wolf blood and molerat blood. Can she collect either of those?
---
The other commenter took care of the flair for you, which I assume was your primary purpose here.
---
If joining was another goal, however, just proceed through your primary journey. I’m sure it will take you where you wish to go.
---
We thank you for contributing toward the group rewards, but my god, donating that much steel was just dumb.
---
A punji board across the door isn’t a trap camp it’s someone trying to defend their camp
---
I've gotten multiple 1* and a decent amount of 2* but i havent gotten any 3* as of yet but im not complaining i got a 2* F25 Fixer hopefully it's dependent on difficulty cause all my 2* have been gotten through SBQ (not her body)
---
No kidding? When was that?
---
Who in their right minds *wouldn’t* donate steel? In one hour I can get you 2-4K Steel.
---
He’s actually full of shit cause you can’t destroy camps unless engaged in pvp, just like most of these stories on this subreddit are full of shit.
---
She collected both of em :/
---
Sorry but this sub is shared by the Fallout 76 community for news, updates and suggestions. It's not r/76camps where all gather to bitch about the same topic.
---
“Flipping the bird” is a phrase that means raising your fist towards someone so that the back of your fist is facing them. From there, raise your middle finger at any speed that you see fit, and then run as fast as your tiny little legs will carry you.
---
And Ward is an NPC at Foundation, if that’s the part that confused you.
---
How Can Todd Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real
---
🖕👨🏻‍🌾
---
yeah, realised that too after patch 21. really annoying.
---
We would be more than willing to assist you in a relationship of mutual respect.......Live Free Brother!
---
Oh i thought they meant flip ward the bird as in flip a person named ward the bird im dumb
---
Haha. Awesome. Thanks for sharing
---
U should scrip all 3 or those weapons. Punji board &gt; your weapons -_-
---
What happens if we don't make it? Update is delayed? Certain quests aren't added?
---
Wait, was losing photos a bug for all of us on xbox or does it just vary for all platforms? I haven't played for about a month and I'm waiting for better content but that sounds like a bug I'd want to avoid since I love me photos as well
---
Have a friend engage in pvp with you to make this quicker
---
You can do it once per day, its a daily quest. For me it triggers when it resets, dont have to check the terminal or anything.
---
I’m in. How do we label our camp?
---
Facepalm.
---
I was just thinking that it was a shame I couldn’t pick up and put down scrap in my stash. I completely forgot about bulking since it’s useless half the time!
---
Also, the vault Tec packages are also an option, but I wouldn’t recommend those since they actually do compress what they have inside.
---
Was she twice shy?
---
I'm going to build my own base with blackjack and hookers.
---
I haven't seen others really complain about losing photos so I assume I was just unlucky but it doesn't appear losing photos is common. I've submitted a bug report but know nothing will happen and the photos are lost forever
---
I feel that bethesda stopped caring a long time ago, you know? They have all the other games they want to launch, starfield, TES6 and they made this game just to try to raise money from us fans to finance other games, after they saw how shitty things were, they tried to fix it with wastelanders, it improved very little and now they just gave up, handed it over. The ammunition converter is a JOKE even after the feedback is boring and almost unusable, this daily limit of rewards is another thing that makes me pissed, I can't take the time to wait a week to exchange so much legendary item, I have 3 characters only to load legendary items why the hell I don't change all this shit right away and try to get a decent legendary one in the legendary choice. I'm tired people, I go in to play because that's it or the anxiety because I don't have money to buy other games and my computer is really bad, I made a million moves to run this game and I feel like an idiot to have to make more effort to like him, it's just too sad.
---
It would make more sense than a stash
---
Well, I could see them at least securing the silos to keep others out of them. But you are right, I can't imagine them launching the nukes themselves.
---
Although... they could use parts from the nukes to add to Liberty Prime's payload.
---
I read that with MODUS' voice. Heckling goosebumps, man
---
I think I'll buy that now,  I'm a bit disappointed with the rainwater catcher. Thanks for the info!
---
Thought is was like 9-10k at some station vendors?  If it’s the same one, good luck, I have yet to see it in a player vendor.  I had to drop some caps so I finally broke down, maxed my charisma and bought it.
---
Same for me.
---
probably not since it's not a random drop and the only way to grab it is minimum 8k caps from a vendor
---
You’re welcome! 😬
---
Thats how every season in any game works, you get dailys, weeklys and other challeges to gain exp.
---
Then you must be new here because like I said most of the posts are about how to improve the game. Why don't you roll on over to r/roastme where you can hate on people and they'll value your opinion.
---
Just an observation;  There are a lot of intelligent comments and impulse posts in regards to the update and wastelands.  I joined this community as a spectator to learn from the vets.  I'm by no means new to the game but there are always things we learn from other no matter how seasoned you may be. 
---
Unfortunately Bethesda has realed unpopular expansions and updates that have not been received well amongst the community.  I personally have never had Facebook, insta, Twitter etc. because the toxicity.  This community is turning into that kind of platform.  I understand the frustration as you have poured so much time and energy into a virtual world.  The problem I see is players use the platform to voice every little whiny detail they wish to see changed or implemented.  If I were Bethesda I would be desensitized to player opinion because it is impossible to please everyone and fulfill every request.  
---
By no means am I defending the slop on their part but in my humble opinion it is obvious to me that they are passionate about 76 by the detail that made all of us fall in love with the game in the first place.  Yes we all have things we wish could be changed but the vast majority with negative posts are overreacting to things like losing double sided wallpaper.  If you have already become bored with the game and the content has become dry then please boycott so the rest of us don't have to listen to your entitled griping.  The game is far from broken but needs some serious attention to quality much like what was implemented when the game was developed.  Online fallout is uncharted territory for Bethesda, think about how serious your complaint is before you decide to demand it and threaten with a boycott.  Then maybe as a community you will collectively start to see changes in their perception of what is posted and how valid your requests may be.
---
I play pretty much every day around about this time. Add me if you want some pointers, just finished for today though.
---
PSN: Shablagoobuddy
---
Weapons and armour are locked to your level so don't get excited when you see a drop for a good weapon right away. Ammo is at a premium at the start of the game, have a melee option to switch too.
---
The community in general is very helpful, you'll likely find higher level players will gift you items so try and avoid your private server
---
To be fair I like their cosmetic options and I like the tent feature/scrap box. Is it ridiculous? Yeah. Am I regretting the purchase? Not really. I guess I'm part of the problem.
---
is it actually broken though? I need to double check but I think it's just visual.
---
Cheers for that. Ever since I first heard about banning dupes, I always got paranoid about that account, especially since I'm just finishing up final achievements on Xbox
---
Dont do it (-_-) dont participate in lazy game design with shit rewards
---
Another dopey kid crying for attention because Bethesda lol nobody cares you don't matter
---
There are other games that let you pick up the previous day's dailies if you miss a log-in though. I would much prefer that.
---
We can’t be talking to Devs on here...probably the Public Relations department, with the Marketing pricks looking over their shoulders.
---
I don’t know why we think this is how we can influence change in the game, the game is rigged and it’s to keep us PAYING
---
It's just visual.
---
Not necessarily
---
FYI, floating camps are lame...
---
Nope.
---
My BE .50 cal doesn't feed itself.
---
Fuck the brotherhood and fuck this "event"
---
Hell make it a fallout 1st feature and they can at least add some more value to it.
---
I mean New Vegas does not happen for another 170ish years in game. I don't think the NCR is even a established yet.
---
Lol congrats you want a banana sticker?
---
Apparently Fireproof is kind of broken and only sometimes works.
---
upon logging in i realized that the train i bought for my camp i can no longer build on as everything built on it is considered floating. not only that but when i stand on my train i am teleported. why would you sell me an open train that i cant actually use
---
Excuse me, I want to be banned instead for duping the junk
---
Yeah I'm an adult who spent money from my job on this game. I'm not sitting on my ass on unemployment lurking reddit posts to hate on people. But you do you
---
I am, and that would be fantastic. My IGN is VerasGunn
---
Yes. I love nanners
---
I didn't stick with you
---
legit  - they'd be better off not touching a damn thing.
---
Yea, it's only a visual bug. If you look at your specials before/after they are the same.
---
You're not an adult you're a whiney piglet, quit crying and just quit already
---
Yet another opinion no one cares about. *slow clap*
---
i mean they should reward players that log in everyday, but i agree i would like to see a system when you can for example refresh your daily challenges for caps or even atoms so players that cant play everyday can keep up
---
originally i was able to build conduit on it and put turrets on it. now i cant. why was this done? some of us play just so our camp is cool. bethesda can never get it right.
---
I added you I won't be able to play till tomorrow afternoon
---
Unyielding armor have been having some bugs that are not tied to this class freak thingy.
---
We just don't get the cosmetic rewards.
---
I don't have an underground base, but what's unfair about it? How does it hurt anybody?
---
If it's because hostile NPCs can't attack it, who cares? I used marsupial jump to scale a mountain and build my base up there (no exploits) and no creatures can attack my base.
---
That is a diffrent bug. One you describe is a seperate one from this class freak thing.
---
What's your timezone? I'll be on in like 20 hours lol
---
Eastern
---
Sounds like someone isnt reciting their loyalty oath. Do we need to send some people to your house?
---
Daym, that's a shame. Back to the water pump then 🤷‍♀️
---
This has been the struggle since launch. They struggled to even fix the weight of bobbypins. That's why the 500 "bethesda please" suggestion threads for new features are very tiresome
---
I am, but it's through gritted teeth. If your guys show up tell them to help themselves to the punch bowl.......
---
I can see it now “we’ve seen the reports that double sided walls now seem to count as mole rat spawn zones and we are looking into it, meanwhile please enjoy this new atom store merch!”
---
Literally just figured this out today.
---
I thought it was only me. Something else always seems to break with updates
---
Is it not showing the expected impact in the pip-boy? It seems food/water is dropping faster, but I've been mistaken before.
---
Oh yeah how dare they think we'll buy black versions of guns! *puts clandestine gauss minigun in pocket*
---
I could be mistaken here but I don't believe you get Ultracite mod plans from Heart of the Enemy. They only drop from the SBQ.
---
you're screaming at the void. they clearly don't give a \*. so long the game is profitable, that's what they set out to do anyway. maximum profit with the least amount of money invested.
---
canceling Fo1st ain't gonna do nothing by the way. if numbers get low enough, they'll just shut the servers down.
---
plus this sub is full of apologists. even though some of them seem to be growing tired of this bs.
---
Appalachia belongs to 76.
---
We walked out of the vault with our fists and party hats and conquered it. We took on the scorched. We defeated the queen. We CURED the plague. We unearthed the U.S. gold reserves and established the foundation for a new society. All of the other factions were decimated by the scorched. B.o.S., Crater, Foundation, and the Overseer can all get f***ed.
---
It's showing the debuffs without Class Freak in your mutations list, but actual Mutations work just as normal.
---
Yeah cuz all the pts players like angryturtle just wanna make vids (mostly false or old information anyways) for views nobody tests shit lol
---
The icon is gone but other players near you can still see you lifting the axe, half broken i guess.
---
I love the game but I really wish it was on a better engine. I don’t think the devs are incompetent, it’s just the engine and the way fallout games are built is outdated and needs a real overhaul, it just *doesn’t* work
---
I gave up after five times of that same problem
---
Tf does cork do
---
Yeah, honestly it is shameful how much Beth developers and decision makers suck at make a functional game, even when they been working on it for over a year!
---
the engine is bad, true. but the nexus is proof that competent people can do amazing things with it. Fo76 is proof of the opposite.
---
I mean, decals, am I right? how do they work.
---
The prototype bit is just a paint so yes learning the Prototype X-01 blueprint is learning the X-01 blueprint. You can get mods from the production wing vendor in the Whitespring bunker.
---
Read the patch 21 release notes. I've never gotten ultracite mods from HoTE, they drop from SBQ.
---
not really, steel isnt hard to come by, and people have had scrap boxes for some time now.
---
good lord you people are dense. 44k steel is fuck all, its literally everywhere.
---
I usually have to switch between characters a couple times on my private server to have them spawn correctly
---
Ahhh dude honestly, like I said in the post and in another comment, I love the game but I can’t understand how they thought it was a great idea to build an online Fallout game on this engine as it is. Like the game is really fun but bleh 🤣
---
It’s so disheartening to have a critical shot miss. That’s the exact opposite of what’s supposed to happen
---
Up until this week's patch, you could re-trigger heart of the enemy by going to scribe grant's terminal in ft. Defiance for unlimited quest rewards
---
I was really angry about all of this, until I found out three key pieces of information:  
---
1 ) bug reports on PTS are often ignored by devs (eg. Fasnacht critter spawning issues)  
---
2 ) Testers on the PTS aren't provided a change-log or running patch notes, so they do 't specifically know what to test  
---
3 ) The double-wall camp nerf was on the PTS, but people didn't report it because they thought it was "just some weird glitch"  
---
The third one literally broke me. Imagine not reporting a potential bug on a PTS cos you "just thought it was a weird glitch". We are getting pounded in every orifice and from every direction.
---
(I'm on console, or else I would put my money where my mouth is and be going balls-deep into that PTS.)
---
I got so frustrated, ended up playing red dead online instead.
---
Fertilizer, toilet paper roll, flamer fuel
---
can you make the train a non floating object?
---
Time is it right now?
---
I would pick it up.
---
Yeah i dont think Bethesda will be able to pull a No Man's Sky kind of comeback with 76 unfortunately. I feel that too with the memorization of locations of DC in fallout 3, went to Washington with my parents and my younger brother asked where "the water purifying" was happening, hah. Why did they suspend your account by the by?
---
Same thing just happened to me
---
11:17pm
---
You could add a new type of wall called interior that allow wallpaper on both-sides.
---
"Such a buggy waste"(that has so much potential)
---
That usually happens to me when I join halfway through the fight but deal enough damage to get loot.
---
Ye for sure but then again it’s a whole different kettle of fish making a mod that isn’t synced with anyone else on the server and strictly only visible to you and something that has to be synced perfectly for everybody I suppose. 
---
It’s probably a combination of the engine and poor management and vast inexperience in developing for games like this. 
---
That being said if we justify the price on how much i’ve gotten out of it, it’s been a bargain... but “games as service” models have a higher expectation for having post launch legs.
---
Yep I gave up just gonna watch the simpsons
---
I'll be on about 8pm your time. Best advice to give you is to do the main quest and take your time with it.
---
Duping, and yes I deserved banning. But they took my money for a subscription I physically couldn’t use, them reinstated my account and took away the atoms I had just paid for at the same time.
---
The wallpaper stuff is a gripe for me but the rest of the downgrade was so shit that it doesn’t really matter
---
At first I downvoted but I came back to upvote bc I realized that you're kinda right. Don't get me wrong, love playing 76. But it does seem kinda lazy or last minute. 
---
I remember there being a similar thing in the past...fuzzy on the details but I think it was based on number of scorched killed. That has some more excitement to it than collecting steel and what not. 
---
Also the rewards did kinda let me down. The people who have been asking for BoS stuff are probably thrilled to get some new things from playing &gt; the ATX. But I'm sure there have been rewards in the past I loved but others probably hated. So I can be cool with the rewards.
---
Ok I was going to do that anyway
---
Don’t contact Bethesda they don’t care
---
It gets kinda ridiculous with cap limit it basically forces you to make a mule character or spend caps on shit you’ll never use/need
---
I never have tp lol
---
That’s all well and good but if caps are infinite nobody is going to want to sell a decent roll. Not a god a roll. A decent roll. For caps.
---
I didn't notice any difference on my laptop. I've always had to limit the frame rate to 144. It would spike on the map and legendary run board to 400-500 making the cursor (I play with an Xbox controller) fly at hypersonic speeds.
---
Yeee, said in a previous comment how I ain’t gonna be really shouting WhAt a wAste oF mOney because hey i’ve gotten like 500 hours out of this game, even with all its flaws. 
---
However, it’s really disrespectful to the playerbase, new and old, to constantly fuck shit up (for a lack of better words 😂). 
---
 
---
Pie in the sky hope is the new hardware maybe will come with a massive game overhaul but there’s more chance of me winning the lottery.
---
upon logging in i realized that the train i bought for my camp i can no longer build on as everything built on it is considered floating. not only that but when i stand on my train i am teleported. why would you sell me an open train that i cant actually use.
---
Would you get the joke?
---
A lot of people try to rush through it to get to the end game stuff but that's such a waste. I'm jealous you get to experience it for the first time. Anyway, enjoy man and I'll maybe catch you tomorrow.
---
I just got it. 😂😂😂👌
---
I'll give you the netcode, it's amazing gamebryo even runs online as it is. plus I have no experience coding online software myself.
---
but a lot of the mishaps in this game have absolutely nothing to do with the fact it's online. it's just sheer, unabridged incompetence.
---
No TP during this time of crisis? You poor poor fool....lol
---
Hopefully I will but all these angry threads are almost making me regret my purchase lol
---
yeah but I tried storing some of the other things the bos needs and its weighing a lot lmao
---
I am on Xbox and my quest is doing same thing is there a way to have them reset quest on Xbox?
---
Tip: take a crossbow. Quiet, powerful, relatively accurate. Always my go-to when taking down creatures.
---
The real fall of Fallout 76 came years later: it wasn’t all the memorabilia that got botched that people bitched about or even just a membership to the MMO, it was straight up the crap performance and some of the cloying cash grab updates in the last year.
---
It’s like they either do great with Wastelanders updates and new story and REAL content or they capitally fuck it up by squeezing the players for an extra $100 a month.
---
Don't worry, even if no one donated we'd still 'hit the target'.  
---
Bethesda wouldn't  admit to low player participation.
---
Congrats!  It's a milestone for every player
---
You sound stupid.
---
I'm just enjoying whatever time is left, and hoping that someone is so enamoured by what *could have been* that they go off and make it. At least something good could maybe grow out of the ashes of this raging dumpster fire haha..
---
  
---
I think your hope has a higher chance than mine though 😂
---
just checked, same...sigh.
---
Uh... Yes?
---
The whales are crying out Bethesda, Can you not hear their call? Change the course of 76 before they swim to less buggie excrement infested waters!
---
there are ways to mitigate damage to the point it's basically 0. like spamming nuka quantums.
---
having said that, I'm not sure they fixed all the godmode glitches. plus if you're on PC there's always the possibility it's a hack.
---
RIP Fo76 
---
"Welcome to our sandbox. Here's your sand" *hands you sandwich bag of dirt* have fun
---
Trust me, starting out at this point at the very least you will get your money's worth. The anger is more about stuff not getting fixed when they say it will or stuff they add in either being something noone asked for or completely useless.
---
You should PM this to the Bethesda account. I feel like they're more likely to read it that way. You did a great job surmising the discontent and feeling unvalued so many of us are experiencing.
---
Damn that sucks, you can really get some epic photos with all the options that are given and for a bug to come along and just wipe it all away, especially since launch. I got some photos from launch and probably wouldn't know what to do if they just vanished into nothing. In any case these shitty bugs shouldn't be happening at the large rate that they pop up for a triple A developer and more of us will just stop playing the longer this continues. Best of luck to yah in the future
---
You're right. I totally overlooked that aspect. I just wanted to call someone out for being a dick, didn't realize he was a liar about being a dick. 😤
---
I already did, I suggest everyone should so Bethesda can hurry up and fix the damn thang.. but yea pimp I did the same shit that's y I made this post cuz I thot it was only me too since I couldn't really find anything after searching and them walkthroughs made it look stupid simple 😂😂
---
I feel this deeply. I am sorry it’s happened to you too.
---
I stopped playing months ago because of all the extra BS that keeps being added. Hopefully we have new games to look forward to. Best wishes man.
---
Ok I hope so
---
Unfortunately so far based on posts I read it seems that Patch 21 broke An Ounce of Prevention quest most likely thanks to that change they made to the quest listed in the patch notes and it broke some instance quest areas this includes areas used by the Cheating Death and From Russian with Lev quests.
---
You can either hope for Bethesda to push for a hot fix in the next couple of days or your looking at waiting 4-6 weeks from now when they release patch 22 in September for a fix.
---
This is par for the course for Bethesda at this point. I would be perfectly fine if everyone left and they shut it down. This is clearly not the same company that put out Skyrim, or even ESO. My experience with FO76 has been mediocre since day one and then they had the balls to ban my account, which I hadn't played in months, in the middle of a goddamn pandemic no less. Yes, the taste in my mouth is bitter.
---
God Bless You.
---
And God Bless the Enclave and America.
---
Sorry about that I knew I should have payed attention to ELA class
---
I have seen it become very laggy when some idiot puts their tent where it prevents the event from working correctly and they all drop in front of the stupid signal thing. 
---
Like play the F’in event. Otherwise it is like shooting fish in a barrel and not fun at all
---
Yeah that's a pretty good idea. Why is there even a limit in the first place?
---
Nah, then they'll just turn VATS off for 8 weeks.
---
They keep on taking one step forward and ten steps backwards. It's made me start playing other games because of my disappointment and it's rough playing this game since almost release and seeing how little has changed with their attitudes towards the game and community.
---
I personally am not sided with the enclave but those bastards in their fancy tin cans can shove that steel right up their *** im not giving that shit eating grinned beret wearing fanboy any more of my steel for literally nothing you dont need that much to repair  the observatory let alone build like 6 prydwens.
---
Yeah just to add my two cents at least on.my end I can confirm that this is a visual bug and the perk is working as intended for me.
---
Lol glad
---
We’ll know if this is true when it comes to the cork challenge. It’s one of the rarest junk items in the game so it would take an actual push from the community to hit that ludicrous target. If they announce that we made it I will be *very* sceptical of it.
---
It's okay I have pre war money
---
The players doing the nuclear bombardments are members of the Enclave.  You habe to be in order to access the nukes
---
Fair, I ain’t the most knowledgable about this type of stuff but even as an outsider it’s easy to see the difference in polish in these types of games. It’s just a shame because even with it’s pathetic bugs and clunkyness I love it, so imagine how great it could be.
---
Cool concept but how would you go about doing this?
---
And Bethesda wasn’t? They released a NoClip documentary of the making of 76 after announce with all of the project leads from BGS Maryland and Austin front and center. Just because we hadn’t really heard much about who Jeff Gardiner, Nate Purkeypile, or Chris Mayer were from previous projects, doesn’t mean they weren’t up front about who the main minds were behind the game.
---
&gt; I have not recurved any from any events I’ve done. Not even one stars
---
That's because the patch notes didn't say "You'll get legendaries for every event/daily now." Read the patch notes again:
---
&gt; Legendary Loot: Daily Quests and Events have had ***their legendary loot rewards*** updated to include additional items, like The Fixer, Secret Service Armor, and others, so long as you’ve learned the Plans for them.
---
I've highlighted the important bit. "Their legendary loot rewards", in other words, the quest needs to already award you a legendary at the end of it, for this change to even be noticeable. Any event/daily that doesn't have a legendary reward at the end of it, is unchanged.
---
For what its worth I canceled 2 FO1st subs too.
---
So... like it is now?
---
I appreciate the alliteration. How about, rewards for events are a S.N.O.R.E
---
Ohhhhhh snap
---
For sure, shame i’m a console player so I wouldn’t be able to experience any mod people made like this or whatever. Even as I complain i’m currently grinding my score 🤣. 
---
That’s the point really though, I love the game as it is, like a bad relationship really but it could be so much better
---
The only creatures that spawned were Grafton monsters. I had to tag each of them then wait for the fire to kill them while hoping no one found me
---
You're quite the optimist.
---
My hero!
---
You sir are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
This isn’t the point you’re trying to make, but not having deep pocketed available led to trying out stabilized, and it’s almost like cheating with such a motionless reticule.
---
Lets play the punching cars till they explode fireproof roulette edition
---
No and the patch notes said pocketed and deep pocketed for SS limbs was available but it's not.
---
I haven’t seen a crossbow spawn in about a week
---
Maybe YOU don't understand how it works. If I bought the game a week ago, the game would've been bought with these features included. They are base features of the game, not some additional blessing that has to be downloaded separately.  And they are either just shit or plain broken. Just because someone bought the game earlier doesn't mean they didn't pay for these additions just as someone who bought the game with them released or should somehow be grateful for the broken mess that they are.
---
I feel you. All the zealots are saying its business as usual and I am over here screaming about the dip in player numbers and my experience feeling barren and my friends list getting smaller and smaller.
---
We also had a mailboxes too, outside our doors, so we could drop off messages and gifts to our friends when they weren't in their quarters. Hmmmm.
---
Just give it to me.  I'll happily spend the less than 2 seconds it takes to convert thousands of rounds of ammunition into something I want.  Or better yet, turn it into completely weightless points to store until I need it.
---
You mean like how would the event start? Or did u mean something else?
---
If someone one shots a legendary in the forest and no one is around to bitch, who gives a flying lvl 2 molerat's ass
---
Ohh sorry i misunderstood the post.
---
I'd suggest just cancelling playing FO76. So many better games from better companies out there.
---
Whining about 2 scrip.
---
Sure.
---
I guess if that tops your list, it's a damn near perfect game.
---
Yeah why isn’t that a SCORE challenge, blow up xx amount of cars
---
Well, we do get 'paid' for the scrap. Granted, the rewards are lacklustre and really should've been BoS themed gear, but it isn't for free. I'm doing it for the easy Caps when the vendors run out.
---
The power armor disposes of it.
---
You have all the other blood samples, too, I’m guessing? Just to clarify.
---
The Responders and Raiders (Crater Raiders, not Rose) questlines are currently bugged and uncompletable. The only thing you can do is wait until the next patch. Probably in a month's time, or they might hotfix it sooner than that if enough people complain about it.
---
That is pretty sleazy of them no doubt there for taking away the atoms if they accepted money and won't let you refund. Just makes me wonder about if someone says another player is cheating and the other might get reprimanded without evidence, or anyone who just gets banned and account wiped by mistake. You cant get that stuff back and I wouldn't play after something like that occurs for damn sure. What sucks is that it's most likely happened to other players already
---
Really it's broken? I Haven't noticed any changes scorched scream at me and I take no damage same with explosions so I don't know
---
Hell yeah!
---
That was super duper doing it's job at best. Sprinkle a little bit of Bethesdas lack of quality testing and blammo. Infinite screws if you knew.
---
Is it still cheaper for making say, 2mm ec? Which uses lead and steel.
---
Are you sure that Pacifist Mode is not on? Check your game settings.
---
But it really isn't though.
---
I am not sure it could have been stated any clearer or better....bravo fellow dweller  +1
---
High ranked players buy your water? They don’t steal it from unlocked purifiers like the rest of us?
---
Oh ok it's all good. Tbh after I posted it I contemplate if anything I said makes sense lol.
---
My first pvp encounter played out exactly like this (other player was immune to all damage), and I kept dying to them instantly.
---
I've never bothered with pvp since. Seems like a waste of time.
---
Not going to happen there's a Holotape that you can listen to if you finish the Brotherhood of Steel quest line were this very though of using the Missile Silos was the topic of the conversation and Maxon immediately exploded on the now dead leader of the Brotherhood of Steel in Appalachia and order her not to use them because they are the cause of the current state of the world and it was a very dumb of her to even start entertaining the idea of using the Missile Silos to fight the Scorchbeasts.
---
They have absolutely no proof I duped, but I did deserve punishing. They should have either made it permanent or did an inventory wipe, but they took it way too far.
---
This is Fallout not Shopping Simulator.  Not his problem you couldn't find anything to buy and anyone of any level can camp anywhere, you do not make the rules. You could have equipped Light Footed and sneaked across the punji boards or simply gone elsewhere instead of throwing a childish temper tantrum.  I don't believe that you destroyed his camp like that, got to be in pvp first or using exploits.  Punji boards are still useful as legitimate defenses, they can be placed around the most attacked items and help the lazy ass turrets realize they have a job to do.  Also they can be camp decor for some of us.
---
Yeah messed up a camp today because of this.
---
Logged off. Maybe tomorrow, too grumpy today.
---
Why are people downvoting this thread?
---
Yeah if I could put it on the ceiling I would actually use these new space wallpapers. That would be dopeeee
---
I did about the same. I still have a bunch. I'll never use it. A few people I know did nearly 100k.
---
Also good luck with posting something positive about something you enjoy. You get nuked for it here.
---
What a kerfuffle!
---
Save the plan and don't learn it so you can get more off of her and sell them
---
Sure is. I'll take it when I see it lol.
---
Take a workshop that had a lvl 3 locked container. Most of the time, you own the workshop, you can access the items. Example. The safe at the red rocket mega-stop
---
I just used it for the first time since the patch. Can't help but wonder, like with everything else, if any of the people who designed the rework actually tried using it.
---
It could be worse. It could be patch 16 again
---
It's steel.  I probably let 100k rot on the ground just during double XP weekend.  I get over 1k just doing a Uranium Fever for meat.  May as well turn it in rather than dump it on the ground.
---
We are currently in negotiations with ATOM Shop personnel.....will have apparel and C.A.M.P. items available shortly.......Please subscribe to our new publication "Outside the Vault" for updates!
---
That a part of the problem, as I was never prompted to get the others in my quest log, it only told me to get ghoul blood. when I tried to pick up the other samples despite this fact it would not let me take the samples from the dead animals.
---
I didn't mean to imply people using the wall glitches for their camps are trying to lag out the game. From my understanding, patching a certain lag exploit somehow meant they had to patch wall glitches. I dunno why or how they are related if I'm honest but Bethesda commented on why they patched how walls worked in their forms.
---
The it's popular to hate this game, whilst holding some truth, is meant as a joke. By far more people are angry over how this effects camp building than people who just spreads hate for this game.
---
Just make a double-sided wall, and a wall with power connectors on both sides, not that complicated.
---
I've had 2 copies downloaded for ages not bethesda launcher and steam, I've 1200 atoms left so a bundle before the bethesda gets deleted and I can free up some space . Sucks but I earned them at the start when atomic shop stuff was trash and ill spend them now when something good comes again.
---
I cancelled last month over their stupid legendary run bs. We want content not bullshit grinds. Games nothing but a psyop to drain your wallet and I'm sick of trying to convince myself otherwise.
---
It's like it's not so much coding as shoving things into an overfull suitcase and stuff pops out the other side.
---
I was with you except for the bit where anyone at Bethesda knows how to run a database query.
---
Unless you can be bothered to use the ammo converter. Turn those 200 missiles into some useful ammunition.
---
I wish they’d release a water tank that had a decent water holding capacity: hook it up to your purifiers and collectors and it’ll store thirty or so units by itself.
---
City 76 ordinances will allow for gambling and "other pursuits" in zoned areas.....please consider bringing your establishment inside the walls for the betterment of all.
---
I have zero issue with one shotting anything when nobody else is around. None.
---
And in the nuked forest? Even if folks are around, when it comes down to it....yeah, I'll one shot over being killed and having to wonder if I'll get my loot back. It's not a concern with Colossus....I'm pretty sure that bitch isn't one, two.....ten shottable?
---
But events? I'll do everything in my power to throw enough damage in, but keep them alive for everyone else.
---
Fuckin' way she goes, boys.
---
Dude I want an underground base! That would be sweet.
---
Go to play good old games then
---
Would love a Vault town thing, thinking a combo between foundation-esque and Vault-Tec aesthetic. We'd have our own home, which is instanced, and we just go nuts on the decoration. I'd name it Reclamation or Tricentennial.
---
I would love the ability for permanent changes eventually, decided by vote by all player accounts. Voting would last a month, to make sure everyone gets a chance, and one per account, so you can't just make more characters.
---
The votes wouldn't have to be major game changing, simple flavour thing like "Allow Ghoul Residents" or some-such, if yes, you see couple of ghouls. Eventually, maybe real-life years down the road (and in-game years, I'm expecting more time skips cause all the shit we do in the span of 2 years is amazing), we decide who to side with/integrate, Foundation/Crater/ATLAS.
---
I think scrip is the daily reward
---
Breathe Karen, it's fine.
---
Christmas had better stuff these are more like treasure maps
---
I don't know, all I know is the ammo counter for my Gatling laser is completely meaningless because it just runs out of ammo at random amounts.
---
Yeah same as me &gt;~&lt;
---
🤣🤣
---
Its to complete  a daily challenge  to sell or trade 3 times with another  player
---
There are daily challenges now for S.C.O.R.E, one of the challenges is buy items from a player 3 times.
---
Oh no! What will you do now??
---
Wow that’s the most excited I’ve ever seen anyone over an auto grenade and war drum. Glad you had fun!
---
That Is why I said IF maxon agrees
---
I like the way you word!
---
SCORE challenge
---
The only action is to stop playing
---
I agree the thing is I was shooting a scorched and he jumped In front of my gun and kept killing me because I kept trying to get him 😂
---
I'm not trying to retrigger it immediately, It's been several days, maybe a week, since I last did it.
---
It’s off I’m gonna turn it on I’m done with pvp 😂
---
I really thought they would increase the daily treasury note exchange amount. 20 notes for 200 gold per day is horrible. A full stuff of T-65 per armor is 6900 gold. If you grind notes/gold for a week, you can get a max of 1700 gold per week. Meaning it would take just over a month to get that suit. But then there are mods for it as well. And secret service armor, Gauss guns... Now mind you, I've got around 900 treasury notes in queue to turn in, and with playing, that number is just increasing daily. I've already got the T-65 suit, Gauss shotgun + pistol + necessary mods for both, secret service armor, but there's still more mods to get. 
---
Why can't I just turn in all my treasury notes so I can just get what I want? Oh, that's right... Bethesda wants me to have to sign in every day and play to increase their number of active player counts. 
---
The legendary run was interesting at first I will say that. Fun story line, public teams bright played back to public servers. BUT, un-creative dailies and broken weeklies ruined it for me. Despite working hard at trying to get the score ahead of the ship, I was still behind. And with all my weeklies being broken, I decided to blow my ATOMS to finish the board. (I will say, that was the best idea move I could make with that game). A few of my friends still complain about the daily grind for it and I don't miss it. 
---
Things I'd love to see:
---
-Weight calculator and filters. So you can see what is eating up your prescious limited storage and fix it easier. 
---
-Event objects leave your pack after the event. (Bolton greens plates?, Soy meat chunks? Mainframe cores? Why do these things have to weigh 1-1.5lbs per and sit after the event only for you to forget about it until you have weight issues?!?!. I get the mainframe cores you can repair and bring back in, but 1.5lbs per when you need 15 is just insane. 
---
-New creatures would be nice. Wendigo Colossus will be nice, but we need some other creatures. I wouldn't mind seeing a Radroach Boss in the toxic waste disposal site that's the size of a deathclaw. 
---
-auto loot with maybe a limit on what can be looted? Like 3 different types, caps, legendary items, and ammo? (This is obviously extra)
---
-what about creating player guild options? 
---
-friendly transfer boxes (mailboxes) that have a limited weight and item storage that only friends can access. 
---
-Disease cure fountains for camps! That would have been an epic plan/drop/reward from events. If whitesprings can have one of these, why can't we all potentially get one?
---
-scrapping legendary items which could give you legendary modules, and then you can use those modules to potentially craft or enhance your weapons. And maybe limit the enhancements. (1 stars can only be upgraded to 2 and 2s can only be upgraded to 3s, plus as you get to 3 star  items your potential success rate for upgrading the weapon is hugely deminished and could very well waste tons of resources to make your perfect weapon, but you have the ability to do it. 
---
-Loot System- obviously the loot system is made to be a running joke by game devs right? Right?.... It's not? Sure feels like it. Level 100, 3*** sheepsquach and I get a 1* exterminators lead pipe... I half expect one of these days I'll get a two shot rolling pin. 
---
- Event workload calculations - I see a lot of players who go to an event and sit off to the side, only to move when it's done and fast travel away. Meanwhile everyone else is doing the work so this person can do Jack and get score, xp, notes, and in some cases a rare item drop. Maybe if the person isn't killing, doing any of the necessary tasks, they are removed from the event or counted as not participating. 
---
Sorry, I could go on all day/night about this. I don't hate the game, I love a lot about the game, I love a lot of the community in it... But I feel like Bethesda doesn't listen to the players unless it hits the main stream media/sites with loads of complaints. Then they shrug and say "my bad" here's some crap to make up for the previous crap. 
---
I also think that with Bethesda's track record, if they try to fix or implement one thing, they break two other things. So maybe asking for a lot from them is pointless.
---
Ahhhh.... I see. I don't take note most of the daily challenges so now i know. Thanks! 😊
---
Yep. True statement there.
---
So frustrating to get a large number of people at this event and not get top tier rewards because no one runs ore.  Like just go load up at the start and turn it in at the last second.  Everyone wins.
---
This would be a great idea to fix the legacy explosive energy weapons. Have a gun trade in for free FO1st subs, one month per weapon. Dupers can trade in infinite weapons for an infinite subscription lol.
---
You can craft adhesive.  Aluminum isn't super common but it's common enough you're going to end up with a hell of a lot more bullets than if you didn't use it.
---
Buy or sell 3 items with another player is a recurrent score challenge. Next time someone does this. It should give you score points for being on the other end of the transaction 😉
---
And we are so much op stronger than them
---
Shit, so that means that even if I were to start a new character, I'd likely run into the same issue?
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422354/recent-c-a-m-p-fixes-in-update-21?language%5B%5D=en
---
Yeah, no one bothers to look around before getting outraged
---
I strongly thought they were hinting at me to go to their camp in return for their visit to mine. 😆
---
I was thinking about that for my gauss minigun. The conversation rates for 2mm ec is so bad, that it's just not viable in my eyes. It's still better to do lead and acid runs for it.
---
Have you been in the south east part of the map. Some dailies don't respawn until to enter the region,
---
The way it probably really happened is OP died to the punji board, wasted a bunch of ammo before realizing they couldn't damage the camp and then came on here to make up a story to try and regain a few inches of e-peen after being humbled so much.
---
You're welcome. This is the first season of the S.C.O.R.E system. Basically means you have to log in every day to complete it so I wouldn't be too bothered about it until the next event which starts in September. If you go to "the legendary run" you can see where you are on the board. Have a look and see if there's any specific items you want to get from it. Truth be told there's nothing that exciting on it.
---
Just course why you came to that conclusion? If I may ask.
---
VATS is excellent with heavy gun.  Far more accurate.
---
I use Fallout 1st to transfer everything on a private, if your not interested in purchasing, I would get a friend you trust to hold your items for you while you switch over. That would be the safest way.
---
Not surprised.  I think I logged in today and my Refrigerated Backpack mod was saying that it only at a -10% reduction in spoil rate, when before the patch it said -60% (which is still incorrect, with a level 50 backpack it's apparently 90% reduction just like Good With Salt).  And yet my food items are still barely getting dents in their CND.
---
No, .50 just shoots slow and crafts 120 + SD.  It's easily one of the most efficient guns in the game.
---
Same for me. I thought it was my net
---
Wait a sec, the satellite that's part of all the Enclave events is the same one that blew up Liberty Prime? I had absolutely no idea, that's pretty damn cool.
---
Remove her from camp, load up another ally and do a day or two of quests from them and switch back.  That unstuck her for me when it hapoenef.
---
That’s something a synth would say. 🤔
---
So what are these rewards you speak of cause if its alcohol and grenades im nuking you after i nuke atlas.
---
ah yeah the old turn it off and on again, will try that thanks
---
Reward him with janitorial duty 
---
Reward us with a time locked gold bullion grind, because all new end game gear will be character locked to curb duping
---
I walked all over fort defiance and it did not trigger.  The Camden park quests trigger if I'm vaguely in the area, but heart of the enemy is not?  Unless I need to be near vault tec university?
---
lol, right?
---
I'm not talking about how well they advertised themselves, I'm talking about how in TOW they weren't afraid to say they were the minds behind the original Fallout games and New Vegas. Gardiner and the others were never part of the original team behind Fallout.
---
They shouldn't reward players for daily playing. Games shouldn't be incentivising addictive and unhealthy behaviour. Especially not to make more money.
---
It also appears to be bugged. I think it's supposed to to need 100 pieces of wood collected, but instead it wants you to collect from wood sources 100 times.
---
I don't even try to go for it.
---
Why am I never one of the people who knows?!
---
I want to get into it. I tried many times. But I just see no reason to play it... The season pass doesn't entice me. I've done the missions and don't see any cool stuff to work on making money for. Such potential there but until there's a reason for all of it I'll stick to FO and GTA.
---
Wow, great tip
---
You bought the license. Not the game. The license entitles you to what the base product was when it came out. I know it's confusing but it's pretty simple once you understand it. You aren't paying them to update it. You're paying them for a license to play the product they made. If they didn't update the game you wouldn't act like they own you more updates, which is what makes them free. If you had bought the base game and then had to pay for the season pass, the updates, the expansions that would make them not free. Do you see the difference now? I'm not sure how much simpler I can make it.
---
TL;DR: Anything added to a game after its been fully released is considered a free update. Unless it's an early access game. Which this is not.
---
Agreed. I can miss a month or more of a Fortnite season and easily catch up if I have the time.
---
Go down by fissure prime and see it that works. I'm guessing.
---
Glad you’re on our side!
---
Can I suggest what would probably be the easiest and least messy way of doing it?
---
Make wallpapers side-agnostic.
---
No more having some wallpapers only applicable to exterior facing walls, and others only applicable to interior facing walls.  If it's a wall, you can put any wallpaper on either side.  You can put the same wallpaper on *both* sides.
---
junk doesnt weight anything in scrap boxes, i have over 500K because ive had the scarp box since 1st released. 
---
44k isnt that much steel, its not impressive at all, i could farm that in 2 maybe 3 days. people can downvote and be salty, but it isnt some hard fought achievement.
---
If it was rigged for us to keep paying it'd actually be good. That is, without tons of bugs and with reasons to play and spend money on the Atom Shop.
---
Well this wasn't about the update in general but the community event. You're free to your opinion but please try to stick to the topic.
---
I will agree it'd be nice if the boxes had extra plans like the pails did, but I honestly didn't even expect to get boxes so to me it's a nice little addition.
---
Cheaters good, players bad
---
Your airship camp is really cool!
---
If he was low health already it was probably Serendipity procing. Typically if you're seeing zeros when attacking another player this is the cause. If the damage numbers were showing anything other than zero but their health just wasn't dropping then that could be explained by like a million different things. 
---
Your best bet is to turn on pacifist mode and avoid hanging around Workshops/PvP events if you aren't built for PvP or have no interest in it. There's a pretty big disparity between a decently made PvP build and your average "food build". So much so that you do not stand much of a chance 9/10 times.
---
\&gt;  This was just an incentive to drain FO1st subscribers coffers 
---
No.  \*sigh\*  How can people be this...  Anyway.  This was giving useful things to new and casual players like the mole miner buckets were.
---
People that haven't been playing for a year and done 5000 SBQ are getting plans they want and some extra stuff and having fun participating.
---
Whiney little bitches who have been playing for a year and expect to get one of the handful of super rare plans they haven't managed to yet for handing in 250 steel are going to be disappointed though.
---
lets prevent this, members :D
---
It's not a chore, it's a scam to get you suckers to grind for more scrap and reward you with recycled trash lol
---
Sometimes Xbox live has issues and you can't find anyone.
---
Yes!
---
Nothing with being a "smartass" that is just the general response for when someone asks about a way to improve their PS4 experience because it's not like you can simply pop open the system to upgrade the hardware so your basically limited to those general suggestions I outlined. 
---
Yeah I could have worded it better but I wasn't fully awake yet when I saw the post so I didn't feel like doing so.
---
As for the crux of the problem it seems that too many Ash/Goo/Meat Piles are causing the issue? Admittedly I haven't run into this problem because I haven't really been in a situation where I can experience such as Line in the Sand and the Radiation Rumble event ever since the patch when up (I only get about 2-3 hours of playtime on work days). 
---
This is not anything new for a Bethesda game I clearly remember this happening with the PS3 version of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas but this along with the broken main quest the patch broke Bethesda really needs to push a hotfix.
---
r u enclave or BoS?
---
It’s because the game is trash
---
Thankfully, Fallout 4’s a good “replacement” for me. I miss making house-like builds in 76, but with the addition of Far Harbor, the barn walls will do just fine. Plus, they’ve got glass roofs from the warehouse kit that make for a fine skylight.
---
It’s just unfortunate, really. I love building in not only 4, but 76, too. There are different features in both build modes that separate the two games, and that’s why I go back and forth. I really hope they listen to the community on this one and revert the changes or at least make it easier to build and less restricted. Like you said, builders probably rack up the most cash for Bethesda.
---
Wow I didn’t expect to see this many people this recently. I can’t get in either haha
---
I bet you wanna *build a wall* too?
---
I think latrine duty in the wasteland might be the worst job ever. All that grilled radroach goes right through ya!
---
Can't you get a well that gives you purified water from the Settlers? That would be pretty nice at times in NW.
---
Edit: Never mind, it's just a reskinned water pump.
---
Having a more extensive and well-known resumé doesn’t equate to them being more transparent. And why the hell would anyone be “afraid” to tout the design acumen from having the original brains behind Fallout lead the team for ANY new game? There’s nothing inherently transparent about that, it’s just basic authority marketing
---
Well, if my mutations are giving me the full disadvantages rather than Class Freak stopping them from dragging my stats down so much, then I’m obviously going to be weaker and therefore easier to kill.
---
Low level players are just high level players on a new account
---
Actually I think this this is happening because you were on that quest when the patch came out? Maybe a new character doesn't run into the same issue.
---
Speed Demon has *always* been bugged.
---
Pick a better starting spot.  You should have some idea by this point.
---
I've gotten all the Halloween and Christmas cosmetics they were nice enough to accidentally add back in, so I'm not bothering to do most of the NW ones now.
---
If you're nearing 70 or higher for Legendary run then you're far enough ahead you don't need to bother with the NW ones.
---
they wont, BoS are always ungrateful shits.
---
Serendipity and dodgy
---
&gt; We thank you for contributing toward the group rewards, but my god, donating that much steel was just dumb.
---
I mean - I'd agree on that for just about everything but steel.
---
I cleared out my inventory (donated about 60k steel), left myself 2k for whatever.  2 days of playing, I'm back up to 6k....
---
Kinda the opposite though? I'm saying I don't mind losing a few scrip if it means I can get the full daily amount out of the machine. 
---
It's not the 2 I lose, it's the 3 that sits in the machine that you can't get because you don't have a legendary weapon that's a low enough level to be worth exactly 3 scrip. You can absolutely see why that would be frustrating, especially if they're gonna impose a limit of how much scrip you can get daily; you better believe I want it all so I can accumulate an overall greater amount of scrip so I can roll more juicy 3 star weapons.
---
Go unyielding for your gear
---
Many perks will be about damage mitigation
---
Blocker in strength
---
Fireproof in endurance, especially if you run bloodied explosive weaponry. Radicool gives up to +5 str with high rads. Great for bloodied melee, not as required if you stay ranged
---
Dodgy in agility to reduce damage as cost of ap
---
Serendipity in luck for decent chance to flat avoid damage
---
Lol that is absolutely wrong. The game is advertised as containing these features at the moment of sale. Even Bethesda's own website disproves what you just said because they advertise the game with Fortifying Atlas included at sale. https://imgur.com/N6bgKye that "Play now" button leads you straight to the store page. You're told that you're paying for this and other included features, such as Season 1 https://imgur.com/jzBHJ9k. It specifically tells me to pay to Play Legendary Run Now You apologists are hilarious. And it fucking says right there it's an overhaul of a release feature, not some fucking extra bonus special DLC.
---
And yes I fucking would act like they owe me updates. Shit that's been promised since release is still not in the game and tons of  shit that is is broken. I now it's confusing, but  it gets pretty simple once you stop being a bootlicker.
---
When you hit 5 turn on pacifist in the settings.
---
Join groups.
---
Don't have an open mic.
---
Being drunk helps.
---
I just wanna place wires though walls so my camp doesn’t look like absolute shit
---
You’re kind of answering your own question, I guess. We’re not only mad because we like building and this “bug” made things A.) easier for us builders and B.) more creative, but because Bethesda focused their energy on fixing a bug that doesn’t break the core game instead of fixing the other more notorious bugs. Like, why us? That’s what all this outrage is about. They’re wasting not only their own time, but ours too, since we now have to find new ways to make “creative” builds.
---
This is the damn truth. I can't up vote this enough. 
---
I've got over 900 treasury notes in queue to turn only 20 in each day. Each full suit of armor costs 6900 gold which means 4 weeks of turning in notes before you add in any mods. And in top of it, you can only have 5000 gold at most. She 30k caps when you are selling armor and weapons for thousands of caps at a time is just not enough. I had to turn off my vending machines because I can't find anything a want to buy from players and vendors to use up caps. Last thing I need is for someone to just buy an item and I lose out on caps because I've got the max.... Again.
---
To be faaaaaiiiiiirrrrr
---
Bethesda should just give us double SCORE week for free and resources for double SCORE month
---
Good job, member!
---
I am not a Beth spokesperson but they said that it was used for a wall stacking glitch; people would use to lag whole servers in order to initiate duping exploits. It seems to me that they didn't warn or put it on the PTS because they didn't want to telegraph the fix to avoid would-be "legacy" blueprints.
---
Well not everyone has a 1st and still contributing 44k is definitely contributing a lot for one player
---
I just don’t understand why it had to be so convoluted. The disconnect is mind boggling. I used it half a dozen times and there is a rhythm to it but just use reasonable exchanges rates and they wouldn’t be in this pickle.  I had like 110 40mm Grenades and yeah I can turn in 50 twice but then the other 10 with a different option. Just take them all and round up or round down - I don’t give a crap. Some dev is over thinking this, it’s not hard. If you can calculate 90% of my caps when selling through a vendor you can take my ammo and give me points in one transaction, no excuse.
---
I wasted 44k steel for shit rewards
---
FTFY
---
Well, if nothing else you picked something original, since this was an AI problem, which doesn't often come up in these sort of threads. Still a basic misunderstanding about game 'engine's though.
---
God dammit. They touched the rugs?!? Nooo... not the rugs...! I love my rugs.
---
if you're in a team and get disconnected after death and then reconnect to the same server the death bag is still there you just lost the marker to it.  
---
It's happened to me twice where I died hunting ghouls in Whitesprings, dying then crashing before I could get back to my death bag, reconnecting to the same server by being in a team and going to where I died and finding my bag just not having the marker pointing to it.
---
Oh man I love standing directly next to a ghoul with my double barrel shotgun and missing both shots with 95 in VATS
---
From a construction standpoint, a cinder block ceiling would be hilarious and terrifying lol.
---
They may not be able to easily fit it. It might be a defect in the engine and there may be few people that can fix it. Maybe they figure nobody will stop playing because of the issue. It boils down to what is the most important to fix to keep players happy and what is the effort needed to fix it.
---
Not often or well. I have had the game refuse to let me place those conduits.
---
If you're 70 you're on track to complete without paying atoms.
---
They're your atoms.  Do what you want with them.
---
Is vats fixed?  I hear they fixed so you can't have double wallpaper. How bout game mechanics
---
Helped me!
---
this isnt bethesda, this is a subreddit
---
Hold off on the atlas nuking till the BOS show up.
---
spoilers, they wont be
---
Yeah I’ve experienced this. Although I just load them up bullets again
---
Sarcasm and actuality aren't all that far apart anymore... lol.
---
better than dumping them into the void for floater grenades
---
If management is doing that, that's just stupid. Really in successful projects I've been on developers will give an estimate on tickets and good management will take your word on it and only assign enough to fill that sprint (IE if your sprint is two weeks long, they only give you ~80 hours worth of bugs to fix). 
---
If they're going by number of tickets closed, well no wonder we get so many problems.
---
Ill just nuke it before and whilst they are there.
---
&gt; We’ll know if this is true when it comes to the cork challenge. It’s one of the rarest junk items in the game so it would take an actual push from the community to hit that ludicrous target. If they announce that we made it I will be very sceptical of it.
---
Especially consider how crappy the award for it is.  Double score weekend - when it only applies to the dailies.  So ... you get 3 days of extra score?  Big deal.  That is mediocre to the extreme.
---
Now - if it was a double exp weekend?  Or script discount?  That would be worth pushing.
---
Git gud scrub, go back to fallout 4 like all the other losers
---
God mode glitch also a possibility
---
&gt;This is supposed to be an mmo. Where are the dungeons? Where are the raids? Where are the mounts? Where are the guilds? Text chat? End game content anywhere? Oh the scorchbeast queen for the 100th time? I guessss
---
Fallout 76 isn't a MMO. It's never been claimed officially that it is. Doesn't have the design of one. Fallout wants you to make a build with what you find, MMOs want you actively find gear for your build. Doesn't allow teams bigger than 4, MMO's most of the time demand more than 4 people who anything that's not basic level content. Fallout is playable alone with and balanced around that. MMO's intend you to be in a group and rarely are balanced for soloing them. Doesn't have servers that allows massive amounts of players on one server. Actually there is very little similar to Fallout 76 and a MMO. Everything that I can that be used to claim otherwise can be found in completely offline single player games... 
---
Plus, not telling you how to spend your money. But buying Fallout 1st doesn't tell them you want improvements. It tells them you are happy with the game. Tells them the whole post of problems you have with the games leading to this has only now that you canalled Fallout 1st that only now you have issues with the game. I know with gaming this sounds weird to people, but no business with fix there game if they already getting extra income from it. It makes resolving problems unprofitable. Just food for thought nest time.
---
I cancelled my 1st mainly because of VATS and there is no sense in a private server if it crashes regularly and you lose everything you built.
---
"  You want to combat dupers yet you unbanned many of them with the duped items still in the inventory. "

This.  This is what is killing me.  This is what will make me quit for good.    
---
Punishing the good, honest and PATIENT players that love the community and the game, and doing nothing about the cheaters.  All the work, the grind, the hours with friends for that one magical drop ... and some snot-nosed kid comes along with 5 duped ones he got from his buddy.
---
i personally love this event been getting 300 lbs of shit off people in workshops today
---
That well gives purified water? I think mine is busted.
---
Enclave, always a bit bummed out youd always end up in the BOS and not Enclave till now
---
dodgy, serendipity, cola spam, rubber banding, armor damage mitigation, bugs.
---
You mean it not supposed to automatically reload with 312 rounds left in the core?
---
Steal? They are inlocked for s reason.
---
Well they are bloodied at least....Fed76 says they a worth a few thousand caps. Better than the usual wrench or rolling pin I get.
---
the sense of freedom after quitting mid season is even greater i can imagine
---
The game engine isn't bad its the fact that they never patched bugs in previous installments that used the game engine and so those bugs keep carrying over to the next game. They cut too many corners and became to dependant on modding community to fix bugs because of money an time. This is the results of years, maybe decades of cutting corners to put out a title that's in a mostly working condition on launch.
---
more like 6-16 months to get a fix lmao
---
Shit I’ve got a couple hundred hours in this game and I still forget that happens
---
But the Enclave are evilllll and MODUS is annoying
---
Megaton = Wall  Rivet City =  Wall  The Citadel  =  Wall  The Strip  = Wall  Diamond City  = Wall  Sanctuary = Wall  The Pit  = Wall   Far Harbor  = Wall
---
Kinda makes sense, right?
---
Inherent issue in the engine, most likely.  I mean it was there in Fallout 4...
---
Same with random stealth breaks that seem to persist for a strangely long time.
---
I guess it's just a reskinned water pump, what a worthless use of bullion. Yeesh.
---
go beg on the market sub
---
Love the idea but if I wanted to be in a faction more psychopathic than what I can join already. Then the blood eagles are a thing xD
---
This is amazing gold for you sir
---
very good.
---
And after 55 craft, I am unable to craft this roll... rng sux...
---
The patch update is garbage
---
I think I have a spare in my vendors. I'm on PC.
---
nah, otherwise we would all just collect plastic to get infinite junk lmao
---
Don't forget the lazy and or dumb SOB's didn't bother fixing the ammo converter to be usable while in Power Armor. Because you know us PA users just love having to get out of our armor making us defenseless to do everything.
---
I'm guessing pvp turns on at 5 and Pacifist turns it off so I don't get grieved by high level players?
---
Is the open mic cause the community is toxic or something else?
---
The best part is you dont need acid as it's just lead and steel so its fairly easy to make with super duper and ammosmith rank 2.
---
Oh Bethesda GIVE ME AN Fn BREAK. You did it right in Fo4 just implement those mechanics and look up the place anywhere mod and fix your shit. This is an empty and hollow gesture and I'm still canceling 1st and boycotting the BOS BS.
---
goddamn, every hour there is another post. even though it was like the top posts topic today.
---
Got this on Xbox last night after radiation rumble. Oh my goodness was it frustrating. Exiting the server and coming back on helped.
---
If they made them worth atoms you'd have 0.1% of the community who ground their ass off in the first week getting 60+ days of atoms and 99.9% of the community completely fucking pissed off they aren't getting atoms.
---
This forums goes utterly ballistic when handing in 250 steel doesn't give them the ultimate super rarest plan in the game.  Imagine the absolute carnage when people are missing out on thousands of atoms because they didn't play for 120 hours/week to grind out the Legendary Run.
---
Honestly I'd say it's actively worse because it no longer checks what ammo you have.
---
I'm a gat danged Enclave G E N E R A L!  
---
I will not aid the enemy...
---
That’s the best you’ve got?  LoL
---
And honestly, playing without it for so long I can live without it on both of my characters. Adrenaline that is
---
But if I only help factions that help me, I'll never do any dailies 😟
---
Wait if 300k are playing 76 and this sub has 267k. Then that's not....2%... Hmmm somthing doesnt quiet add up with your math here buddy.
---
What other post-apocalyptic open world games would you recommend?
---
Sorry to break it to ya, Gen, but we have thousands that have infested your ranks
---
Crafting adhesive is a process that requires to sacrifice huge part of a camp budget for a plantation (which I personally can't afford, I'm already at max budget without plants), which I doubt many will resort to. Or you can hop to lots of locations to farm ingredients separately, but it's still quite cumbersome process, almost the same as with farming acid.
---
On aluminium abundance I'll just comment that I, despite having 1st sub for 4 months in the past, managed to end up with about 700 aluminium. And I collected lots of junk. Can't say I build much either. I guess if you really need aluminium in hundreds, you need to follow very specific farm routes, otherwise it's not that abundant across points of general interest like ws, west-tek and such.
---
It was just 9 scrip, the only good armor effects are 1* and 3*. At least now it's possible to get some pretty good weapons out of it, or at least 15 scrip instead of 9
---
Unless a pre-war America general joined the ranks of the BoS: no.
---
The promotion system can only be found inside the Whitespring bunker, so it’s not possible for the BoS to get the access credentials without it.
---
Same reason that most other ammo types are janked.
---
I got 36x 5.56 with my perks opposed to the shitty 24x .45 I get. The same shit ratios happen in the machine. 
---
Pretty sure .308 kids get fucked as well for crafting.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Yeah i had the same idea
---
Or find a way for VATS to be helpful with CAMP building
---
But they added sparkly stars. Didn't you need those?
---
Well.. I mean anyone who has the ability to launch a nuke is certified enclave material so I wouldn't doubt it.
---
Our dailies will benefit.......US.  Let them send their own people into the wastes on their missions.....of course, we can assist, for a fee.
---
Jesus, I read that in malcom McDowell voice
---
Thank you. And yeah it's hard being a loyal fallout fan that's for sure
---
it really not impressive, its just circlejerk.
---
I can login to Diablo anytime during the 3 month season and start knocking out the challenges. No reason this has to be daily.
---
Pump action shotgun? That's like killing one level 5 scorched in Morgantown airport 😂
---
It's like Beth is on repeat. Hope you get it all sorted man.
---
Is this the first time Bethesda have an online game. Seems like there are alot of bugs and things broken.
---
The Enclave is literally responsible for attempted genocide, several times.
---
They really seem to hate power armour yet continue to create cool but super expensive skins for it
---
No they don't, they are missing all the new plans and most of the PA mod plans are bugged and don't drop this time.
---
&gt;The promotion system can only be found inside the Whitespring bunker, so it’s not possible for the BoS to get the access credentials without it.
---
Finding and entering the bunker is not hard Plus if you could enter vault 79 with no fuss it would seem logical that the BoS could enter the Whitespring  Bunker without a sweat. And i would Imagine there would be some pre war generals that would disagree with the enclave's plans
---
I cancelled it in June (I think) and resubscribed again because it looked like they were fixing the stuff I cared about. I've got 500 hours in the game since the end of April, and spent a little too much on Atoms, but I'm done with it all now. They are, at best, crooks.
---
It's a shame seeing my favourite franchise fall so far from grace.
---
Stupid question: how do you even donate 250 steel? I have enough 'bulk steel' on me in junk... but it says I don't have the required materials. Is there a bigger quantity beyond 'bulk' (which is 30 steel scrap bits)?
---
You'd just not get any of the rewards. Though keep in mind, whilst the numbers might seem stupid high, Bethesda does want us to unlock them. They most likely know how often player pick up steel and how much is floating around, thus based the numbers on that. 
---
I think if we fail them, we'd get extra time till we did do it.
---
Fusion cores are used for PA and they have some weird ideas about them needing to be super rare for lore or something.
---
Plasma cores are completely off the chart for how cheap and light they are so if they did do them the conversion rates would have to be ridiculous anyway.
---
I thought it was a Wendy's.....
---
You use fusion cores when making those fenerators?
---
The Prydwen?
---
bruh anyone donating 44k has a fuckin scrap box, this shit is not impressive in the slightest, people are just pretending with this fake positivity bullshit. OP is just trying to karma farm and you morons are buying it 🤣
---
good lord people dont even read what they are downvoting
---
OK...what does that have to do with this thread?
---
I know VATS and walls and wallpaper are a thing being discussed, but your comment does not make any sense to this thread.
---
&gt;It’s one of the rarest junk items in the game
---
I think its called Clancy manor (very top North in forest next to white area)  its got quite a few liquid crustal decanters. That's where I go for my cork if im going through golf course I pick up golf balls.
---
Yeah I run a bloody build alt but keep a vampire FF weapon for taging and the healing helps. The drop rates suck as is, you never know when someone else might get something good to trade for later 🙂
---
Thank you, i'll use your advice next time. Though Bethesda should really add markers to all your death bags. My bro died in not the most visible spot to find a death bag and had  the standard paper bag skin equipped. That plus the high level ghouls that can one shot us, it would've take a long time to find it. I also saw a post post from 2018 complaining about the same thing, though it wasn't very popular. Thank you again.
---
I’ll do ya one better-
---
Give me all your scrap and get absolutely nothing in return.
---
Electricity wizard’s name was Nikola Tesla.
---
only a moron would actually donate that much steel, that or someone looking to karmawhore
---
Couldn’t remember. Ty, yes it’s been publicized.
---
there it literally no point to the rewards unless you are really new to the game.
---
The vehicles in fallout most if not all have small fusion generators. Hint why they have a shroom cloud when blown up also +1 rads.
---
Console or PC? I think Angry turtle mentioned that the glitched Line in the sand event may cause a blue screen for the console.
---
Same I’m tired of the crap loot pools.
---
I'd like a large fries and a frosty please....
---
Probably not, it'll be full of Legacy and Bloodied build guys killing everything as fast as possible, and then AFKing the actual cookout.
---
I like my steel where it is. In my STASH. Used for things I like to make.
---
This is the last response I'm justifying you with since you had to resort to aggressive name calling while I'm trying to be civil with you. If you're OS for your phone or computer updates, you don't have to pay for that and I'm sure they'd advertise anything contained in the update. Same for when a game updates. They typically call them free title updates or free hot fixes because no one is specifically paying for these to be added into a game.
---
I'm sorry you feel entitled to things and get aggressive when people don't agree with you. We obviously have differing opinions and I'm not going to stoop to your level and continue this farce. Enjoy whatever it is you do in your free time.
---
I see you're not a a flake. 
---
Time to get some Commie Wackers and start busting those autos!
---
Start out with melee weapons, ammo is hard to come by early game
---
Learn every crafting bench plan
---
Conserve your screws
---
Get power armor
---
Join a team 
---
Play events
---
Complete the excavator quest for a free power armor station plan
---
Get good armor
---
We did some experimentation and we think it has something to do with ash piles from energy weapons.  When any of use used an energy weapon, we had problems.  When we all used a ballistic weapon, everything was fine.
---
I cancelled mine 2 days ago because I'm so tired of VATS
---
Same, patch 21 was a joke I starting to think they haven’t Testing anything on PTS whole June
---
Well damn screwed that up for myself...had 10 of them and was selling them for 500 caps and they flew off. Damn I feel stupid now.
---
I can confirm now that downclocking works. Hard to believe this horror is finally over, thanks to you and may the wasteland smile upon you!
---
It’s a debuff, correct? Logically that means this will go too.
---
I don't mind the Collecting for ATLAS, big community challenge, I like it, but the rewards are goddamn ridiculous. BoS-esque rewards. Bullets? Lead? Nuclear Waste? Plans/Recipes? FUCKING GOLD! Doesn't have to be hundreds, just a chance for a dozen or so for each donation? That would be nice and a way better incentive.
---
If you start at full HP go to email disposal and die from rad damage in the mines. When you respawn go do stuff as you will naturally take damage.
---
As for rads. Take radx diluted (dosent cancel mutations) when you need to. If you get too low on hp and need to heal rads you have a few options. Equip sun kissed perk for a few seconds, drink brahmn milk or use diluted radaway.
---
Far cry new dawn, mad Max(omg I love the car harpoon and pulling wheels off cars). Wasteland I &amp; II, dying light, dead island. Metro 2033.
---
Yikes!   I’m shuddering just thinking about it.
---
If you’re defenceless outside of your power armor, then you need to get some armor that at least pretends to be good. A set of non legendary heavy combat armor with the ultra light mod works wonders. I had a 2* for my commando PvP character which then went to my melee character regularly running less than 10% health and it very rarely died once it hit level 50.
---
It's a question, kid
---
I recently started playing again and was so disappointed the scrap box is subscription only. I've been enjoying playing again, but I'm already starting to waver. I'm struggling to manage a decent selection of weapons and not have my stash box full, I was really disappointed vendors all pool caps now, I see how greedy Bethesda has become with FO1st and breaking their promise that the atomic shop would be cosmetic only, and now this camp disaster.
---
The camp building has been the only thing keeping me interested this second time around, and now I'm thinking I'll probably quit again like I did shortly after release. Only this time it will be for good. As a long time fan, what an utter disappointment and greedy, disgraceful sellout you have become, u/BethesdaGameStudios_.
---
Well at least you made caps off of them lol
---
THey already tried that at launch, it was received poorly which is why they do it the way the do now. What they need to do is have a PTS for each console as well, I know for a fact it is possible on Xbox, Bethesda just doesn't want to do it.
---
Open a ticket with Bethesda, after making sure it’s not a new character you started or something.
---
jeez, three weeks? It’s almost like the employees are all at home!... wait a second...
---
Why isn't this post getting more traction?
---
Can't forget tenpenny tower lol
---
Edit also, paradise falls
---
Seriously this is like a cheat sheet for the devs to look at and see THIS is what you should be working on I got the game at launch and fell off but came back after wastelanders and nothing really has changed every single patch they "fix" some things and then break more than they fix
---
I saw it work for the “collect 100 wood” so tried it with the “collect 7600 wood” alas it does not count :-(
---
All platforms.
---
+1  Good Call
---
2\* compound bow and a 1\* fixer from dailies and old events so far.
---
Finding it? Perhaps not that difficult.
---
Finding the unused credentials of another US government member, like Sam Blackwell, that didn’t made it into the bunker? Very unlikely.
---
Plus, let’s not forget that the primary reason the Enclave killed Blackwell after the war was precisely to retrieve his access credentials, which do would indicate that they also looked for any remaining others, since they were a security risk as well.
---
And again, I really doubt that any pre-war general (assuming any survived outside an Enclave facility, where most, if not all, should have been taken to) would join an organization that was partially formed to disregard the authority &amp; military hierarchy of pre-war America’s politicians &amp; army.
---
No more armor rewards at sbq?
---
Look dude; we’re in the middle, or beginning, or end of a pandemic who really knows! and the majority of us are stuck in the house. At least until we have to put a mask on and stroll the market store for groceries or grab a fast one from a food plaza. I’m averaging about 9 hours a day of fallout right now and if you think I’m giving up my bottomless junk pile because of a few pish posh bugs, I’m sorry good sir but I will not. I understand what you are saying and how you are feeling about how flim flam Bethesda is being with the 76 franchise. The answer is not to give up your first membership, but to stand united as a community and prosper beyond these trying times!
---
Also if any one has the responder fireman uniform on PS4, I will give an arm and a leg for it. I’ve been grinding for that for a year and half now.
---
I’m sorry to ruin the fun but does it have to do something with that building that blew up recently?
---
Yeah but those pesky flame throwing Floaters seem impervious to me when I  show them my Fireproof card, they just burn it then burn me. It is the only time I  run away.
---
Hahahaha
---
Walls are the best solution DT knows what he's doing lol
---
Ive got a mirelurk queen that spawns close to my camp who walks toward my missile turrets than dies to fall damage or something. If I try kill it before it dies it mutates and has the message but isn't legendary.
---
I feel you man. Needless waste via cynical business practices and a loss of soul. Like Disney in the 90's. [https://youtu.be/msbBGwXb9Zs](https://youtu.be/msbBGwXb9Zs)
---
Yet you posted that anyway 🙄
---
Me three, it just grays out and I am just sitting there infront of the mine.
---
i can kinda see how they would go fast but the 2mm EC has a mini gun now so we need the big ains when it comes to crafting or farming off of machine. which doesn't carry it. and it might be because of "lore" reasons but come on.
---
They could also try playing 76 on regular PCs and consoles without any unique programs or tech.  Since this game's launch I feel like the team has been experiencing the game under very different circumstances from the average player.
---
You guys just now realizing how lazy bethesda is?
---
I've seen YouTubers get in and yet I can't it makes me mad
---
oh but havent you heard? if you dont donate tens of thousands of resources to the BoS for those floater grenades that youre and entitled whiny asshole
---
We would also like to be able to float things still
---
I did a test on my melee character.  She had over 17000 steel, so pulled 5000 out and waddled up the hill to ATLAS.  I deposited it resulting in 20 packs.  I the slowly opened them and watched the rewards pop up.  A bunch of alcohol, stimpacks, and junk.  2 meh plans.   
---
Not worth it, but at least I did my part with contributing.  
---
Reserving my steel now for bullets to gift my other characters.
---
Uh... Think Rust or ARK but with less griefing, less about PVP, and you don’t reset on death, and with quests and a storyline. There are public events that people team up with, very similar to how dungeons go but there’s no cap or minimum on participation or roles. 
---
The “map” however is generally the same but each player brings their custom built structure with them. And when they leave, they take it with them too. It’s saved to them. You can only build in a specific radius and there’s a limit. You also can’t build too close to someone else.
---
* after level 50 you can re-assign points with every level you gain. 
---
* weapon recipes are usually unlocked by scrapping said weapon, and some can be bought from vendors  
---
* by BOS if you mean this new "waste your materials" event then no, the rewards are recycled from g*fts which have been duped in the billions 
---
* acid is fairly hard to come by, but most people use it for gunpowder not smelting 
---
* and I have no ideas about mods I'm om Xbox. hope any of this helped :) 👍
---
imagine actually thinking that we have to donate to get the rewards. some people are so easily swayed by FOMO. its sad.
---
The player could assist their entry, and that's why the brotherhood will allow him/her into their ranks as the normally don't let outsiders into their ranks 
---
A general could of escaped with Maxon and learnt from him that Killing off an entire population might not be a good idea
---
Who dupes cork tho?
---
nice role change from becoming the good samaritan of the wasteland tho
---
Wow!, How did you get so high level? . I have my main 156 and I got two alts, a 49 and 11.
---
For good measures, nuke it after they all die.
---
Again, I'm not trying to say that Bethesda isn't being transparent about who's developing their games. My point is that Obsidian did and CONTINUES to create amazing RPGs. Even though their new IP may not be as deep as Fallout, they still know what true RPG elements are, which are in fact not a constant 3-yes-1-no shit dialogue system. When it comes to Fallout, many people can agree that Obsidian did a great job making New Vegas, let alone Fallout 1/2 when it comes to RPG elements that are true to Fallout's Lore. Fallout 4 was a great game, yes, but failed to immerse its players because of the shitty dialogue system.
---
Fallout 4 did get many things right like the weapon customization system and the gunplay, but it failed in some categories like the story and dialogue. Bethesda fails to see that, among other things.
---
Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Feargus Urquhart were only three of the many great minds behind Fallout 1,2, and NV. Just imagine how a new Fallout would be if they were in charge of it.
---
This is only one of the points I've made in my post, the other parts include criticism behind the BGS that is in charge of 76, and it just concerns me how little they care for the game at this point.
---
I was meaning more like the steel
---
It's gotten more traction than I would have thought haha
---
If you are planning a heavy strength and intelligence build, go heavy guns.
---
I admit it is rather rare but I consolidated my 4 characters junk to just 1 and I am sitting on a bit over 110K in cork. Plastic is what I am low on with only 10K total, damn shotgun shells.
---
and they are salty as fuck when you point out that this event is shit, with a shit value proposition.
---
Yeah I'd love to see the devs do more live streams with actually playing on a public server and trying to build elaborate camps without crashing or experiencing these glitches
---
Also on PC. Just ran into the same issue. Rip us I guess.
---
Like i can read your mind and know what you mean 😁 without saying it. Anyway, noone stockpile cork im sure, fuck that *event*
---
Ill go in there myself and finish em off.
---
The biggest thing this patch revealed, moreso than any other patch, is that those who are managing this game are no longer playing it.
---
But hang on a sec, No one is the 'good samaritain' in the wasteland. Not even the BoS is perfect. In FO4 tegan even tells you to practically raid settlements for supplies
---
Alienate? More like eliminate many of us.
---
You don’t need max points in intelligence to build everything. Swap those perks in and out as needed. Your not going to be fighting whilst building so nerd rage etc u could swap out. I run 5 in intelligence so can equip whatever I want and as a norm I run 2 weaponsmith for the durability and nerd rage. For sniping u want rifles in agility along with tank killer and concentrated fire and in agility sneak/covert op/sandman/1 in gun fu/5 adrenaline. The rest where u see fit. Just remember u don’t want to have lock pick. Scrapper. Hacker on all the time just when needed. Same with any crafting or building perks.
---
all day long, my vats shots were missing to the left at almost every range.
---
I’ve always kind of hated heavy guns, especially from an RP perspective; IRL, even carrying an LMG with a full set of armor and gear is a nightmare (I can tell you this from experience), so the idea of my character lugging a minigun around has always seemed silly to me.
---
I have some extra steps for safety:
---
- Make or join a public team. 
---
- Ask your friend to join. 
---
- Disconnect internet by interrupting it like turning off the wifi for a split second or something. 
---
- Wait until your console connect properly. 
---
- Press the button to go back to main menu
---
- Change your character
---
- choose play with team or join your friend if they kicked you. (I don't think if someone can kick you if you're the leader)
---
Finally the Brotherhood receives the material delivery they deserve. Well done Dweller!
---
In these trying times, they prefer to shelter in place.
---
what are said meh plans?
---
Why do items on walls get removed if you add a wallpaper, but changing the floor type keeps everything intact?
---
here comes that fake positivity circlejerk here to drown the criticism. this sub is so pathetic sometimes.
---
some guns dont miss in vats, others miss 2 out of 3 shots.
---
I run with a shotgun/cripple build so I use vats until all enemies are crawling on the ground then I finish them off outside of vats.
---
No way! Remember that the day before leaving vault 76, all the dwellers had a massive party!
---
I don't want to encounter those people again and find out that my character is now a father and has to pay child support...
---
Best to just keep going in the other direction and face down deathclaws... 
---
You never know, Rocksy might end up hiring one of you to track my ass down...
---
Except even if we do this, they will absolutely act as if we completed the event. There’s no way they’ll let it fail. It would be embarrassing to them for starters, and it also wouldn’t do for the BoS to arrive to a half finished base. 🙄
---
Yea there seems to be little to no play testing I know we have the PTS but that's PC I'm PS4 and it's just so frustrating
---
Thanks everyone for the clarification. Rethinking of it, I hope what I ask here doesn't get this practice sabotage. Not sure if Bethesdha see this as a easy way out of the system to get this challenge's rewards. Let me know if i need to delete this thread of mine.
---
Wait, so if you leave or switch servers, then your base is erased? or does it "follow" you? (if so, how does that end up working if its near someone elses on the same "map"?)
---
It'll be fixed in 4-5 weeks, as is the tradition
---
i mean if they come here and downvote, by that logic they must hate giving ammo to low level players and actual being helpful lmao.
---
The true brotherhood of steel would like to help
---
you are preaching to the choir
---
Yeah, something else they screwed up with another stellar patch.  I killed some standard enemies and heard the sound effect for that, but they were just standard muties/hounds when I checked them.  Also hearing double sound effects from score under certain circumstances, like exiting PA.
---
Why they gotta hoard tech all for themselves anyway? Bunch of power hungry weirdoes to me
---
If every unlooted corpse leaves a pile of stuff when it despawns, I’d expect to find a lot more random junk laying around. Maybe it only happens in certain situations or areas?
---
same here
---
I bought this bundle, but couldn't even find the emote to use.
---
If you want fusion cores make the heavy laser Gatling that uses them. It come with one when you craft it. Way less than flux costs.
---
I'm doing 1k of each resource. Not sure if that makes me a chump by your definition but I'm doing it to try and pull a bit of immersion and enjoyment from what's in the game. I know it doesnt really matter but it's just a quick small satisfaction when I donate but I pretend it actually matters and I'm helping to bring the BoS back to Appalachia. Calling people chumps for doing something you chose not to do is kinda dumb everyone is gonna have their own reasons for donating and I'm sure pretty much everyone know they dont NEED to especially after 10 of these posts being thrown out everyday since announcement
---
Yeah the PTS and what they release are different versions to which doesn't help. It makes no sense that they continue to mess it up
---
I never know I wanted one till now
---
Just my two cents on the perk layout, cheers to you and all the best :)
---
Actually a double score weekend would be 4 extra days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday) of score. Equating to 10,000 bonus score if you do all the challenges. Depending on where you're at of the run that can really make a difference. I wouldn't call it crappy but rather overpriced at 200,000,000 cork.
---
I'll donate since there's a chance of 2 armor plans I don't have could drop. Those Raider armor plans are rare drops. Most everything else from the crates ends up being vendor food to clear the daily 1400 vendor caps.
---
Todd Howard: "Looks OK to me."
---
Level 40 and donated my 750 steel only to get stuff I already had. Oh well.
---
pretty much, god forbid a "community" event make you do something with other people and bring people together. lol nope, just put shit in a box and give everyone else shit for not putting in as much as you did.
---
Maybe while trying to figure out what they're saying is a complicated problem, why not just increase the % to hit values in VATS until you have a proper fix? If my to hit % was 399% I bet I would miss a lot less.
---
I doubt there'll be any response from them sadly
---
Emmm... the same day of this fixes I got the nuka cola bundle and i was able to replace my rusty stairs for the nuka cola one without problem. I don't know, it can be an on an off problem or something?
---
Read patchnotes
---
They indeed did update a few of the main quests in high level areas so that low level players would have less of tough time doing those quests.
---
Edit:
---
Here is what they changed according to the patch notes:
---
"Quests and Events  
---
• An Ounce of Prevention: We’ve simplified the “Collect Blood Samples: 0/3” to only require a single Blood Sample from a Feral Ghoul.
---
• This quest step frequently caused some confusion for new players and had a bug that could sometimes block progression. This change should make An Ounce of Prevention a smoother experience for everyone.
---
• Signal Strength: At the National Isolated Radio Array, we’ve removed the wave of difficult robot enemies that spawn and reduced the overall difficulty of enemies in the area.
---
• Signal Strength could be difficult for new characters due high-level enemies at the Radio Array. We’ve dropped the difficulty so that this part of the quest is easier to complete for lower level characters."
---
It wouldn't surprise me. They bungled the running of Elder Scrolls Legends and then killed it before the last planned expansion on the roadmap.
---
it's fine if you've got thousands of rounds. but when you go back to camp with 
---
237 .308, 86 .45, 3 missiles, a mini nuke, 411 5mm and 124 .38 rounds, it's just as pointless and time consuming as it was.
---
Appreciate the advice.   Hadn't been a problem before now it seems like it's serious.   I'll try your system, hoping I can stop losing stuff.
---
You are lying. When you die you don't drop the fluxes, it disappears.
---
Like the Legendary Bloatfly in FONV :
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/f/f4/Legendary_Bloatfly.png
---
I liked the part where you said "waddled". It made me smirk.
---
Other words I find myself using to describe these people:
---
* Suckers
---
* Rubes
---
* Fools
---
* Clods
---
* Saps
---
* Tools
---
Dupers donate all the scrap if you don't you are a chump.
---
Not an exploit. "magic guns" You can gank her when she is climbing out if you know what you are doing, gotta have near perfect aim and hold steady to hit in just one location. However once she flies then it is normal, but you can still kill her with your magic gun with ease just takes more time.
---
AP refresh. I sold so many unyielding and vanguard AP refresh pieces thanks to SBQ. 8-10k a pop and they would sell within hours. I will miss getting these.
---
Press show only
---
Yes, they mentioned it in the patch notes. It was absolutely intentional.
---
I never thought of this. Thanks!
---
Won't happen, because triple XP would mean that far fewer players would need to buy their way to rank 100.
---
key word, *pretend* it matters, it doesnt, its just crappy rationalizations for a shitty event. but good on you for not wasting hundreds of thousands that could be better spent helping someone else or being used to keep you in the game.
---
It's first come first serve. If you join and someone has your location you can choose to continue without your camp or find a new server. 
---
It never wipes it.
---
I actually looked around to see if one was there, seemed like the perfect place to put one too. People see what they want to see sadly.
---
Either do it don't? Not really sure why a post is needed to figure out what you do or don't like. None of us can tell you either way.
---
Something is up.  I did her yesterday hoping maybe they fixed the kill atom challenge (they haven’t), and only got treasury notes and some junk.  Not even flux, and I’m a bloodied build with a bloodied gauss shotgun so I did substantial damage to her.
---
Considering I'm taking a break after the Steel Dawn questline until Fractured Steel, I'm just donating anything. I mean, it's not like I'll have a use for it until I return.
---
Yeah, it's a shame and I've just cancelled FO1st as well:
---
* VATS is still fucked and it looks like it never will get fixed
---
* Bows are now even more broken than before
---
* Gauss Rifles are still broken and given how long they've been that way it's clear that there is absolutely no priority given to ever address these issues.
---
* No end game content except stupid &amp; highly repetitive grind
---
* Devs that \*clearly\* don't don't play their own game, ignore the community and have a total lack of vision.
---
Here is a funny thing, though: The amount of world building and story telling that went into the good old TESV:Skyrim was mind-boggling. You could find new stuff you had overlooked even after hundreds of hours. Plots and subplots galore. Interesting NPCs and funny tidbits everywhere. Compared to that FO76 feels like the metaphorical wasteland and is devoid of content and devoid of fun. 
---
FO76 had a metric f-ton of potential and it could over time have been fleshed out to the same level of interesting, intriguing and astonishing as Skyrim. However, instead of filling it with more life we get more grind, more bugs and more pay-to-use skins and C.A.M.P. items shoved our way and it is clear that \*this\* won't change.
---
Time to vote with the wallet. o7
---
It follows you. If there’s a conflict, it notifies you when you load in and says you can either store your base (aka 90% chance it’s a total rebuild) or you can find a new world. And then it’ll repeat until you’re loaded into a world where your spot is open. 
---
I’ve built in one of the more popular spots and I think the most I’ve had to switch is like 3 or 4 times? Took maybe an extra 5 min total to get going. Now I’m building it a not so popular spot and I rarely have to switch
---
I know it does and I used to run it as a main gun. (Plain 1* bloodied one and bffr after that). Yes, it is ammo-efficient, and yes, you can craft lots of ammo for it for cheap. But finding 50cal ammo while adventuring is whole another story. For me it turned out actually easier to buy 'em in a bulk and never bother about crafting/looting.
---
no one faction but the lone wanderer/sole survivor etc, everyone expects their help. at least new vegas gave us the option to help the baddies similar to nuka world, its nice for people who like to roleplay different styles. not everyone wants to rebuild someone elses view of society.
---
fallout 1 and 2 you could be totally evil, killing all the npcs would grant you a perk or something i cant recall, you could get berserk/childkiller reputation too which would change how npcs interact with you too.
---
1. You can fix anything later, don't worry.
---
2. Eh. There are a bunch of vendors at the Whitespring that sell a ton of plans.
---
3. Hahaha, FUCK NO it's not worth it. Don't be a chump.
---
4. You can get like 100 acid in 15 minutes by hitting up Flooded Trainyard/Tanagra Town/Dolly Sods/Toxic Larry's and killing Snallygasters, Cave Crickets, and Yao Guai. Snallies, crickets, bears, and Grafton Monsters drop acid, so it's trivial to get a lot of it.
---
5. Nah, you're good.
---
3 flubs in a patch isn't that bad.
---
I assume ppl still playing haven't been around since launch?  3 is low
---
Ps eso isn't by this studio.  Austin is newish to bethesda and had 0 experience in multiplayer games
---
I can't believe you paid more money for this game and amazed you still had fallout 1st. I play often, but the amount of missing features, lack of content, and bugs are astounding. Welcome to the other side!
---
Go with shotguns then.
---
Not moving my camp...guess I’m glad I slapped it down next to a copper extractor though. If the issue is that the game can’t handle two sides of different wallpapers in 2020...that’s embarrassing.
---
Make walls that can snap on to the same floor piece in different directions if that’s what it takes. If the game was buggy because of the doorframe truck, I’m sure the coding is there to make that happen. “Thin walls”
---
I learned about it completely by accident. Was making an assaultron helmet for a low level alt and super duper proc'd and i scrapped the helmet and got the a scrap assaultron head back and thought "wait a minute"
---
Hate to break it to you but it not suppressing negative mutation effects was a thing before the patch. The simple fix was to remove and re-add them. I HATE them being in alphabetical order to I redo my Luck perks every time I login anyway.
---
Until August 7th mad max is $5!!!!
---
Definitely conserve screws. I’ve dropped weapons so I can bring back a fan and typewriter. 
---
Abandoned Bog Town is a great spot for screws if you all don’t know all ready. Can get 30+ screws per run.
---
Yep
---
You know they datamined the drops, right? We've known from the start that the rewards are worthless. Don't waste your time with this shit.
---
This is an old bug
---
lmao dupers arent going to waste the resources they specifically set out to dupe on these rewards. dupers are in it for personal gain, but this event isnt worth it.
---
widespread issue - many if not everyone is facing the same thing, they updated this quest in the last patch which broke it
---
Only use my VATS character for the critical dailies now. Sucks because there is no better feeling than using a bloodied western revolver with gun fu (when it works) and reaper's sprint. All while having Line in the Sand to yourself.
---
It's also been turned off, not even broken for PVP. The only thing that works are criticals and there's no critical banker perk. Even then critical damage doesn't seem right.
---
there are out there pretending like they actually achieved something by wasting 50K steel. its so sad
---
Isn’t double sided walls as simple as allowing wallpapers to be placed on the exterior? Not sure why it involves a discussion
---
FO76 is a great game. I just started playing about a month ago and love it. If you like Fallout it’s a great game. It scratches everything I want in a game. Exploring. Scavenging. Base building. Building up your character. 
---
Don’t listen to the naysayers man
---
Im going to guess a toilet and a pearl grip for a pistol
---
It does.  I don't take over-the-top free stuff for that reason.  A stimpack or nuclear keycard?  Sure.  Other than that ... nah.
---
Didn't they say there would be unique/rare plans?
---
I sell these for 10 caps lol
---
Fairly confident its' visual only; I have grounded and my energy damage changed appropriately when I unequippped Class Freak.
---
These reward boxes are the worst pile of shit, you loose money at each trade. Consider your steel a donation that will offer you nothing in return but loss of your time and energy. Sell your steel to a vendor or drop in a can, you'd feel better
---
I crafted a full set of this, so you’re saying I can equip, let’s say, the camo left arm and it will give me a jetpack? And then I can use another mod on the chest piece?
---
Checked this morning we are apparently have way there nearly. Don't know how
---
Oh so I have to wait and hope that they fix it that's unfortunate, I started playing 2 days ago and already got a main quest bug.
---
That's a well thought out post, I appreciate the efforts! I'd upvote it x1000 if I could.
---
Yes.
---
who the fuck is Russel Dorsey anyways?
---
This. Other games do it so much better.
---
I'm out after this run. I can't have a game take over my life like this. I'd play WoW again otherwise.
---
I agree. From the lies to the broken mechanics to the lack of care about players the list goes on and I've been spending a lot of time on modern warfare. At least they reward you for your effort
---
Keep spreading the word, hopefully enough people will boycott it and we’ll fail the event to show bethesda we’re tired of eating up all their shit
---
The video I that I have recorded told me that I got the stable fluxes.
---
The reward boxes are absolute dog shit. Barely covered my fast travel there. F this event
---
I don't get the mentality. It's like Stockholm Syndrome with these people, "No the event is actually really good, guys, and these awards are such a nice bonus."
---
Absolutely. That's the reason I left for now. You should post this as a new thread lol this is what people need to hear
---
I do think it was another player, I think it might be a sync issue. I have this happen often around popular farming territory. The pylon/bogtown area is a very popular spawn-in for high level farming (and often "overtake workshop" dailies). I feel like I run into people with similar xp grinds to me sometimes and this starts happening more.
---
I mean, you’re not wrong. The executives are having conversations like this daily. Granted, it’s sarcastic and unrealistic but those marketing guys at Bethesda are looking for a way to milk us.
---
I’m moderately happy with what Fallout 1st offers me. Mostly just feeling like a big shot in the atomic shop and the survival tent.
---
I’m not mad at fallout 76 taking my monies because I actually enjoy the game, and (unpopular opinion) want to pay the devs more consistently to create more content. Just like we would donate to a patreon or a gofundme..
---
Also, this is no different than literally any other current business model. (i.e. Netflix, Comcast, AT&amp;T.. I can go on..)
---
You can’t even sell them, that’s a hot garbage
---
Thank you, I have no idea it exists.
---
The grind is worse on WoW yes, but with a goal in mind : lategame content.
---
In WoW, you have raiding, both big and small size, open PVP, arena PvP, etc.... Everything that makes an MMO, because it forces interactions.
---
In FO76, you playing a single player game in an online environnement because you only have the single player content.
---
Even the colossal problem, as it is désigned, would fit perfectly in a FO4 like game.
---
As I said, the only thing that has an MMO feel in FO76 is SBQ fight, because its the only open boss event in the game.
---
THIS will get hotfixed within hours.
---
I haven't really seen it in my hundreds of hours of playing.. I have seen the guy just standing still and unable to loot bug, but that one is different. Either way, in just one day i've seen it happen multiple times.. So they broke it again, or even more so with this patch.
---
"Iron is full of impurities that weaken it; through forging, it becomes **steel** and is transformed into a razor-sharp sword. Human beings develop in the same fashion." The **Art** of Peace O'Sensei Morihei Ueshiba.
---
Yep, it makes it quicker when hacking terminals too.
---
If you do it like most people and just spam random words until it works, you can hold down the exit button as soon as you get the 4th word wrong. It's faster than waiting for it to kick you out of the terminal.
---
YES. This needs to happen. There could be an apartment building where if you went in there was a lobby and pressing the elevator would give you an option to visit your teams room, or your own, and you would be able to build camp furniture, there could be a place for vendors, a place just to chill out, maybe robot vendors too
---
It isn't broken
---
Imagine how sick it would be if there was a community project to, like you said, build a city around vault 76 so when new players exit the vault they’re greeted by this amazing city. What a way to start a FO game. NPCS could direct you to each main quest, vendors for high and low level players, etc
---
It's worth 9600 caps minimum.
---
Colossal problem? More like Colossal failure
---
Seemed to only happen to me with shotguns. My first 20 levels were spent trying to be a shotgun/rifle but as noted, they could be right in my face showing 95% and nothing for 3 shots. 
---
I switched over to full auto handmade and now every shot hits. (I know because this thing eats ammo so I'm stingy with it) even when only at 72% etc.
---
Lol yeah and no strengthened mods either there goes secret service armor for pvp
---
My frame rate drops to unplayable during Radiation Rumble when I'm using my Tesla
---
Bruh people can play the game how they want. No need in getting pissed off because people are contributing to an event.
---
Yup, but only if you already had the mod applied before this patch, otherwise it doesn't show up as a available mod.
---
Lol.   I’ve noticed this too.  I like that it’s visually more obvious but it appears to have the same “hit box” as the paper bag
---
That's how most MMOs work.    
---
At their core, they are mean to be very LONG, frustrating, a almost incalculable time sink and little reward vs time played.    
---
You're paying for access to something and will never truly own any of it. Should someone higher up decide to cancel 76 you're F'd. Mostly in terms of lost time which you'll never get back.
---
thats been in the game forever. its not a new bug at all. happens to me everyday on pub worlds
---
Thank you kid sir. I did my best not to rant too much
---
Another thing they didn't test.
---
Why are you using it in the first place?
---
Sir, this is a Taco Bell.
---
can you display any items from your item or junk on top of the classical column? curious before I buy it. What is allowed tobe displayed on top of the column? Thanks
---
Well we'll see if the BoS coming to Appalachia are a good or bad chapter. But I bet they are going to be bland like the raiders. Morally gray decisions has always been one of the best things about fallout for me.
---
I don't play anymore, but I follow the news... Every update seems to be controversial.
---
All I right in thinking this is a nexus between mismanagement and dealing with an ageing engine that wasn't designed for multiplayer?
---
It makes me sad.  This could have been something truly awesome =/ and fallout is my favourite game series, bar none. Bethesda genuinely don't seem to care for the franchise.
---
It probably is a db sync issue -- those monsters were killed, but for some reason are showing up on my long/mid range view as alive and moving.  As you get closer to the cell they get updated to their true state: dead.  But it's never happened to me before, since day 1 of playing, and now it's happening frequently.  Something is amiss.
---
At this rate that won't be fixed until after the legendary Run is finished and it'll be bugged again for next season
---
I turned my place into a commie dungeon, and anytime someone comes to trade or buy something i don't say a word and blast the soviet and chinese anthem on local freq
---
thank fuck, now i have a chance to get a zealots limb damage rolling pin instead of a ghoulslayers right arm with +1 ***agility.***  
---
woo
---
Why the hell would I waste carry capacity on armor when I have perfectly good power armor? It's not my fault Bethesda made it impossible to do anything besides kill and (sometimes) trade in Power Armor.
---
Just hold down the B button and it exits any terminal completely!
---
Ark, good! DayZ, bad!
---
I know, I'm not wasting my scrap for this stupid event.
---
Reported.
---
What effects do the owlet nuggets give?
---
and thats a problem because...?
---
I use it to get rid of the horrendous weight of crap like missiles that I don’t want. Selling it is basically giving it away and sometimes you just can’t give it away.
---
I...know...
---
The vaulttec dlc for fo4 had pieces that did this :/
---
Yeah I can help
---
Warframe does it nicely in that dailies for Nightwaves persist for a few days (only worth 1k each) and clearing out your entire weekly stock of challenges actually brings up a few from the previous week to do if you failed to do them.
---
Considering they unbanned dupers, I'd have to say this statement is fact.
---
Just accept you can't keep a lot of stuff in your stash. I was used to have one(or multiple) of each gun in every fallout game before 76. Now I just keep the weapons I have on me and my stash is just filled with junk and ammo that I think i'm going to use.
---
The other gripe I have with the game is that there's not that many sidequests. I feel there are more daily quests than anything else. And they can get tiresome after a while. I'm one of those who is actually enjoying the daily challenges the legendary run offers me as they give me a goal to reach. Don't know if I'm gonna keep playing after it ends, tho. I might just get off for a while until the next season comes along.
---
If you're on pc you can press esc. I dont know if theres an instant exit for console. Maybe it's the map button because that's what esc is.
---
Lost my shielded lining.
---
Hey thanks!! Please let me know when you’re available
---
if you want to waste steel like a chump go ahead, being a sucker isnt illegal.
---
You now only need 1 blood sample and the t type. If it glitches quit to main menu then close app. Also helps to try it in a public server
---
Lmao 😅
---
Jokes on them since we know they'll auto-complete. Only cute noobs are donating thinking they're making a difference.
---
Oof. I know. It’s a pain in the ass! The loot bag itself looks cool, but it’s functionality is atrocious.
---
subatomic#6746 I'll be on in an hour and a half hopefully
---
What kind of weapon are you using currently and how did you obtain it? Is it a legacy? Or a bloody explosive? Do you have the circus trailer, insurgent/treasure hunter outfit, standing/sitting gorilla plans learned? Or maybe a deathclaw mask? If so please, tell me how you got all those rare items and plans. 
---
Without us there would be hardly any b2525, be, je fixers in existence. Scorchbeast queen would be almost impossible. Love us or hate us, the dupers are what makes this game fun.
---
It has to be in your inventory - unlike most other things where the game will gladly use your stash...
---
If you want to bitch about an event in a video game, go ahead, being a dick isnt illegal
---
Seriously, if it were any other game, where mods hadn't been supported on nearly identical previous versions, they could maaaybe hide their ineptitude in the shroud of the unknown of the engine, but Fallout development is an open book, and pathetically easy to develop for.
---
You can't lie to us, we know how stupid easy it is. Just do what we tell you or let us do it ourselves. There's a reason there's a community bug fix mod for every game they've ever made. I can't respect their "Independence" when I taught myself how to do their f\*\*\*ing jobs back in Morrowind at 15 years old.
---
I have a legacy JE flamer and i need that fuel boy 👀👀
---
Damn people are actually donating hundreds of thousands? Yea that's crazy I didnt even expect dupers to drop that much. Aren't we pretending everytime we play a game though? When you kill the Master in fallout 1 does it actually matter? Of course not it's a video game we just get immersed in the story and pretend we achieved something when all we did is click some buttons in a game lol. I just dont see what's wrong with people spending their resources how they or why it necessitates insulting them because you disagree with it
---
Stable flux you get from the queen will disappear if you die. Stable flux you get from other sources (trading) drops in a bag.   
---
I know.  I traded a really nice bloodied combat shotgun for a lot of flux.  On my way back to my camp some random molerats bit my bloodied ass and killed me.  My junk that dropped still had the the 1000 flux. 
---
That was my most "fuck I hate this game- Oh thank God" moment when I retrieved the loot from my bag.
---
That must be a bug... super mutants don’t surrender!
---
Yeah my work productivity has dropped immensely.
---
I never even thought of that 🤦‍♂️ lmao thank you!
---
Why did you say that?
---
imagine shilling so hard, that you think that this event is complete dogshit.
---
This isn't an MMO and even MMO's have catch-up mechanisms in place for people that actually have lives or other interests.
---
Thanks
---
1. Nope. You can move specials after level 50 (1 point per level) OR pick a new perk. But it can be time taking to build your character if you totally mess it up. Here is a planner for you  [Build planner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
2. You can buy most weapon plans from different vendors, while mods for weapon are learned by scrapping said weapons (mostly). Here is a good doc for you:  [Mod Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311)
---
3. No it is not. Atleast for a player who has been in game for awhile. There are no new or exclusive plans that you can get from it.  [Event loot tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc97GKtc*_Pq0kHgxGs4DBjUkPtnQBA)

4. Acid is one of the harder materials to come by. Another link to help you:  [Where to farm all things](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit#)
---
5. No. Mods are not officially supported by bethesda, but they do not restrict the use of them. If they wanted to they could disable all of them with a switch of a button (like they do in Nuclear Winter). People (like me) have been using mods from day 1 and nobody has gotten banned for using them.
---
EDIT: And just because you are new and most likely want to know everything about legendary weapon prefixes and amounts of damage you can do  [Weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
because they have been ungrateful shits in every game.
---
I think it's because they fucked up the rendering on the new shiny effects that are on the bigger rewards and these effects stay even after the item is claimed.
---
I know, it was more for the cathartic effect. I'm just really disappointed, and I've been carrying that around for far too long. It has deeply saddened me that something that once brought me so much joy, and entertainment is now something I want to avoid like a disease ridden prostitute.
---
Just donate all your stuff to us and get your Plasma Gun and brand new X-0.01 armor!
---
Also they patched it so it's much more convenient to get rid of and purchase mass quantities of ammo if you hadn't used it since the update
---
I've tried 4 times but nothing
---
Right, I forgot everybody goes apeshit over unyielding. I just scrip it whenever I see it. I ran out of things to spend caps on about a hundred levels ago
---
What did you do with him and did it follow the guidelines on prisoners set by the Geneva Convention?
---
I literally got 4 super sledges and a bone hammer in 5 straight legendary drops. All after I had maxed my scrip for the day. WTF
---
Yeah I have a full set of the camo one crafted, sadly I removed my cosmos jetpack but I’ll get that from the legendary run. Thanks for the answer
---
Snitches.
---
You sir are a legend, now i will go back to my pirate ways and steal from the brotherhood because they have far to much steel and i want some.
---
We don't know. It was removed from the road map so we'll just have to hope it comes out eventually.
---
I have to go in every time I play and reselect the emotes I’ve paid for or else they don’t work. Annoying.
---
If you can’t tell that you were whining, then that’s problem number 1. I mean this whole thing is ridiculous. Straight up, you can’t compare duping aka cheating for gain to glitches utilized for building a structure. You just can’t. And if you really think I’m wrong, then you have no business in this game. Sometimes I think Reddit is a magnet for the most toxic individuals and slowest thinkers. I tried to talk some sense into you, but that clearly was a mistake. Go ahead and downvote me to prove my point.
---
I hope to god we aren't forced to side with the bos I want to side with the Enclave and destroy the bos :)
---
It is just as bad.
---
I mean this was pretty obvious, but good for letting the blueberrys know.....
---
Hello Sara!! I admire your post first off! Secondly i run and started a community of peaceful fallout 76 players over a year ago. First was 20 now we are over 1.5k and on all platforms. We do have lore we built and RP for fun but its not mandatory lol
---
What started as a way to help people not only in game but those who deal with social anxiety and depression too. A charismatic bunch of people whos only goal is to make the game and others lifes better and injoy time with one another. More then just a faction or community, we are a family!
---
If you or anyone who see thos is interested feel free to hmu by message or look at my post history for details. 
---
We are the Pkoa thats Peacekeepers of Appalachia. And to anyone who is friendly and non toxic we welcome with open arms.
---
Hope ypu have a blessed day friend and hope to see you out there!
---
Thank you for your time.
---
-Red
---
Can confirm, went to Gilman Lumber thinking it would be an easy one to knock out with woodchucker equipped, boy was I wrong.
---
yeah because pressing a button on a box 50 times is so immersive. such good story telling. really good that we got this instead of an objective that would bring people together like last time we had one of these events.
---
In all honesty I'd take a free states update over BoS. You k ow some of those bastard gotta be held up in some bunker somewhere. Makes more sense than a BoS division we've never heard of showing up here lol
---
I haven't even talked to that BOS simp and don't plan to.
---
what is it with them and duffel bags.
---
I liked the Halloween event but I hated the lag that came with it. Would've been the best event if I knew wtf was going on half the time I played it lol
---
Man I would have to leave it for later if you don’t mind. It’s almost 1 am here and I gotta get up early tomorrow.
---
Yea it is definitely happening quite a bit for me these days.
---
But it goes to waste if you donate. Make ammo instead.
---
Division 2s seasons are easy as hell. Your rank xp is shared with your season xp.
---
So you level your endgame stats and your season rank at the same time.
---
Its better than nothing, and fuel is hard to come by and expensive to make too
---
In real life, a nuclear reactor is in fact just the heat source for a steam turbine (boiling water to make steam to turn a turbine to generate electricity.) Nuclear reactors we have today utilize fission, but fusion would function the same way.
---
In Fallout 2, the car we use is powered by power cells, which means it's basically just an electric motor powered by batteries.
---
If the cars in the Bethesda Fallout games do use nuclear reactors, then they're basically also running on electricity, with the nuclear (fusion) reactor functioning by first generating heat through the fusion reaction, which is then used to boil water and generate steam, which is then used to turn a turbine, which is then used to generate electricity, which then runs the electric engine of the car. Unless it's a magic car, which can turn fusion into power for the car in some way that we don't understand.
---
Either way, nuclear reactors wouldn't cause a nuclear explosion the same way nuclear weapons would. Nuclear reactors would melt down, and any explosion therein would most likely be caused by steam build up.
---
Then again, we could also discuss the concept of fusion cores, because if they exist, and they're referred to as "long-term nuclear batteries" in the wiki, then clearly there's some kind of nuclear magic going on in that world. In the real world, a fusion core would, if such a thing were to exist in the first place, be a miniature nuclear reactor, wherein fusion would be heating water, turning it into steam, which would be turning a turbine, which would be generating power. However, a turbine that fits in a fusion core wouldn't be much more powerful than a bicycle dynamo. Hence, personally I've always just considered the fusion cores as really really powerful batteries, since that would at least make a lot more sense to me.
---
In the buildable fusion generator itself, we can kind of see (or at least imagine) the outline of a steam turbine, so it's at least plausible that the fusion generator would in fact be a miniature version of a real reactor, wherein fusion is being used to turn a steam turbine and thus generate electricity, and to that end, the fusion core that is slotted into the fusion generator *might* just be the battery being used to give the jump required to start the fusion reaction within the generator.
---
Now, if we look at cars in general, they typically require fuel to run. Cars in the Fallout world also require fuel to run, as evident from the Red Rocket fueling stations. And, as the wiki also points out, some cars in the Fallout world do use some kind of combustible liquid fuel. *That* might be what's causing the cars to explode, and the mushroom cloud is just an artistic flair.
---
In any case, since the nuclear power generation in the Fallout world is pretty much magical, and doesn't seem to have much basis in reality, we could agree that a small vehicle could also work as a magical fusion generator.
---
But then again, cars have trunks, so maybe it's just a car, with a trunk, that you use as your stash.
---
I'm in Australia so it might be a bit hard but I'll try and wake up early tomorrow for you
---
russle dorsey is like the embodiment of the type of person who would actual waste mats on this event. move mountains for someone they have never met and will 100% fuck them over.
---
There is no community event. Bethesda will not allow this event to fail. Donating wastes your resources.
---
Day later still no luck entering the mine, another player was beside me and walked right inside though.
---
Good read - it's always interesting hearing other people's point of view.  Fair enough.
---
The player could also fire a nuclear missile at their base at Modus request... or Modus could simply make an orbital strike against them, so I would say the odds are against the BoS in this case.
---
Really? You really think that the US generals were not aware of all the atrocities the pre-war America was doing, including against its own population?
---
And again, much like any important politician, a general would be a VIP when it came to evacuate them in an emergency... and it’s exactly what happened: while only one general sided with Eckhart, more had arrived at the Whitespring bunker, but Eckhart had them killed.
---
So, no, I think we can safely assume that no US army general suddenly fell on the lap of the BoS.
---
its ugly as fuck. looks too clean to even be a "junkyard" skin.
---
Think about it logically. You have fingers thicker than a book. You’re hardly doing anything sensitive like manipulating small components and mixing chemicals, are you? And you sure as hell ain’t sleeping in power armor. Then there’s the fact it’s too big for most of not all chairs.
---
And if I recall, you were the one whinging and bitching about how easy it is to die outside of power armor. I gave you a solution, albeit not one you like. The ultra light mod takes off most of the weight.
---
Lost my flux rewarded from Scorched Earth today, when some jerk in power armor literally muscled me out of the way of my own dropped loot bag before I could get my reticule hovered over it. I don't even know how he knew it was there, it was buried under the SBQ with just a tiny bit of blue sticking out. That new free loot bag annoys me, with how precise you have to be with your reticule in order to take from it. This mofo had it down, though. Hoovered up my shit in a second. Thanks for attending my bitch sesh. I feel ready to let it go now.
---
Thank you, you sound like a great ground.  I am though looking for a more personable situation.  Your group I might get lost in.  Not sure
---
Yes you did.
---
Ahhhhh! Got you. Thanks!
---
Tbh, i dont see whats so difficult about allowing eletrical lines to pass through walls, or why double sided walls werent implemented sooner, or why we still face bugs that stop us from placing fences, or bugs that put an object a floor above us then where we wanted to put it
---
In any case lets hope this implemented for free and soon
---
Yea it can't fail, but if we don't hit the go's there's no extra "reward" hence the event. I'm sure if none of the goals were hit there'd be a story about how the BoS scavenged enough materials to fortify it themselves but that's not really the point here. The point is they're trying to make us as a community come together for a common goal. Something this community hates doing, apparently.
---
You can only have one ally at a time.
---
So was this confirmed to be just a visual bug?
---
Yep, it's blocked, can't get in.
---
Just fix your handmade at a weapons bench, lol. Fixers and combat rifles are good too
---
At the moment you may only place one ally's item at a time.
---
No, I’m not gonna downvote. There is absolutely no point in doing so. But how is tossing a few figures around and explaining the consequences of such long odds whinging exactly?
---
Qoodchucker does not work for that daily. Basically qhat you pull without it equipped is what goes into the challenge.
---
Yes, i had this happen to me over a year ago. So not a new bug/glitch.
---
Just go to the encrypted event
---
Ugh
---
But Bethesda wouldn't let a (Technically) Newly added faction be destroyed like that so quickly, and ok maybe there aren't anymore generals for the BoS but the COULD hack the system into thinking they are Generals (It is just an elevator with a Handprint ID after all)
---
I prefer paratrooper bag for my dead loot. It sinks into the ground sometimes.
---
Fair enough friend. Wish you the best nmw
---
I won’t donate because I refuse to let Bethesda walk on my nuts. They’re giving us diluted Christmas presents that have just been reskinned. I’d rather throw the steel in a fissure site.
---
How do I get a fixer? I saw the handmade plan at a vendor at white spring and I found a few combat rifle blueprints... also, how do I get an automatic receiver for the combat rifle?
---
I personally like it. I'm partial to PA skins though as I am exclusively a PA user.
---
Why would I donate steel for bad rewards? Ammo is more important. 
---
How does this event bring people together? You drop off junk and leave. I never see people there on the map.
---
Ya it seems any extra emote outside of the Fo1st ones just eventually disappear. The salute one from the special edition has been gone for over a month.
---
Damn that sucks
---
It still has the hit box of a paper bag
---
Might have to let you know tomorrow after work, or Friday that I can stay up late no problem

I’ve always been on Xbox but when the new consoles come out we are getting a PS5. Gonna play those exclusives. That will probably be the end of this game for me
---
File a bethesda support ticket and they will progress quest for you
---
This list just made the one intern they have working on NW call in sick for the rest of the week.
---
Do we know if that’s something they plan on changing
---
When that raider boss was like “your lucky I don’t kill you where you stand” I would’ve said “I’m a bloodied death claw gauntlet/heavy guns build that dishes out 1200 damage in one swing, and your going to threaten me?”
---
I noticed this too but didn't think much of it since my carry weight wasn't affect. Just assumed it wasn't changing the effects page since none of my stats looked different. On Ps4.
---
Yes its now a quest reward although i dont remember which 1 that is sorry
---
Post it!  I'd love to see this jackass
---
This didn't age well.
---
Yes, exploits being in the game and abused is bad. But seemingly exploits are patched ages before desired functionality is (re)introduced, if it is at all.
---
Every patch introduces so many bugs, often breaking stuff that was working perfectly the patch before. I'm more worried about their "fixes" making more work for the company than a small number of the playerbase doing so with their exploits.
---
We still have hacked weapons, hacked power armors, hacked wedding rings, endlessly duped godroll and legacy items, consumables, junk, and ammo, aimbots and wallhacks, and so on. If the goal was to defeat exploits and the fruits of their labor ASAP, how come these hacked weapons haven't been removed from the game despite being here since earlier this year?
---
And how about stuff that is just endlessly broken? Scorchbeast Queen can't be crippled since Wastelanders: the fix is to remove the limb damage immunity perk from her, that's it. Are they worried the aforementioned hacked weapons will let her die too quickly? The magic damage bug? How come those aren't being prioritized? Energy weapon damage vs armor is being calculated incorrectly, making them complete garbage compared to a ballistic weapon. Is the worry that fixing this formula would make the legacy explosives even more overpowered than they are? Then why not just replace the explosive effect on those weapons with 25% FFR?
---
Yes, duping is bad™. But all the issues above more negatively affect the average player's gameplay severely more. The prioritization of issues is really disconnected from what the players are experiencing. And if you think about it, the issues they tend to fix (or at least the ones we know about) seem very related to the company's ability to make money as opposed to players' enjoyment of the barebones gameplay loop.
---
A area that's like public workshop. The building part not the getting shoot in the back part. We can build it up and defend it.
---
Do the Encrypted event when it pops up on your server. It has the potential to reward the plan for The Fixer. The better option is to buy the plan from a player for 7k - 8k. To get new mods for guns, you have to scrap that same type of gun. 
---
If you find a combat rifle on an enemy and you scrap it, you have a chance that a random mod for it unlocks.
---
That would be great and I think it would be implement with very little code.
---
And In the end none of the workers got the bonuses they were promised lol.
---
If Proctor Ingram could keep the Prydwyn alfoat in power armor, why can't I make a simple weapon at a workbench?
---
You missed the whole point of my post, YOU CAN'T USE THE TERMINAL IN POWER ARMOR. You just latched onto one tiny part of my comment and ran with it because you clearly don't understand the problem, it's not a feature, it's another bug. Bethesda are fucking morons and made it so your head goes through the screen making in unreadable. It's a fucking bug and it needs to be fixed. Stop trying to defend their bullshit. I don't actually give a shit about how defenseless I am outside power armor, I've only ever died outside PA because (surprise!) a fucking bug made the enemy spawns at my camp location invulnerable.
---
Personally I haven't needed to craft ammo since getting the mini ammo machine from the raiders.
---
We're all working towards the same goal. It's like fundraisers in school. You all work to get that school trip except out school trip is BoS reskins and meat week.
---
Damn about 60 hours of game time snap this one up whether you play it now or not.
---
Tbh we all should , it needs to get shutdown and get a complete bug fix &amp; glitch fix (yes i know it would never happen) so this game would be what it should , Amazing
---
Ps4 has it, real weird
---
No.
---
Alright I’ll try and find one then... thanks for the help!
---
It goes through the screen? I always thought it went under. Yeah, that is totally ridiculous. But Ingram has spent literally years adapting to that PA frame, and you only came out of the Vault a year ago. But hey, there’s always being literally a god of the wastes... To be honest I don’t understand it either.
---
And invincible spawns really pissed me off when I was in the Bog, so now I had my camp near site Alpha. Far enough there aren’t any spawns, and I’m on an acid node that’s underwater, I can grow crops, use water purifiers etc.
---
Playing any bethbyro game on a console seems quite nauseating.
---
Both handmade and combat rifles are excellent choices.
---
Id say the explosive 10mm SMG you get as a questreward from the quest in tge waterpark is also good early on, but i dont know if its affected by guerilla or commando
---
The best way to exit the ammo converter is to scrap it entirely. As a UX designer the design of it is just so frustrating.
---
Huh... it’s almost like I’ve seen tons of other people use this joke before making it unfunny... weird...
---
Good to know, but I checked and it was definitely only counting each collecting of wood as 1, not each piece
---

The “Fractured Steel” title of the winter season could point in that direction, plus, lore wise it wouldn’t make sense for an operational BoS branch to exist in the east coast by the time Elder Lyons group travel to the east, which we know for a fact passed through Pittsburgh (FO3’s Pitt), which lies further both of Appalachia, on their way to Washington.
---
Quite the detour if they could have just gone to Appalachia instead, which would have taken them more directly to Washington.
---
Considering that the BoS couldn’t get inside the Dam building, which is only locked with regular door locks, I very much doubt so (seriously, check the terminals, notes, holotapes, etc., at the Grafton Dam: the BoS claimed they couldn’t get past some normal locked doors).
---
I'm afraid someone will search him.
---
Dupers are too busy posting and showing off their dupeing power on FB trade sites.
---
Look dont get me wrong I of course would rather have a fasnacht or meat week style event where everybody could come together and goof off but bethesda is trying something new and I appreciate the attempt to mix it up even if it's not what I'd want an event to be. No I wouldn't find clicking a button 50 times immersive but clicking it 4 times and knowing the story reason why (to build up the brotherhood base) and honestly if Godd Howard demands my cork then he can fuckin have all of it.
---
No problem on PS4
---
And most MMOs are considered second jobs by large swaths of their playerbases. I don't think anyone wants 76 to also feel like a job.
---
It's 2020, we can ask for a better designed gameplay loop that's simultaneously pro-player AND pro-game studio.
---
Have you tried opening the legendary run from the main menu and from in game to see if there’s a difference? And on a private server?
---
You've never heard of the old flaming bag of poop prank?
---
They sure did! That is what's commonly referred to as a fucking lie.
---
I refuse to quit playing......
---
Their idea and our idea of "rare plans" is somewhat different.
---
It would never be that Bethesda would Add a faction then delete it again
---
And I think fractured steel means 'The BoS disobey Maxon's orders and say.........Launch a nuke
---
And with the door thing AnYtHinG iS PoSSiBLe
---
It’s fun....
---
&gt;People like you man. Your comment was constructive thank you.
---
Really, you seem to know me so well from one comment? I am trying to point out that your definition of MMO is clearly not what I would call it, or would most other players of said MMO's. There's a lot of misinformation out there on the interwebs, I'm not talking about other outlets that also mislabel games, I am talking to you, mr OP. Let's take those letters **MMO.**
---
Massivly Multiplayer Online game. OK, it is multiplayer and online...it's the massive part that does not fit. Firstly, most MMO's are ***persistent***. Meaning the game universe stays alive when you are not logged in. Games like Everquest, World of Warcraft, Star Wars Galaxies (RIP). FO76 does not do this. When you log off, for all intents and purposes, the world ceases to exist. And it is only 24 players at once, even when active, that is a far reach from the word **massive**, would you not agree?
---
&gt; I also have a right to be upset with the game that lacks engaging content that other games in it's similar genre do have. 
---
That's my point, it is not a similar genre, you want it to be, but it is clearly not an MMO. Stop trying to shoehorn mechanics that work in a persistent world into one that does not persist. You will never be happy with what you expect versus what can technically be delivered.
---
&gt; If it's not an mmo, mmorpg, mmo-lite, looter shooter, or an open world adventure, what kind of game is it supposed to be?
---
Ahhh, see, now I have made you think about it, good. Well, that's the heart of the matter, a question that only those who made it can answer with any authority. It is not ***any*** genre, it scratches a unique itch now doesn't it. It combines many aspects of many other games in a unique way, I would loosely call it an online multiplayer RPG.
---
&gt; I was using you as a generalization, I'll make sure you make that a point next time. Sorry you misunderstood the language. 
---
Nah. I just caught you out on your own hypocrisy. Also, judging from your non-apology, add insincerity to that list too.
---
It's clear that you're coming from an intellectually dishonest position. There's really no point discussing this any further with you.
---
I think the Overseer is. Sutton would be a pretty nice 76 dweller town.
---
&gt; "No the event is actually really good, guys, and these awards are such a nice bonus."
---
...said no one. 
---
C’mon - you don’t need to fabricate a fucking story to make a point. Everyone knows it sucks. No one is defending it - even the fanboys/girls.
---
Lmfao, poor intern! They’re trying their best but 😬
---
No. Having an open mic means having your mic sending even though you're not talking...
---
This means everyone gets to hear your heavy breathing, your dog barking, or your baby crying, or every click of your stupid loud mechanical keyboard.   
---
Adjusting the sensitivity threshold on your mic, or just using Push To Talk, are ways to avoid it. 
---
You can also mute players who have open mics.
---
I currently have 215 steel in my stash. Not really going out of my way for either. If I happen to be in the area and acquire 250 steel then maybe i'll donate but it's definitely not something i'm really gonna worry about.
---
I don’t think so. I’ve had speed demon since beta and it hasn’t changed at all......
---
Or just enter the hellscape battleground known as Poseidon Energy and earn those cores like a champ
---
I'm not sure how it clips, just that it does making it unusable. Not that I'd call it usable in the first place anyway. 
---
I had to move that camp, even if they aren't invincible, half the time they spawned underground. Still could wreck half my camp though. The repair costs were too high. Luckily my new location is super unpopular, only had to switch servers once in a month, instead of almost every day before.
---
Our dailies seem to be making sure Bethesda gets off their arse and actually fix the shit that matters most to the community.
---
Sadly these daily challenges don't autocomplete.
---
Same in PS4 lol
---
There has been dozens of posts about the same thing here on this sub.. But here you go (they update the page like once a day it seems)  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Thank you very much
---
Seems like you ain’t to good at pvp. And melee sucks for sure. You are going to get wrecked before you have a chance to attack....
---
If we want communication, we will have to gather 3 radio vacuum tubes and give them to Bethesda. That's how it works.
---
Oh... Oh no...
---
That's really awesome! The assaultron was one of the main reasons miner miracles was put off until i finished literally everything else lmao
---
Get you some guns and bullets 5 they give u more scrap from guns , which means more steal and plastic!!
---
No
---
Dense and fireproof = totally immunity
---
Sadly this will never happen unless Bethesda loses enough players or revenue to force their hand.
---
It's by design that they want us to login and play a little every day than play a lot a few times a week. Balances out server load, make the servers look more active and, most importantly, it gives more opportunities to tempt people into spending money in the Atomic Shop, to catch up on Score ranks or finally cave and purchase Fallout 1st to get some inventory management relief.
---
Happens to me all the time on the Manhunt event. VATS works on all the super mutants except Mad dog.
---
You threw up?
---
I cancelled mine as well. Bethesda is completely tone deaf and treats this game as a revenue stream to fund projects like Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls.
---
Ok thanks for telling me
---
Yeah I did it right now, hopefully they can help me
---
We'll make our own faction... With blackjack and hookers.
---
They'll never do this. They hate working on this game more than they have to.
---
Yeah, i only started playing when wastelanders came out and i really do enjoy the game. Fo1st looks convenient and is very tempting... But i just don't think it's worth it and i definitely don't want to fall for their money grabbing tactics bc that's really all it is.
---
I wouldn't care is Bethesda stole this idea and claimed it their own, at least it's what we wanted. Keep the other factions though
---
Calling it now they got rid of it because they’re gonna sell double sided walls on the Atomic shop
---
Haven't tested this myself but there was a post yesterday claiming explosive splash damage does not cripple anymore, only the target you actually hit.
---
I still grind this game the same way I did many an RPG growing up. I have seen the sun rise, and set on more sessions than I care to admit, but it feels limiting now. Like they are telling me how I should play the game instead of just letting me enjoy it the same way I have done for years with hundreds of games. Every time I hit that time gate that is subtly saying 'sorry, better luck tomorrow', I get pissed. I want to keep playing the game, but the game is telling me that it doesn't want to play anymore.
---
As much as i would love to see this it will NEVER happen.. They want you to log in every single day to check out atomstore and increase the chance you buy atoms.
---
EDIT: And why would you want to lower the amount of scrip/caps/bullion we get per week? Right now we get 1050 scrip (+dailies), 9800 caps and 1700 bullion (+200 more bullion if you no-life it and log in every 20h) each week.
---
Save your steel, friend. It's so not worth it.
---
I had 9 bulk steels in my inventory (so, 270 total) and it didn't work. Do I have to unbulk it?
---
There’s a pixel shortage.
---
I don't even know
---
It’s still not great but does work a lil more efficiently. I’m not on ps4 but if you hold down the back bottom, circle for ps4 it’ll log you out of any terminal.
---
Don't worry they're going to lie and say we exceeded the goal by like 2 million steel probably. Gotta make their player number look good.
---
Not sure, but it seems likely.
---
Well now it lags so fucking bad when firing a Tesla or explosive laser, you can easily just free aim and take us out 🤣
---
Maybe one if the Devs has a friend who's a Kleptomaniac.
---
You can hold the button to close it as well.
---
I was gonna agree then remembered it's just a game and those materials aren't real so why the fuck do I care? Gonna donate twice now and not even claim the rewards
---
I’ve donated only 25 steel? am I gonna get the rewards of the goals are met, or no? Is there a limit?
---
OP Weapons shouldn't be allowed in PvP. PvP should be melee only, bare fist. It's more competitive that way. What's the point in PvP when you automatically know who's going to win. It's just target practice then.
---
this is my "fix" (cancel 1st): [https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/)
---
Vats doesn't work in PvP with most weapons since wastelanders. Did you use vats? 
---
Pretty sure that's your issue
---
&gt;Most of the loudest defenders on here say it's a freaking MMO.
---
See my comment below about misinformation on this topic, this sub is ripe with misinformation, something I like to address here and there.
---
And speaking of misinformation...
---
&gt; It's a halfbaked and very poorly implemented looter shooter
---
Yes, if you were expecting a looter shooter, it would appear poorly implemented. I would consider games like Borderlands, Destiny and The Division looter shooters. The progress mechanic is the loot that is dropped, hence the name. FO76 has so many other ways to progress, if you are looking at it from only the loot drop perspective, you are going to be disappointed. The loot is just a bonus for accomplishing all these difficult things in the world, you know, the rich story and amazing writing that goes into the questing.
---
I should probably crawl back under my rock now and let all you youngun's fight over what you think FO76 is, for me it's a giant world to get lost in....for hours. It's the journey, not the finish line that makes games like this memorable. Slow down, wander off in some direction you have never been before, if you don't like that, maybe it's time to move on.
---
I like it. Maybe rename it? I liked a name someone else gave. City 76. Or maybe Reclamation.
---
Do your weeklies. Do your dailies, EVERY DAY.
---
By the people for the people
---
Cold Hard Cash
---
Isn't that the same mindset that wiped out every other faction in Appalachia from the Scorched?
---
Revolutionary.
---
The more I find out about these bugs..the more glad I am that I didn't purchase the game but playing through gamepass..I'm exactly stuck on that mission and lo what I find here...it's bugged
---
Wasn't the prydwen repaired specifically to travel to the Commonwealth? To my knowledge, the lore was that it had never been used by the Brotherhood before then...
---
my fix: (cancel 1st and stop playing) [https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/)
---
And we rode the Hasselhoff, and we brought the crown back!
---
I’m not donating so much as a wood scrap. The best part about this event is farming the dumbasses slugging into Atlas with hundreds of pounds of junk on them. “This level 19 cant kill me, I should be ok to hit back, no way I’ll die and drop all my shit” 🤣
---
Although the aesthetics are nice I'm the Mire, I HATE it there, all the bugs you can't see, the annoying terrain. Almost all of it.
---
I prefer a Gargantuan Tick tbh.  Ticks are more terrifying.
---
Here he is: https://imgur.com/a/Z7BAA5L
---
Depending how you ask.
---
Nocturnal isn't that bad.... at least at night lol
---
Had a friend how runs a nocturnal stealth build back in the past and he deals good dmg. (the stealth part will help you though the day)
---
Oh don’t you worry I have more steel ready for BOS when they arrive...😂😎
---
And don't forget she asked us to help raiders . . . I want her coat more than I want anything to do with her
---
It has the same hit box as the brown bag.
---
I'm pretty sure that's intentional, so you cant loot it until the person dropping it moves off.
---
Yeah what's wrong with a little genocide now and then
---
I want infinite screws. Something to do with the assaultron helmet? Or did it already get patched?
---
Yeah. We're the ones who stormed a fortified gold vault and repaired the reactor. We're the ones who rebuilt the economy using gold. We're the ones that fought through the Mire, Ash heap, and other areas. We're the ones that launched nukes at the scorchbeast nests, and then killed the queen ourselves. We're the ones who did everything the Brotherhood couldn't do.
---
First time I've been called young in a couple decades. A few even.
---
I expected some level of cooperative RPG with light shooting and decent loot. And was disappointed on most levels. The story is decent, but very short for an RPG. I guess masterpieces like Mass Effect completely ruined my ability to accept such paltry effort in a presumptive RPG.
---
The people screaming about it being an MMO are using it as a defense against its very obvious shortcomings and insanely intensive time gating.
---
I'm glad that spending days slowly wandering the world of FO76 make you happy. But that's not what the game was marketed as. Not what I bought it for.
---
Just making sure.
---
Yes it's a new keyboard but did you purchase a faulty keyboard? 
---
Have you tested a different keyboard?
---
Same issue. Go fucking figure
---
Technically the fastest way is give Bethesda your money.
---
Other than that, do all your daily and weekly challenges, create a high INT character and buff INT further with food/chems/building public team. Buff your +XP, again through food/chems/lunchboxes. and grind anything that dumps XP.
---
Some of us have alts that could single handedly complete this event, but we’re not donating shit 🤣. I have millions of every single junk item Bethesda, come fucking get it.
---
Nope.  Ad Victoriam!
---
It's a very uncommon bug.  I've only had it happen maybe 3 times in the last 120 hours of gameplay.  It also works consistently outside of fallout.
---
just canceled mine too: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/)
---
As already said. Real money is the fastest. If that's not an option. Do all the daily and weekly challenges. Lastly do the repeatable challenge (10kexp) many many times.
---
If anybody is looking for a great base building game (and so much more) look into No Man’s Sky. Unlike Fallout they got their shit together eventually and are continually updating it!
---
Well you didn't miss out on anything then, ignorance is bliss as they say and it's working as intended now so best not to dwell on it
---
Are people really giving all their junk away for re-skinned Xmas presents?
---
You mean like the Responders, Fire Breathers or Free States?
---
You are entitled to your own opinion on what Fractured Steel may refer to, but lore-wise it would make far more sense to exit the BoS again, in order to avoid a canon contradictions with FO3.
---
If you want a more tangible example of BoS failing to breach pre-war security, the central premise of Operation Anchorage is precisely that: the Outcasts are unable to breach security and are forced to seek someone with an interface that allows them to complete the simulation.
---
Everything seems to point in the opposite direction of what you are assuming.
---
Not new happened months ago
---
Are you on ps4? Do you have plans I don't know? If so, I'm up for it.
---
Toast + Nutella + Bananas = Beast.
---
Why can't they just add a quit option on the screen? Why can't you see how much you have on hand to know if you can convert?(inside the interface) You have to know the amount of ammo on hand and the conversion rate or waste time trying without exiting machine and checking inventory. But you can't exit the machine without spamming back a hundred times if you're deep in to use.
---
Donated about 10k, got a bunch of plans I didn't already know. And a load of grenades. I'm pleased,  I like having lots of grenades. Friday is going to involve a lot of grenade throwing.
---
Lol
---
That's not what alliteration means.
---
Uh adrenaline perk is not fixed I repeat itz not fixed...biggest lie don't believe this months patch notes. Very embarrassing.....
---
As much as I hate the hitching, I think the hackers on PC would ruin the game even more for me.
---
You know he's just going to use it for assaultrons to destroy all humans, right?
---
Gets easier if you don't just slap random words though.  You can even start getting it first try.
---
Quickest way is to run through the end portion of the words provided.  Look for obvious stuff like "ing".  If a lot have it, then you pick that.  With that decision you either narrow it down to a set few with that ending, or eliminate over half the possibilities.
---
But generally it's a word with a bit in common with most of the others.  So by picking one with a major feature you end up landing on the right one a fair bit.
---
If it's one of those fancy gaming keyboards make sure you don't have a switch or profile toggled somewhere to disable certain keys.
---
Is it just me or since update 21 the sound (walking, gunshots etc.) of the game has been a lot worse and the frame rate has been so much worse as well.
---
I also found asides to the painful UI, the function also brings a cheaper source of mini nukes for my backup two shot 50% Crits Fatman(it shows 3200ish DMG in my pipboy, don't really felt it's correct though), I don't use it often, but I do like how I can save the adhesives/nuclear materials/screws anyway. Just only if the machines using the vendor UI though, otherwise I don't really wants to touch it too much
---
Hold circle
---
Your best bet is going to be fix your handmade. They are pretty cheap to repair. If scrap is the problem. depending on what rank you are on the legendary run I believe one of the rewards on the board is a few repair kits which fix your gun for free. Just inspect the weapon from the pipboy and it should give you the option to use the repair kit. 
---
As for everyone saying to get a fixer that is a good option but I recommend you use the combat rifle until 45. It’s easier to upgrade as you level up and you can get the plan to craft them for free by doing the motherload quest over at hornwright industrial. Craft a bunch and scrap them for the mods to create a full auto version. Then when your ready to upgrade to a fixer at 45 you’ll be all set because the fixer uses the same mods as the combat rifle. 
---
Edit: forgot to mention do not do the encrypted yet. You will get steamrolled at 35. The event is tricky even for high level long time players. And the fixer plans have a low drop rate. You could buy the plans but thats a lot of cap grinding at your level plus you would still need to scrap combat rifles because fixers can’t be scraped to learn mods. So your far better off with the combat rifle.
---
A quad Fixer with FF and a BE50 Handmade, most of the time.  I got them from the purveyor.I got the Circus Trailer and the Treasure Hunter hat from the event.I got the crazy guy mask and old man winter from the event.
---
The rest I do not have, and do not care.  I did not earn them.  My circle of friends feels the same way.
---
I/we kill the SBQ without anyone having duped or even legacy weapons all of the time.  It's not hard.
---
That's just it.  If everyone has it, then might as well that nobody has it.  The rarity is what drives people to continue.  The cheaters circumvent all of that grind and bonding with others to achieve something or earn something.  That's why you cheaters make real people sick.
---
Just stop trying to justify cheating. There are plenty of us out there who grind and love the game.  We don't half-step and unjustly gain advantages over others who do it the right way.  It's not a good trait to have in reality or fantasy,  it's as simple as that.
---
I'll give you some credit, you didn't blame Bethesda for your actions ... lol.
---
If you hold the back out button for 2 seconds, it will take you out of any terminal
---
Are you one pc?
---
Yeah I remember back in the early days of the game when I used to bulk junk to save space I kept re scrapping it by accident with the scrap all junk button 😅
---
Someone mentioned it in one of the broken perk cards list for patch 20. 
---
Back in the day I would run max rank fireproof and take no damage from scorched screams and now I run it on my alt and those screams cut her down like butter so maybe they did a sly nerf? Either way I don't run it anymore cause it's useless.
---
I'm kinda meh on it, was hoping it'd have some custom audio since it cost the same as the 2 pack of liberty prime skins. The color scheme does rock perfectly with my armored raider gas mask and riot advanced ranger armor tho. Would've liked it to be rustier.
---
Yes no difference on both public and private.
---
Same here. I have about 550 to 600 damage resistance depending on what armor I'm running and I still run from the flamer floaters.
---
Not just me then? Fuck a doodle doo
---
At this point in the run you're  either going to have to grind experience twelve hours a day + dailies and weeklies or you're going to have to pay for atoms... seems Bethesda has it working the intended purpose...
---
I disappear for one day and the community is up in arms about something else... What about camp stuff did they patch?
---
Fallout...77
---
Reclaimation sounds nice. It’d fit right in with Foundation and Crater. And... Atlas for the BoS? I don’t know, and according to a note, Russel doesn’t either.
---
I swear to christ if you try to sell us interior walls I’m gonna be fucking livid.
---
couldn’t have said it better bro
---
That would be immensely stupid but not surprising at all from Bethesda
---
I feel kind of guilty using the bulk method to get that weekly so I feel it's a fair trade off haha. it's only if you are using the bulk method that you need to scrap at the workbench, it counts if you are just scrapping like normal ie non bulked with the scrap box.
---
If no one can make “circular”/dodecagon bases anymore due to removing the door-to-wall swap, please release triangular foundation and roof pieces in order to do this in game normally. All the box houses are so boring as far as architecture goes. It would be great to get some new architecture types. 
---
 My base is a round build at the moment and if for any reason it gets moved or scrapped on accident, I will absolutely be refunding FO1st and finding something else to play. Took almost a full day to get it just right and now I’ll never be able to build anything like it. So lame to take away the ability to build something other than square boxes.
---
Agreed on all those things. But I’m happy with baby steps with Bethesda. At least its not broken after they fixed it
---
“It’s not a good trait to have in reality-“
---
Tell that to Bill Belichick, works great for him.
---
Like the others said, you dont need to spam the back button, just hold it down and it will take you out of any terminal
---
I'm sorry I didn't know that this whole time. I've been just backing out of terminals everywhere. has this been a fallout thing always or just 76?
---
Acronymation haha
---
More like: added double sided walls to atom shop in **camp revamp bundle** for 2400 atoms. Ughhh the development for this game is so lazy.
---
Mind you, moose bites can be pretty nasty
---
More like ass Victorium...
---
He. Good luck destroying me! Oh. Todd has already done that, and screwed me out of over 5000 atoms.
---
wastelanders just added NPC's and a full new storyline, the BOS are coming to Appalachia, and if you're talking about like the real time line? the brotherhood was formed right when the great war started. and the black market mostly crashed with the last dupe but it is still quite active
---
I prefer the old atom shop song as well
---
you should leave salt in his bag and take the rest
---
as long as there's one item in the bag it'll show on his map for him to run back to.
---
We should have a weekly cap of 1,400 gold bullion at the least, I don’t want to have 140 notes and have to log in every day of the week to spend it. It seems fair I don’t think there’s any disadvantage to it and it isn’t game breaking
---
I didn't play 1 or 2, but in 3 the main BoS faction was trying to protect the wastelanders from the super mutants and feral ghouls, while another faction was trying to grab all the tech toys from everyone else. The "Outcasts" (the ones collecting tech) also try to ambush and kill the Lone Wanderer after he opens a hidden armory for them ("Operation Anchorage" DLC) while the other faction (led by Elder Lyons) sends patrols to protect the  shipments of fresh water generated by Project Purity.
---
Put your flux into a tent before you go and loot the queen. That’s what I’ve started doing. The last mob that spawns always kills me with poison damage so now I just loot her after my junk is safe. It’s not like she is going anywhere. She dead.
---
reminds me of the mod I use on fallout 4 called ammo-o-matic. Lmao much easier than the in game version in 76
---
I've also noticed that if you hit the back button after depositing ammo it'll put you right at the screen to keep depositing the same ammo, instead of clicking through like 4 other screens to get back there.
---
It’s a flair. Idk how to add it on mobile but on pc it should be in the side bar above where the rules are.
---
Nope.  It works and stops working randomly.  Only in game though.
---
back bottom circle. not quoting but it's funny. thank you I didn't know you could hold back button for quick exit. how Did you learn this? is it a standard fallout thing? or just 76? should still be a quit option in there for us slow people.
---
I was gone for a day and I don’t even know what the community is so pissed about now... What did they do to the build system? Went to my camp and didn’t notice anything majorly wrong.
---
Heavy weapons and power armor go together like bread and butter and sneak and commando are the most op imo
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted but yeah, got a useless Gauss Shotgun last night and I guess it's further diluted the rng.
---
So roughly 300,000 individual donations
---
&gt;I expected some level of cooperative RPG with light shooting and decent loot.
---
That's a far cry from looter shooter, would you not agree? Of course it is going to have loot, rewards for you doing things, what game does not. You failed to mention the survival aspects. Mass Effect had no such needs for character survival, completely different pacing in an RPG like that, no? Again, you entered into it with some pre-conceived notion of what you wanted it to be, I did too. That's why I didn't play it at launch. Once I accepted it for what it is and does well, I can't get enough. Thank you for your comment, not being sarcastic.
---

---
My first advice is to use nukes and dragons. I can't stand that site haha
---
Can you explain the misunderstanding?
---
thanks
---
I can help with the entire set of challenges if you want.
---
&gt; They want more time spent in game
---
You misspelled 'money' (or 'atoms').
---
They want you to form a habit. It's a popular form of low key brainwashing that's an industry standard ever since Zinga made half the money in the world on a game about an imaginary farm. Your suggestion would negate that goal.
---
There is a scrap box at Atlas, and an armor and weapon bench just below Dorsey.
---
Eh.  If it's your thing.  I'm planning on using the black pa skin at the end of the legendary run when I get it.  Quantum x-01 is the best pa paint.
---
This happened to me in one violent night. Did not have time to try line in the sand yet and i think i also lagged when i had meat piles in my view.
---
At this point it's our fault for expecting anything beyond the bare minimum. They have shown us time and time again this game is simply here to make some money while they are developing major games like Starfield and Elder Scrolls.
---
Bethesda is clearly trying to maximize profits on a game they don't really seem to care much about. They put in the least amount of work to make the most profit. If they truly cared about the game or the Fallout brand, they would be investing much more into the development and growth of 76. That is clearly not the case.
---
I would think they would want to build this game up so when the Fallout tv show comes out in a couple of years (maybe) fans could have a game they could jump into and invest heavily in to try and catch up the average player base. At the rate they are going I don't see the game surviving the new console generation switch, which is quite sad to me.
---
Hopefully I'm wrong but only time will tell.
---
You're a bit late in the game to get all the rewards without paying. The only ways to advance are doing the dailys and weeklys. And the only one you can grind is 10k xp that gets you 100 score
---
Lol could you imagine if literally nobody donated. Theyre probably fudging the numbers anyway to falsely show others that the games not as dead as everyone thinks it is. This is nothing more than a large net cast to catch some new whales.
---
Exactly what ive been saying!
---
Thanks for the clarification, I was trying to upgrade it last night ...but nope!.. thankfully it didn't take any flux or ingredients everytime I tried as it has the option if you've already got the plans... Dammit.. really want that complete Camo look..on a side note the armor Camo looks sick👍
---
About the Legendary Run Ghillie Armor Skins: No
---
Commando really isn't op, tbh. Against a few enemies, sure, but when you have a horde of enemies, you just can't kill them quickly enough vs heavy guns.
---
This would make an amazing event
---
It's a cycle I've seen a couple of times now in this sub
---
You also forgot to include the "I'm unsubscribing from fallout 1st" people
---
While i understand people are upset, seeing a bunch of posts of people dropping their subscriptions gets tiresome to see.
---
I might give the Sneak/Stealth a shot, since I've been tinkering with Anti-Armor stuff in my Melee character.  It makes a much noticable difference.
---
I would make CHR 3 with tenderizer 3 and make AGI 15 and get Escape Artist.
---
Damn.
---
Aa is pointless with commando or heavys. Since you should be running tank killer or stabilzed. Those both already give you an aa effect so an aa weapon will give you sever diminishing returns
---
Edit, also in melee you should run incisor then aa weapons also wouldn't make a difference
---
Bloodied sneak I hit the queen for 350 a shot with fixer
---
You will find out through the story why the Brotherhood is there. Whoever told you they weren't a thing in the timeline yet lied to you.
---
r/DestinyTheGame is awful most of the time lol (with the occasional good posts)
---
However it seems alot of people are enjoying the current season from what I've seen so its not too bad right now
---
Seems to be that way.  I prefer just... *deep breath* using stimpaks.
---
He will definitely have a chance to spend atoms to complete it before it ends.
---
Yeah ditto they're weirdly one of the few creatures I treat with respect. Of course it was another reason not to bother with fireproof. ;)
---
For real? 😂 🤦‍♂️ Thanks
---
Oh the colossal problem was released all right. Its called patch 21.
---
Well, considering I know someone that finished the legendary run over a week ago. Then I would say yes. With enough XP buffs you can do that 10000XP challenge many times a day to catch up.
---
I don't think there's any intention to use it in Fallout 76; I believe it's only in the game's files because it was in the Fallout 4 engine which Fallout 76 was built upon.
---
That's not what I said.  I said against a large group of enemies, it's hard if not impossible to kill them all before they rush you.
---
Lol I remember hearing it on the tail end of a Gillette advert
---
How many characters can I have max, in the case I wanna run different character builds?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f335e88&amp;d=s01sq2s22sx0s32sr2pe2eh2cu0c72ic4s12ip2id2s72a04l71ls2lt2&amp;m=1c2fe3&amp;ad=03458
---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights
---
Using heavys you'll want to use pa for stabilzed. If you don't use pa you are missing out on a ruffly 28% damage boost as well as a huge accuracy buff
---
warhammer subreddits are this, its symptomatic of social media themselves
---
How is it taking people a couple of hours to finish SCORE challenges?
---
20 minutes tops to finish most, if not all of them combined each day.
---
Maybe every month or so there is a new building/city section? Farm/Walls/Water Purifier/Trade Post/Plumbing etc. Get given an ATLAS styled event. We get base 76 donation rewards, if we complete the donation events, we'd get special rewards once the building is complete.
---
Can introduce a game wide voting system. Each account gets a vote, each vote lasts a month.  These could be something simple non mechanical subjects 
---
* Town Name (City 76?, Reclamation?)
---
* Type of Memorial Statue for all the dead Appalachians
---
* Aesthetics for the buildings in the town
---
* Our Flag (You KNOW WE NEED A FLAG! Hell. Bethesda can do a flag contest, pick a few to go to finals, then we'd vote on it))
---
* If ghouls are allowed to stay
---
EDIT: Voting will need to be ranked-choice. First past-the-post is a horrible system
---
etc.
---
Or votes could be more mechanical, like once the essential buildings (walls, water purifier, farm etc) are completed we'd get to vote for the next building (casino/type of vendors, school/park/mine/scrapyard etc). These buildings would give different type of rewards/events.
---
The town can also have events:
---
* Defend the Walls: Scorched/Super Mutant/Blood Eagles are attacking the town and must be defended
---
* Clear the Sewers: The Sewers are flooded with monsters, clear them out
---
and more (I don't have many ideas for these events yet)
---
Could place it at Sutton? The sloping mountain around Vault 76? Its gotta take place around The Forest though, for lower level characters to visit.
---
This can take place over months/years IRL. It'd just be nice that we're doing something permanent, unique, and not just predestined. Also nice to have a place we'd call home.
---
I left for five days to help my aunt dig up her backyard so she can have a nice garden and when I can back I was so far behind I could’ve done every challenge on that weekly and Daily list for two weeks and still wouldn’t catch up
---
Yeah I did see that but got hopeful when I saw the upgrade available when crafting....but nope, nothing happens ..boooo
---
You could try switching which ports your machine is using. There are loads of instructions for how and why to do this on the internet. GL!
---
You can have 5 characters
---
Won't say no to help haha, i'm still on and messing around if you want to shoot me an invite.
---
Does the next Season start right after the current one? I need to take a long break after this one...
---
Thanks I'll try it.
---
It is super buggy but greater hip fire accuracy really helps and quickly using vats not at close range also helps.
---
Yeah, it's not just the ammo converter, any terminal. You can just hold down circle and it will take you out of any terminal without having to spam circle
---
Lol he's like hey you wanna hear a joke?
---
Until it doesn’t.... Is fallout 76 fully canon? I’d say not
---
I Use gun fu and grim reapers sprint
---
Bummer.  I was planning to give a Stealth/Anti-Armor a shot.
---
They needed to stop releasing new shit and work on the old shit long ago :(
---
Chinese stealth suit is a must have if you do go with the build
---
You can if you want. But it will only give you ruffly a 20% damage increase after tank killer
---
I don't know.  It's just so much easier to mow down enemies with the lawnmower that is a good heavy gun.
---
I still feel stupid for preordering this game, but at least now I'm not gonna spend hours redownloading it again
---
The green ship moves one space per day(I believe) if that helps any. GL
---
No more Geneva convention, killed him 😅
---
Got ya.  So basically Bethesda can't seem to get performance ever to work for fallout games is what it seems.
---
*power* armor though.
---
Agreed. I didn’t notice it changed, it was so hard to back out of before thats how I learned about the quick exit.
---
Event website says 75m already donated, so we're half way to target.  I feel Bethesda will just keep pumping up the number to make sure it reaches target (or just misses) to not let dissapointment be so public.
---
This would be amazing to see and would fit perfectly with the lore of the game. But how would it work for new players, or people who start new characters?
---
Yep, I wrote that one down.  That armor is really good, even without the Stealth.
---
Well I 'm a bloodied hybrid I play both ways i kill myself more when using my heavy weapons due to them all being explosive
---
Proceeds to build a real functioning set of power armor.
---
Cork is for [https://imgur.com/a/jecbKoQ](https://imgur.com/a/jecbKoQ)
---
You also don't have to "press to return to ammo selection" or whatever it says. After you hit "sell X of X" just hit back and hit sell again. No need to go back to ammo selection and add two or three extra clicks going through the category and type menu again.
---
The model is ok but didn’t quite capture the concept very well. The rusty raider PA skins look more junkyard than this.
---
Fireproof and just not shooting your feet.
---
My math was wrong a bit, some i counted to 5, some to 7. Main point being the same, sorry 😥
---
The whole thing probably should be scrubbed. It’ll be to hard to keep changing it they should scrap it and start over. I think I’m gonna stop using it once i max out raider reputation for that ammo machine.
---
Fugly. I wouldn't spend my atoms on it even if it was on sale with 75% discount..
---
New mount to ride on?
---
Honestly don’t think it matters what we call it now cause it’s an out of control dumpster fire. Sad really; potential was there, but execution was abysmal at best.
---
You mean a stash box. I couldn't see any scrap box and had to drop a tent as close as I could for people to use. Still very irritatingly slow as I had 55k steel to donate from just normal casual weapon scrapping over the last 6-7 months. God bless the scrapbox as I pay no attention to what I'm dumping in there.... now if i just had more lead and violet flux. ;)
---
They aren't going to let us fail the event.
---
theyll magically reach the goal if everyone did manage to pull off a boycott.
---
no way would they derail their next season release because players didnt participate.
---
Doh! My bad, I'm just returning and haven't memorized that FO1st get a different type of box.
---
I vaguely remember a part where no one believed the BoS about the giant bats and they were left to defend every body from the beast on their own with few supplies left. If I remember correctly this is when they started demanding supplies. Pls correct if i'm remember wrong.
---
People run through the game, to level fast. Ignore all the lore, then complain that the game has no story. Now they read someone's half-assed opinion and take it as canon.
---
Or like this guy only learns the lore he likes and wants to argue with you while only knowing half the storie.
---
From what I understand, one of the new legendary perks is going to increase ammo creation by a lot.
---
It's both.  You get an AP regen debuff when low on water, and you get an AP regen buff when well hydrated.  I've heard it said that the buffs will remain (because otherwise, food and drink really would become completely pointless).
---
Is it the same people both times? I always assumed it was two different groups of people for each thing.
---
Do you care about a dopey looking red beret?
---
Im not a French schoolgirl so I've given zero as I don't need a beret. Yet I'll bet my inventory gets tainted with it anyway.
---
Kill it. Kill it with fire.
---
Too bad, I want a large fry and frosty taco.
---
I started on my alt two weeks after my main. Currently working towards rank 74, so I should be able to finish near the last week of the run. But I also missed the double  **S.C.O.R.E**  weekend.
---
Your flux disappears into the abyss if you die after Scorched Earth. It's intentional actually to prevent assholes from griefing people for it.
---
Sent a friend request
---
I'll try updating mine but i won't get my hopes up since I'm rolling a gtx960. Also, how do you even update directx?
---
Those entitled MFs aren't here yet. That kid is the one giving you the rewards.
---
Its a typical cycle. Players have a right to be passionate about a game and want it to be the best. Often times their opinions are sound and true. Some of the stuff they messed up after an update are just a simple head slapper.
---
But the way many go about their venting is pathetic. I feel sometimes they learned how to be "woke" from 24 hour news and social media. The only way they will be heard is if they tell stomp and scream instead of coming here with some valid feedback and some ideas that could fix it. If you go in the more moderated spaces like Beth forums the feedback is passionate but much more mature. 
---
You will also be attacked here if you actually enjoy the game and enjoy the events. If you're view is different from someone else's they will hang you up by your toes. So the loud stomping voices prevail and those who enjoy or have a different view often sit on the side lines not wanting to engage in prepubescent foot stomping.

We've gotten a boost of new players along with an update that smashed a "feature" many loved. Add to it the BoS event that gives nothing to old players and appeals to the new players... Yet the amount of mats required are driven by old players... So this place is alit. As the sub burns I'm running around Appalachia enjoying the game.
---
well it does not work at all with combat shotguns.
---
pumpguns with explo do cripple via splash damage but ... well definitely nerfed.
---
How about along with the double sided walls, we get a few other building updates.
---
Non square palates, triangles and such to build octagonal ir hexagonal buildings.
---
Smaller wall chunks, instead of breaking a wall down to upper and lower section as it currently is, break it into 4 or 6 chunks so we can make our own custom walls with windows and shapes we want.
---
Make walls conductive, so that we dont have to string wires all over the place to light up our entire houses. 
---
Allow foundations and items to have a smaller clip zone, there is no flat ground anywhere on the server and if we try to build a seamless floor it just never work. So just let our foundations and items to clip into the ground a bit more, same with work stations. Fo4 work so well with this by letting us stick the back half of the gun station into a wall. 
---
Also please fix the massive hit box on the large water purifier.
---
And if you really want to make the community happy with a new feature, give us the ability to turn on hit boxes while building.
---
Were you targeting their legs or them in general? As other poster mentioned... splash damage doesn’t cripple anymore. Not tested tho, I don’t use explosive shotguns.
---
Am I the only one that doesn't have duped gear. did riding shotgun last night where 2 players had bloodied explosive flamers and gatling plasmas. Not shy about it either. I asked to trade to confirm they were legacy, not a problem These guy are under level 100 and both had identical weapons. I was angry at first and then thought about how they were both probably having much more fun than me. I can't blame them for wanting to have the fun that bethesda took away. I dropped them some fuel and cores thumbs up and fucked off to bed. I guess u where only banned if duped them live on the Internet or something. Nothing wrong with owning and using them so carry on!
---
Them? Who, the kid and his robots?
---
Instead of following the prompts on the screen use the back button to go back after selling or buying. You go right back to the last screen instead of being forced through all of them again. When you're done with one ammo type just hold the back button down to auto-exit.
---
Yeah i saw it pop up in the bottom of my screen, but i can't see your name in the social menu.  Let me relog.
---
It's my favorite part of my day.  By 3 bullets.  3 caps for 250 score, pretty good deal.
---
Confirmed. I'm on PC, and tonight, Radiation Rumble, usually smooth as butter, was a literal slide-show while looting corpses. Seemed worse toward the back two tunnels. Somethings changed for the worse.
---
I donated 250k, it's not like I'm using it or need anything else. If you are poor don't worry about donating, but don't make it seem like people are dumb for giving away a common cheap resource.
---
That defeats the purpose of the systems like these. The original daily challenges and now the score system exist to encourage people to log in daily. It's all about player retention in games like this and encouraging players to log in every day even if it's just to do challenges and leave keeps people hooked.
---
There is a workaround have a Google.
---
For rads use assaultron head. Each shot gives like 50 rads. I rarely try to get off my rads and when it gets too low I just die and it gets to near nerd rage treshold and I repeat assaultron head. It makes the game perfectly demanding for me to be that close to downing. Not really worth it to try be as close to the 20% hp as possible
---
Even better! Let's fail it and them lie and we still get freebies!
---
Maybe Sutton. Lore-wise Vault 76 is more or less inoperable, designed to fail after 25 years. The distance also introduces the players into the world before being bombarded with this town. Sutton is also location of the Overseer. But I like the name, City 76. It's either that or Reclamation.
---
They are pretty good autocompleting stuff
---
Same here. I'm taking a break from 76 — time for FO4 and NV.
---
It's not genocide if they're heartless animals anyway.  Like Preston Garvey for example.
---
Close range is worse since its relying on another hit calculation. You can replicate it to by coaching and watching bullets go over peoples heads.
---
The "good" ending.
---
Oh yeah, you can still eat and drink to get the buffs from them, for sure.
---
Or the hitbox size in pixels is the square of their IQ
---
Not always, but yeah.
---
Glad you said for enclave and not for hating the event itself. I too will hate on BoS and nuke them for hahas.
---
Depends mate. I too don't care about being massively OP. I've landed an Instigating Fixer with +10% aim damage and +15% reload which one shots most basic enemies and robots including gutsys.
---
I use Fixer on semi auto rifleman and for Commando I use a Quad HM/+10%/+1 PER (yes, neither are 'perfect' weapons) but I found the Quad ammo for a commando build not too bad. I like manual aiming anyways so it suits ME, and handmades don't climb lots on fully auto.
---
So yeah, I'd recommend handmade on Commando preferably if you can get the damage stacking kind (higher damage for each subsequent hit). Remember there's also junkies too.
---
It's hard because bloody is so outrageously OP any comparison feels weak.
---
Most say handmade, assault rifle and combat rifles.
---
Me myself i prefere the 10mm smg or my fixer.
---
My main is a junkie build and my explosive junkie 10mm smg is a beast that v rarely leaves my side
---
wasn't referring to previous games. But the new upcoming subscriptions.
---
just shitposting :)
---
The best way to help new players is to leave them alone and not interact with them.
---
I think they’re cute and want to wear them plus it’d match the camo secret service underarmor
---
Not rare/hard to get?
---
Forget that, get me a cheesy gordita crunch!
---
A game engine is a conglomerate of parts. AI package, physics, rendering, etc. Saying that an engine is outdated, or that one problem is due to the entire thing, is common, but inaccurate. Parts of an engine are outdated. In this case the ladder issue was due specifically to the AI package, which could be upgraded and improved independently of other parts.
---
The creation engine doesn't need to be replaced, and could probably do ladders fine with a little effort. The real issue is that Bethesda hasn't been putting in the effort to modernize it.
---
There were also gamepaly issue with ladders that factored into this decision, they've talked about it a few times.
---
Yeah had that happen at a workshop event earlier, also have been having a LOT of non legendary ghouls mutating and gaining stars (and dropping legendaries) but not gaining the word legendary in their name. They just say "Charred Feral Ghoul \*\*\*". Really weird.
---
Cheesy gordita crunch frosty?
---
What's your IGN? It's not showing any friend requests on my end?
---
So are we just planning to nuke atlas every hour on the hour?
---
If so... " you son of a B*tch, I'm in"
---
And which of last years community goals was worth the trouble again? A few icons, a picture frame, a lamp and the only thing people actually cared about was the purveyor discount.
---
Now we have some actual rewards like the free collectron thrown in and the community goal isn't killing useless scorched but just handing in some fucking steel and others scrap.
---
When do they put the llamas in charge? That might improve things.
---
*All I need is a wad of cash and a head wrapped around it.*
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BChZXckdbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BChZXckdbo)  
---
Yessss!
---
They meant the community rewards for completing the challenege I assume. The datamined rewards list everyone is upset over is merely the rewards you get from the Atlas supply packages. However, there is also a lesser known datamined reward list for the actual completion of the event. I don't remember them all, but I know that there was a BOS beret, BOS collectron, and BOS flag pole. These rewards are a bit lackluster as well since they seem to be mostly re-skins, however I'd be lying if I didn't say that the collectron intrigues me since each collectron gathers different resources. The BOS flag pole also actually looks really cool, and isn't a re-skin.
---
Idk why I haven’t found it after taking down so many queens. I heard it has like a 20% drop rate
---
Considering all the factions in all of fallout, the enclave are the most stable, mentally atleast.
---
In Fo76, oddly it's the raiders
---
Bethesda’s gotta love that royalty-free music!
---
What does 2 ranges of a weapon mean? The sniper has a much greater range than the shishkebob.
---
My ign is: Duffydidley
---
The world setting, factions and other elements that are already in Appalachia despite the players action, are most definitely part of the lore, with even a few connections to other games, like the mail from Kent Connolly (FO4) during the Mistress of Mystery quest, as well as the communication between Modus and ZAX at Raven Rock prior to the Great War that already hinted at the later’s obsession with US presidents, which leads it to take the persona of president Eden, essentially a merge of different traits from former presidents of the US.
---
Player actions, such as which group the side to breach Vault 79 or how they distribute the gold, are up on the air until Bethesda mentions that a particular scenario is the canon one (like when they confirmed that not destroying the Citadel was the canon ending of FO3).
---
It’s canon that the Appalachian BoS branch under Taggerdy met its end at the hands of the scorched, and thy actually meshed well with the canon since it prevented a contradiction with FO3, but this new group will once again conflict with it unless it also is “exited”, justifying why Lyons had to take the long way to reach the Capital Wasteland through Pittsburgh instead of passing more directly through Appalachia.
---
For some better perspective, check this map showing more or less several locations using IRL maps as reference:
---
https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1GP3QtQFvcDiezEVWJ-VnteAULXs&amp;ll=37.920702002595114%2C-80.29511928771716&amp;z=7
---
For context, Raven Rock is REALLY close to Harper’s Ferry.
---
Which takes us to the next big lore conflict: if a BoS was operational for over a hundred years in the east coast, why they didn’t investigate the Capital Wasteland and the Pentagon (which became the Citadel) before Lyons group came? We are literally told that Lyon’s group discovered the Pentagon and Liberty Prime inside it.
---
No matter how you want to put it, the only logical way to keep the lore consistent is by removing this new BoS group.
---
The problem with Nocturnal weapons and perks (like Sandman perk) is that there are no "Daylight" variants to switch to during sunlight hours.  They do the most damage at around midnight and then fade to normal weapons during the day.
---
Basically, the equivalent weapon types are Junkies or Bloodied but both are equally effective throughout the entire day.
---
Of course, there is nothing stopping you from switch up weapons during the day then back to Nocturnal at night.
---
I just think that Nocturnal was never finished with an equivalent Daylight weapon.  If they had, then a Nocturnal/Daylight combination would be fun to play.  As it stands though, it's just a weird abandoned prefix that most people just script.
---
They need logins and daily plays. That's the real game for them. All the layers of grind, from gold to script to score all with daily limits to get you back
---
sadly this makes too much sense for it to be implemented by the A-Team that is working on the game
---
"this thing sucks!"  
---
"how do use thing?"
---
Still gonna take those 37 gold bars tho
---
Lmfao
---
No good god, no Rush no ARK. I played Ark a lot, nothing to do with it.
---
Its more a WoW with seriously restricted Pvp , in the wastelands. And more daily limits to force you to relog everyday. 
---
I love the game but oh my so many defects I cannot defend it.
---
I gave 5000 and got a B2525 fixer and a bloodied exploding faster reload plasma gat but can’t play now as I’m meeting the queen, donald trump and the Dali Lama for a game of paintball in the Amazon.
---
😭😤😠😡🤬🤯😳🥵🥶😱😨😰🤗🤗🤗
---
?
---
Exactly this: I knew a few people in the Army who were completely unable to relate to anyone not in a military service: they'd speak in milspec jargon, deride people who wore long or facial hair, and in general act like, well, human versions of Mr. Gutsies. Good to have at your back in a foxhole, but not anyone I'd want to be around outside of combat. I'm not saying Taggerdy was \_that\_ bad, but she was certainly not the best choice for a face-person when dealing with civilians.
---
Really? I'm always short on plasma cores. How do you get them so easily? I'm drowning in fusion cores, and occasionally drop full ones to lighten my load.
---
It’s me going through phases getting to calm... by the way, stoked it’s just visual. My hit points didn’t move when I unequipped and reequipped so I assumed it was just visual personally
---
also did my part and donated 0k in steel. 
---
Using steel for crafting Gauss shotguns and crafted bloodied one,
---
Goddamnit they’ve ruined the assaultron helmet thing, go to Hell Bethesda. If a player wants to spend time and resources making screws then fucking let them, it’s BS how hard screws are to get in this game. Walk around and pick up all the fans and typewriters and because of this new “pick up 180 items to make everything respawn” BS that keeps stuff respawning daily, you won’t see anymore screws til you walk around and pick up more crap. Which would be hard to do if you need screws to repair your main weapons and armor so you CAN travel around to pick stuff up.
---
At least let scrapper give us screws from weapons and armor again, this is absurd. Fuck the camp building thing people are pissed off about, this is a much bigger issue.
---
EDIT: Oh and you fixed the Ghillie SS Armor skin and added skins to the compound bow, yet you didn’t fix the Ghillie scout armor skin and didn’t add skins to the fixer? Absolutely ridiculous...
---
You can do all the things in the list and level up in 20 minutes? I want to do what you're doing.
---
"Oh , I guess this one is not going to blow up." 
---
KA-BOOM!
---
i only got 2 fluxes the last fights i did yesterday. i died one time right after queen was laid to rest and there was 1 flux in my lootbag, the other gone 
---
might be a bug or the new normal, who knows these days
---
Good.  That's what I thought.  I don't get why people don't test these things.
---
I am currently using a magic shotgun, but just got a vampiric handmade with explosive bullets and fills vats crit meter faster that is making me consider leaving the shotgun behind.
---
Not old news. New news. Awesome news.
---
glad I got two legacy camps
---
I have the same graphics card and cpu.
---
I wasn’t sure if this was just me being impatient...
---
Try losing application then doing a network test, that usually works for me. I dunno why
---
You aren't alone,Just thank lord todd for free levels.
---
That’s what you thought!?!? No need to get snippy
---
Is it the same situation as other loot bags? Like the paratrooper? This one is my first so I’m not sure if they all have tiny hitboxes or it’s a glitch
---
I just use my phone to snap a few pictures of my inventory and trade in mostly 10x or 100x until I can't, then excess Missiles and Mini Nukes (2 or less) go into my stash until I convert again.
---
That's a real challenge!
---
Thank you for this information
---
Think they all have the same
---
The whole game feels like a chore
---
Thats why the bethesda exec boys should get a huge middle finger emote from the player base,dont do that lame event and let them eat a humble pie when they have to autocomplete it.
---
For the melee carry weight i highly recommended Radicool. Even if you aren't bloodied just having a little bit of radiation gives you extra strength.
---
Yes, healing factor is not working with class freak (Xbox). However my other mutations seem to be working ( marsupial, bird bones , adrenaline, eagle eye, scaly skin)
---
Is this a social experiment?
---
Also keep pressing B or what ever button for non-Xbox after each trade in to shorten the navigation.
---
I've noticed that as well.  Been using Excavator armour on one of my new builds because of being overweight.  Went down 3+ fusion cores just running around gathering flux.  It was rare that I would use more than 1x.
---
Personally, I hope that whoever gets sent to Appalachia is more like Elder Owyn (or possibly Sarah) Lyons rather than Maxson: willing to protect wastelanders rather than confiscate every useful weapon they can.
---
You are strong and wise,ArcadianDelSol•, and I am very proud of you
---
I just need xp boost to level up my Nuclear Winter
---
performance issues would also imply more than a small handful are *even playing on a server in the first place*
---
Yep.  Seems to happen to the Alpha of the mob, even if they aren't legendary.
---
If you don’t want to leave that shotty, I’ll gladly buy the handmade if you’re on ps4
---
Same on PS4... I’m glad I’m only 8 levels away from finishing it.
---
If you play Star Citizen then you already have the patience needed to enjoy this game
---
Honestly just dont worry about end game builds and grinding, find a play style that you like and go for it, one good weapon with decent legendaries can last you awhile. Play through the game as if it was a regular Fallout game and dont rush through to end game.
---
u dont need to play it every day to complete legendary run on time. and ur suggestion isnt good bcz it would be nice to have servers at least half filled every day.
---
and u still need to log in every day to scrip legendaries, exchange treasure notes and get ur 1400 caps if u still need them.
---
When little to no communication coming from the community reps at Bethesda, people will then act and react to what they perceive. 
---
When hundreds of thousands, dare even millions, of reports and tickets about tons of bugs are submitted and players receive silence as a response, what are people to think?
---
When the only real consistent change is to the weekly shop, it screams of the clear motive of money (and yes I know servers need financing/maintenance) but when the products monetized can't even be used or cause errors, what are consumers supposed to do?
---
It's sad and cyclical, but since folks don't feel they are heard, or want to praise in a space where others may like it, what do you expect? Especially when players are hopeful for the promises given and then fall flat ( like the Colossal event over a month late now)
---
So in my own small corner of the wasteland, no I'm not tried of it. People need a space to call attention to issues, celebrate cool things, and gather. It's the nature of social media and it's an opt in thing. Everyone has the choice to come and participate or ignore it
---
This has happened to me before. Just play something else or turn it off. It always worked the next day
---
I'd love a giant Mother Radroach boss
---
This is like the third time I’ve seen warframe pushed in this subreddit today. Did they buy an astroturf campaign or something?
---
I also miss the empty desolation. I really liked the atmosphere it had. But the change is good, makes the game world feel alive and not static. I want more content, be it BoS, Enclave, Proper Raiders... not less.
---
hope it does. I ve already done this one and it is kinda boring without challenges.
---
OK, I knew this, but the engine is such a mess and it includes 20 years old code(someone said that's even older than this), so it would probably be easier just to make a new engine than "rewrite" the old one. They "rewrote" it to Skyrim and it still includes things from Morrowind.
---
There is enough of these outdated parts to say the whole engine is outdated or what part of the engine you think is up to date?
---
It is too "chaotic" for Beth to handle, but sure they could update it to be better and they are doing it all the time, but would probably it still be wiser to get rid of all the "dead code" that it includes from twenty+ years and make a new one(or buy like they bought this one)?
---
Whoa I did not know this. Thank you
---
Depends on the type of build you want.
---
Definitely cancelling.
---
Who in their right mind decides camp bs is more important to correct before bugs on Weapons, duping, perks, etc. That's too long of a list.
---
Their blatant disregard to players needs, wishes and wants is a laughing stock and I sincerely hope they go under the negative spotlight for all of this.
---
I duped all of my crafting materials. Grinding scrap isn’t an element of the game that is missed
---
First time?
---
Get good armor, make sure its combat armor or better. Legendary effects are not going to do too much if you can't take a love tap without getting knocked. Also invest in sneak and that perk that makes enemies lose you if you crouch. They have saved my life many times.
---
Thalenia, thank you for your reply. I honestly get the feeling a huge chunk of my problems are caused by the online nature of the game, and when I made the original post I kinda didn't want to mention my connection in the first place because I am aware that latency is often unrelated to bandwidth in the first place and it is way harder to give it a metric for. But just to make it clear, I'm on a fiber connection, wired, straight through a switch (that's right, not even through a router) in order to guarantee the best possible latency within my possibilities. I'll often even go for the first world even if my CAMP cannot be placed because I assume it's the best latency match, and yet I'm getting incredible amounts of connection-based jank. Now, I genuinely would like to enjoy the game, and that's why I asked in the first place: Is there anything that can be done given that people have reported these problems not happening to them? Will Fallout 1st, sting as it might to pay even more to actually get to play this game, help?
---
YES I WANT CITY 76 BUOLT IP AROUND VAULT 76
---
to lvl up on higher lvl u need more time. but anything else yes u can do it fast (safe some very few challenges as find bobblehead)
---
Still works. Sever hop could help too?
---
This actually might just be a bug, because I'm pretty sure the canned goods in feed the people aren't static, they are instanced. AKA, if someone picked one up, someone else can pick up the same one. Atleast, I think. I DO know for a fact though that the canned goods in feed the people can sometimes completely disappear for a player spontaneously. This has happened to me several times on a private and public servers where I know for a fact I was the only person there. Its been bugged for awhile.
---
If you recently got the game you probably haven't completed a lot of the other challenges that reward atoms.  Do the dailies and weeklies and grind out atoms to get as far as you can at the end of the run.
---
 xbox sorry. I might use it though. thing that is turning me off is that I have to move a bunch of specials around and get some perk cards to make it work. will probably take like 20 levels :-(
---
Has it changed since launch?
---
Me and a buddy tried to duo it years ago but ended up feeling like we were in an amusement park standing in line waiting for our turn to kill 'X' boss. 
---
Or standing around waiting for the respawn timer on said boss, while other groups piled up behind us.
---
Just felt really... unpolished and unfun at launch.
---
for doing all of them I never spent more than 1-1.5 hour (without nw).
---
Excuse my ignorance but what is that daily cap? I do the 200 gold a day in the machine with the raiders and fudation, but I'm not sure about the daily caps.
---
Not just PS4. Hard core PC does this as well.
---
Only 3 things... OK here goes...
---
1. The game has to work. This means ALL the bugs need to be fixed, no more crashing, no more lag, it just works.
---
2. More story, or even the ability for us to create story content ourselves (approved by Bethesda of course to keep out all the random garbage).
---
3. Way better camp building options, ranging from simple things like 1/2 walls to being able to "save" an entire camp, so you can build an infinite number of unique camps without permanently losing the old ones (like a blueprint that doesn't suck). Someone mentioned "Camp A/B/C", like that but with as many as people want to make. If the "interior" camps (coming eventually) offered virtually unlimited budget, we could more easily create our own content.
---
Bonus thing:  Perk card loadouts and/or allowing passive cards to just work (lockpick, weapon artisan, etc.) without having to swap them so often.
---
yep, use the expertise of the crater/foundation to crack open that vault door and turn the lights back on.  Make a shanty town directly outside the place.
---
I think it tracks all platforms in total, so anger aside, that's a lot of folks. I think anyway?
---
I just checked the website and it’s amazing, we are half way to the beret and it ends tomorrow. Clearly Bethesda seriously overestimated how committed their fan base is.
---
Well, healing factor is not working with class freak (Xbox). However my other mutations seem to be working ( marsupial, bird bones , adrenaline, eagle eye, scaly skin)  . It’s not visual, and I have tested it.
---
While there wasn't the slow down, just as the event ended and I could see the huge piles of loot... the client crashed :(
---
&gt; The whole game pass thing was an added way to get younger people playing the game
---
That's not true...i don't know why young people keep getting blamed for bethesda's greed. You do realize the average age of f76 playerbase is older folks right? I have yet to meet someone who is under 18 playing this game from all the people i've interacted with.
---
But to the point, the battle pass was added as a way to cash in on the success of this new monetization method.
---
The problem is we got fucking shafted again by bethesda. Most games battle pass/seasons comes with actual content. Map changes, new weapons, armor, etc etc. You know stuff to actually see and do. Bethesda's battlepass comes with 8 different iterations of the guille suit - and fucking 7/8 of them have broken meshes and dont work properly.
---
Which ones and what system?
---
You can trade 1400 caps per day with vendor bot,  150 scrip per day via scrip machines at stations (u can get more for quests, events etc) and 200 for bullion. Thats the daily cap
---
Erica's standard weapon is a fully-automatic, anti-armour w/10% damage while aiming handmade. It gets the job done - it's effective against most enemies at most ranges, and allows for good accuracy.
---
When I build up enough 10mm ammunition, I do switch to a 10mm submachine gun with similar specs. It's not as effective at longer ranges due to the recoil, so you need to fire in bursts, but at close range - especially against big enemies - that fire rate makes it pretty devastating. I don't use stealth with her, but if you plan to it's worth noting that the 10mm doesn't have a silencer.
---
There are atom shop discounts for 1st members. This week is the coal excavator PA skin, 80% discount. You did not noticed it?
---
Bethesda could at least offer a courtesy reach around...  That’s just rude!
---
You have to realize that the ones that are interested enough to look up info and participate to that level... are the vast *minority*.
---
The *majority* of players will never look at anything unless it's a game screen or notice in world.
---
What 'we' diehards consider to be pressing issues, probably doesn't really matter to the majority of casual players. 
---
We can argue about which demographic should be catered to, the diehards that probably spend more or the casuals that probably only spend the ATOMS they are given freely. But that's beside the point. 
---
Fact is, threads like this have been a **daily** thing since the game launched. Every single day for over a year!
---
I'm sure they've tuned them all out by now.
---
Oh yeah i scrip the legendaries too. I didn't know about the caps lol. Thanks!
---
Nah. Dailies, gold, NW and im out! Those BoS goons will get nothing from this raider. Besides, I need the steel to make bullets for any BoS I come across in the fall
---
You need to have the weapon plan learned before you can have % to get it from purveyor (originally).
---
Latest patch supposedly added the possiblity to get even the rare plan weapons and armors which plans are gotten by gold bullions to most or even global reward lists , sbq should be one of those aswell but not sure about the random legendary enemies .....
---
&gt; I'm holding a clearance sale to clean out my mules
---
Do you think pointing out this game targets people with addictive tendencies is a good look?
---
What happened
---
The goodest! All payoff and no work. The raider life indeed!
---
Coo, guess I’ll keep trucking till I get my 3* nocturnal fixer
---
Molotovs are great for tagging mobs during events, if you doesn't have some explosive lmg
---
Yes?
---
I thought everyone already knew this 🤔
---
Its really simple. Stop donating money to company which doesnt deliver what you expected. Why you put money on something you dont like. They never make it like they promised because players like you still paying.
---
I worked at a swimming pool back in my 20s - that was when I learnt to fear floaters. That fear has never left me....
---
How do i get one of these random rewards from u? And how much junk do u require?
---
You have to first learn the plan from it randomly dropping as a reward for the Imposter Sheepsquatch event, Encryptid. Then you can get them from the Legendary Purveyor, Mumbles the Moleman, at the Rusty Pick and now I believe it has been added to the normal drop pool (once you've learned the plan) or will be soon.
---
(todd face)
---
Numbers in the bottom right corner during trade with scrip machine or vendor bot
---
Complete the Encryptid event until you get the Fixer plan. Then, once done, go to Mama Mmmmmrgh and pray that she gives you a legendary Fixer.

It seems random as well can be like 1-2 seconds to like 10 i stand back and wait at times think oh this one wont then kafuckingboom in my face.
---
Literally read the replies on here you melt. Wake up lad
---
Bruh, what-
---
With that logic every online game targets people with addictive tendencies.
---
Not "junkyard" enough.
---
The regular Raider Power Armor is way more of a "junkyard" power armor.
---
I have the plan with xtras to spare so I’ll just wait
---
Oh, so you dont like it when bethesda goes back on their word? Then why would you give them more money after theyve already done that multiple times dumbass?
---
They don’t advertise it in game, they are failing to provide appropriate notice for these alleged “benefits” as if they want us to miss the discounts for those who don’t check the atom shop weekly on the website (which in my personal opinion should be an option to use to find out, we should absolutely have in game notices on discounts)
---
Stuck outside the wooden door gang
---
Read the replies on this post you spacka
---
Go full nocturnal build
---
Complete encrypted event, you get a chance of getting the fixer plan or, buy one from the Fo76 market they usually go for 10k ish caps, once learnt you then have a small chance of them dropping, they will also drop from mumbles once the plan is learnt, you are better off trying to trade for you one you are after,
---
.... now your seeing it
---
Double sided walls would be great, providing you make it so each side can have a different wallpaper.  
---
the Triangle and rounded quarter floor pieces from fallout 4 with the associated curved and long wall pieces, would also be a welcome addition to many camp builders.  
---
Finally, is there any chance of making the snap points on the floors work so you can attach a foundation to an upper floor piece, having floating foundations when bridging places looks worse than having diving board style upper floors IMO.
---
I agree with this post 100%. Bethesda does not play this game as you've said otherwise ALOT of ACTUAL fixes would be made. And it's also clear that Bethesda has started to cater to a certain portion of the player base without failing to see that a MAJORITY want this game fixed. This is a Triple A company and I really expect better ESPECIALLY after this game being out for dang well ALMOST TWO YEARS. Everything you said here was correct. I have been playing since beta and noticed that bugs that were extremely minor are fixed real quick, but major bugs take MONTHS. It's pathetic for a company with such power as Bethesda to really just let their game go like this.
---
I had no idea I had so many addictions... I hope I can find help.
---
I would rather get the entire contents of my scrapbox and throw myself into fissure site prime than donate to ATLAS. I hope you enjoyed your shitty, diluted reskinned Christmas presents.
---
It always worked on fo76, but I'm not certain about the previous games.
---
It won’t ever be fixed wake up you are wasting your time lad
---
Me too last week. Haven’t regret it! Takes you 4-5 days and you won’t think much of it again :p
---
20 year old code isn't really a big deal. Unreal still has core code from it's earliest iterations. Beth is already adding a new terrain system, lighting system (which was updated in an active release with Fallout 76, not a mundane task), and animation system for sure (that one was super out of date, everything in Skyrim was still hand animated, and mocap in FO4 was minimal). They implemented a better scripting langauge (although it could still be better). They have been making improvements, so we know they recognize the need.
---
There are things that this engine does that are important to Bethesda, even if a lot of players don't care about it, or don't think they do. Things like the physics system tracking thousands of loose items across the whole game world, rather than resetting them when you leave the area, like most games. Most other comparable RPGs don't have that, they don't handle NPC inventories in as much detail, they don't give NPCs full schedules like the radiant AI system does (well, can, they haven't been utilizing it fully). These sort of simulation systems aren't necessarily unique to the Creation Engine, but very rarely do you see them all in one place anywhere else.
---
Finally, there's the cost in training time and money that would be associated with using a completely different engine. When your engine is proprietary, so are your tools, you don't have to pay for them, and when you've been developing on them for a long time your people know how to use them. Switching to a new engine means new tools, and time to learn those tools, on top of the cost of using that engine. In the long run, the costs balance out, if not tip in favor of fixing the engine.
---
I absolutely acknowledge the issues with both the current Creation Engine and with Bethesda's development practices, but I firmly believe that the blame is more with those practices (or lack thereof) than with the engine itself.
---
If anyone here is bitching it sounds like you ☕️🐸
---
Don’t donate it to them - it shows them that it’s acceptable to give us watered down reskinned Christmas presents as a reward.
---
I see. I have never done this myself so I had o clue what is everybody talking about. Thanks cap.
---
Please note: With today’s update, we’ve found that the Forager Ally is not currently providing Daily Quests to players who have this Ally in their C.A.M.P.s. We did not have enough time to address this prior to releasing the patch, and we are working to address this issue as soon as possible.

---
Um, it backs you up because he was supporting you. Dummy.
---
It’s ineffectiveness is definitely part of its charm. I’m running bloodied commando right now on my alt, bloodied unarmed on my main. The challenge and oh-crap moments seem a distant memory now. I was thinking either Nocturnal since I have all the necessary rifleman and commando perk cards already, or gunslinger/guerrilla.
---
Don't let people use Ghillie armour. It's meant to min max visibility for defence.
---
I agree with every point other than food or drink, this isnt a survival game, the mechanic is just annoying
---
Try the other fallout games after then, you wont be dissapointed!
---
I honestly would not be the least bit suprised to find out that the devs rig the tote board to show it completing early on in each segment Granted what else are you going to spend your scrap on(well not me I burn through plastic almost as fast as I get it) but I dont realy think I need anything rewarded from the event, and realy the BOS from my prov was a failed entity.
---
Meh Let them have NUKA COLA Whatever so we dont end up fighting Scorched in Power armor.
---
Yeah right. Betesda let us use a dupe method for 6 months...
---
I just joined a match and got extremely lucky, Big chest that had marine armor and a 50 cal MG, Got a ton of Stimpacks, I was actually prepared to survive long enough to find three creatures. 
---
At full health in marine armor, someone one shots me with a Cryo grenade. A cryo grenade doesn’t even do that much damage in adventure mode.
---
This game mode is ass, hope it’s the next thing to be removed like survival mode.
---
Why should we have to “earn” the double score weekends? We deserve it anyway for all the bullshit they put us through.
---
Far Cry New Dawn is a pretty awesome. It's a nice alternative to Fallout, as long as you can put up with some scripted plot rail roading. Far Cry 5 is great too, but it is pre-apocolyptic. 
---
It's probably under ten bucks by now too.
---
Yup, there you go. You got it.
---
Online games have insidious design tendencies that don't prioritize the player's experience. GaaS is a scam model that only exists to extract money from people - if you're not one of the people paying up, you're just a happy side effect of the exploitation of addictive people.
---
In lore your character becomes a General for the Enclave before being able to launch though... correct?
---
I'm hazy on the late game lore.
---
thats a lot of SBQs between then and now brother lol
---
Who are these people buying fixer plans for 10k. I sell them for 2k and I haven’t sold one yet. if you show up to encryptid enough you’ll just get the plan. I’ve gotten three so far.
---
So you do not bother to chech the discounts in the shop without any notice? So you do not check the weekly ATX update? Where are you spending the atoms that come with the subscription then?
---
Damn.... and I thought I was having fun this whole time.
---
I found Jesus but realized he was just selling subscriptions for Heaven 1st. $20 weekly.
---
Great job, you've pissed the community off EVEN FURTHER.
---
Let me guess.. if OP pays for fallout 1st he's apart of the problem and gets the blame, but if he doesn't have fallout 1st he shouldn't be concerned about the issue at hand?
---
Yes, they would encourage getting in the fight a lot more than the ghillie outfit, since you can't wear armor with it. The inability to wear armor is a big part of what makes me ignore combat in NW.
---
That, and kills being worthless, but death being devastating. So yeah, XP allocation is also a big issue that should be changed, but Ghillie armors are not that much of a problem.
---
I guess you can say that? The biggest problem they have is they continued to use basically the same game engine for the past 20 years (which they have "built up" over time) so they continued to have the same issues and one can only hope that they finally switched to a different engine with their two upcoming games Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI.
---
It got deleted from Nexus for some reason. I used xTranslator to import Kits Killer Strings' translation and re-generate new strings files.
---
Ahh thanks! i missed that in the patch notes
---
Games trash
---
Yeah, the Philly 76'ers rule!
---
Is there a private heaven option tho? I want that
---
You'd be having a lot more fun if the game was designed to provide you with fun and not solely to extract money from 'whales.'
---
RARE plans they said actually.
---
Sink in for a moment let that.
---
I have been doing this, as soon as I hit the cap im out. I as well don't know if I can keep playing this what it looks now like a mobile game.
---
When you said open mic for some reason I thought you meant dont use voice chat. Idk why, maybe im losing it already lol.
---
I just want to mention that I have met a shit ton of people under 18. Youngest was 13...
---
First you tell me I’m and addict and now I’m a whale... I don’t even know what to believe anymore.
---
ah shit I have all but one of those mutations. this is gonna suck ass.
---
Warframe isn’t that fun for new players unless u tryna spend much more than here
---
I'm not sure I called you a whale. Or even that you were an addict.
---
The SCORE system isn't my problem, I have no problem with endlessly grinding either. I spent endless hours grinding dinosaur island on final fantasy 7 just to reach max level and still put hundreds more hours into the game. I really don't like the that game basically tells me 10 mins after I've started that I've reached my daily cap in everything and that I shouldn't play anymore. Nor, do I enjoy the recent influx of the same behaviours my 8 year old nephew displays when he plays Fortnite; which, I attributed to the fact that the game recently became available for xbox game pass users which is also available to use on PC. Yes I could be wrong; in which, the adult player base is far more juvenile than I anticipated. If so, I apologize to the children who seem to be playing with more grace and decorum than you have used in many other games I have witnessed many of you playing
---
does super duper perk work in this situation too ?
---
Okay mr. pedo
---
[](/ajlie)I'll stop lying to reddit, but I refuse to stop lying to myself.
---
Are you sure you did t drop it?
---
Put in 2000 steel to check out the boxes..nope! Not a single bloody thing of any value to any players over about 50...no more from me I'd rather keep the components I grinded for!
---
I'll do that, I really hate the support website. It's a level 152, been general for may months.
---
Games with passes like these are great (even if they lack a lot in other areas). FO76 sucks for going for a shitty 100 SCORE for every 10,000 EXP. That's just scummy.
---
I accept and understand this. I just found out I’m an addict so I’m just gonna keep lying to myself too.
---
Yup, same thing happened to me last night at Line in the Sand - graphics all pixelated and then the frame rate completely tanked as soon as the meat piles started. 
---
Was absolutely fine before this 'patch'.
---
And I'm on PS4.
---
This is ridiculous. They suddenly claim they've heard us?  LOL ... Just revert the change, at whatever the cost, BGS. The game has survived nearly 2 years with this, creating an immense library of building community video tutorials using this. It's clear BGS has no clue the magnitude of removing this from the game. Their pathetic band-aid "fixes" months down the road aren't going to replace 5% of what they've destroyed. I'm pretty sure they're going to lose a good majority of the playerbase in a matter of weeks if this change isn't reverted ASAP.  They claim it's about performance issues? Seriously? Just leave this one in.
---
Depends what you're trying to accomplish!
---
My main uses mostly chameleon armour, with action point refresh speed secondaries and a few junk weight reduction perks. She's a stealthy sniper who trades in junk, so being invisible and being able to carry almost-limitless amounts of garbage is very important to her. 
---
And Matilda, her instigating, 10% damage while aiming, 90% reduced weight gauss rifle is perfect for how she fights. She can one-shot everything feom extreme range, short of the meaty enemies like Sheepsquatch (which is where critical hits and those action point refresh perks come in - in the time it takes her to reload, her AP is fully refilled).
---
Those would be useless to both of my alts. Like Erica is a durable ground-pounder with no stealth to speak of, so as she's meant to be indestructible she uses an auto-stim, a regenerating, and a few Vanguard's armour pieces. I've specifically avoided weight-saving perks on her, as she is specced to be able to jump into PA and switch to heavy weapons on the fly, and I was sick of getting overencumbered whenever I did so! An Instigating gauss rifle would be of no use to her fast-based, cover-to-cover, pitched battles kind of combat, so she's got an AA handmade.
---
So what you're looking for in your weapons and armour will really depend on what you're trying to accomplish. Take a look at the list of effects to see what works for you! https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
To be fair there IS actual "Rare Plans" in that reward table if you ask me (at least on the console version were the plan hasn't been Duped so much) if you find these plans useful or not is another matter entirely. 
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but those Raider Armor plans are extremely rare to the point where a player has ONE chance of getting them per character for completing the quest Signal Strength. Just how rare?
---
We're talking about 1.96% chance of getting a Heavy Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan, a 2.94% chance of getting a Sturdy Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan and a 5.88% chance of getting a Light Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan. 
---
What were people expecting? For Bethesda to ruin the grind they set up and give up Gold Bullion plans? For Bethesda to make events irrelevant and add Event only plans like The Fixer or Bear Arms? I don't know what people were expecting honestly you guys keep bringing up this argument that there's no rare plans but provide no context to what you would have wanted to see.
---
Garbage
---
Or do, it’s user preference and what they wanna wear.
---
Yeah, it’s annoying, you miss a day or two because of life and you fall further and further behind. Also I don’t want to be forced/encouraged to play every day.
---
You can not enter on destiny 2 for a month and complete the season only playing the other month, here is imposible
---
Number 3 plagued me when I started out on gamepass. Morgantown airport was half unkillable naked scorched lol. I didn’t see the error again until yesterday when I went to the palace of the winding path for the Rose quests, literally every enemy frozen, but this time they were killable. Free loot I guess lol
---
Your absolutely right in noting that the greatest power a consumer has over a company is the power to stop using their service and take their cash elsewhere, I think you missed their point though in that their not happy and feel that the company hasn’t lived up to promises made at time of purchase. We all know almost anyone with fo1 will stay because of the stent/scrapbox but bethesda definitely could do with hiring a few top level people who know a little something about brand loyalty to correct the shops course
---
Love it, what a win-win deal!
---
125 million steel for a cap we will never wear.
---
Handmade
---
and only reason you haven't gone bloodied is you don't have a good bloodied rifle, yet. Once you have it's kind of hard not to go bloodied.
---
Ships course not shops course but now I think of it both work
---
I downloaded xTranslator today and it has an option to use existing (Kit's) .strings files for translation. I tried it out and seems to be working ok in my limited playtime. That is, I can see Kit's strings and the new strings in the update.
---
Not really. It unbalances NW, encouraging stealth builds and meaning everybody will be wearing the suit.
---
I will I donated 1k and I haven’t got a plan at all I only got alcohol from it and some caps 😤
---
Only 140??
---
Same on PS4 now - wasn't like this for me before this update.
---
I agree with you, when I hit rank 100 I’m taking a hiatus from 76. This daily challenge grind bs has seriously burned me out on the game.
---
They just have their windows down and their systems up, they put one finger on each hand up cos they just don’t give a fuck.
---
Screw the brotherhood of steel. We'll start our own brotherhood, with blackjack and hookers!
---
He didn’t say “to be fair” he said “Be Fair”
---
Oh my god I didn't even think about this...arg. Thanks OP...next time they want me to gather building supplies...they can shove my bulk scrap up their asses.
---
I read that as “Better for their Anal Ticks”
---
The BoS in previous games were more benevolent than the chapter in F4. Seems most people only know them from F4 and  judge them from F4 only.
---
yes
---
its better just stop paying and make statement why you stop. Than they have real numbers how many people stop paying and they start doing something. When everyone just keep extend fallout 1st membership from their view is everything good. Its company building around money, nothing else. OP just say they doesn't deliver what he expect for 10 months its better considering to just stop paying.
---
&gt;Spent way too many hours in the game (1800 now?).  Someone pointed out I should be much higher than what I am, given those hours, but I haven't chased XP.   You'll find me doing stuff like looking for the best angle from which to take a picture, etc.  :)    I'm out on a disability retirement, and gaming is intellectually interesting.  I used to do boardgaming, but (1) ageism in the boardgaming club--no longer a 20- or 30-something, (2) distance to the club, and (3) the pandemic.
---
I don't get it either: I have to expect at least two hours unless the dailies are really easy.
---
PS4 here - noticed it on one of my characters, particularly Healing Factor and Scaly Skin.
---
Swapped characters and my other mutie was fine though.
---
I'm about 5 hours in and just chugging along at my own speed. Already seen a number of unresponsive enemies and other bugs but yeah like you said, SC has given me plenty of patience. On the bright side its been running perfectly despite reports I heard of even current performance being terrible even on hih end hardware. But im getting 100-120 fps at 3440x1440 on Ultra settings.
---
Edit: forgot to mention that I'm actually really enjoying myself if only cause the game looks rather pretty despite its age, probably cause of the emphasis on lighting.
---
You sound ignorant
---
Why should daily logins be rewarded more than weekly or even biweekly?
---
And a bunch of Tech they can see up from close.
---
I hate people who one shot legendaries...like...seriously ya dick?
---
Shut up undercover Karen
---
I gave them about 1000 steel because I was swimming in it and figured why not, I got some caps and a bunch of stimpacks which I was running very low on, so not too bad, the cork on the other hand, nope.
---
Did they say they were going to fix this?
---
Awesome!! Thank you for this. I will check that link out. I’m going to check out that chameleon armour, it seems really interesting
---
PS4 too - Healing Factor (showed -55%) and Scaly Skin (showed AP -50) were the 2 I noticed it on
---
Defintely been nerfed. Tested various shotguns, and did multiple rad rumbles. And it's not just the explosive damage either. Direct hits that should have them crawling on the ground, don't. Slows them yes, crippling takes a lot longer now, if they don't die 1st.
---
I agree and I don't know what would be the best thing to do, but I am quite sure different engine should have been used in 76. People mainly working with 76 are not familiar with the engine(Austin), NPC AI system is not needed or doesn't work and including the multiplayer code to this engine was not the best idea(even if this means that now it's in it and we will probably see somesort of MP in future Beth games).
---
\&gt;implying people have read that before whining like babies
---
I mean, it'd be noce, but this is Reddit.
---
I would use First Aid instead of Nerd Rage and Field Surgeon instead of Lone Wanderer since you said you wanted a full health build.  Also Mister Sandman maxed and Escape Artist instead of Sneak if you can get a piece of Chameleon gear.
---
I have a msi armor 8 GB rx580 with a 2600x. This is a very graphically intense program. My gpu is constantly at 100%, but temps stay reasonable. I have a 1440p monitor, and at that resolution I would get 45 to 60 fps on high settings. I recently set it to 1080p and now I'm getting 60 to 75, but still running at 100%. In my radeon dashboard, it simply recommends buying a 5700xt. I kind of want to but that's $400 I don't have right now. I wonder if buying a second 580 will help.
---
Nope. I’m just an idiot and assumed. They announced they are not reverting because it was being used as an exploit?..
---
Continuously Hop On, Regret Everything?
---
After all this game has done to drive me off, having a weeks worth of notes has been the only reasonable idea since I only log in once a week at this point tbh
---
Of course the games designed to make money , did I miss Bethesda getting charity tax status somewhere and whilst we’re on the subject why can’t McDonald’s give me free food
---
Ah dam, I thought you had some seen some new info.
---
Ok, excuse me. Most people don’t give a shit, but you plebs seem to and I don’t understand why. It’s like an echo chamber for cunts in this subreddit.
---
Heavy Raider Armor Arms and Light Raider Armor Legs, also on PC. Also looking for T-60 Right Arm and Left leg plans. Once I have those I will have all armor plans unlocked.
---
No probably not
---
No.. my apologies for the false hope my guy 😞
---
Gota have the rapture for that one i think
---
Forget about VATS missing, what about the ‘magical’ legendary affects on some weapons and armour that when used with VATS does INSANE damage.
---
Dam man, I’m sorry to hear that then, kinda makes you ask what they patched that would even cause something like that to happen
---
I've had this issue with him since Wastelanders dropped.
---
I just saw it today at a whitesprings vendor, don’t remember the exact one but you can shop around to find it
---
I won't argue that one. They probably should have just used whatever ESO is running on.
---
You realise consul duped plans just as much as pc right? There are millions of duped presents on xbox
---
Yeah I’m definitely not gonna get the 1st subscription. I can’t meet those prerequisites.
---
I'll be out of here as soon as Cyberpunk is available. Weather I'll be back is on Bethesda to make it worth while. Track record suggests no.
---
Not even sure what build I want yet.  I think I will have to try different stuff out :)
---
They still fit like under armor but show over your armor, blending all clunky with ops under armor. 👎
---
I will check that out, thank you :)
---
This is how I've always done it, as well.  This, among many other things this has killed for me, has completely broken my spirit for building. :( :( :(
---
How does their online community compare to this one?
---
What? Does it still weigh a pound? And do you wear it over armor now?
---
32 f here. Whats your play style? I play as a sneak sniper and use a  shotgun when things get too personal.
---
Unless I am understanding this wrong they have it listed as an ATLAS community reward 😫
---
I appreciate you taking the time to answer when it's quite obvious you didn't even bother to read the entire question.
---
There was literally a keyring in F:NV
---
So... you’re quitting 3 months from now?
---
Why would you do either of those things when you can grab one of the three plants that make them?
---
Mines ok im xbox.
---
The Wastelanders DLC added NPCs, two new 'cities' full of the same, and new questlines.
---
The old quests are all still there. For the most part you can tell whether you're playing new or old content by whether or not you're talking to actual living humans, or just tracking down the holotapes of humans who already died.
---
The towns of Crater and Foundation are new too.
---
The presence of the Brotherhood of Steel is explained (with varying degrees of success depending on who you ask) by the 'old' main quest. Without giving too many spoilers, they were essentially a surviving military unit which made contact with the West Coast Brotherhood by way of surviving communications infrastructure. The 'actual' Brotherhood never actually made the journey across America, but instead they found some groupies over the radio, essentially.
---
And yes, there's a black market. People selling weapons for RL money is a problem in a lot of online games like this, though.
---
Is the legendary run screen really controlled with a cursor on the console version lol
---
I'm sure.  It's pretty darned predictable at this point.
---
No if someone else picks it up you can no longer see it or pick it up. They work the same as bobble heads or magazines as far as I know. I was grinding this event before the double xp so I could stack up on the canned meat stew and failed a couple times because ass hats would do this exact thing.
---
Nope you can't actually display anything in that way. You can't assign anything from your inventory to the column. 
---
The only display effect you get is that you can snap some of the smaller camp objects, like for example the NW statues to them.
---
We should take over vault 76 and start a revolution! We will force Bethesdad to give us 2 sided walls!
---
I hope they will change the perk system once because of this kinds of reasons. They need to add perk loadouts or that you can change multiple points between your S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
What is the exact message you get on your screen?
---
We already know what the rewards are. A berret. A metal pole, a reskin of the BoS fatigues, a BoS collectron, purveyor sale, double score day, extra challenges, and a meat week that seems exactly the same as all the others. Im not donating shit because i really couldnt care less about any of that and hope there base crumbles to the ground.
---
I trade him chems and water sometimes but i don't do it daily, i didn't know it was a limit of caps, thank you for the info!! I'm still discovering things 😊
---
I personally think that all those daily currency caps as well as repeatable quests and score challenges should just be weekly so people who don't have time during the week can just have a session or two during the weekend, while also allowing daily play if you really want to, though in that case they should probably increase it more than just the total of what a week would be, as otherwise it'll still get filled quickly for those.
---
As an example, instead of having a "kill three legendary enemys" for monday and wednesday just have "kill three legendary enemys (2x)" so no matter when you do it you can still get score twice and that could work for all of the challenges. They would be like the Weekly xp gathering one is but rather than being unlimited they get a limit so they can still control player behavior a bit just as they are now.
---
The main problem here would be the daily quests, as doing them 7 times in a row would just end up annoying, increasing the rewards by a lot and having them be weekly or even biweekly may be better but in my opinion they aren't as bad as the other things mentioned, as you can deal with them not being done every day, as most of them give rewards you can get in other ways (script/treasury notes) the only problem there is reputation.
---
Well i plan to finish this season to LVL 100, then I'll quit 76 again.
---
If there's no daily atoms then there's no reason to log in. I'm LVL 400 now so nothing left to do untill we get some new content.
---
Gonna have a new game to sink my time into so I likely won't be taking too much time away from that unless it's one of the other games I plan to buy this holiday season.
---
&gt;this is true
---
Let people play how they want. And when you’re solo, it’s better to be stealthy and not so noticeable. If they wanna wear ghillie armor, so be it. Not hurting anyone
---
I wish I had the option to play with my brother yet the social menu is still busted and no I will not ask a stranger to invite us both to a group and no I won't pay a subscription to a private server to circumvent a broken mechanic.
---
Glass cannons just don’t appeal to me
---
It is. It will make camping worse, and stealth much easier
---
Miss.
---
Positive. I thought that at first too but There was no loot bag. It was just gone all the sudden. I’m about done with this fucking game.
---
Well if you actually read that you'd have seen that I was talking about the booze and floater grenades for individual donations. Like if next week maybe they'd add a prize or two to the pool. 
---
I understand not taking the time to read what you're replying to though. Who has time to understand what they're replying to before bitching about how dissatisfied they are?
---
Im a whale and an addict.

And fuck me I'm  happy about it!!!
---
I get this.. I was majorly disappointed in the legendary run. I just want my normal daily challenges back. I can understand a break entirely (I’ve taken many since beta)
---
I have the same bug mate don't worry it's nit your keyboard! I don't restart my computer, I just use "i" key to access my PIPBOY and after a while I can use tab again. For cancelling I use ESC key until my tab key starts working again
---
But it blends with the operative under armor. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
But the worst are people who one-shot them after you've taken the time to try to get everyone over for a shot.....or the people who don't return the favor after you've led the first one right to them.     
---
Now, if we walk in and see people are acting like this, we will one-shoot them ourselves and let's just say this.   If there are even two of our team there who decides the group is a collective bunch of a$$holes, you won't even be getting tags on very many enemies.
---
The first step is admitting brother whale!
---
Hi. Got an RX5700XT great GPU for sure since you can run pretty much any game on 1440P but 76 is simply unoptimized. You will still run into FPS drops all across the game for no reason like for example you just sprint towards a building or you start shooting a gun.
---
Does bulk reduce weight?
---
The drop rates always been low on some of them it’s just that there were so many presents opened that none of the plans are rare or worth much now . It’s a balancing act to give all players the plans that those naughty little imps got when they got a little carried away with presents. But rather than grind the challenge for the plans its way quicker and cheaper to sell your steel in your vendor and  use the caps to jump around camps buying the plans people are still getting from their muled presents for few caps, or just wait long enough and you’ll come across bags of them for free
---
Future tec camp skin makes your camp icon disappear too
---
Atoms". I probably amassed about 7k Atoms by playtime, I have about 300 hours into the game so I used up some atoms to buy levels.
---
You need to learn the plan for the gauss rifle to be able to craft 2mm EC. It's the prime capacitor for gauss rifle, the one that drops from the queen. Hope this helps.
---
I'm assuming you saw the headless unmoving enemies, that bug comes and goes it's rather strange. Glad to hear you're enjoying it with good performance too
---
I like that this post is tagged as news. "This just in! Local man donates 44,000 virtual steel to quasi-military reconstruction project"
---
But thanks for donating that much. Just don't drink all that booze at once though.
---
Ah yeah and as for a second Gpu. Don’t. A lot of games don’t support that (Crossfire is it called) and you don’t want to make it depending if your game runs well based on the crossfire support of it.
---
Ok, thanks for the Information :) I'll have a look over your build just now. I don't want to use junkies though. Vamp may work! I don't fight SBQ much at all so I'm not too fussed about maxing out my damage, but where I can I will.
---
Ageds like spoiled milk
---
I got most of mine through just searching ammo boxes with the scavenger perk.
---
Past level 50 you can choose either to move a perk point, or choose any perk card of your choice. If your build is messed up now you will have infinite opportunities to fix it.
---
I'm sick of people one shotting stuff...it's a dick move...and I'm envious since I don't have anything that can do that much damage.
---
Drop into the ash heap maybe or keep
---
Doing events in and around the forest. If u see a few players or even one high level dojng an event join and just tag the enemys. U still get the exp. join a team. Building for the intelligence or events for event xp. 30-60 are the toughest levels. By then u should have a build that will let u 1-2 shot most areas and leveling becomes a lot easier. Line in the sand with an auto tesla is great if it drops. Just got the ground with it and it will tag multiple enemys and your levels will shoot up
---
I *believe* you can still hear it in the Whitespring shopping area!
---
Personally I miss the original title music. I didn't like the Nuclear Winter variant *at all*, and was unreasonably happy when the original was returned. But now it's gone again!
---
Tag enemies at events like Uranium Fever and One Violent Night. Higher levels make the kills and you get XP for tagging.
---
Yeah, try the others, FO76 is literally the worst of them.
---
FO1 and 2 are very old school, but I loved those.
---
FO3, NV and 4 are all great, but NV (New Vegas) stays closer to the mechanics of the original Fallout games.
---
I honestly think people only have themselves to blame. This game was fraught with issues from release. They kept advertising their biggest update yet (Wastelanders) and they couldn’t finish it, so they postponed it for months. In the same week they postponed it, they announced they’ve been working on F1st which was finished. 
---
They very clearly said “we’ve failed to deliver on the big update for everyone, but we’ve been consistently working on a paid subscription, for the game that isn’t finished. And that’s ready right now”. 
---
And people *still* bought it and expected good things? It’s insane to think Bethesda were going to get it right. People who had this game from the start still remember the massive issues it had. And even just this week, they’ve patched the wall issue so now we can’t have internal walls anymore. They’re a joke
---
I don’t understand the fascination with commando, you’re wasting a shit ton of ammo to do the same damage rifleman builds do in one or two shots.
---
Is there some sort of secret I don’t know about it?
---
This happens.   It's unfortunate, but true.  I wouldn't blame you.
---
I don’t know after Patch 21 but before there was a bug where if you died you would lose all your flux for some odd reason. Can’t confirm if it’s fixed because I haven’t died on a queen yet with the new patch
---
Remember all this stuff worked ALMOST perfectly in Fo4. They actually broke functionality by trying to add in restrictions and remove parts of the system. 
---
The imposed restrictions are what has caused the majority of the problems as well as any exploits.
---
Dear Bethesda, I have lost most of my faith in you. You alienated your fallout fan base by getting rid of the whole appeal of your games... the MODS they make your games so much more fun. But on positive note if there’s anything Bethesda is good at its fucking lore and this game has so much potential. Having a fallout game that multiplayer is an interesting idea but it shouldn’t be the base because traditional fallout fans like the single player part of fallout games that make the world feel so expansive which your game is not when you can just fast travel to a camp . As for the story I’m sure they could figure out the story(with vault and the overseer) and there are two acts to the story where your alone and then the second part is wastelanders.
---
Well that sucks I'll just continue building up my base and doing allie quist intell then thank you for your help
---
Once u know a
---
Perk u can swap it in and out providing u have the available points. Things like lock picking scrapper hacking etc u only use when u need them then swap the cards back. After 50 u get the choice of moving a point in the specials or picking a card. It’s also good to know at your level below 50 when u pick a point say in strength u can then back out on the perk screen and pick a perk in any catagory.
---
They're fun!
---
My intetnet has been out for 2 weeks so im probably going to miss out on stuff becuase you need to log in everyday
---
Yeah, I equipped it right after I saw it free in the shop and was thinking hey, that's kinda cool,for once they give something nice.. But then after playing a little with my friends we realized it's bugged af. Not only sometimes it's in the air, but it's hard to interact with it, you have to aim at a specific angle to even see what's in the there. Now I understand why they gave it to everyone for free. What a joke.
---
Thanks for the heads up. After the update I went for a queen run and died in 20 minutes more than in the past weeks. Using Unyielding armor on PS4. 
---
At some point I was dying before I could load and move.  Happened about 12 times or more in a row. Now I know why :)).
---
the whole game is the PTS server. they're using us to test their product and we never get paid for it.
---
STOP PAYING FOR FALLOUT 1ST.
---
These are the posts that really grind me gears. Whenever Bethesda fucks up, people make the same posts over and over again but nothing changes because people still pay for Fallout 1st. I'm getting sick of these posts, just stop paying! Just stop paying, it's so simple!
---
Yes to both?
---
No I'm not, I just have it installed because emotions.
---
I believe more that they will actually quit the game than the fallout 1st. After who knows how much time with unlimited scrap box and atoms every month. Now all has to fix the stash box. I think some of those who unsubscribed recently will not last
---
That event is often pure chaos.  It can and does fail.   If you're there for the XP and the event--not just the XP--I don't think you have the luxury of just tagging enemies.
---
Power armor and two handed melee weapons are great for levelling, they'll get boring after a while but even with a minimal investment of perk points your heavy attacks will wreck stuff and you have great survivability. You can pivot to heavy guns later or shop at people's vendors to get armor with legendary effects you want to replace your power armor.
---
What? How can you mess a core game mechanic up that badly
---
Yeah, it's just a cent
---
Agreed, it will clear up the situation. For example, during project paradise, there's a chance everyone may leave you alone and move on to other habitat.
---
That day, the deathclaw dead, and the only one who survived was the ghoul. I was so glad my shishkebab works on ghoul. I'm not sure if it's because formula Q or they just fixed friendly fire.
---
Lol bit of a parasite kinda view. There will be another glitch for you to exploit later to get it back ;)
---
As some have suggested maybe move it to sutton or something similar as the vault itself is inoperable and sutton also makes sense as the overseer would start it (she says she'd rebuild sutton first), that could actually end up being a community event most people would like, as it reflects the "we got enough of your bullshit" a lot of players are feeling towards the npc factions, it would also massively promote helping each other out if there was an area with multiple vendors of different levels so a broad spectrum of players would end up there.
---
As to the process, I think we should have a mix of junk collecting as we have it with the BoS now, though at least make the threshhold rewards worth while ( I don't think we should need "supply" crates, maybe something like 76caps to exchange with the new vendors for higher value would be cool) and more importantly quests to go get help from crater, foundation and atlas (assuming the BoS set up their vinery by then) we could be demanding compensation for all that we've done for them and to make it interesting have some convincing to do setting up plots for each of the factions to show how much they need us, optimally with multiple options to do things like, lure a mutant behemoth to their front gates (or a more extreme event version with a wendigo collosus?) and defeat it or just doing a mission for them that they attempted but thought to be impossible if you aren't into being malicious.
---
Yeah i was guna mention the werd angle bit too but figured most people figured that one out. Its still a pretty good free thing when your expectations are as low as mine lol.
---
It's not a bug it's a feature anti steal protection
---
The legendary system is so shit in this game. Everyone blames the players for one shotting legendary mobs. Blame the devs for designing a first come first serve legendary system. How come everyone participating in an event can't loot legendary mobs even though they didn't hit them.  
---
All events just turn into a shit fest when 8 people are trying to tag one legendary mob and having to change weapons to do so, it's just ridiculous.
---
Just let it happen
---
I've been missing a trick as I'm too lazy to switch to the card, thank you for setting me on the right path.
---
Plastic farming is a pain in the butt
---
Are you in power armor in adventure mode??
---
&gt;"If...joining is another...goal, however, just proceed through your...primary journey. I’m sure it will take you where you...wish...to go."
---
There, fixed it for Stersurprise. Now it's in MODUS' voice. lol
---
I think a lot of players would be with you on something like that, it's like a dream community event for when the bullshit BoS vinery is done and over with.
---
Did you report any of these bugs to Bethesda?
---
Find a crew. This allows you to tag along with higher levels or others your level. If they are much higher level follow them to places like West Tek. You tag things they kill them. If your the same you ease your way into difficult areas playing smart and working together. 
---
If your on PC hit me up. I am part if a mature clan that has a great Fallout division. We would be more than happy to help you out and set you up with gear to help you out.
---
The other thing is don't dismiss easy bugs like cranberry relish and Berry Mentats. They really help you level.
---
not enough to bother Bethesda
---
You'll turn into a meat pile until u get there
---
I only started playing in March, lvl 125, 400 hours and I've got all this 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I dunno, the Overseer is pretty cool, she was never rude or demeaning to us and cared about us.  If 76 faction becomes a thing I would not mind her being the leader
---
Ooo, cool! Thanks for the tip, looks like I have some sight-seeing to do.
---
Aw, what was the original title music? That might have been before I started playing (July 2019).
---
In Fortnite, if I miss weekly challenges, they are still there eight weeks later.  If I miss daily challenges, I get an exp buff to make up for it.  And most importantly by far, in that game's season pass, I can just play the game any way I want, any time I want, daily or not daily, and I will get to level 100 some time or other.  Of course there are major downsides as well, like the fact that you get very few rewards if you didnt pay for the season pass...
---
" Their shaking down of the population in 76 is really provocative. "? There is a kid that heard a radio broadcast and is asking you for supplies, not shaking you down. The BoS is not even here yet. I just hope when they come beth doesn't make them bland like the raiders. I so wanted the raiders to be proper bad guys for my evil character. They are so poorly done I scrapped that character. Sorry rant over.
---
I can second that for sure anytime I died my loot bag was way up in the air. Very difficult to loot all around, figures lol
---
Every other day
---
Many, many times. I thought I was going crazy.
---
Level 24, you should be able to handle the Ash Heap pretty well and north into the Toxic Valley. An issue may be your damage output and possibly armor. Super Mutants shouldn't be a major threat (unless you get swarmed) and basic Scorched should be brushed aside. Seek out player vendors and events to get drops and upgrade your weaponry.
---
So. What do you think rare plans means? Explain.
---
The issue here is that you can't get score from literally any other source other than that 100XP repeatable which is so little that it doesn't even matter. You should get some amount of score for every little bit of XP you earn. 100 xp could be equals to 10 score and it would still be hard to level that way but it would make it to where people could get ahead without playing daily for hours a day.
---
Rad resistant backpack mod or secret service armor. I almost never have to adjust my rad levels anymore.
---
You don't like either answer you got even though one was answering about the community rewards (which understandably wasnt what you were asking) but this guy is answering your question. The loot pool from the atlas packages probably won't change, they never changed the loot pools from mole miner or presents so why would they change these. Just because someone doesn'g answer every aspect of your question doesn't mean they are giving you an invalid answer. Why are you being rude to people trying to answer your question. Also yes we are all sick of the "I'm quiting" posts but why do you care. Do other peoples unhappiness make you unhappy?
---
It is, I like the way it looks but I think I'll wait till it's fixed.. well IF its ever going to be fixed xD
---
From what I have read duping junk was so easy for a time that a lot of dupers just duped every type of junk to be set for live no matter what they may need.
---
But I can't really confirm it, it seems to make enough sense though.
---
It’s worse than before.
---
Yeah, I would even kill for an atom option to respec my char
---
Not much else to do so might as well.
---
Isn't that the weird truth of the matter.
---
You can switch out Perk cards at any time. I'm around level 40 and find I'm not using some of my earlier choices all that much. Lockpick for example, and some of the abilities you gain by way of mutations or legendaries make some of the quality of life Perks somewhat obsolete.
---
Anyone really disappointed that the brotherhood(west coast not Lyon&lt;3)are coming because they’re self righteous assholes who horde technology and sind contribute anything to society
---
Hey brother, your flair is a it decieving there.
---
I believe they said there would be a 2 week break.  Not enough if you ask me, but luckily you can't trust anything they say anyway so who knows.  Maybe it will be delayed just like everything else we want.
---
I totally agree with you here, sadly the way the game is marketed it means little features like a scrap box or double walls, heck even the build templates will have some hefty monetization involved. The game as it currently stands has the same bussniess model as mobile phone games business just sprinkled with buy this for the low low price of xxx Atoms.   
---
It is a shame that they went this way with the game, I loved the idea of a hybrid MMO survival game.
---
Also, let us use wallpaper in workshops.
---
If only the could make the gd mothman dance disappear... I have Fallout 1st myself, but that music triggers me.
---
How do you have the storage for 44k in steel? I can’t have 100 bulk steel without being over 800.
---
Absolutely. I actually finished tonight and one of the guys I play with finished over a week ago. He needs to concentrate on upping XP bonuses and intelligence. 
---
All hail the cranberry relish, brain bomb, and Berry Mentats combo. 
---
Mmmmm everything is purple.
---
Still weights a pound and now fits over armor, but it fits tight on the body like under armor, and any mods have been removed.
---
Ignoring that even if Bethesda added in a cool roach behemoth, it would be neat if it was just a living APC that dropped loads of roaches and fired beam attacks from it antenna. But again Bethesda got much bigger problems rn, you could even say that they are COLOSSAL...
---
yep patched.
---
The base game is empty of NPCs (as far as I know, entirely): you learn through the course of exploration why everyone is gone and replaced by the Scorched. The story is in terminals and tapes and notes. To be honest, that story is very rich, but didn't go over very well with most users. The developers then added two major factions (Raiders, Settlers) and integrated them into the established story. For the most part, the world still seems emptied of people, but in the way it was intended, but they are slowly creeping back.
---
I've actually hit that challenge multiple times in one event. It's all about the purple people life.
---
Do you have to build something specific or just anything?
---
No, he said "most".  It's true, you get four or five really easy ones like "build 5 things in your base" or "kill 20 creatures" or even "just join a damn group".  So yeah, in 20 minutes, I've done *most* of them.  Then it takes another hour to do inane shit like "kill 3 creatures in NW" or "kill a level 3 legendary" or even just "go from level 210 to level 211".
---
It doesn't matter how long it takes to do *most* of the challenges.  If you want level 100, and don't want to pay or to sweatlord xp repeatables for a weekend, then you need to do almost *all* of the challenges.
---
Swing and a miss
---
It’s happened to me a lot, since launch. Most notably prevalent with Mirelurk Queen at Toxic Lake Bed!
---
**EXPLOSION OF WATER**  
---
**Mirelurk Queen:** RROOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHH^oh ^I’m ^dead
---
A flying what?   LOL!
---
It likes fire! It was born in fire!
---
Mwhahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!
---
I love it that I can do whatever I want in division and still rank up my season.
---
Haven't played Fallout 76 since months. Wanted to start again with the season, but that shitty idea of forcing challenges down my throat keeps me away from the game.
---
I'm pretty sure people who said they're quitting just desperately hoped Bethesda would notice it. Ofc it's never gonna happen, but hope is irrational. Also those people probably were very frustrated so they didn't know what else to say. I'm sure after some time even if they quit they'll come back. I personally still have no idea what so upsetting  about camp happened that caused people to say that. I'm not playing long enough, so I still have a lot of stuff to do in game, so no quitting for me xD
---
I just wanted to make a double door and now I can’t
---
If they would just get rid of food and alchohol, bumped the cap rate, gave rarer plans you can't usually get in vendors, this would be way more worth our time
---
I got to level 60 in about a month and I’m probably gonna stop playing. Just not anywhere near as rewarding as Fallout 4, which will replace 76 in my game rotation. I’m on XB1 if I were on PC I really wouldn’t at all have given 76 a second chance. 🤷🏼
---
Sometimes changing wallpapers doesn't remove anything attached to the wall, but I've never been able to find a consistent reason. I really do not understand why they're intended to remove all items, because when that "glitch" happens everything still works fine and makes it a million times easier to change up the interior of my CAMP.
---
must..resist.. staring.. at your pic..it's hypnotizing!
---
I did. Sorry for answering you.
---
High health bolstering or vanguard. Low health u want unyielding. Can mix in a piece of chameleon if u like for the sneak but again if your a kick the door in death spraying plasma gat user sneak isn’t high on your list of priority’s.
---
I asked if there was a DEFINITIVE answer to a MULTIPLE CHOICE question and he said "no probably not". 
---
How does "no probably not" answer my question?
---
The mole miner event had 1 goal: kill the treasure hunter over one week. This event has several different goals over several weeks. They're not the same. 
---
As for being rude; it's obvious neither of them actually read what they're replying to. They saw they headline and jumped down to give their answers, neither of which answered the question, which is just wasting both of our time. 
---
As for not wanting to hear the bitching: I'd just like an answer without the whining. I'd like to avoid all the b.s. and just get to the point. There are a gazillion fucking posts people can whine on, I don't want to fucking read it looking for a simple answer to what I though was a simple question. 
---
Any other way I offended your delicate sensibilities?
---
This is honestly a good idea. The downside is us. Take the fast travel bug where it just cancels. I’ve had it happen a few times. But in a vote, it would be way low on my list. And others would put it near the top. I bet there’s some reading this that are annoyed to hear me say that. 
---
So in the end we’d all vote for that which we want most. And if someone’s bugs don’t make it to the top, they are going to be pissed.
---
Damn, I was thinking of moving and rebuilding my camp today, guess I'll wait.
---
I was in the same boat, did radiation rumble and thought either my internet or my machine had crapped out, gotta be honest kinda relieved it’s the game and not my hardware
---
Dude? Did you read the article? Do you know what this was used for? Not for duping directly, but to lag servers to make dupe methods and other exploits available
---
Well technically you are just forced to reach the rank of general in a pre-war military computer system in order to be granted access, though the enclave also approves of the pre-war system, given their history so it's kind of exactly what happens.
---
It's been back since then - it was the title music we had until Wastelanders came out!
---
only for aluminum and lead
---
I'd bet a lot of caps that this is exactly what will happen, and I'm worried that if it does it won't get a big enough reaction out of people to catch their attention like this did.
---
Ok Bender.
---
I´ll put it on my doorknob when your mom is over ..... for you know ... reasons
---
But you didn't answer me. Yes you took the time to type some nonsense, I won't dispute that. However it's a multiple choice question: "no" is not an answer to a multiple choice question. I asked if there was a definitive answer to that multiple choice question: your answer says PROBABLY not. Definitive and probably are opposites. All you did was waste both of our time.
---
I had a regret last time I encountered this bug, and I now want to pass it on to you...
---
You should’ve taken a photo with the point to the sky pose.
---
Do you have the new free lootbag/dropbag equipped? If yes there's a chance that when you drop something the bag will just *disappear*. Happend to me with some missiles I didn't need and the bag just got reduced to atoms. So if you accidentally dropped it it might be gone for ever :(
---
I’m not really sure maybe just give it a couple days hopefully it gets fix tho
---
Daily designs like that make me quit games instantly. Every time.
---
armour...in the legendary shop? !
---
BALLER!!!!!
---
I would submit a ticket on bethesda support
---
&gt; I honestly haven't seen an legitimate criticism about the ATLAS Project.
---
Here's one.
---
There is no in game notification that there is an event going. 
---
No event marker over Atlas.
---
No radio signal alerting players to the event. 
---
Most players tune out the tiny box in the corner of the main menu, as the desire to get in game means they just hit the button to get past that screen. 
---
As far as I can tell, reading that one box is the only way to know the event is going, unless you are invested enough to be reading about it online. 
---
Further, when actually going to Atlas, it doesn't feel like an event area and if I was a new player I'd simply assume it was just a story mission I hadn't unlocked yet, thus ignoring it until I did. 
---
The only other event in 76 that I've experienced was the first Meat Week. That was a blast! You had zero trouble knowing something 'different' was happening and the map was abuzz with activity. You could still play the regular game without being interrupted, but the event messages were frequent and tempting. 
---
Even when you didn't want to do them, looking at the map and seeing a group of 14+ players all gathered at one place spurred curiosity and got players excited.
---
I spent a good chunk of time just standing at Atlas yesterday while doing other things and I only saw 3 people stop by and then only 1 seemed to be participating in the event. 
---
This is a 'community' event that feels very isolating and solo styled as a result.
---
So that’s why bow started to suck 🤔
---
For me fireproof doesn’t work with the robot explosions. Grenades, grenade launchers, Missile Launchers, all do no damage to me with maxed fireproof. Let a robot explode near me? Downed in an instant.
---
Airships like the Prydwyn are known to be used frequently throughout the BoS' history and the assets to show one would still retain filenames from their use in FO4 representing that specific airship.
---
No one is gonna quit, its just people being impulsive.
---
Its the same shit with every update, at this point its just karma whoring.
---
You know, collecting junk and scrapping it is the easiest thing in the game. So why should the rewards be legendaries? Or anything else? You were told you’d get goodies, and a chance at some rare plans. 
---
I’ve donated over 8k steel. That’s what I got. Some goodies and plans, 4 of which o didn’t know. 
---
The rewards are meh. I was hoping that by plans they meant some of the plans you could get during the treasure hunter event, but no.
---
However me and my friends made it fun for ourselves. We decided to really explore Morgantown and found things we didn’t know. We went Supermutant hunting because their weapons give a lot of steel.
---
I don’t really play the game to get Uber rewards, but for fun. And smart people know how to make their own fun.
---
This shit just keeps getting worse.
---
I was going to get the nuka bundle just for the stairs but I won't even be able to install them.
---
Well, if every night after work and after you have taken care of yourself, I think it´s better to play then to binge netflix. At least you are doing someonthing and working on goals. I get routinely pissed off when people tell me that i´m playing too much because i play everyday. While those same people become couch potatoes from 8pm to midnight.
---
I love you !
---
Man a feisty sounds good
---
I feel your pain. I really wanted to destroy the raiders on my BoS character, but could even hurt them. And I wanted to join them on my evil character, but they were so bland I just scrapped that character, just did their quest on my main.
---
I think Jon from MATN found the best analogy for everything Bethesda does for Fallout 76, with the Simsons' cursed frogurt bit.
---
Bethesda gives us something cool. That's good. (Ammo converter! Whoo!)
---
But it's always, without fail, broken or bugged on release. That's bad. (Worst user experience imaginable)
---
But then they fix it... That's good. (Convert more ammo at once! Bigger point limit! Whoo!)
---
...in a way that is technically a fix, but is still terrible. That's bad. (Now you can't see what ammo you actually have to convert...)
---
It's just... there is zero quality control in this company and it's completely baffling how anyone approves some of this stuff for production. What's even more baffling is that people keep giving them money despite all this. Just one single play test of both the ammo converter and the duffel bag would have brought these issues to light long before they ever went to the public build. Same with the Fasnacht event being bugged to shit (literally), which they would have noticed if they had bothered to TEST it for even just one hour. Instead they assumed it would work. And this happens with every single thing they release.
---
Bullshit Update!
---
I couldn't agree more. As flawed as this game is, I still love it but as soon as I get the last 20 levels, I'm taking a long break. It's turned into such a grind that I have a hard time convincing myself to even get on the last couple nights
---
You're right. Also, you can loot it from that angle right away. What i liked about the normal paper bag was, you could drop your stuff and stand there with noone beeing able to loot before you move an inch.
---
Pervert.
---
I purchased a year, but I turned off the auto renewal the other day. I love the tent, but only use private world's to move stuff between characters.
---
i donated 35k and i got like 10 plans i havent learnt before, 7-8k of caps and got overencumbered with booze.  and now I have 700+ radaways and 500+ stimpacks.
---
Don’t worry about it. The majority of players don’t even use Reddit.
---
I just dont claim them till they fix it or I need something
---
Haven't offended me. As for bitching you cover that all on your own.
---
Bruh I don't get why so many people side with the literal villains of the franchise, like I understand the brotherhood isn't kind of a gray area but the enclave literally kidnaps and tortures tribals
---
I saw a camp last night that must have had 25 of the damn things throughout a giant 3 story building.
---
You know what I appreciates about you  u/Cerberus1247s?
---
Literally the first thing in the post states why he can't just un-sub.
---
What can I say, stupidity and laziness piss me off and those are both prime examples.
---
I agree with both you and OP
---
Its shocking they cant deliver what they promised and to be honest bethesda just appear to be more and more incompetent after every update or game they bring out. But you are right, just cancel subscriptions, stop paying for their games and go play something else. I have never before seen these loooong ass, emotional, passionate speeches for any other game that fails to deliver.  only in this community
---
Guys. At this point its painfully obvious bethesda dont give a fuck. Your massive post definitely isn't going to change their opinion. Just stop playing and paying and watch their company sink when everyone eventually realises this
---
How dare you, that emote is a wasteland treasure
---
Logging in every day to try to whittle down my 200+ T notes too.   :(
---
Just stop playing and stop paying
---
I used to do melee, but I started a new character for nuclear winter, I’m kinda using handmades in adventure to train accuracy for nuclear winter
---
What is your graphics settings? Try turning down Shadow quality and distance. I believe these 2 settings affect FPS the most.
---
Mmmm well there's little incentive not to do it. Look at the pathetic patch and the 25M steel trade for a hat and thrashed rewards.
---
It's pack up time for a lot of people anyways.
---
Build your camp near a settlers camp and an ally will random spawn there. Probably the closest thing to having 2 allies.
---
Oh man, I wanted to rebuild my CAMP after the season ended, but I think I might be stuck with nibe forever now, because the build I envisioned can’t be done anymore.🙈
---
Same here.....the grind ALONG with the caps on everything (caps, scrip, gb).   I started Outer Worlds yesterday.
---
Bruh the enclave couldn't even last 200 years, you let a single tribal obliterate your entire technically advanced base.
---
Or. U don’t waste ammo and squeeze of 1 shot and do 2k+ damage a headshot and when faced with a sheepy or SB hold down crit and wipe them out in seconds
---
The rewards probably won't change.
---
I’m 99% sure I didn’t drop it I was equipping it and” poof” it was gone. And no I just have a regular loot paper bag
---
They made changes in the newest patch to the quest so that only needs the ghoul blood when before it needed wolf and mole rat blood too. 
---
Apparently they forgot to tell it to the centrifuge...
---
Because those plants are not worth the hassle. Capping one, at least on a private server, means basically putting everything else you were doing down and babysitting the fucking thing. The attack frequency is nucking futs, often literally daisy chaining together, and plonking down turrets does precisely fuckall to make it actually defend itself while yer gone doing fun things like quests and murderhoboing(as was the case for FO4 settlements if you didnt abuse exploits or use mods to alter things).
---
Maybe the npc attack rate drops precipitously on public servers but that is irrelevant since players will usually snipe them if they think they can get away with it. And they often can, especially if the workshop is held by a lvl30-60 toon that's off questing while a lvl200 decides he wants some fusion cores.
---
You can always switch into commando or rifleman easily after grinding perk points. Getting a new weapon and ammo is the tougher part. Waiting for Bethesda to fix something is kinda hopeless
---
I can't find the plans after the update for arms and legs
---
No joke.   And man, tv is so mindless.   I can barely stand to do more than one or two hours of it at a time unless I'm really sick.
---
It's not a back and forth, there is constant whining after every single update. Wastelanders had positive reception for about 48-72 hours before people started complaining that gold/rep grind is too long, NPCs were stealing legendaries, assassin's doesn't affect humans, people didnt get to tag the riding shotgun legendary, bloodied didn't get nerfed, and whatever else. I still find it funny though that the worst reception that brought out all the lawsuit and death threats was fasnacht not working properly for a day
---
Preset load outs I think are needed but not with moving the specials. I’d like to be able to have option A my bloodied build and option B all the crafting and building perks. Not swap between 15 strength melee build and a 5 strength commando I think that defeats the object of having builds.
---
You do get some discounts, last week it was that fridge
---
I thought something was up with it. Oh well, makes it a perfect death bag, then, since others will have a harder time looking it if they don’t know.
---
Been seeing this happening in events. For the rest of the events in that server i also one shot the legendaries. Then TP to the lowest player n drop the loots in front of him/her b4 i disappear
---
This is Happening to me right now on PC
---
This happens every month. Most of them will never cancel, a good chunk of those that do will subscribe again within 2 weeks. Yet all of them need their attention and validation by posting here instead of actually doing anything
---
Nah, apparently it has the same hit box as the paper bag and I was trying the get it from the wrong side. Every. Time.
---
I thought that. Die every ten seconds. It’s not like that. Blocker. Serendipity and dodgy in your build and u mitigate a huge amount of incoming damage. With a high health buikd and those perks with vanguard armour I’d imagine your almost invincible
---
Now, this is a good tip, but at the same time, I have a feeling this isn’t intentional since the water pump isn’t available (to my knowledge).
---
That just breaks the fun and challenging aspect of the game completely though
---
Works perfectly fine on my ps4 pro.
---
very good advice. in fallout 4, 3 and NV I would always just brute force the fuck out of terminals but I've realised taking a few seconds to try and suss it out saves me a great deal of time overall. plus I feel big brained if I get it first try :D
---
Came here from a Google search to see if this was a thing. I unlocked the skin and it is not compatible with the Fixer. Rediculous
---
They didn't disclosed it
---
You probably need to have completed the wastelanders quest line
---
Wait, are you just saying that, or is this a thing?  
---
I've become paranoid since dying twice out of nowhere after the Queen would die and I'd be on my way to loot her. Every time I'd make it to my brown bag special, everything would be there except for my Flux. I saw someone running away from the area of my bag once, I could've sworn someone was sniping it.
---
Everytime I do that it lags out for me and I just end up standing there for a second unable to move. It ends up being quicker to spam tab.
---
Targeting addictive tendencies is a business model in nearly all realms of daily life. Clothes, fast food, toys, games, media, are all designed in a way to maximize profits and consumption, and in many cases the most efficient method also affects people with addictive tendencies more strongly than others. That may not even always be intentional because it's not something that can be separated
---
I tried seeing wat they added in as a feature to entice me. End up i donated 750 steep scraps n never to return again.
---
It is such an interesting update... waoh... pun intended.
---
If u say so. I’d say it’s still far easier at high health. My alt is a sniper at high health. Average build as I’m not spending points until I have 40 and then respec to a melee build. And with my alt it’s far easier, sbq encrypted aside, than with my bloodied build. If your not one shotting most things at high health there’s something wrong with your build
---
What do you mean you’ve already done this one? As in you’ve already achieved all 100 levels?
---
Screws are the only thing I’m always out of
---
Since i don care about camps, since most of the fun of the game has been slowly been taken away in the name of "removing grief or PVP aspects", you do whatever you want with camps... I could care less
---
pick up and use toothpaste
---
Hmm, didn't know that. I usually stash it immediately after the Queen dies, but this time 2 legendary Scorchbeasts and a diseased Scorchbeast all spawned immediately after her death and I wanted to get some hits on them before someone melted them. Then I died because I'm not really very good at the game.
---
I feel you on that one, that’s one of the things for me to stock I’d have to be able to supply myself with them lol
---
Wait it has a hit box.  Fuck me I thought beth was trolling me
---
You have to complete the Wastelansers story line to be able to use bullion.  Also, when you do make sure to keep all the fold fornyourself.
---
I subscribed, and have no regrets. I'm almost at the end of my first month, and the scrapbox and tent have been lifesavers on more than one occasion, and the Ranger outfit looks awesome. However, I (at the moment) only intend to remain subscribed for another month (or two max) unless I see notable improvement. I want to mentioned that the game cost and the subscription are all I've paid for, I haven't (and won't) buy atoms separately: there's no need, the sub and the run give me enough to get what I want, if I want.
---
My money is on the queen in this one.
---
2 is just Wack-A-Mole, hope you enjoy the carnie game
---
lead. my main weapon is an automatic handmade and it eats 5.56 for breakfast. lead and steel consume my existence lol.
---
I started late so I'm not going to finish the season and I know that. The only thing I kind of want is the firefly jar but having to log in every single day and scramble around to do the challenges is... Blegh. I made it most of the way there and now I just cba. The way the score requirements increase after each level is a pain in the butt.
---
What exactly do you mean by that? A questline for Foundation/Crater or something else? I ask because the only quest I have been getting is the Vital Equipment Daily from Ward. Like nobody in Crater wants anything to do with me
---
The trick also is knowing which are the better perks to choose and also which are the better weapons and armor to look out for.
---
Not a chance. That Dali lama is a vicious SOB. It’s all
---
An act with those robes mate.
---
Yeah, the titanic is still waiting on Bethesda ironing out the bugs on  the  iceberg warning system they sold them , accept the bow is as good as its ever going to get or move on to a sniper rifle or commando rifle my friend
---
Once got over three in a row first try in New Vegas around Searchlight.  Was the more difficult ones too.  It was total luck, *but I'm definitely gonna maintain taking credit for it as a tactical move.*
---
I figured that was the case, but if people aren’t aware, they’ll aim for a hit box in a place where there isn’t one.
---
I don’t get the big deal about the wall change. Can’t use doorways to glitch wires through walls? Well you’re in luck because there’s connectors for that, just grab the plans and you’re set. 
---
Unless there’s something bigger with the walls that I haven’t seen
---
Ammo economy? Most ammo is worthless anyways, I am not too bothered by this exploit. I'm surprised they didn't address it in the patch however.
---
Same goes for Raiders and Settlers ... and no doubt Enclave in the future. 
---
How many people are allied to both Settlers and Raiders so that they can have the stuff that is locked behind each of them? I know my BOS character is ... WTF?
---
If you decide to become allied with one faction over another, then the ones you don't support should be your enemy and any of their benefits should be locked away, certain top tier benefits. Faction benefits should be tiered and balanced, with strengths, weakness, traits/perks associated with the back-story of each - you decided which one fits your character and/or play-style. But if you want top tier benefits you have to choose a faction - and that choice comes with consequences. 
---
Public teams should also have some faction alignment associated with them. 
---
Want to change allegiance? Sure go for it ... but now you're a traitor and your previous faction will hunt you down, or at least shoot on sight. Players fully aligned to your previous faction can be given quests to also hunt you down. Change your mind? Too bad, your reputation is toast - get grinding again to build it back.
---
Don't want to do PVP? Then don't fully align with a faction, but no, you can't have their "ally" tier benefits then.
---
This is actually the way I originally thought/hoped it would work - and I hate PVP. 
---
Guess game/faction balancing was too difficult...
---
If the BoS wanted donations of stable flux, I would hang up my TSE 10mm and go home.
---
Not joking. 
---
People used to pick fights right after the SBQ, or take advantage of people clearing adds who don't have pacifist on by shooting back when they inevitably get hit by a stray bullet and swiping their flux. They changed it many updates ago to discourage this kind of flux farming which is good but it means you have to play smarter and not rush to loot her as there's always that final wave of adds to clear.
---
Find a tent first, stash your flux, clear the straggling adds, **then** loot. Advice from this ole lvl 500, anyway.
---
Ben Simmons and Embiid are our gods?
---
Can of has had you to bestow of it the me an many a plastic I think you call them unless dont you dont don't yes apostrophe, ok english bye nao sorry 4 mai shit word cuz know I dont of the
---
Combined with the low limits on caps, scrip and gb, it has really burned me out.
---
That's what I did for like 3 minutes
---
Since so many things still have their copy/pasted fallout 4 code in this game, there might be some exploit to use the fallout 4 "freeze" option where you open vats without targeting anything specific. Use that to glitch through walls or something idk. Maybe then they'l look into it
---
This. They finally got me with the FO1st. Moving all my junk into the scrap box for the first time felt better than taking a massive dump. Coincidentally, a massive dump is also a very accurate description of this current Season.
---
Have you been to the Wayward or spoken to the overseer ?
---
Does the pass end when the green ship reaches the end?
---
Then make your own screws. 😎
---
Totally OT, but thanks for helping your aunt with the garden.   I hope it turns out beautiful!
---
I thought u need to wait for at least a year? Didnt know they r so efficient. I m very impressed. Pun intended.
---
Lead, definitely lead
---
Really nice build and yep, that's definitely a legacy camp now. I really hope they give us these options again sometime.
---
Adhesive and aluminum but that's cuz I go through a LOT of arrows and by that same logic lead will be high profile too so good instinct
---
I'm in the process of completing New Arrivals. That Overseer quest?
---
Yeah thats a sad realisation for me cuz i love the bow aesthetic. I was thinking of just leveling up a shotgunner.. cant rly fail on that
---
Yeah, lol.   You work for the government by any chance?   We're great at creating acronyms.
---
😮
---
*that feeling when it clicks*   
---
Ohhh yeah, this song! I don't know how I could have forgotten it, it's epic. I can totally empathize with how you felt.
---
Don’t worry after they allowed loads of rare fixers to be duped , I’m sure the fixer skins coming to an atom shop very soon - only 99999 atoms
---
Ballistic fiber, screws,acid, lead &amp; ultracite all sell very well. If you're vendor caps farming I'd look into selling overdrive or just digested goo, if you have a route down it's easy but can be tedious for people not looking at a map
---
Dammit, you managed to transmit the regret...
---
Looking at the lore the "fusion" line of cars actually rely on "rechargeable batteries or on-board fission reactors" so the mushroom clouds do make sense as it is either fission that is being used or the weird unrealistic kind of "fusion" statet as "Nuclear fusion relies on the capture of radioactive energy from microfusion cells rather than generating power by using heat energy to drive turbines", I would assume a small vehicle like the fusion flea would use the microfusion cell batteries, though I can't confirm that. It would technically need refueling but the other generators, which obviously use combustion don#t need it either for game-play purposes so I don't see a problem there.
---
I definitely agree that having them as generators in our camps could make just as much sense as other camp items and actually look pretty cool.
---
The real-world parallel would be using a run down cars engine, or more specifically its alternator (needed to translate, hope it's the right word, English is not my native) in order to power your lamps and the like, which is just cool for a setting like that.
---
Additionally it makes more sense than being able to build a perfectly viable small scale reactor, which is not even possible for our real world scientists, though then a lot of things become questionable and it's better to assume that things just work differently in the Fallout universe.
---
Instigating fixer. One shot on the head. I get between 1500-2000+ damages at whitespring as a bloodied build
---
I wondered if they've ever studied burnout and dropout rates with these things.
---
I ain’t uninstalling cause if it gets fixed I’m not sitting a week to let it download but they sure as hell ain’t getting any more of ma money,
---
Vault stairs. It's in the title.
---
Surprising how FO3 come first but NV stayed closer to the mechanics of the original games
---
A two week break before Season 2 apparently. In my opinion, that’s not enough. I’m at SCORE 82 and I’m burnt out as it is.
---
yep. just doing dailies/weeklies + some casual xp farming. I got most part of it during double xp weekend. radiation rumble gives me 60k-80k of experience and so on. all my friends got rank 100 already. Special hello to complainers who was crying about NOT POSSIBLE to do it on time.
---
Did you read the first part of the post?
---
I'm all for getting fucked in the ass by Todd, I like that curly-haired weiner kid look, but does he need to put on a strap-on covered in thumb tacs and gasoline?
---
I’m kind of cap farming, but also enjoy helping people not have to go through a 5 hour grind to craft something. I do have a junk routine down though
---
I hate how people think stop paying is the only way to do it. Some people (like myself) want to make this constructive AND not cause the game to financially collapse (if everyone stopped paying). 
---
I think the way they are going about is really shitty, especially for those funding the game (1st members).
---
I will keep voicing my opinion and pursue change for the better of the game and franchise that I among many others, love.
---
Didn't destroy his camp, just fired off rounds to feel better after wasting my time. Did maybe a quarter of damage. I'm more frustrated that the game doesn't tell us the levels of the player before we waste time going, I think anyone would agree with that. Yeah, they can be used for defense or decoration but in front of a door that doesn't need to be guarded more is a dick move. It's shitty when Bethesda puts them in doorways on dimmly lit buses and it's shitty when he puts it in front of a door to his work benches with a turret inches away.
---
I like it’s more Slim Design, not as bulky as other PA Skins
---
Sometimes, its just a lag or someone killed the legendary b4 it managed to mutate...
---
The Seasons issue is the one that gets me every single time. It was a huge announcement - the entire post-Wastelanders roadmap with all of the gameplay content slated for the rest of 2020 and early 2021. It got over 1000 comments which is unheard of in this community. It was at the top of the front page. You literally could not miss it.
---
The top comment on the most visible post after a huge announcement asked whether seasons would continue to be free after the first one. A fair question since the wording was ambiguous in the announcement and Bethesda have a history of over monetisation in the game. Something that any community manager worth their salt would want to clarify immediately, especially since the answer they eventually gave was what the community wanted to hear.
---
Instead it takes six days. News starts filtering around to communities less involved in 76 that there's now going to be paid seasons on top of everything else, damaging the brand further because of inadequate communication in the first instance and then a lack of proper community engagement afterwards.
---
Here's what should have happened. Any one of the three community managers in this subreddit should have read the thread. I would be fairly clear what the main community concern is. You then either stick a comment saying "Oh no, all of them are free sorry for bad wording", or you pick up your phone, ring Todd, or the chief monetisation officer, or one of the interns, and say "Are seasons free in future?" and when the answer's yes, stick a comment down. There's no way that takes six days.
---
Instead, our beloved community managers were scrolling by new, commenting on cool builds (which ironically have now been purged by exploit machine) and giving radio silence on the biggest issue of the time. Either they're completely incompetent, because they let the issue fester too long which caused irreparable harm to the game and brand - people not associated with the game now think that the game has paid seasons on top of everything else. Or they aren't powerful enough to effect any meaningful change, since this would be a case of saying "We literally cannot do this, everyone will stop playing if we add in a fifth level of monetisation" and getting minds changed immediately because of community feedback.
---
Neither of the two options paint them in a positive light. I remember a big post, over a year old, from Bethesda regarding communication going forwards. About how they would engage more with the community, as would be expected from an always online game in 2018, not a single player game from 1995. Even with their extra special focus on communication, we still have delayed communication on big issues in the game (Fasnacht, for example), delayed communication on future content (Seasons), skipped ITVs if nobody feels like doing one this week, and, at best, vague responses to bug reports regarding fixes. I honestly believe you could script a simple bot that understands the context of a post and comments "We'll pass this on to the team!" or "We're looking at this as an urgent fix!" if it's a negative post or "Wow! That's amazing!" if it's positive and it would impact the community more than any of the managers.

matrix
---
I may have spent as much time on the menu as I did in game when that was the theme!
---
I read that part, my reply is mostly to Fallout 1st users as a whole not necessarily to you.
---
I feel your pain my amigo , I dropped a bloodied now at the leg. Vendor and was soooo excited until I started using it , way too buggy and hits like my granny’s hairdresser unfortunately
---
30 minutes for me, tops....    
---
Usually I had my player set up so that the xp bar was just ready to tip into levelling up....not much work required after the challenge drops to push it over the edge.   Failing that, a new character is completes the challenge by the time she's done at the Wayward and done a couple others things.    
---
As for the other challenges, if you know where to go for certain things, it's fast.   As is using a private world so that you don't have to compete with everyone for whatever.
---
I hear you I spent an hour yesterday doing the grind felt like half a day. Then I played Fallout 4 for 10 minutes and it was suddenly 5 hours later.
---
Is there a current work around? FFS Bethesda. This is beyond a joke. I can't even do the main story quest..
---
oh
---
Funny enough me and my friends built our own little town by placing all our camps together.
---
Oh wow, I had no clue. Thank you, you've restored some of my faith in Wastelanders.
---
Main Quest Quest Blocked For Me Too, Can't Get In
---
Yeah he seems shitty but so do you.
---
Acid and screws
---
Crater / Foundation / Train station should all be free.
---
I like it but I don’t think it’s good enough for the amount of ATOMS asked for. IMO the raider looks more like a junkyard skin since it’s built out of a lot of junk. I really dig the helmet though
---
"Everyone liked this"
---
Strange doesn't slow down for me. But I also use a solid state drive on my XB1 maybe that is why.
---
I have a 2lbs missile launcher and I just picked up the power fist. I don't use punji boards and if you think a bloodied commando/rifle build is going to drop a furious auto assault rifle, you're crazy 😕
---
I hear you guys on the % chance been broken 
---
But i have another 
---
So on xbox , i enter vats at a crucial moment , like being rushed and cornered by a handfull
---
Of baddies  ,  
---
U know those times in the game where tour sure 76 is sick of you wiping the floor with its AI so it goes into cheating mode lol
---
My bss +1s powerfist should make short work of the baddies , but no , pressing attack while in vats and .....nothing 
---
Im locked on one baddy with 2 to go , should be a simple one shot and then flip to next but no 
---
Just staring at the guys closing in .. tic tic tic 
---
So i exit and then re enter vats , but nope im still a statue / cant attack 
---
And then even when i can i completely miss even though the audio procs as if u made contact 
---
Stooooooopid
---
I go commando ( not now as I’m wearing pants obviously but you know what I mean ) loads of great weapons , handmade , fixer etc which actually work and pack a decent punch and fire rate
---
I’m on vacation at the moment, haven’t played since last week and not back online till the end of next week. Looks like I’m not missing anything.
---
But most users don't give them money, they paid the one off 12 month subscription and this is what the OP is talking about. If he regularly paid for the FO1st I'm sure he'd cancel it.
---
I got a anti armor fixer yesterday as a reward for that lame daily in the toxic valley.
---
that from the blackbear lodge to kill 3 creatures.
---
it was a one star, but a fixer nonetheless.
---
That’s the one real issue I have with wastelanders they should have changed the opening of the game away from leaving the vault to being freed from captivity by an NPC character.
---
I feel like if all train stations were free 1. Fast travel would be kinda useless to pay for and 2. Would give people too many areas
---
It’s Fallout flavored ESO. If you’re familiar with eso and liked it, you will enjoy this too. Their monetization scheme is exactly the same too, minus loot boxes. At least the core gameplay loop is very similar.
---
Wasn't it all royalty free though? Sounded like you playing a Roblox game rather than a *Fallout* game. But what's the difference?
---
The problem with this game is it wants you to play for like 2 hours everyday, but it's more enjoyable to uncap everything and tlet people play when they want for long periods rather than putting daily caps on things
---
Not even close to a trading post.
---
Lead / Steel / Plastic.
---
Against what? It's an open door to work benches with the muzzle of a turret pointed at it. If any real threat comes at it the turrets will take care of it, the punji is just a dick move.
---
Are we talking about the same thing. Like your character has a level and then the legendary run has a S.C.O.R.E rank, which has a limited number of daily points (unless you include the ridiculous 10,000 xp for 100 rank points)
---
Switch servers and tracking icon will come up again, sometimes it takes a while. I have had them empty, stuck up trees and hovering above trees.
---
Reading your list, our expectations are pretty low. And we still got disappointed.
---
Just... don't worry about SCORE!
---
Treat it as a nice bonus (that stole our free atoms in order to exist) rather than a goal in and of itself.
---
Read. The. Post.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, I see your points, particularly about pvp.   I just use them on private servers or take the higher level plants.  People are less likely to challenge you on them, but it still happens.
---
I don't have a problem with the attack rate on the plants personally.   I get a lot done outside of farming cores.   If the time invested bugs you, maybe let the enemies overrun the plant, and do the Retake event instead?   That's generally alot faster than Defend.
---
Sounds familiar to something irl.
---
They dont test, they slap their keyboards with their buttcheeks and Then upload...
---
There’s loads of screws in the cranberry bog town with with the claimable workshop in a secret room if you google it, hit that each time you play and you’ll have enough for your crafting needs
---
I’m managed to pull a BFFR FR fixer from the purveyor on fasnacht week, so I want a skin for my baby 🤣
---
Crater and Foundation should be free at neighborly or ally or better yet as early as you side with them. I don’t get why they’re not free
---
The number of people telling OP to stop paying for FO1st, even though OP predicted this would happen and explained that they paid the 12 months upfront, is genuinely astounding.  
---
Agreed OP, keeps trying to sabotage their own fan base, first by burning everyone who pre-ordered the game, and now by burning everyone who ponied up the money for the full 12 months of FO1st.   
---
There's probably some limited overlap between the two groups of people, but a lot of players came to 76 well after launch, when the game came to Steam and it started to seem like Bethesda was actually fixing up the bad things in the game.  
---
So they've managed to poison the well of their loyal fan base AND the less invested people who were willing to give them a chance down the track.  
---
Golf claps to Bethesda.
---
The BOS needs 125 million steel to build an apalachian version of liberty prime.
---
So I guess complete this, the two quests it gives you and just go from there?
---
Exactly, so the drawbacks would barely be there
---
I'm in the same boat currently on my alt.
---
do all possible event that pop up in the Forest / Toxic Valley, and roam around the Ash Heap.
---
Forest / Ash Heap / Toxic Valley all have set spawn level under 35 so you don't get random level 65 pack of ghouls.
---
Bethesda Austin is not a triple A game studio. They're not even double.
---
Yeah it would make life just a lot easier
---
I'm not a monster. We both had pacifist on. I just wasted ammo because I was frustrated. Everyone calm down. If I did destroy anything I'd repair it. I've repaired damaged stranger's camps. I was just mad I wasted time going to his camp for plans I already had at level 2. I'm not wasting caps on stuff I already have for the 3 purchase challenge, I was just blowing off steam. It's not even as bad as if I were in single player, quicksaved and killed an NPC. My missile launcher did nothing but make me feel better.
---
I'm tired of it too.   To the point that I think UF is better on a private server.
---
You'll get there in terms of powerful weapons.   If nothing else, grind that gold.  You will absolutely love the plasma caster and gauss minigun, or at least I do.
---
So in essence you’re saying:
---
„People who dupe X amounts of illegitimate legacy plasma weapons = People who make a wall float“
---
Yeah, miss me with that bs. Those are two vastly different issues.
---
Agree to disagree.
---
The price of FO76 would net you a pretty decent set up in Warframe, if you wait for a 50%-75% off login coupon.
---
They're also changing the new player experience with the upcoming expansion on the 25th, so it's possible that things will be better on that front.
---
They're a business, and the game is entirely free and able to be enjoyed without spending a dime.
---
Unlike in FO76, you can even trade players for the real money currency. 
---
Its not hard to make the currency, but you do need to learn how to do it.
---
^^(www.warframe.market)
---
DE is a *far* more competent developer than Bethesda has been.
---
^^(Chat rule enforcement is another story...)
---
People like to give all these businesses shit, but in reality we take a lot of what they do correctly for granted.
---
#Things can *always* be better.
---
Trouble is everyone is trying to chase the addictive feeling that got when they first played 76 but as gamers we know that’s very unlikely to return in these circumstances.
---
We just move on.
---
Yeah once you finish with the overseer then it's on to do some quests for both Raiders and Settlers. Make sure you do both sides to the point where you get the quests "Siding with...". Then you have to choose who to do the last mission with (you can still continue to do diailies and get reputation with both. You just get a reputation boost with the one you choose for the last quest)
---
I really wish they didn't have any pvp in Adventure mode.
---
Close. Got slap damage from a punji, KNEW nothing would happen so I wasted ammo and melee because I was frustrated. Then came on here to bitch about punjis. You all think I'm a greifer? Wow.
---
Oh, trust me, they don't want you to be playing period. Haven't you been paying attention? I'm starting to think that the devs are held hostage and every patch is a cry for help.
---
I will never. This game means to much to me. More than than appalachia radio means to the dj.
---
Google it. There's a lot of info out there.
---
Yea I noticed just from the other bug issues on the quest that they must have changed it at some point (I’m fairly new to this game) but it’s not even acknowledging I did the part of getting the blood sample and putting it in. It’s like it just disappeared.
---
Why would I trott halfway across the map, past minefields of monster, just to " donate" my precious scrap?
---
In Aid
---
It Just works
---
Who said I destroyed his camp? Did you all just assume I'm an asshole?
---
I’m unemployed at the moment so I kind of enjoy having something to look forward to everyday. But I see where most People would be put off.
---
At this point I don’t get why fast traveling costs anything, especially with the importance moving away from caps aside from player to player vending. I don’t think they’ll remove the cost, nor does it really bother me, I just think they should add more free spots
---
You have choosen or been choosen to.....
---
And lower the restrictions on building so we don’t have to switch to the doorway
---
Yeah I rock a bloodied fixer aswell and it’s brilliant, totally love it and I’m also a little nervous anytime I’m scripting just incase , the only problem I’ve heard with skins is that if you accidentally drop the weapon during a speed dump of your crappy weighty grenades and mines etc and ignore the prompt it disappears because there’s a skin on it
---
How am I a dick? Not lying about anything.
---
You're not wrong. Games are much more mentally stimulating. The same game every night though - I don't think that's any better than netflixing it all night.
---
yes. i have s.c.o.r.e. rank 100 of legendary run and almost got lvl 400. what is so ridiculous about 10k xp for 100 rank point?
---
If you haven't bought it yet, you might want to wait until September or so. That's when the new season kicks off, and I suspect there'll be some special activities in-game to launch it. On the other hand, joining now will give you a chance to get through the current content at a decent pace (but you'll not likely want to get in on The Legendary Race-not worth spending Atoms to get caught up from 0).
---
It should be criticized at every turn.
---
Overkill is more like it. Point the turrets towards the door, not inches from it and the punji. Damn.
---
&gt;I feel like gaming (whether videogames or boardgames) help keep the intellect alive. TV...... pretty much a stupifying drug.
---
Depends entirely on what you play and watch.
---
If you just watch mindless shit, yeah, it's not going to help.
---
The same can be said for games with relatively mindless gameplay.
---
Really agree.  I haven't played it in a week and I don't care, I just hit complete burnout with it.  At the beginning of the season I had a clear level goal to get to (I want the chicken coop) but now I've hit level 50 and it really doesn't bother me if I get any further.
---
I also don't relish the thought of ending one season and going straight into the next without a break/much of a break.  It's too much.
---
Hehehe
---
Yeah, i feel like i have mulltiple massive dumps, but dread of soon ending subscription is f...ing real, tho for that price i could buy something that realy worth, or food for almost weak!
---
Even if the object you pick is a world spawn, if it's inside a workshop area owned by someone it'll give you wanted status. Happened to me at the red rocket megastop with the locked toolbox near the red rocker cores recycling bin (daily quest).
---
I challenge anyone to search "punji" on this sub and find a positive post. Hate me all you want.
---
Yeah I just want to place my CAMP in a nice spot I like but fast travel costs to places in the main story would just be really expensive for me so I can’t really do it
---
"The 76ers"
---
Wish we came from vault 69, now.
---
Bethesda should do what fortnite does with their daily challenges. If you miss a daily challenge in fortnite, the amount of XP you missed turn into a double XP boost and it stacks depending on how many challenges and days you missed. So it helps you get back your missed XP instead of punishing you for missing it, and more games ( espically fallout 76, since dailies in it are a chore and take quite some time to complete ) should pick up on this system
---
Hmmm i
---
May have to
---
Join the cause /. Somebody said u can switch of auto renew - is that the same ?? / or not ( xbox )
---
so what, his sub end some day and dont need to refresh it. Throwing another money to someone who fool you again and again. His choice, dont cry about money never ever again.
---
I really wish they didn't have PVP at all. In fact I really wish they didn't have *online* at all. For someone like me who loathes multiplayer in general the game's really only playable with one buddy on a private server.
---
I thought the raider thing was just like a collection that gathers junk ammo over time. slow and bad ammo. the converter is better I think. still could be better.
---
I dont even know why we left vault 76 behind. Why dont we live in and around it.
---
S.C.O.R.E. is not the only reason to log on daily.  
---
I finally unlocked top Raider rep on my main character. Not looking forward to do those dailies on my alt character aswell, but I kinda want to. Why? Because the ammodispenser is too good to pass on, plus treasure notes are required each day aswell. That is if you want a better chance on a good armor piece. Legendary mobs only drop the most ridicules (and useless) items.
---
I think its score from auto completed challenges. I logged on one day and saw I had 2 dailies already completed and thought to myself well shit. Went and actually completed a daily and I got 750 score and still had the rest of my dailies to do
---
It’s crazy they are not free, doing the intensely repetitive dailies and being charged for it, what a kick in the teeth from bethesda.
---
I died right after Scorched Earth and as I was wrestling to get my reticule on the tiny spot on my loot bag where I could access the contents, some chucklefuck power armor d-bag bullies me out of the way of my own bag and immediately hoovers it all up. It was buried under a dead SBQ! There was only a tiny bit of blue showing.
---
They don't want us to play, the devs are actually being held hostage and every patch is like a cry for help.
---
On a more serious note, very few words make it through to the devs, and it seems they care even fewer times. I will never be mad at Blizzard again after experiencing how actual radio silence and being out of touch with the community feels. Bethesda is reaching EA levels in my eyes. I don't know at this point what's truly wrong. Are they understaffed, incompetent, bad management and suits making one bad decision after the other? Everything combined? All I know is that I'm watching a game with tons of potential that I'm invested in killing itself. And that makes me extremely sad.
---
On console (ps4) at least if you cant trade the current player fix is do any event then trade as soon as possible works for me like 90% of the time other potential fixes are having both ppl close the game fully then reopen it and try trading immediately
---
Been watching that come down in price, any good?
---
Thank you for the advice. I didn't know if I was just rushing the story or something like that.
---
It's because Obsidian did NV, with some of the original Fallout people.
---
I've had the idea for this faction for a long time. The Reclaimers. I just can't ever get it started up, no matter how hard I try.
---
The Quest "tracking unknowns" gives it as a reward.
---
You start at Harpers Ferry where three questmarkers appear, you need to read the entries in the terminals near the red gates.
---
Then north of Valley Galleria in the far east of the map you will find a Gutsy Robot that gives you the Quest.
---
At this point they would need a double sided walls for every wall type that currently exists. 
---
A generic unfinished wall will likely not be enough to maintain the looks people are currently using, which then brings up again the need for ruined and fine variants that they rarely think to implement. So very few items that in game that have pristine and ruined vsriants.
---
I guess they could implement wallpapers for the various front and  backsides of the currently existing walls. But then it becomes an issue of distributing them back out to the populace.
---
Do they get coded back into each individual building set? Or be a completely separate set of walls/wallpapers?  Each variant needing to be coded in will just make that many more points of failure given their current track record.
---
My prediction is that they would sell each one individually in separate over priced atom sets. 
---
I myself have rooms in my camp that are designed to utilize the natural unfinished looks of certain walls and the various wallpapers.
---
I highly doubt anything they come up with will be able to satisfy the needs of the entire community while also managing to avoid the temptation of selling us back the fix for cash.
---
The trunk must also be magic - given all the crap I have in my stash.
---
I paid full price at launch. I knew I wouldn't be able to spend on Atoms, but was happy because they said all content will be free. I didn't even feel cheated when it went on sale soon after. Then utility items and the sub came out, my friends that I convinced to buy the game left. That's when I stopped defending beth.
---
If I could I would also cancel.
---
Wow you really aren't getting the point of this post at all, are you?
---
It's not the fault of those who subscribed originally, it's bethesda's, they sold something, people paid for it, then they didn't deliver the whole product, that's just plain fraud and needs to be addressed.
---
He is in no way just crying about money, he is addressing a serious issue.
---
If you were to go to a store to lets say buy a phone, you make a contract in order to get a flatrate and the phone with it and then got an older version of the phone that's missing multiple features, would you not be upset? Would you just "stop paying" as you say?
---
Hotfixed you mean. xD
---
Yeah this is where having 2 accounts (on PC) comes in handy.
---
Just waiting to finish the Legendary Run, will be far enough in 4 days to use atoms buy the rest of the levels.
---
Then I'll take a break and see if things improve before deciding if I'll come back.
---
Delicious! Finally, some good fucking ideas.
---
Also eats up more camp budget.
---
The enclave gave us giant bats that killed everyone,  a plague that continues to kill people. Worst of all they didnt even manage to continue this plague to kill Preston's before we leave vault 111.
---
With the Legendary Run, sometimes people need to kill Legendaries to complete a daily SCORE challenge. Don’t one shot Legendaries.
---
The S.C.O.R.E system is actually what made me stop playing consistently. See y'all when Dawn of Steel arrives
---
If you have a BE25 railway rifle, I have 250 corks for you!
---
same
---
I play both sneak with Chinese stealth suit, party healer, or with power armor and my plasma caster and vampire gatling plasma.
---
It's decent but short
---
In the southwest of Ireland I think
---
Finally, a non-salty post! Thank you, Sixgun, for lifting my spirits. I've dropped about 2500 steel, and the immediate rewards (while not amazing) are perfectly adequate considering how common the material in question this week is. Cork week, though - I'm not sure a couple of bottles of booze and a few floater grenades is adequate compensation. Perhaps the drop rates will be stealthily tweaked by then...
---
Globes anywhere such as Bog Town.
---
Are you looking for a plutonic friend or maybe something more?  I'm Sara, my wife is Teresa. We live in the US in Arizona.
---
Might want to make this a priority as it's a quest early on and lots of new players are playing due to Ganes Pass.
---
It is ridiculous, but that’s how it is at the moment and people know that’s how it works. Yet they still one shot the shit out of them.
---
The point was that it's hardly something that can be controlled. An addictive personality literally means you are more obsessive towards certain aspects of desire or incentive than others. Things that are made to tempt people without addictive tendencies will tempt those who do have them more. It can be done accidentally or they can benefit from it knowingly, but the only way to avoid it is to abolish all forms of entertainment, industry, and anything else that people might ever want until dopamine is entirely erased from your life, and only then will the playing field be even. Having addictive tendencies is a very real issue, but it's an issue you have to get help for instead of using it as a victim card at every turn of your life
---
Same story. I paid full price at launch. I knew I wouldn't be able to spend on Atoms, but was happy because they said all content will be free. I didn't even feel cheated when it went on sale soon after. Then utility items and the sub came out, my friends that I convinced to buy the game left. That's when I stopped defending beth.
---
Bite my shiny metal ass

Fuck. Now i gotta check mine. It did seem off to me when my combat armor didn't appear over it

"Maybe this time it won't explode?"

I really don't understand why people still have fallout 1st
---
At least they had no dissidents in their rank ... aside from the computers.
---
You can use them in a private or adventure and move your characters freely between as well
---
Nah, I liked the Heart of the Enemy glitch much better. Oh well, there are still 2 others reported months ago but not fixed...
---
I’m not going to do it but I did wonder when I dropped into nw for the score challenge how a high level player had found looted equipped and used a Gatling gun to kill me before I had taken 3 steps
---
This post has a good bearkdown for you: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i470wd/communication\_what\_we\_wantedexpected\_vs\_what\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i470wd/communication_what_we_wantedexpected_vs_what_we/)
---
I'm on hiatus until new quests, but have been since S.C.O.R.E. Surprisingly easy
---
The solution would be to stop paying them for things you're not getting then.  This isn't child support, no one is forcing you to send them any money.  If you don't want to support the bastards, don't pay them.  As long as people enable them, they will continue to screw them, over and over, with no incentive to reciprocate...
---
Circular/Mitre saw blade not angle grinder, but anyways, isn’t it also spinning the wrong way?
---
Do you have fallout first, if not than no.  It's a bonus for first members
---
You: "~~Diplomatic~~ Fire immunity...!"
---
Floaters: "...has just been revoked!"
---
That sounds incredible.
---
On a similar theme, the "mod a weapon or piece of armour" task -apply paint, remove paint, rinse and repeat 👍
---
A mitre saw blade doesn’t glow orange and shoot sparks when spinning freely last time I checked.        
---
          
---
Damn didn’t notice the spinning til you mentioned it but haha
---
Aw fr?? I'm a power armour build so
---
Ah, come on.   Wouldn't you have just laughed as you killed him?
---
Doing fine with your build is not proof of diversity at all.
---
Reminds me of mama Murphy
---
This is not official way how to make a reclamation, he should ask for refund or something. A lot of better games cant deliver what they promise why should this? Buying year sub is risk and their marketing. 
---
About that phone example. You get older version but you buy another older version from the same company thinking they sell you new one this time? Come on.
---
Nah. I've stuck with it for so long now I dont see myself quitting now. Tbh I dont find any of the new problems worth quitting over
---
Don't know yet.
---
Yeah same,but if you exit power armor and place it near the station and go to crafting the bug will probably wont occur.
---
I know what you mean.
---
I’d recommend getting it on Xbox game pass, you can get it for 1$ for the first month. You can easily get a few play throughs in over a month. That’s what I did. Great game
---
Me toooo - ugh!
---
Ah alright. Gonna be a bit tricky though because im always In it and I just get out a lot for ammo crafting
---
I agree. I don't even play the game like I used too. I stopped doing the daily missions for the factions because it takes time away from xp farming and the daily and weekly missions.
---
I just do the challenges then xp farm until I level up. I used to farm the queen sometimes and thought about going for the wendigo colossus but it seems like a waste of time because I miss out on the score. 
---
Since I can get atoms from the score it makes those worthwhile too
---
Thanks, I play on PC though, but its down to about £20 or so now, will pick it up on an impulse spend at some point id imagine
---
In my experience, unless it's a science or history show, how is it not mindless?   Okay, some British mystery shows aren't mindless, but what would you put the percentage on for mindless vs.  intellectually satisfying?   5, 95?
---
Games....   never played one that was mindless.   However, now that most of the stuff has been figured on in 76 for me, it's approaching that.   Time to learn other games.
---
Once I saw the mapping for the Legendary Run I knew it was going to be a chore. A grind. A concept we’ve seen before in other games. But considering it was the first, I committed to it. But it’s the first and last I’m doing.
---
Good. They have to be. Eliminated.
---
If you join a public team, it will add up to 3 camps and 3 survival tents to fast travel.  I think you can fast travel to your team mebers for free too which gives a possible 9 spots.  You can also use events when they are flashing.  I did get to the point where I have plenty of caps and can easily sell the 1400 to bot vendors, so I don't want the additional loading screens.
---
1st sibscribera could simply go private and workshop it there as it would disappear after i leave. Only beth would know. I would do it but i dont want to risk a permaban. (I dont have the armco yet)
---
Escape on PC, but still. REALLY badly implemented system. Nowhere else do you use Esc on PC expect opening the map...
---
&gt;lol yeah someone on here mentioned that it is now worse than before.  I thought "nah, can't be any worse", then went to use it.  It's so bad!
---
using ssd aswell so I don t think it comes from that
---
Xbox game pass is for pc. The pc version is 1$ the first month
---
I am also stuck on this quest,  just tried this and sadly the option to collect blood was not on a mole rat. 
---
How did Bethesda fuck up this bad? What type of incompetent work experience kids do they have working on this game?
---
He can't just stop the subscription if he got the 1 year one, and well it should be a risk in the way that the cosmetics may disappoint but if they literally say that features are going to be available that is just false advertising. Yes he should ask for a refund but that still doesn't change the underlying problem he is trying to address.
---
And with the Phone example there is a reason why I used a contract as an example instead of buying another phone, you know. In that example it's the same, as you would be stuck paying something which is missing what was advertised. I am not sure whether or not you get what a subscription or a contract for a phone is.
---
This conversation is over though as you appear to not want to understand, so I will not be responding anymore.
---
That’s six possible spots but yeah you can do that just kinda wish Crater and Foundation were free fast travel spots especially cause they’re far from each other
---
Can confirm, I load into nw and ft much quicker than my friend without an upgraded hard drive. Sometimes 15 or more seconds faster. Except I have mine set up a little different.
---
I have a 1tb sshd installed on the system and the game is saved on the system along with all of my save data. The rest of my games are saved on an external HD, however. This allows me to clean my systems memory more efficiently and easily. I also feel secure knowing my favorite games are backed up externally and I won't have to download them again. The main game I play will be saved on the system to increase performance, other games can still be accessed from the external HD but tend to load slower. 
---
Hard wire internet connection can help improve load times as well. Sometimes it just comes down to proper setup and hardware.
---
Apparently Vault 76 is designed to fail and be inoperable after 25 years. You can tell the two survivors just outside the Vault this.
---
Armco and gauss mini are both ally level rep which made me mad. Armco at neighbourly would have been nice. Been collecting strangler heart plans while i grinded rep.
---
Also, you can use the item you get from the legendary run. The vault-tec supply package.
---
What you mean is the camp divice that you got before leaving the vault.
---
The survival tent is at least a mobile free fast travel spot that you can place almost all over the world when you are a fallout 1st member.
---
The tent isn't a privat server only item if that answers your question.
---
Morgantown high school also has a fair number of golf balls (in the gym).
---
He was just correcting you. Since the gauntlets is not an angle grinder
---
You know you don't *have* to complete the season right? You could just ignore it, log in when you want and have fun playing the game.  
---
Are the rewards going to improve your enjoyment of the game *that* much?
---
My goal was also the chicken coop, anything after that unless you get the top slot is a waste of time to me, I don't look at my level for the board i'm just counting the squares down now I have 9 to go, makes it feel better about the grind.
---
Things trying to get into the building. It may not be effective but chances are the builder didn’t know that. Smashing up a camp is a dick move, not building a non trap camp
---
He got the last laugh tho, still kept his 1* nocturnal rolling pin
---
Thanks, I know a lot less people will be donating cork than Steel, mostly because cork is rarer material and o doubt the rewards will be any better
---
I've done that event more than 20 times with zero fixer plans dropped 😭
---
I suspect when they show up they'll immediately become hostile to us what with all our mutations and such that that brotherhood fanboy will become the first casualty. That or they'll turn him into a monster before long.
---
Story wise sounded like the brotherhood did alot more raiding that the wannabe raiders we wound up with.
---
&gt; I don't have a problem with the attack rate on the plants personally.
---
I have to wonder what's different, because last time my buddy and I took the Poseidon NPP we had four consecutive attacks basically back to back. Maybe a level thing? I'm only 32 and my buddy's 42, so we're fairly low level in the grand scheme of things.
---
&gt;  If the time invested bugs you, maybe let the enemies overrun the plant, and do the Retake event instead as soon as it pops? That's generally alot faster than Defend.
---
That's generally what ends up happening anyway because neither myself nor the buddy I play with have the time or desire to sit there for an entire 4-8 hour sesh and babysit the Poseidon Nuclear Plant or the RR Megastop. Or the racetrack...I main an M2 Browning with a black powder rifle alongside so I chew through lead like nobody's business.
---
&gt; We're having pretty different experiences with turrets. I've literally had to shoot no one at some Defends. I've stopped putting them down if I want the xp.
---
The problem isn't how effective they are when we're present, the problem is placing them down does **fuck all** for allowing the workshop to defend itself while we're gone. The whole point of placing defenses isn't to make the defense quest easier when you're there, but to make it where the settlement can wipe its own arse when you're off doing other things.
---
This was a big problem in FO4 as well. 
---
I stopped having the problem in Fallout 4 when I realized putting a couple dozen missile turrets down on a settlement generally nipped attacks in the bud outright, but that's not possible in 76 for a fair few reasons(Neither of us can build them, the game won't let us build that many of them being the main two).
---
It was a gripe I, and many countless other, players had with the system in Fallout 4, and it seems they didn't change a goddamn thing for 76. Way I see it, if your turrets are so effective when you're present that you have to turn them off to get any XP out of an attack, they should be able to repel 99% of unattended NPC attacks.
---
No I don't, but I still love me some acronyms.
---
They should have added some event or daily quest that would reward us extra steel, not you just have to do more chores for another chore
---
To be frank, I feel like at most this would be a temp suspension unless you really abused it.
---
Thanks for checking.
---
Many clues point to devs who don't play the game and do minimal or no testing. The number of people who have problems with this"improved" quest only strengthens the idea that the studio is operating under flawed leadership.
---
I've got to rebuild mine as I switched them to bloodied to grind out the scoreboard but can tell you they're a lot more viable that generally thought of. They are a bit of a novelty in parts because of how the gear and perks work but if you use something like and instigating weapon during the day you don't feel debuffed. Night eyes is a great perk but the visual effect takes a little getting used too. That and mr sandman are the most useful nighttime perks. Also don't bother with nocturnal armor, it really could use changing to have a stat boost as DR doesn't make a big difference.
---
I was counting one person as 3 spots for their camp, tent, and character.  Then if team is full, there are 3 others besides yourself.  Unsure about traveling to the character now though.  It was possible early on qhen public teams hit.
---
Hear, hear.
---
I've done that event more than 20 times so farwith zero fixer plans dropped 😭
---
NO ITS NOT STOP LYING IF IT WAS A PRIORITY IT WOULD BE FIXED BEFORE ADRENALINE
---
It is  quite good seemed bug free when I was playing it although I'm not a fan came back to fo76 it is a good game but not for me glad I tried it on game pass so didn't actually buy it game pass is good in that it allows you to trial full games before you buy them
---
A lot of ppl quiting is not a good thing...
---
This is bethesda that we always knew, ppl quiting will not move them but it will destroy our beloved game and community 
---
If there is a positive way of fixing this situation, I'm all in
---
But as it happened to a lot of games and platforms before it will come at some point when everyone is fed up
---
All you're doing is diluting the waters of discussion when it comes to regulating game publishers taking advantage of consumers. It's not worth it.
---
It is kind of lore fitting, isn’t it. I’ve not visited them yet, but I am hoping there’s some kind of reputation reward scaling. Because yes, they are the Sheriff of Nottingham faction, and unlike offline Fallout games you’re not (exactly) the protagonist so they’ll treat you like scum. But they do react to force majeure kind of situations. Also it would be a shame if they got ignored because the gamble / payoff ratio is too much on the losing side.
---
Oh nice, never look at that at all, my gaming time is so limited that only only tend to pick up 1 or 2 games at a time, cheers
---
It is absolutely a societal issue. Human nature is to get better stuff than everyone else, then flaunt it because it somehow makes them "better" than those who don't have it. It's even worse here in the US. Now, I don't know how many non-american (for lack of a better term) people are upset about the rewards, but I do know that Americans tend to confuse self-reliance and self-confidence with selfishness. It would not surprise me to learn that the majority of the "screw that, I'm keeping my stuff" set are American in origin.
---
“I pledge allegiance to the...”
---
I'm doing it on 2 profiles burnt out is a understatment
---
Well I guess then the game just behaves as usual:glitches and bugged. Sorry for your loss tho
---
this happened to me on ps.  i unequipped and put back and it was ok
---
Thats a bonus, I remember FO1 and 2 were well constructed games, dont recall major bugs affecting me and the humour and writing was good. I am a bit like you, the whole space universe doesn't overly appeal, that's why I have held off on it
---
The thought of coming home to your camp and finding a Paladin rummaging through your stash makes me laugh. “Glass shards? Fukken taxed, mate.”
---
This explains why I can enter nw grab a weapon and kill someone as the spawn 😆
---
I appreciate the way that rhymed
---
woah.
---
Same here. I came back because wastelanders actually seemed pretty good.. Then it was the same repetitive grind with terrible end game.
---
I did forget about it all,sounds terrible now.
---
But i just cant live without my scrapbox anymore,whoever thought of that is brilliant...
---
Anyway u are right
---
If you are running into enemies you can't handle it's time to put the questing on hold and work on your build and gear. If you have a weapon you like work towards the perk cards that boost its damage. For example, if you like your handmade get all the rifleman perks.
---
I'd rather focus on things that can actually change rather than get upset over unavoidably consequences of human nature
---
good points
---
The rewards probably won't change, that's it.
---
No. I don’t play lots. Half hour is enough to get the daily’s done without NW. weeklys seem to complete themselfs as I do the daily’s and I’m rank 76 currently. Doesn’t need to be made easier
---
Documentaries.
---
Literally anything educational.
---
And games like Diablo 3 instantly come to mind when I think of mindless.
---
FO76 is definitely mostly a mindless grind.
---
Everything that you're supposed to "find" for quests is marked and requires no actual effort, as if your character just knows where everything is.
---
Im level 5 and im about to quit any minute now because its so fun
---
Scrapbox lol
---
10. Manhunt - If you load in up the road from the dam, then turn around and look behind you, then you will probably see two Marshalls right behind you.   They will attack you for no reason.  Sometimes they will start shooting immediately, but sometimes they will wait until you get closer to the dam and start engaging Super Mutants.  If you load in, turn around and see Marshalls behind you, then just go ahead and kill them, to save yourself the trouble.  It will not affect the outcome of the event.  Once you take out Malone, you will still get all of the rewards.  I have fought the Marshalls many times, during the Manhunt event.
---
.
---
I'm pretty sure I have a ton of the stuff sitting in my scrapbox, but I can imagine most people chuck it out when they need space in their stash. It will definitely be harder to reach the goal.
---
To change the rewards there would probably require an update. And bringing down games on consuls for updates is not simple. Xbox and PS4 both have restrictions on how often games can do that, which includes for what reasons. And it costs money. 
---
Yup, games have to pay for updates sometimes. Every time? I don’t know. Those details are always worked out between the platform and the game makers.
---
Xbox and PS4 have an interest in making sure players have as few interruptions to the games they are playing.
---
That key-ring would literally save server lag, as individual items need way more storage than a single one and I think that would translate somewhat if they had one "keyring" item with variables at true or false for whether you have the key or not.
---
And maybe add a "master-keycard" for those, heck they could even add an enclave quest or something to unlock it for it to make sense (like having modus add the data of keycards to that one)
---
ESPN with the 200,000,000 million thing. Why didn't they switch the amounts?
---
Well you probably didn't know but there are other players. Players who can't play every day
---
Yeah, I don't understand that either.
---
Reminds me of the r6s sub lol. They keep complaining about the issues that have been here for years and nothing gets better.
---
Personally, I think the issue is with the lead dev not really know where he wants to take the game from day 1. They've just been coasting along, hoping they'd find a good spot.
---
I'm not a 100% sure, but I think you get the original ranger armor and helmet as well as whatever special outfit or offer is available at the time for all F1 members. There really should be a something that shows what is available presently if they want to sell it.
---
Yeah, like it is great we are getting all this free content but I feel it would be better if they did these two things
---
Increase daily score or the season length 
---
As a bonus for the weekly challenges make it that we get something like 50 atoms along with the weekly challenge score.
---
I do. And the rewards. Just like in every single legend run over a month or two are there to entice u to play the game. Nothing but cosmetics really a little scrip and gold on the way. If you don’t buy in the time u don’t get rewarded. That’s the entire point of it.
---
Especially now that Wastelanders has added in the missing third of the game that Godd Howard forgot to put in on launch. Genuinely think, if they would let us divorce the game from the online aspect and play solely on our local machines(With the caveat that characters used for this would not be able to join online sessions; this would enable modding ala 3/NV/4 without concern of it being a way to cheat items online), they'd have a real winner on their hands.
---
That's what he for not using dense armor and fireproof perks. 
---
\*one shooter here lol\*
---
It's something akin to stockholm syndrome.  They come here seeking empathy and don't want to cancel, yet rail against 'tough love' advice to leave if they're not happy with the arrangement, despite the fact that they can cancel at any time and get a pro-rated refund for the remainder of the year's subscription.  No one is forcing them to put up with it but themselves...
---
Oh for the love of Atom 😣
---
What's broken? I haven't noticed any more neg effects than there should be, before P21.
---
I use Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones, Carnivore, Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, Healing Factor, Marsupial, and Peed demon.
---
The last round of outrage I made a thread telling people to put up or shut up and if they were really going to quit record a video feeding all their gear for scrip. Mods nuked the thread because some one got salty and reported me.
---
1. Guided Meditation - I have been doing it that way for a long time.  I just load into the event, go to the bridge speaker and kill the two or three ghouls attacking it, then just stand there for six minutes or so, listening to the soothing voice talking through the meditation, then collect the event rewards, get credit for a daily requirement, or whatever.  This is nothing new, and I am happy it is this way, because it is a very easy event completion.  I am sure there is probably a way to "encourage" more ghouls though, if that is what you want.  Have you tried just going to the other speakers, to see if more ghouls end coming there?  Have you tried going to the ghouls that you can usually see on the other bridges, to attack them?
---
Yeah, documentaries and education thing are usually pretty good.   Still, most stuff isn't in those categories.
---
I thought FO76 was pretty challenging before I learned most of it.  Now....time to learn a new game as this one has definitely turned into a mindless grind.
---
Yeah but Stop Sucking Score Sounds Silly just doesn't ring the right way
---
Some Mutant Warlord did about 5 legendary mutations yesterday, fell off a tall building and I followed it and it and had no legendary on it.
---
I am near the end and have so far been dissapointed in everything I have received i wouldnt worry if you don't get it
---
Nope, instead they'll just use it to blame Bethesda
---
Yeah, I may just move back to the settler's bag and use the duffel bag for death drops.
---
That didn't stop it last time....
---
If you are on Xbox I'll buy it for you
---
3.  Naked headless Scorched - Yeah, I have experienced this in other areas as well.  The worst part is you can shoot or melee them all you want, and they will still just be standing there, so you never get to loot them.  This should definitely be fixed.
---
It's not people being impulsive, it's people being drama queens. I bet if you went back over the last few waves of outrage you'd find the same people swearing that time the last straw and they were out.
---
Totally agree. They have said they are ‘looking in to resolving it’ because of the push back. They obviously can’t undo the patch so hopefully they just release them. I mean, how hard can it be? Just blank double sided interior walls lol. They finally released junk walls (reused asset from fallout 4...) with only 4 pieces.. and no corner piece. Which they had in Fallout 4. 🙄
---
Oh ok yeah you’re right
---
It’s literally the first fucking thing he says - he paid for the year’s package, so he can’t unsubscribe.
---
You should see some of the comments from dupers. Many are not going to help and gloat about it.
---
Bethesda?
---
HE CAN NOT STOP PAYING BECAUSE HE BOUGHT THE TWELVE MONTH PACKAGE YOU THICK TWAT
---
Two words: Situational Awareness.  You get this mad when you go to npc trapped areas?  
---
In front of a door is a weird place for a punji board but maybe that door attracts enemies more than the rest of his camp.  I have particular walls and support posts in different camps that attract enemies more than anything else.  Not sure that knowing levels would help anything, many people sell stuff on their alts.  By mentioning Wrecking Ball (which doesn't work in camps btw) you did seem to imply that you damaged his camp in a fit of rage.  Glad to see that that wasn't what happened but still not sure how you did any damage at all.  You don't have to waste time going to camps for the challenge either, just trade with a friend.  3 of any ammo at 1 cap each.  You both will get credit.
---
The number of players who visit this sub compared to the number who play the game would be tiny so whatever is suggested here will have little effect. Considering how poorly it is even noted in game them event even exists Im surprised many even find there way to it to participate, if they didnt know about it from various sites. 
---
Despite it all the steel was 3/4s done when I checked this morning so no. I doubt there is any danger of the event failing at any point.
---
Angry upvote
---
I've actually just taken 2 days out for this exact reason.
---
Read the first thing he said you thick cunt.
---
So workshop where everyone can build and nobody can PVP? Sounds like a good idea, but there's always the element of player abuse. There'd have to be a system to kick out trolls who would just build out swastikas or something.
---
I'd give you a thumbs up, but the Enclave.....just a bunch of technofascists.  You had me until you mentioned their name.
---
okay got it thanks! appreciate the info
---
No they won’t. They’ll blame Bethesda for cheating the players.
---
Here’s what’s really going on with a lot of them. 
---
They are saying that because they need an out of the event completes. Because they don’t want to admit that players actually did it and weren’t buttsore like they are. 
---
Yeah the rewards are meh. So what. It’s the easiest thing to do in the game. Steel is literally the most common resource you can get. Not including weapons off of enemies, there’s over 100 junk items that gives steel. There’s also iron deposits and veins. There are 3 veins behind my camp that give 24-40 iron ore. When smelted that’s 60-100 steel. In about 2 minutes. 
---
I was hoping for some cool plans. I was disappointed too what the plans were. But I’m still having fun collecting and donating. 
---
For all the new players, it’s probably a better event.
---
Yo ho yo ho a raiders life for meee
---
Yea, loose that bag in flat water...  You will have a hard time
---
The brick and steel building sets are only purchasable from bot vendors. they dont drop anywhere in the wild
---
'Unavoidable consequence of human nature' is a cowardly way to justify preying on gambling addicts. 
---
Stay away from casinos.
---
I'm always short in adhesive and aluminum and sometimes with screws and springs too
---
Of course not. It's just the latest in a long line of idle nonsense.
---
Remember the classics...?...."I'm uninstalling'"...'I'm cancelling FO1st"...now its "I'm not donating". Rarely is there any follow through though. 
---
I bet many will silently do at least one run if only to cover the possibility of Bethesda tagging their accounts for the community award.
---
Solution: Play as a casual. I don't even know what S.C.O.R.E is really. It's some kind of alternate EXP bar that keeps filling randomly. Sometimes I get surprise rewards and advance on some old school game board. I just play the game like I would FO3, NW and FO4. There's so incredibly much to discover.
---
I'm having the time of my life and honestly playing this way there is just as much content as in FO4. Granted, there are these silly NPC:s that seem more self aware and just keep running back and forth through my game. Sometimes they shoot me for no reason, but luckily I take no damage. And sometimes they offer beautiful chance encounters where we get to take down something big together.
---
My advancement is probably not the fastest, but I'm also not in a hurry. I'm rising at approximately one level per session, sitting at lvl 15 now. I discovered early on that VATS works differently and doesn't really stop the world, so I mostly just aim down the sights of my revolver from afar and my 
---
accuracy is pretty close to 100% for the first, well-aimed shot. With a revolver I one-shot Scorched, so I can't complain. 
---
What I mean by all this is that I see your frustration, but if I just play the way I did in previous Fallout games, I haven't really encountered any issues so far. Everything's been working beautifully and I'm thinking maybe they are mainly developing the game for us casuals, if there are more of us?
---
Patch 21 is terrible. It's as if Bethesda have decided to say F.U to the players that have stuck with it and ensure that all future content will be directed towards attracting new players. The only good thing left in the game (C.A.M.P.) has now been ruined. B.O.S community event is a joke. The legendary run is just doing the same boring stuff as before but for less rewards. Thank God cyberpunk is coming.
---
Are YOU going to make a post at the end of this saying that you were wrong? I mean, if it's good enough for the goose...
---
Well at least you get the occasional restbite when it bugs out auto completes them all and doens't give you the score.
---
Sounds like it.  The story can be completed at your level technically......it's not very likely though unless you have already done a playthrough and know how to cheese the game mechanics.  Just have to stick to leveling for now.
---
That's why I liked the possible responses to the Free Radicals. If you had ridiculous strength you could threaten them with glorious violence and they'd heartily agree with your demands. 
---
That should've been an option for all dialogue with all NPCs except for Gail, who would obviously be both too strong and too dumb to be intimidated, or Rah Rah, who's a child.
---
They’re bullshitting.
---
The daily grind is definitely killing my love for the game. I have been playing it a lot less lately. Whatever they do next season, I hope its W.E.E.K.L.Y.
---
Do you get to keep the stuff you obtained while having Fallout 1st or is it removed?
---
You've even included the photoframe with updated musket.  Bravo.
---
I donate all my junk to a worthy cause: the Scorchbeast Queen's guts. In the form of bullets. Well, mostly lasers since I use a UGL, but you get what I mean.
---
&gt;	my build is so bad in that game I can barely kill creatures
---
&gt;	I’m level 30 + 
---
You don't have a build at lvl 30
---
U can kill things 9 times faster and rifleman is nearly useless against the main endgame fight unless you have a God roll rifleman weapon
---
Did not say the gauntlet is an angle grinder, but merely referred to an angle grinder because it is a more relatable example.
---
Dude I wish
---
Guys dont let the feeling of missing out of a dumb vidya take control of you. It is a dirty psychological trick that we need to be immunized in general not just in relations to vidya because there are legions of advertisers trying to play mindgames with us one way or another. 
---
It took me a while to gain this perspective but it is SO MUCH better now.
---
It's really not that big a deal. It's the easiest event to participate in, and considering we've already nearly hit the target for steel after 2 days tells me we should be good.
---
I took a break from FO76 6 months ago, sad to see the game is still in a bad spot. I've spent over 500 hours in this game and made some good ass memories that I'm sure to smile back on in the future. That being said, I paid full price for the tricentinial edition pre-order and I don't regret my purchase one bit. I feel like I got my moneys worth of fun and good times out of this game but I would love to see it recover so I could make even more memories. I held on for a long time brothers, I endured the crashes and the endless bugs from day one; but I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel like I used to. Does anyone think this will get better?
---
Wait until it gets to cork and then see if you feel the same about how easy it is.
---
i agree I used to do my foundation and raider reputation quests then my score challenges, now I only do my challenges as I want to spend as little time in the game as possible because of burn out.  I would prefer all the dailies for the week to drop on Tuesday with the weeklies then I have until the following week to complete them. that way I can do other things when I only have a couple of hours to log on.
---
We'll need it for phase 3 of atlas: 200 million corks. If we get em, we can have double score for a while
---
Holding B (for Xbox/PC) or circle (for PS4) doesn't do it? That's how I usually exit the Ammo Converter, even before this new downdate.
---
I heard change to 'Project76Custom.ini'
---
I remember Tomahawk being one.  Can't remember the other one because I think I already knew it.  
---
TOMAHAWK?  Really?  I'm now getting slightly annoyed thinking back on it, lol
---
After my little not so scientific testing, and some research into others' posts regarding data mining results, etc I was like "nope, not gonna chase this for shit".
---
Oh for sure duping has been an issue on both sides of the fence but I don't think it's much of an argument to say that PC version hasn't had it the worse of it when a player can much more easily break the TOS with PC hacks,3rd Party Tools, Trainers etc due to the open nature of the platform where's on Console the only thing that trickles down are the same game in game issues that people experience and in game exploits people use before they are patched out.
---
Yeah, I have too.
---
Steel at least makes sense (ammo armor housing) but it’s the lowest amount
---
Usually i know when and where I get hit with radiation, so I switch into the CSS (hotkeyed). Sometimes I do it too late and then I need Thirst Quencher 3 and some dirty water or toxic goo.
---
I feel the same way about it with cork. I'm already saving cork. DUH. 
---
Man, a lot of you must really really suck at video games if you think any of this is hard or work. Like really really suck.
---
Why don't YOU read the purchase agreement?  He can cancel at any time for a refund, yet won't for reasons.  Classic stockholm syndrome.
---
They stole parts of the tardis and made hundreds of knock-off versions, that's my head cannon, especially for FO1st scrapboxes
---
Couldn't do it. Got burned out from the score grind at 70. I don't even give a flying f*** about the latest update.
---
Eso is a "replicate"(replica?) of a mobile game? Have you actually played the game or just fanboi over some idiot streamer kid?
---
It's a decent game with a lot of potential but it kind of felt like a pilot to me. Like the other guys saying it is short but has the room to grow Into a really interesting universe in its own right
---
You mite want to look up how to make caps
---
🤔🤔🤔 
---
...
---
😁😁👍
---
Go drink from the pond you free loading hippy.
---
Not "everyone" boycotting, just the vocal minority. Same minority says that Bethesda would cheat the mater anyway...
---
Lol, quarantine has totally humanity.
---
Don’t want to play everyday, don’t play everyday, don’t think about S.C.O.R.E.
---
Yes it is, as well as both emote dances
---
Nice swap. I'll keep your secret.
---
Ran to west tek and had a glitches naked super mutant outside. Went inside and had 8 regular supers drop legendaries for me. Was super weird
---
Yeah, I'm afraid I've been shut down by the gates too many times.....  feels like it's added up to, "what's the point".
---
The pipe weapons give some cork
---
Yo what's your psn il join and use them for you
---
Because the 50 to 100 caps od close to what you get for bulking. Plus the extra goods you get like stmpacks
---
As someone who currently runs the perk loadout mod I agree. It was satisfying to work out my my specials configuration to accommodate swapping between rifleman and heavy gunner effectively.
---
I know, I made the update
---
Yeah, they may have been testing the waters i guess, would make sense why it was short. Then use the popularity to justify the investment into a fully fleshed out game/universe.
---
I find it surprising that this is how people feel about the daily challenges. I actually find the grind for bullion more tedious. For me the daily challenges are usually stuff that I'd be doing anyway (killing monsters, building up the camp) or something that takes about a negligible amount of time (chewing bubblegum, taking over a workshop). About the only "grindy" challenges are the level up ones and the XP repeatable (which admittedly will be very hard if you still use INT as a dump stat and don't use the new carnivore/herbivore buffs).
---
I get it if you don't have the time to log in every day because real life is more important, but the challenges themselves aren't really that much of a chore.
---
Plus, if u don't charge they just take it all and sell it to vendors
---
Blaketopia
---
Thank you :) what guns do you use? I’ve probably got a bit of spare ammo laying around I’ll share with you
---
I know, i made the post about emmet mountain
---
Very meta, i know
---
Would it kill to donate the minimum 250? A lot of people jump on the 'autocomplete' bandwagon because of one incident in the past and claim it as fact now, how I would laugh if it fell short and the very same people cried foul when it failed.
---
Holy crap, what's up
---
Make sure all your junk is scrapped
---
That was my thought too! I’m in every exploit discord and Facebook group. They are up to something 💰
---
Prime 50.cal,are you doing the silo with me? I can do it alot quicker on my own about 10 mins to launch
---
Wastelanders was really the only up.  It broke down to unplayable within a few weeks.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Everything is scrapped and turn into bulk items.
---
If Bethesda come forward and admit that it was not truly a community event and that it was just a fake way to attempt to bring the community together then yes of course.
---
My purifier is open for everyone, if its empty, ypu van drink from my well too, or you can cook a soup, my garden will provide you everything.
---
Define "quitting".   Somewhere between playing it 6-8 hrs/day and uninstalling the game, there's a grey area where you log in just long enough to cash in t-notes and get out.  Largely "quit" but not completely.
---
I dropped two fiddy.
---
You lose the tent, but keep the scrapbox(but can't add anymore to it) &amp; you keep any related fallout 1st costumes/items
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve gotten the brick set from claiming a workshop
---
Your greed is ruining the economy
---
You get junk rewords why bother !
---
Gunpowder
---
It's not in the world drops so If you want you will have to find a way to pay, really 1k caps isn't a massive amount. Either sell anything and everything or bide your time and level up as caps become far more abundant as you progress.
---
Fallout 1st members get unlimited scrap storage.
---
Right, Im happy to let you run it, I won’t slow you down*
---
You spelled out the reason why your protest is pointless though in your own post...
---
They aren't tracking this in any form, so protesting by not donating is pointless because it won't send a message since... they have no way of tracking our progress. ;p
---
Donate if you want the plans etc, it's not like it makes a difference either way. We aren't sending any messages here.
---
Why defend the game?  It is objectively below average.
---
&gt; that's my head cannon
---
Don't shoot with that cannon, or was it a Freudian slip?
---
I'm not quitting because of the camp thing I just donr play much anymore but to get the score
---
Joining now
---
Don't bother bulking stuff think there's only 3 things that it reduces the weight for.
---
Don't keep a lot of junk in genial. Keep maybe 50 of each, with a bit more screws and harder to find stuff
---
One trip through West Tec typically gets me around 300 steel.
---
Yeah, I really don't get the logic behind that. Wtf is ANYONE going to do with that much cork?!
---
It’s not the elite it’s just the ranger armor outfit, there’s been a few variants for fallout 1st subscribers
---
You're right about all of that. I'm so used to checking the reddit or the site at least once a week that it didn't occur to me that there's no notice about it.
---
Now that I'm thinking about it, they had the same issue with the killing scorched community event. They could had a better banner, maybe change the backdrop to the ATLAS observatory. Something, because I know I rarely even look at the pop-up screen when I start the game up.
---
I just want to se ATLAS get built up, I think if we meet the goals it gets reinforced
---
I actually just crafted 5mm instead of 50 :/ but I’m like 20 steel off making a set of the 50 cal so I’ll make you some ammo for this after I gather some mats
---
Happens to me a couple of times today as I exited power armor. I just dismissed it as it showing me score I earned moments before.
---
They're just gorillas
---
Theyre locked because free loading magpies like you come and steal them.
---
If you dont want pay water build your own purifiers
---
Why don’t you read it properly? The cool off period has *loooooong* expired bud.
---
Na man your good, don't make me any ammo il be fine, thanks anyways
---
You aren't being civil.  This whole post is essentially a kafkatrap.  If people who don't like the way Bethesda is running this game reply, then you have your silly point validated.
---
So idk how it works but two weeks ago I only could roll 3 times for the 100 scrip legendary ranged weapon. I had 260 scrip on me and could scrip one more weapon. So went and rolled, I rolled a bloodied lever action then rolled again, got my bloodied fixer so I went scrip the last gun I could walked back over and rolled a bloodied Tesla. Since then nothing but trash except bloodied light machine gun. Everything else is a pipe pistol. So who knows how it works
---
Yikes!  😿 Good luck!
---
Lol, I found half of the dupes way before they started cropping up in Discord servers and YouTube lmao
---
Ya I feel like I got about 10 repeatable xp score today and I don’t know how that happened lol. I noticed I also got it 2 or 3 times when I exited my power armor, thought it might have just been lagging from an earlier challenge
---
Yeah, I don't get that part, only 72.56 mil. I'm 2 days sounds reasonable
---
It may be, but there's things to enjoy, but the point was if you say enjoy aspects of the game or even make any comment that's not negative, people aduume that you're defending the game.
---
Well its well known that dupers are selfish pricks
---
WORKED FOE ME !!!!  U SIR ARE A LEGEND!!!!!
---
Broo your base isn't even fully yours. You had 1 floor cleared and the rest is full of ghouls.
---
I always leave mine open. But I have my vendors down and I only have two being I find so much around from events and stuff
---
 WORKED FOE ME !!!! U SIR ARE A LEGEND!!!!!
---
Mods
---
I've been taking a break so I'm a bit out of the loop. What's going on? Why are people wanting to quit?
---
Acid, lead, and steel.
---
This is why I often go between playing this (or similar games) watching Hulu and games like for honor and r6 siege. i can’t ever really get exhausted cause after a 30 minute break on Hulu it’s a good way to calm down from any bullshit Ubisoft had planned that day.
---
Gonna need it today especially cause Warmonger comes out on For honor and I just know ima have a “fun time”
---
I'm trying my best to focus on the main missions but I keep getting distracted with building, thank you :)
---
Assumptions are a problem with people in general.
---
Gunpowder, ammo and chems take up an insane amount of weight. Sell or offload what you wont use. Things like stims are rewarded frequently for events and quests so you really dont need to hoard a lot of them (says me who is probably carting around close to 300 again :/ )
---
Yeah you can't get bullion before raiding the vault
---
Bones are useless, drop all
---
Gunpowder weights a lot, and is in the Misc tab, use it all to craft ammo to use or sell. 5.56 and .45 sells well for 1 cap
---
Bulk and sell all common junk and keep at most 50 or 100 of each
---
Same thing as always. New update. You can’t replace walls to doors or windows anymore. You need to store and replace. So it’s the end of the world.
---
I got a 3 star bloodied assault rifle today and picked up a couple of 2 stars at least. No fixers or anything but i dont think ive ever pulled one off the purveyor either.
---
I remember that update.if you played fallout 3 there was a similar sidequest with  the antagonizer and some one else very similar story.not the greatest dlc for Fo4 but definitely memorable
---
Okay, thanks again :) you’re a champion
---
I’m not donating to anything but again, the BOS isn’t asking for anything, it’s just some guy.
---
Also, why exactly are there so many Enclave fanboys?
---
Also the crystal decanters give cork for some reason lol
---
I've just pulled a 1 star zealots fixer from a event glad to see at least one part of update is working thanks for the reply.
---
&gt; event that gives nothing to old players and appeals to the new players... Yet the amount of mats required are driven by old players..
---
Yep.   And this "old player" with FO1st contributed exactly 250 steel because of it.
---
The story wasn't the best, but the automatron customization and the ability to create infinite companions  was unique
---
Also sugar grove
---
Expecting a lot out of a community that often screams  shill or troll at people who have a different view then their own.
---
Yeah they do, although the subscription feels more like I'm paying them money to pay them even more money
---
Looks like you ran out of luck...lol its suppose to be completely random as far as what you get but a B fixer and a B lever back to back sounds good
---
Still better than the Institute, who in their opening appearance at the start of fo4 are committing mass murder.
---
Does it simply not let you? Or is the quest marker somewhere else?
---
I forgot about that part...That did introduce alot of options
---
I got a gse25 lmg earlier... pretty decent almost drop
---
The only thing that’s appealed to me really is the Captain Cosmos PA when you hit above rank 90... and I only started playing the game again last week so I’m rank 7, I didn’t even realise the game had seasons now and I only took a short break just before the season started xD side note: why the fuck does the “clean” sink give me FUCKING PARASITES and rads? Doesn’t seem very clean to me.
---
Ok thanks, I heard u get script for completing events, now I know y I wasn't
---
Oh you meant fixer specifically my bad I misread that xd
---
No, it was one of the monthly Fallout 1st special items. Hopefully it make a repeat appearance.
---
That great least we can hopefully get some good stuff now.
---
Yeah, I realized that. You can find a few in the Charleston Capital Building
---
I don't even get what you're after anymore. Your original comment was already a massive stretch, I tried to tell you how futile it is and you kept doubling down. This is clearly something personal, but you can't use that to blindly throw accusations at everything. The most "predatory" things here are limited time discounts and bundles. So does your local walmart. Even your school bake sales do it. I don't know if you're just lashing out at something specific or anything that even remotely meets your own criteria, but you really should take that somewhere else. At least go complain about a game that has actual mechanics like loot boxes that can be considered addictive
---
Yeah tell me about it. It’s not the 2525 like everyone wants but I love my bloodied fixer. But yeah I shit bricks when that happened. If there wasn’t a stupid daily limit I would’ve kept spending to get more. Being I got 3 bloodied weapons in a row. But yeah I know I took all luck I had and used it in one ten minute moment. Lol
---
Well you can get scrip for some events. Scrip and bullion are different things
---
Im up for contributing 125,000,000 to a community project to build up Sutton for the REAL OP faction (76ers) lol i mean the old raider stuff is still there so all we’d need to do is scrap all the gore then start decking out the buildings ....maybe in the market of this town, you could ‘buy’ a slot to build a vender for caps, or take one over where it shares the contents of your camps vendor meaning its almost like a communal market (it would incite more player traffic in the area making it busier too)
---
Best description I’ve seen of what is most likely the reality.
---
Think of it this way: most internet stories are lies, and reddit is near the bottom of the internet barrel.
---
You really don't have to play it every day. I haven't, and I'm farther along in ranks than a person needs to be to finish the run. And I haven't bought atoms, and I haven't grinded the repeatable xp bonus.
---
I have looked for ways to maximize things, like using lunch boxes and doing events, and going into areas that have a lot of creatures, so that in the time I am on playing, Im getting the most.
---
It does exist. Its kind of North from lake eloise.
---
Spawns when you drop a Nuke on the Camden Park Bathrooms. Need to have a buff from eating moldy hot dogs to deal damage to it.
---
No don't apologise I meant any drop other than 1 star. I was just saying you can get the fixer.
---
I scrap all heavy rounds...mini nukes 40mm and missiles you can rack up 100 extra lbs of this with just completing events
---
I mean I'm an American but I guess I was raised different lol I'm not sure how other countries are but yea here people don't seem to care much for one another. I mean hell we have issues wearing masks to try and keep each other safe lol
---
U got Bethesda'd bro!
---
But everyone said it was going to kill the Fallout Franchise once and for good! I was promised that Outer Worlds would be our savior? You mean game haters lied to me?!??!
---
They should care, because they sell wallpaper.
---
You had a complete impenetrable bunker with an army of robots protecting it and y'all couldn't last longer then 25 years
---
I totally disagree. Gold is much easier to get than reputation, you can get 500 gold in one day but the rep grind takes over a month
---
Yeah, that was bizarre.
---
Uhhh. In the Enclaves first appearance in the INTRO cut-scene, they are gunning down civilians. I win the 'my fascist organisation is worse than your fascist organisation' contest.
---
Yea u trade the script for bullion at the machines I know that, but is there a list on the events that award it?
---
I had some lucky streaks as well.i started to save up 1k and if I roll something good within 4 rolls I spend it all..usually works ok..some think there is some sequence to the purveyors madness.
---
Side note, I find it funny that people can go on and on about the BOS in fo4 when by the time they arrive,the Institute has already committed far greater crimes than all the other factions combined.
---
Do I actually need to start a quest for this? Or is everyone eligible for the rewards even if they don't contribute?
---
you can click ”back to main menu” and just exit. It’s not that hard
---
I might have been willing to help the BOS if they came in peace but when someone tells you I’m taking your land and you need to pay me for it or we will destroy you that just drives me into the arms of the enclave. Are the BOS forgetting we literally have a nuclear arsenal and are more than willing to use it to gather plants! What do they think we’ll do with it when faced with an invading hostile force?
---
You're a star Fallout Fandom had me looking over by Fissure Alpha
---
Nope. You trade treasury notes for bullion. Public events, the ones with the ! In the icon. Aware notes
---
Everyone getting downvoted in this post is right. Just because you mentioned it in your post, doesn't change the fact that buying a years worth of that shit from bethesda was just a flat out stupid idea. They have a track record of doing this and every day i see people acting surprised that they still do it. It's gonna keep happening because you people buy these subscriptions.
---
It was just the n feeling lonely as far as I can tell, I might also be an old school assaultron with a broadsider as a face instead of a laser but who knows.
---
I’ve had this happen also, there’s really nothing to be done except server hop
---
I only realized it when I asked my FO1st friend if he was going to venture out of his hidey hole for it and he was clueless even though he plays 16 hours a day. lol
---
I don't have an issue with people who don't like Bethesda. Everyone's allowed an opinion.
---
My only point was that people were taking this whole event the wrong way because all the complaints I kept seeing were about the individual rewards, when in my opinion those are just extra little thank yous.
---
If voicing my opinion and trying to steer clear of name calling like some of the others here is uncivil then apparently I don't know what civil is lol
---
Sorry, I meant bullion notes not legendary script
---
What gets me is sometimes non-legendary robots randomly explode. I had a level 1 eyebot explode and kill me during a workshop defense.
---
I still have my shielded brotherhood officer suit and my protective one? Is it just the fatigues that were effected?
---
You guys couldn’t even handle a scorchbeast queen without losing your entire force, how do you think they’ll last against the nuclear arsenal we use like it was jet?
---
&gt;What's even more baffling is that people keep giving them money despite all this.
---
Every game they have released has been a mess, every single one. Sure they iron out the kinks after a while but there are still lots of issues that the community needs to come in and fix. This is why every Bethesda game has an "unofficial patch" that fixes tons of issues with the game. Imagine this is one of those games but instead of focusing on the core game, you have to appease a growing (?) fan base in an online game that constantly needs some form of new content. You then try and make everything as grindy as possible in the hopes that it bides you times for newer content to be released only for that to blow up in your face and people stop playing and cancel their subscription to your game. 
---
Long story short, this isn't the first time they fucked up, not gonna be the last but they have a core of dedicated fans that will buy into it anyway.
---
Yea then that's a terrible wya they've gone about advertising it. You'd think they'd find a better way to inform us, but I've been so used to that pop up screen being adverts for the atom store that I instantly close it out lol
---
Yeah
---
Remember you could lose Legendarys to that thing, LOL some good bad times lol
---
Mate, you are a god. Thank you very much! That was the fastest silo run and queen kill I’ve ever seen
---
Think of something you've never heard of then google it. Okay. Sure.
---
Lmao was wasn't expecting it that quick at all for the queen kill. Got to wait 45 mins before I can launch the other Nuke
---
I got a 3 star bloodied railway rifle
---
That’s why I have both my camps close to Foundation and Crater. Maybe once I max out their rep in 10 years I’ll build my camp somewhere nice, but until then I’ll be making the best out of the cheap option
---
Why aren't you carrying your own water if its so very necessary for survival? Use your own camp budget to fill your needs. Do you also eat their crops, empty their Collectron and sleep in their bed. 
---
And try diunf some research - one of the first answers on how to make caps for noobs is to make and sell water. Ain't gonna happen if free loading idiots constantly thieve because they are lazy.
---
I had to Google it and page through a couple Microsoft pages to find a link to a list of both current and beta drivers.
---
Thanks for letting me know seem this part of the update actually works.
---
I got a instigating ffr forgot the 3rd star combat rifle..  no fixer yet though
---
That’s alright, I appreciate you launching one :) if you wanna bugger off and do your own thing don’t let me stop you!
---
People are free to sell whatever they want. Stop trying to control other players.
---
Getting a water purifier in this game is easy, and you should always have your own supply of purified water. 
---
I don't like mine. And I don't sell it. But seriously, for someone with the raider tag after their name, you sure are talking like a Settler.
---
Hey man that's chill. But you miss out on a few extra people buying your stuff is all. An if you don't sell stuff then no one needs to come in your camp anyway.
---
...Well, for first drop I've got plans for Plasma Grenade, so I wouldn't be this pessimistic xD
---
I kind of agree, I do sell a lot of my ammo for spare caps, back before this issue it seemed a lot more people bought and sold ammo of all types
---
I already left. I really feel like there isn't anything to do and to strive for in the game once you are finished with the main quest and you are finished with your build. I have one character at level 120, and I am satisfied with the amount of fun I had with levels 1-80. But since I finished my build and got some good weapons I can kill literally anything within 2 seconds, I cannot justify to myself playing anymore of this game because there simply isn't anything to do. 
---
The main problem I see, is that this game is just too easy and unbalanced in the non-existent "late game", that you really don't need any of the end game gear, which is locked behind the most boring grind I have every seen in an MMO. There just isn't any content or motivation to have T-65 PA and Gauss minigun. There is not raid-like feature in the late game, which requires you to have to best gear possible. 
---
If I had to put it simply to someone, then I'd say that there literally is not end game content, and you'd be a fool to waste your preacious time on trying to find one.
---
Yeah, I really felt misled about Fallout 1st. We were led to believe we were getting a lot more. Then after they got a wave of people paying $100 for a year, they just kind of abandoned it. Everything is about making goals for that quarter, future be damned.
---
Il stay in the server till I launch the other one you gave me 2 il launch 2 :D
---
I mean I may be wrong but technically the only faction we "join" is the responders. Raiders we just help Rose, Free states we just do their unfinished work, BoS I think we just fool the computer into thinking we're members, Enclave we also fool the computers by becoming a general and work for modus. People can roleplay all they want but it seems like lorewise were only dwellers, all the other factions were means to an end.
---
Same with Wastelanders, our max rep is "ally" implying that we aren't actually in the faction itself. They still call us vault dwellers.
---
I'm going to assume the BoS X-Pac is the same way, we just help them with whatever the heck they want.
---
Any power armor that’s not on a chassis can go
---
Mini nukes and missiles can go
---
I only use 50 cal 10mm and 45mm rounds. So my ammo count is 0 in the stash.
---
Lol, yeah, me too. If I acted as a kid the way some of these people (in and out of the game) act, I'd have got my ass beat with a wooden spoon!
---
Thanks again. Appreciate it
---
Not reddit. This sub is a flaming pile of turd at the moment.
---
I don't have power armour but I shall check thank you.
---
Personally I only keep less than 50 of all junk items except never get rid of acid,  aluminum, lead , plastic and screws (these you can sell to other players , but you'll want them for crafting at end game) 
---
Just what ever weapons you want to keep or sell.
---
Everything else is a waste and sell for caps to robots or just drop (if it has weight).  Just keep all food drink drugs on your character and only keep what you need
---
All good, I’m proud to say I swapped it just now lol, thanks for pointing it out, had the BoS flair since launch, but now they bug the crap out of me
---
I believe so
---
Woefully under utilised. It’s a great little camp I think!
---
I always try to exchange armor first, and do to it when I end up having it end on a 5 or 0 so when I do weapons, theres no odd number left.  Theres no real right or wrong way to turn it in. I do 1 piece at 6 am before work, so that's my daily reset time, and then do the rest of my 150 after work when I've had a chance to play.
---
You also get plastic from the golf balls for later
---
Really the only thing new atm is wasetlanders. Just follow that quest line, make sure you play both sides as far as possible
---
Uninstalled 3 months ago already lmao
---
Just a random idea, but maybe make INTERNALLY WIRED WALLS and WALLPAPER FOR BOTH SIDES OF A WALL, ya know like in REAL FUCKING LIFE. 
---
But I'm just spitballing here
---
It's a 2 in 1, but 1/250 of a single donation
---
Somebody else said this about how to cancel on xbox:  
---
"Go to Xbox Live and sign in, and then account setting under your game tag pic. Then go to services and subscriptions. Fallout 1st will be in there and click Manage. "
---
I also stopped playing several years ago and came back for Fallout
---
As of yesterday you could travel to a teammate free.
---
I love my plasma caster so I've been making an absolute TON of plasma carts, I keep running out of copper and plastic though
---
This gun will melt the queen if you prime it so you’ll never need to worry about lots of players being there if you launch. And it looks badass too.
---
I found the communist. Get him!
---
Just today I saw a suggestion of building city76 and being the dominant appalachian faction, I want that, maybe not right on the vault but in sutton, where the overseer wants to rebuild first, according to her dialogue.
---
A hub for all, a power in the wasteland, a diplomatic backing for the vault dwellers for them not to be treated as horse shit while literally making it possible for the other factions to exist.
---
You think you have it bad? Think of the people who have to do others or help them. My husband has barely any free time since the covid outbreak but wants everything. So i have to do mine then do his.
---
Yeah well would be nice to get good rolls more often. I use to just collect scrip to get up to a 1000 like you and just spend it all. Because I have my armor and don’t wanna go through the rolling process for that again to get better prefixes. But even when I spend all the scrip I don’t recall really getting anything worth while. So now I get about 300 and spend it. But I might have to save until that 50% off purveyor sale
---
It really depends on which build you prefer. But if you're just looking at the second stat ffr is the better choice
---
Magic wise yes first option looks better. If you are on console then it’s hard to trigger magic so maybe go for bloodied. Good thing is you have two same weapons and you can test them on hard foes and SBQ to see which one is better overall.
---
You had all this incredible infrastructure and technology yet you couldn't last longer then the ones without such commodities
---
At first I thought that was a bloody subreddit...
---
we'll see... remember this thread for after fractured steel. Im betting all my bottlecaps that they wont be 'exited'
---
You get caps when you donate, moreso than you would by selling to vendors FYI
---
cmon, its give a little get a little. If the devs and suits would give a little oversight and fix what the community wants, then they'll get a little more of our cash. Just because it's designed to make money, doesn't mean it should start to be deliberately malicious in obtaining it. There's a lot of psychology involved in business now, and frankly it's disgusting and has no right existing in the same space. All this FOMO and time gaiting shit especially in the electronic entertainment industry, is doing a huge disservice to great names and companies that used to stand for something. Now all we get in terms of customer protection from any one of these companies, is increased quarterly profits and fattened shareholder wallets. We're definitely on a collision course here and its far bigger than fallout 76.
---
Honestly, same, flux is difficult to grind for sometimes especially since the only way to get them is by nuking WS, General Steakhouse or where the Queen is but even then you're lucky to get a few and that's providing you have the resources necessary to craft them..
---
Pain in the ass
---
If you don't have FO1st, bulk whatever scrap you keep.   It takes less space in stash.  Watch the amount of bulk you actually keep.   Eventually, you'll need to watch the aid you keep.   Keep an eye on the weight of things in Miscellaneous.   It can add up.   Watch out for missiles and mininukes under ammo:   again, weight.    
---
I was so broke at level 20 that I was going around to stations gathered and selling extra bottles for cash.   Be prepared to pick up everything.   If you can't scrap it, sell it.
---
Server hop, or find some Gatling guns and scrap them
---
I didn't mind them in 3 but like the actual BoS in nv and 4 just came off as dicks. So I blew up their zeppelin.
---
Pretty sure you can only Learn them threw scrapping
---
Yep, when I do quit the game it will be because of this. I like the game, but I like playing it when I feel like it. Having to play it every single day so I don’t miss out on any cool items sucks.
---
Ah yes, indulgences. The first pay to win scheme schemed
---
You can get from events I’m pretty sure
---
I've received plenty of legendaries from 1-3*.
---
The highlight was a 1* Rolling Pin followed immediately by a 3* Rolling Pin...GOD ROLLS! The rng really sucks (not even the first matched pair this week)
---
That's not a bad idea. Seems latley the way to get good gear is to trade or buy with real money wich seems insane
---
Right? Kids these days need beat. Or am I missing the point lol
---
Yup. Blank spot on my wheel..
---
I've got nearly a full set of rolling pins lol good times.
---
These systems seem to be specifically designed to take advantage of 'FOMO'. I will probably never use 90% of the skins and unique items from the Legendary Run... But I still feel like I need to get it done, or at least get as far as I can. And being able to buy the ranks with the currency these dailies and weeklies have restricted but is still available for real money shows what it's really all about.
---
I'm also playing FIFA and Fortnite on the side with my friends, and those games are running the same racket. It gets its hooks in people with meaningless tat, but meaningless tat that is unlikely to be available again.
---
Also pay attention to plans. They weigh a quarter pound and it’s kind of easy to backlog a lot of them.
---
I've bought mods from watoga vendor bot
---
Then don't.
---
I'm a little torn on this. On the one hand I'd love the chance to get some of these rare plans and it would definitely make me donate much more than the 250 steel I did.
---
On the other hand it would heavily advantage the FO1st members as they might already sit on 10k steel to grind for these plans, where the normal players don't have stash capacity for more than about 500 steel.
---
I feel like this would make people even more pissed off than they are now, and with all the score stuff, dailies, grinds etc. I'm actually reliefed that my inner demons don't make me grind for steel now on top of everything else.
---
Amen
---
Ah I learn all of them on the spot and just drop any I know already
---
Hello my name is Mattie, im a fallout 76 addict, can't stop playing till I get all the rare outfits and plans then I can rest.
---
From start to finish, a childish rant.
---
I honestly wish it had, I'd much rather give my money to Obsidian than Bethesda at this point
---
Cool, I'll try that. Thanks!
---
For me it was worth getting a month of it to unlock the emotes and the craftable clothes since you get to keep them all after your subscription ends. I'm not getting a second month though.
---
What I don't get it why don't they just hire the modders and have them fix the game as official developers? Honestly mods are the reason people still play Skyrim (not the only reason but still)
---
On pc too. This needs upcoming. Radiation Rumble is almost unplayable.
---
It was acctually 72.56 mil after 24 hours. They are releasing for the past 48 hours later today.  And yes can you actually see that Bethesda would allow this to fail?
---
Legit glad I saw this before I had applied it (someone mentioned it some time ago)
---
It’s Just Work!
---
But despite that im happy to play along and do something that brings the community together.
---
To be fair it is an exploit, just not as serious of one. An exploit is some unintentional feature/bug a player can take advantage for their own gain, which sounds like exactly what this was
---
Do you literally just count the levels? I am one space away from the final color change, but I have no idea what number that is.
---
Neh, if i know players in the event on that particular servers are not gonna share. I will just one shot. why bother to b nice n get nothing.
---
Go to Lucky Hole mine, around the end there's an enemy who always carry a gatling gun. Kill him, grab the gun, scrap it on the near chemistry station, server hop and repeat.
---
That's how I unlocket all the mods for gatling gun, that place is also good for handmade mods farming.
---
Thanks for your advice!! But I’m not sure if my junkies ffr gauss mini is magic or not
---
Welcome to the wastelands!
---
😁👍
---
How do you do that?
---
Thanks man I’ll try this out
---
Bug, I think they know and it’s on the list to be fixed.
---
And you think that Bethesda won't do it if it doesn't meet the goal? The need to do it for the new quest line
---
I switch between two of them very often, I’m just wondering whether my junkies one is magic or not
---
Tbh the hold (B) or (Circle) worked before too 
---
The x10 , x100 , x1000 additions are nice but a slider or even a "Deposit All Ammo" would have been better or maybe even a "favourite" ammo  where all None favourited ammo types would be added and the rest could be done with 1x press
---
Yeah the bows have really bugged out on me
---
This is a little off-topic as well, but, nice name.
---
Oh, that is a really good one.
---
I shot at a punji board and didn't do any damage. Don't know how that's a dick move, but whatever.
---
That's a childish statement. Both games can exist. You've always had the ability to NOT give your money to Bethesda.
---
If you equip Bear Arms, you can play around with both until you decide which one you like best.   It's like 1.8 lbs or something.   For that matter, you could keep them both.
---
The "Fake" reason was after 25 years after the bombs fell go out and rebuild America, but the actual reason was to go out and secure all the nuke silos in Appalachia
---
To be honest and try to explain it, I’ll say this for myself. The game has become so boring due to the lack of free, ingame earned customizability that I sometimes buy atomic shop items just to breathe in another 2-3 hours of life into my experience. I put in a new fridge or some wallpaper and it keeps my withering attention span for this game for another session or two.
---
It would feel like I had a part in it
---
I will not renew for sure. The game stability is getting bad with more bugs. Getting sick n tired
---
I get what your saying but theres a few problems I see:  
---
1. I dont think the BoS have asked us for anything, just the Russel guy wants to set up for when they arrive  
---
2. They dont know we have nukes, they havent heard from Appalachia since long before the last BoS died here, and they died long before we came out of that vault
---
I’ve got skins on all my other guns, I’m VERY careful with that, and I only tend to sell grenades to vendors so it doesn’t even pop up on that list, I have the nukashine power armour paint which is black and gold, and have all gold skins on my guns because I want it to match! Ocd 🤣
---
I know that, but why did we leave the vault. Surely we could have used it as a base of operations.
---
I get what you mean, but I think It tore us apart more than brought us together
---
Yep that's why crater doesn't attack us if we meet them and then backstab them by doing foundations heist they at that point know what we can do and what would happen if they would attack us
---
I like the idea of all vaults and/or stations being free fast travel locations ONCE you've discovered and been there
---
Maybe you know this already but workshops come with their own resource pools.  If you are in the build menu and the crafting requirements are shown in green, the materials are coming from the workshop and not your material reserves. 
---
You can build several extractors without using any of your own stuff.
---
I’m gonna test it on SBQ solo to see which one is better, my ammo cry though
---
I remember when Walmart introduced the season pass, where I had to visit the store every day just to browse around the isles. Good stuff.
---
As far as I read it the rewards will be available for all, though if you want to be sure just donate 250 steel once at the ATLAS observatory
---
Once I got 3  3☆ bows in a row, all either mutant/ghoul/scorched slayer with VATS bonuses as the other abilities. All 3 of them.
---
I'm pretty sure all the power was shut off, so bo purified water, no oxygen, no nothing.
---
Of course, my GT is YouSankMe. I'll be on in a few hours or so
---
Because if that’s the mentality we all have it’s just going to get worse and worse.
---
I put in 26k steel, got 2 new plans I hadnt got before, about 6k caps, loads of boose, radaway, stims, 45 plasma grenades
---
I actually made a low level toon just for leveling, just to make sure I can get that achievement, but even that one is starting to get up in level by now.
---
Yeah, I was on a private server.  I suppose that's the culprit then?
---
the regular ranger armor is the standard reward for getting 1st even juat once. the elite/advanced/desert/etc. variants are all limited time rewards only available for a month or so. if you didnt have 1st when they were available and redeemed them from the atom store, you cant get them. no idea if they'll ever come back.
---
This bag is as good as the preorder bag.
---
I dont wanna be part of this faction, too selfish
---
if i take a workshop and scrap all those things, do I get the mats or do they just go back to the workshop pool?
---
Yeah. My salute emote is gone too...
---
Oh yeah you mean how now every sever on Xbox everyone but mean even tho I played since beta has legacies and they won’t trade they won’t trade any of their weapons. Because they want real money. And nope I’m good.
---
Someone found him sleeping on a shelf, thats probably the best one Ive seen
---
It's Reality, checking in. People are happy/angry and have something to say. 
---
Don't worry, it will be gone in a few days. Then it's back to being a 1:1 copy of the official Bethesda forums.
---
Let alone that, gain one level a day thing. Sure, a few times lines in the sand or help the excavotors events in a building group does the trick, but jesus it's annoying.
---
it seems like you're confusing private worlds, a feature of fallout 1st, with fallout 1st as a whole. people who have 1st bring their characters and everything they have between private and public (adventure) worlds, including the tents.
---
I only update my C.A.M.P once every 6 months but never have I seen any issues with it, don’t see why people are complaining about this though. Yes round camps and double walled camps can’t be a thing anymore but I’ve been able to work around these things easily, this is definitely not an event to quit the game over
---
There are workarounds, since they never fix the problems they just block the current method lol
---
I'd be interested in hearing your final decision.
---
500? the limit is 200 i thought.
---
Wife and I both already quit months ago
---
That’s crazy. I can’t believe people are giving Bethesda 100$ a year for this.
---
Yeah I know of the other method, but it's much more jury rigged and has an uglier result.
---
From what I read earlier, (see their official post) they had an exploit that a player could use it to create unlimited walls and lag out the server to do other glitches /exploits such as duping
---
What?? They forget they charged full price for the game or some shit???👀👀👀👀👀 have me fucked up 🤢
---
Yes and that's the point, i´still donated, even though i don't think it matters. Also been fun planning out routes and finding new ways to scavenge for each resource.
---
Nice idea, yet fucks that build underground are the glitcher that Beth keeps talking about, besides the duper.
---
Why did autocorrect change it to that? My spelling is bad but geez
---
Thank you so much it worked and I got a legendary cry player at the same time
---
Absolutely what im doing.
---
I work, so have limited time for gaming most days. It will be nice to play others once the grind is over.
---
I will be taking another extended break from the game once I hit 100
---
Nope they still didn't make changes the dialog changes slightly when your faction rep increases.
---
I fully expect that when they roll in, he gets “removed” as they clear out the area. Wasters have no place in the Codex, least of all in their very own base of operations.
---
I got 5-6 100 score levels ups for no reason yesterday, got out of my PA to do some cooking and all of a sudden I'm getting score spam? None of my challenges had completed all were fine so not sure what triggered it but defo not gunna complain about this one ;p
---
Playing radiation rumble now gives you the actual player shell shock / crippled head!
---
Thank you so much it worked and I got a legendary cryolater as well
---
True, But the reddit community, at least the active members are not the majority of players. So take everything with a grain of salt.
---
I know I am part of the problem but I just bought the last ten(ish) levels so I could play how I wanted again.
---
Do you have skins on them?
---
I have a hard time with the controls in Outer worlds (on xbox) aiming feels waaaaay to fast, and the movement in general doesnt feel right to me. Thats why I never completed the game.
---
There is some DLC coming soon (not sure if more is planned) but it's a sub-20 hour game based on how you play.  The one thing to consider though is that you can play the game in significantly different ways that changes the story and the ending so there's some replay value if you really enjoy the game.
---
It look cool thanks bethesda
---
*cries in shotgun*
---
For my shotgun user, West-Tek is a zero sum game. I get enough plastic to make shotgun shells, but I use almost as many shells as I make. I typically lose shells and the lasers only partially make up for it. I have that I have to make time for "plastic runs".
---
How can you not one shot mobs? You have to go out of your way not to one shot or melt a mob in 0.5 seconds. I'm running around with close to 3k dmg per hit with my unarmed build. I have to change to my mini gun if i want to tag enemies. But i can't shoot them with my mini gun because i might accidentally melt them. So i have to bash them. 
---
 I get what you're saying but the whole system is just a shit show. I personally don't blame the players.
---
Even if not intentional its very helpful when you are low health and can't find a box that isn't opened already
---
WS pool.
---
I have some of my own: locations with armed enemies are, equip scrapper perk. The cork however, neither same story, but go to locations with enemies that have Pipe weapons, they drop cork
---
I can't let you guys do this, DinoGus they are messing with you!
---
Good point
---
Hopefully this is just another nail in the coffin.
---
Still got mine......
---
Go to a trading site. You can pick one up for 5-10k
---
That's another unfulfilled marketing promise from Beth. With the introduction of f1st this "feature" was touted as "coming soon", together with an increase in camp budget.
---
Jokes on them, dupers already carried us.
---
Nuke op first rifle gaming is 100% launching the first nuke on atlas
---
Honestly I wouldn't buy them, just rely on scrapping random drops. It's one of my favourite weapons but I don't believe spending caps on the upgrades are particularly cost effective. Even in base form its very effective for a low/medium level character.
---
Funny thing is they will swear up and down saying "these aren't duped!"
---
Indeed.
---
I stopped a couple days ago mainly because of the many, many currencies to buy or unlock everything. When the game introduced to me the gold on top of the caps, scrips, score, XP, atom, that was the final straw.  I also blew a few hundred scrip for crappier weapons than I cashed in. What a waste of time.  
---
I’ll also add that I absolutely love camp building.  It was one of my favorite parts of FO4. The limits on everything including that also wore me down. Cannot stand that I can’t display but just a few weapons, for example.  It’s ridiculous.  And then everything in my vending machines or on my walls count towards my weight limitS. I’ve had to dump so much stuff that I’d rather keep just because of the stupid limits. It’s like they are forcing me to pay $99 for Fallout 1st to enjoy the game. Never going to happen, Bethesda.
---
Unless they are SS they should be tradeable. Just remove any skins.
---
Agreed, the calendar has another double value daily weekend coming up at the end of the month.  I'm a bit behind as I'm right around level 70 on the board.  I've already relegated myself to getting on to power through the SCORE and gold dailies and wandering back off as I'm down to the last 3,000 gold that I care about before the rest is just nice to haves that won't push me to play.
---
I hope they take some lessons learned and make it a bit easier next go round.  I'm sure they'll see the stats of average board completion, atoms spent, etc.  Adding this Brotherhood mini-event is a tease too since it's just a resource burn.  It's like they have the right ideas for end game content but not a great execution plan on how to achieve that while engaging the player base.
---
‘Thanks for being so grownup, Dad.’
---
I think, as a past Wow player, your statement of I will never be mad at Blizzard again...sums up everything. In fact because of World of Warcraft I promised I would NEVER play an mmo game again and found the amazing website of CHEAPSHARK. That allowed me to get email notifications when the games I wanted hit a certain price point. After quitting Wow I found myself thrilled with open world game after open world game. My friend suggested Fallout(I think mostly because FO4 was coming out and he was excited) and I added FO4, new Vegas and 3 into cheapshark for 5 bucks each, yeah I'm cheap. 3 days later FO3 popped an alert they always seem to rock bottom prices as new installments come out. After 3 days of playing I was hooked. 
---
Now I KNOW I can quit a game very easily. For one thanks to cheapshark and epic free games I have enough AAA titles to keep me entertained into the next decade and I have Watch Dogs legion and Valhalla right around the corner losing 76 would barely phase me at this point. In fact, I think, it might be time to let go. I have Batman Arkham Asylum taunting me in my steam library.
---
the season ends when the green ship reaches the end, yes. if your ship is past it, you're on track to finish. if not... well, 150 atoms ranks you up one. better start giving bethesda some cash if you want that planetarium.
---
I resigned myself to not hitting 100.  Luckily there isn't many rewards I'm interested in - there was a lot of padding in this implementation.
---
Been playing Far Cry 5 since it went on sale.  Been a lot of fun!  Just wish the dialogue for the allies had better volume.
---
What I mean is SS armor generally can’t be traded. It can be scripped. Other armor you should be able to do what you please.
---
Im wondering too if you obly can get it once or what
---
i´ll give this a try, thank you =)
---
I don’t care either way. I don’t want the “rewards.”
---
Will the real Todd Howard please stand up?
---
If it is .1 wt keep 50 or less, .05 wt keep 100, like said already screws, aluminum keep as much as possible.  Ballistic fiber is needed to repair gear 100 also, unless you use repair kits.  I think aluminum is the only one that is lighter when bulked.  If you need more steal just collect weapons and scrap them with the scraper perk and if you don’t have that one, it still works good enough.
---
It was good last night as well.  I do that database rebuild and sometimes that cache delete and both have seriously helped and avoided the full reload.  I do find over time the issues build up and the rebuild and cache helps knock it back down for 3-6 months.
---
Dam that just sucks so fucking bad. I have a few questions: Did you equip it from the pipboy or the weapons wheel? And did you have any skin on it? And last but not least, what was it exactly? Im more than ready to check if i have anything like it to give to you for free.
---
I did not know.. did they completely remove the plan from the roadmap or is it still coming at some point?
---
to me it’s rlly good but there’s not many weapons and it’s pretty short
---
Seen many a vendor selling them for around 9k , not to rub salt in the would but I got the plan on my third go , it's just luck of the draw unfortunately
---
They had no reason to do this yet it seems that is there only game plan.  I loved my shot gun build.  That perk alone made it an amazing build. Not anymore I guess.  Also, in what reality does a fucking explosion NOT cripple something?? Taking away the ability for explosions on my shotty to cripple is ridiculous
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you the plan for free
---
Bloodied all the way. Junkie builds are cool and only do slightly less damage but it is more expensive to maintain due to constantly checking if your suffering from withdrawal and have to buy a steady supply of chems. Where as bloodied keep your health low is about it.
---
Completely levelling (Maybe donate shit-tonne of gunpowder?) Sutton. Then having people vote on a new aesthetic would be great. Having player engage in the decision making would be great. Gets us invested, and also would be nice to have a 'fan-built' faction in Fallout lore.
---
They don’t leave when you leave, but they do leave when the server cycles down. My guess is it was someone else’s handiwork. Servers don’t stay up for months.
---
Yeah tell me about it. But it’s whatever let them think their guns are worth the 80 dollars they spent on it
---
i might just do that, should of done that from the start, would've saved me alot of caps.
---
I mean yeah, we havnt had an awful lot of exciting content recently. But I'm still gonna play the game because I enjoy messing around with friends and running events.
---
They didn’t say “coming soon” so quoted are a bit misleading, no?
---
I've tried to test it out. It doesn't work. I think it's from earlier challenges. Just doesn't do the animation until you're out PA
---
How do u do that? Arnt the stats for heavy gunner counter productive to a rifle build?
---
I'm pretty annoyed.  Literally just started this game a month ago and they've already basically lost me
---
For me personally I subscribe to FO1st for the private world. I am a mainly solo player I rarely team up with other players I solo most events and while I seldom get the top awards I’ve gotten pretty good at most of the ones I’ve done regularly. The only events I go on public servers for are big events that are next to impossible to complete solo (encrypted and scorched earth specifically) believe me I’ve tried lol.
---
nah im on pc. maybe you can make someone else happy with it. but i appreciate the offer
---
No one is forcing you to play
---
These should be simple fixes for a AAA company that has been actively working on the game for two years after launch. At a certain point this is just bullshit, especially when they're taking in $12/month from a large portion of their player base. You're defending shitty practices for no reason, I think boot licker is pretty appropriate.
---
The only mentioned exploit fixes relate to trap stacking and Assaultron helmet scrapping. And the only stated "fixes" to the walls were snapping issues and the foundationless build glitch.
---
No problem! But yeah if you try the market reddit it should be pretty easy to come by.
---
I wonder what Maxson (Or whoever he sends as his figurehead) will say about all those nukes. Well, I have an idea from the holotapes, but I am looking forward to that one.
---
How? When I try to use the terminal I can't do anything, he just show what setting he already have but cannot make me choose anything
---
So you have lockpick and expert lockpick both equipped and cannot unlock a level 2 lock?
---
Yeah i´ve been trying to max my steel production with a route i take.
---
Much like the game... 🤣
---
Sorry, I couldn't resist. I love the game and play daily.
---
Daily content isn't Bethesda's fault. Someone else, a long long time ago, came up with that hellish idea. I myself first started suffering from the daily grind in World of Warcraft, but I'm sure not even Bethesda developers are to actually blame for this curse.
---
Having said that, what *is* Bethesda's fault, is falling into the trap of even thinking that daily content is a *good* idea. It isn't. It absolutely is not. It's awful. Nothing should *ever* be available on a daily basis.
---
Time-gating in and of itself is an easy way of restricting content, but not the only way. It's just that coming up with those harder ways of restricting content can require some ability to innovate, and I'll be the first one to admit that I personally couldn't necessarily, off the top of my head, give those kinds of innovative alternatives.
---
Could I give a *better* alternative to daily content though? Yes. Easy. Just as a simple example, weekly content. Or, monthly content. If you *need* to restrict something by day, then give us 7 times the content in one week. Or, 30 times the content in one month. Or hell, even put the content reset at 14 days. Any one of those options is several times better than daily content.
---
There's a couple things daily content is good at; first of all, it's a good way to half-force people to play. No, nobody is holding a 10mm pistol to your head, literally forcing you to make a life and death choice over whether you play or not, but it's still a question of losing out on things if you do not play, and when those things are the actual content, then it can seem like a necessity.
---
And, secondly, it is a really great way of causing people to burn out.
---
I haven't had any issues with Fallout 76 thus far myself. None of the things that people have been raging about have affected me in any way. I've had no bugs, or crashes, beyond what I've had in any other game. I've enjoyed the game since the B.E.T.A. I've been fine with the MTX prices, or the subscription - there are way, way worse companies when it comes to that out there, such as GGG and Path of Exile, or hell, Scam Citizen, with its $27000 DLC. I've wished for better things, of course, but nothing has made me really sour on this game.
---
Daily content will probably do that. If the next season continues with this daily crap, I'll absolutely skip doing it, and if I start skipping content, I'll lose interest in the game. But, meh, that's just me.
---
We already funded the game by purchasing it (some of us at full retail price only for it to drop a year) which should support online for a couple years.
---
People already fund the game through atom purchases.
---
People already fund the game through settler and raider packs paid only by money (atoms not good enough)
---
We have paid plenty. Time for them to give something back to the players. Double for longtime fallout 1st members
---
Also telling people they should keep paying their subscription otherwise bethesda stop the game is crap. Stop being scammed for a tent and a box
---
DPS is higher on high health mobs. For me though, the ammo is a non issue as regular mobs still die in 1 hit.
---
Ahm... would you mind to give a short how to at how to start/proceed after importing the strings!? atm i just dont get a clue how to proceed, or which FAQ/Tutorial to read... :-/ \*sniff\*
---
If weapon displays allowed visitors to check out the stats I would make a collection.
---
I've been doing Encryptid since it started and never got the plan from that event.
---
 I do see 'em in vendors for about 10k.
---
Wish I had the money for a scrap box, this would be way more efficient if I did
---
God I hate Meg. Every time Bethesda tries to make Raiders sympathetic, all I gotta think is, "They be murdering moronic sociopaths."
---
This is probably a dumb question, but we get legendaries from completing events or dailies? Similar to how fasnacht was?
---
It’s actually amazingly easy. I’m surprised you can’t do it.
---
Wise man say, opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.  I like my scrap box, tent and extra atoms every month.  The discounts and other shit it just that, I don't care about it.   I paid for the full year and will renew when that comes up because I like it and I can afford to throw away $100. Stop whining and play the game.
---
Tbf Obsidian didn't really have the resources to build a Triple-A game when they worked on Outer Worlds. They didn't get bought by Microsoft until right before the release. 
---
They are starting to make dlcs for the game, though.
---
Live and learn mate. Always ask questions, makes life easier
---
Was with a duper last night and he shoved 100k steel in, checking this morning steel is 3/4 done so it seems to me the target is so high *because* of dupers. He did it because he wants to dupe the rewards for people who for whatever reason don’t get them (new players when BoS launches of whatever). Might not like his actions, but it’s a stretch to call them selfish.... he’s filling a gap and making it convenient where Bethesda doesn’t.
---
It’s the same characters in private servers and adventure mode. All features are available in both.
---
My stash is about 80% full of bobble heads, magazines and recipes. 
---
Individualy they dont weight much but they do add up over time.
---
Congrats?
---
Kill 75 wanted players is a challenge, so yeah high levels will come and kill them, I usually gesture that I,m gunna kill them , then stop some gear/junk for them and look after their junk until they return.
---
There is no 'community' it is just a player base of people playing on their own, sometimes in teams but always alone, even teams are transient but never what one would call a community.
---
Oh, there's your problem. You feel like you need these items and that they're not just random rewards thrown in to keep people playing. Unfortunately, that's a self-inflicted problem, not something the devs are doing to you
---
Community 🤣
---
Will the real Todd Howard please stand up? Will the real Todd Howard please stand up? I repeat, will the real Todd Howard please stand up? We’re gonna have a problem here...
---
They said something about performance issues

and read the 1st comment by magosnow
---
I can't think about playing this game without it. My stash inventory management  is difficult enoug with it.
---
We don't need either one, friend.
---
Because some people cant cancel it. I get a error everytime i try😂 ive been trying for like 4 months now. But its a playstation issue and i can never get a hold of them. 😑
---
Its been doing this for months on my game. It magically fixes itself within half an hour. Its similar to the tracked quests bug, where none of your quests show on the map until a while after you load in. Even the description is often blank on the quest objective. Seems like some things load in from the server after you are already in game.
---
With the class freak (and Stranger in Numbers) bug, you can actually leave the effects window open and gradually see the description update one at a time for your mutations
---
Hopefully they do have something to say, like the army guys in wastelanders, maybe thats what makes them "factured"
---
I need my junk for crafting, not interested in the 'rewards'.
---
If you're on ps4 I can over you a plan for 6.9k.
---
 I have 4 in total
---
There is a x/100 indicator right bottom from the blue line of current level progress.
---
I swear they changed the floaters recently so they don't need to rest. It used to be that you would get hit by their gust for a few seconds and then there would be a break. Now it's just nonstop gusts of fire, freeze, or whatever the green one spits out.
---
Precisely, imagine to manage your stash with 3000 steel in it
---
Anyone know how to switch to another drop bag on PS4?
---
Yep I am totally bored of grinding for SCORE, Scrip, scrap for BoS, bullion, and rep. Game has become a real grind-fest designed to get you playing every day so they can upsell crap from the Atom Store and hide the lack of substantial new story/lore. Seasons and the reduction of free atoms by over 70% pretty much did it for me, I play occassionally but mostly camp building, which they also just broke.
---
They should but they won't. It's the whole selling point of FO1st.
---
I agree to a point, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting the actual “product” you paid for.
---
you can press and hold the back button and it will exit
---
They want it to be a grind so you will be more likely to use atoms to speed it up.
---
Agreed!
---
You need to realize that this is just a game. Don’t worried about getting rank 100 just play the game however you like 
---
Those reward will be released at a later time in the atom shop or at the end of the season pay for rank up
---
I've got the opposite problem. I'm a newer player and I've just got freeloaders trying to reap the rewards but not help defend. Numerous times I've had high levels join only to sit idle and let me do the legwork...
---
The thing about this is that once you stop playing for like a day or so it's so easy to just not return because you realize just how slow progress is
---
Not true. You do not need chems, and the addictions only goes away, if you want to (like taking addictol, or radscorpiom omlette), they are persistent.
---
You just need 5 addiction and you do not have to take anymore chems if you do not want to.
---
Live service, changes mean player frustration ensues = working as intended.
---
I am under the impression there was an active exploit with them, this existed 3 patches ago and the underlying mechanic that was exploited was removed. The cause of the exploit was the ability to multi stack walls endlessly to cause server lag, which could be used to crash the server.. The patch fixed the crash dupe, but the multi stack walls stayed and could still be used to create server lag. 
---
NOW, if this is the case, and they needed to remove them, this shows their entire disconnect from a huge chunk of the player base, shows they don't care, or see what we do with their game. This mechanic existed forever and was utilized by the entire building community. Even their camp showcase featured this mechanic prominently.
---
But is it at least made out of the right kind of fabric? I hear that it's really important that a duffle bag is made out of the right kind of fabric.
---
I've currently used all my steel making ammo, no donation from me.
---
Ha interesting. Small chance it may have been me if PC as I often give out fixers to lower level players and I did so a few times to some level 20's about that time frame all on the same night. 
---
But as to the rest, it's just luck. It's supposedly 10 percent chance to drop, but that just means you have a 90 percent chance not to get it every time.
---
First time I got the plan it took me about 20 attempts. Then I got it instantly again the very next time. After that it took me about 45 goes to ever see it again. I just sold the plan two days ago for about 8500.
---
They're not as common in vendors as they used to be, I've only seen one recently and he wanted 16k for it. Just keep luggng I guess or server/vendor hop like a madman.
---
Emotes go away.
---
I miss mine but if anything the tent was clutch because I do not want to move my camp. So I just deal with and hope someone tent is nearby
---
Yes steal lol. I like to think I’m being a degenerate asshole making life harder for you other vault dwellers. Nothing more satisfying than knowing someone is thirsty running to get some purified water only to see that the purifier is empty. 😂
---
The battle pass system needs to be more like Fortnite, where you can play catchup and complete the pass by playing a good session once a week.
---
The price dropped like a week after lol
---
Can't imagine what would happen if they didn't make it out of canvas. At least they aren't nylon
---
You are right, it was just my assumption and no I didn't do very well in school when it came to math. Or grammar.
---
Cool :)
---
No joke there.  After a year of never getting it but doing the event every time I saw it, I had it drop twice in 2 days suddenly.  The first time I didn't even do anything, the event completed right as I fast traveled in.
---
Private worlds are fantastic for farming Whitespring. Nuke it, kill the glowers, travel away, log off, log back on, and kill again. You can easily get 6+ runs in without any effort.
---
No shit, I must have missed that. Thanks, i'll take a look next time I log on.
---
There is no maintenance to junkies at all. Once you're addicted that's it, you don't have to constantly check anything.
---
Private servers. They're positively delightful and it's REALLY hard to go back to laggy public servers.
---
100% agree. I love the game but sue to adulting I can't play more than once or twice a week but even if I could, playing every day would turn it into a chore.
---
I didn’t even get that. Just alcohol and trash I can find on every corner.
---
Most people don’t realize how much exp Radiation rumble(fail runs) and line in the sand (glitch) give when done currently. I’m rank 76 right now but I got most of my rank during the double exp weekend 
---
Each time those event pop up I was getting 50-70k exp
---
Caps are generated out of thin air constantly, there needs to be a mechanism to get rid of them to control inflation.
---
What are the 3 things that bulking helps reduce weight with?
---
Check your Misc tab and sort by weight. Most things in there weigh zero, but some missions and various things you pick up around the wasteland end up in this tab and do have weight to them. If you're not on top of it, it will stack quick.   
---
Ultracite and Flux that you get from nuke zones weigh a lot. If you're not running power armor and not using the flux to craft things, it's going to eat up your stash space quick. Flux sells well on player venders btw.  
---
There are junk items in there that don't show up in the bulk menu that will stack really quick if you're not keeping a watchful eye on it. Circuits come to mind as being one of those things but I know there's a few others.   
---
Try and keep the mats in your stash only for the active things you're crafting. For example If you're done with building your base, ditch all your concret and most of your wood.   Need to craft a bunch of lever actions to learn mods? Keep only the matts you need for the lever actions. That said, there is an exception of a few things like screws, springs, ballistic fiber and other things that are hard to source and having a lot of them isn't a bad thing to a point.
---
Build your camp under it and some stairs?
---
Didn't play much Tuesday
---
Didn't play at all last night
---
No plans to play tonight.
---
That's the longest I've not logged in since I started playing again in December.  I.. just don't even want to anymore.  Don't wanna see what else is broken (class freak maybe?, Hanging shit on walls, stuff not there they said would be... Just off the top of my head)
---
It's demotivating.  Nothing else that I really want to play, but the sad truth is 76 is slipping into that category too.  1st was canceled not long after wastelanders.  I see little/no chance of me ever subscribing again as things are going.
---
Let the downvotes begin, but op asked so ☺️
---
Dyer chemical. West of fast travel point down by the river. If you have some, you’ve probably learned the plan to make more. Make sure you’re getting the bloom.
---
And like the comments state, the exploits related to the "wall stacking" glitch have long been fixed. This is a needless addition on top of the prior fixes that'll be used to sell a new item in the atom shop. They can still crash servers with mounted head stacking and the like. This is a pointless redundancy.
---
You have a misunderstanding of the game model being used.
---
I’ve never seen it besides on here
---
How is it entitlement to expect to get the most out of something you paid for? I understand there are a lot of these, but there is a reason for that. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I used to. The great thing about reddit is that, if you don't like what people post, you can completely ignore it and move on with your life.
---
On the last point: somebody posted here a while back that they do discounts on random stuff but you have to look through the atom shop to find them. Apparently they aren't advertised well at all. I think they did a comparison with a first and non-first player.
---
I don't have first, so I can't verify but that's what I read on this sub!
---
i'm good y'all. it's really been fun, but the constant waiting has killed the game for me. wait to gain rep, wait to gain gold, waiting for the next event, waiting for core features that should have been in day 1, waiting for fixes for the bugs from the last patch, waiting for fixes for things that have been broken from day 1, waiting, waiting, waiting. it's been *two years* ffs and this game still plays and receives the same amount of support (if not less) as a mobile freemium game. it's just sad and disappointing. maybe i'll see what this game looks like next year, assuming it's still around. for now, Fallout 1st cancelled and i am diving into my backlog.
---
A D I O S
---
How much weight is your weapon collection?
---
I just cancelled my subscription after the last update. I might get it again eventually, but it just seemed like the update provided zero new benefits while making the overall gameplay slightly worse. 
---
Plus all I use it for is easy alt transfers, nuking Whitespring, and the stashbox. I can survive without it. 
---
Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Bethesda also state that private servers would eventually allow you to install server-wide mods?
---
No limit on how many you can get, it's just a matter of RNG.
---
Yup. that's been mentioned several times since the patch.
---
At level 24 I’m surprised you find the ash heap or toxic valley too daunting. It may be an issue with your perks, weapons, or mods on said weapons.
---
does the same to me
---
It was still easier to just spam 'X' until you emptied your reserves before. I'd dump my 5.56 in stash and collect all the trash I'd gathered that day and then just spam 'X' until I hit cap or the counter stopped going up. 
---
Then just select 5.56 and spam until I ran out of points. 
---
Took all of 5 minutes before to clear out an assortment of small quantities of all types. 
---
Now it's really only useful for converting large quantities. 
---
Trying to convert 88 .38 rounds, 72 .45 rounds etc is just too much hassle for the results to be worth it. 
---
Not being a FO1st member, my stash hovers at 730lbs. Collecting ammo from corpses would get me to 800 in a single session and then I'd be able to convert the trash into 100 rounds or so for my handmade. Now I'm training myself not to bother picking up any ammo I won't use, as I just don't have the space to store it until I have enough to make converting worthwhile.
---
Go to watoga high and take all the plates/plastic-ware
---
fucking people downvoting me lol, Im literally unable to complete the main story and you whiney bitches are getting upvotes for bitching about wallpaper.
---
I think you mean "hence" not hints.
---
Why not “  kill six legendary enemy” instead of “kill 3 legendary enemy (x2)”
---
Maybe i should start a bank or a warehouse for people. People deposit junk they want out of their stash but not throw away. Maybe even trying to collect a lot for a trade or a building project. Then people could withdraw everyday. Maybe geet 2-3 people from most common time zones to help me out so there is almost always someone online for deposits and withdrawals.
---
Every time I’ve nuked white spring on a private server everything is dead. It’s filled with dead glowing ones I wait for it to respawn and I wait and I wait.
---
Yeah they updated to be like fasnacht
---
I've been having some extreme lag on PC for the last 2 days, much more than I normally experience. Meat piles + confetti mess seem to be a major factor. In most situations it isn't noticeable to me but in combat and while looting a lot of bodies, definitely.
---
No they don't
---
Yeah, and the other high school. I know the spots. But, again, assuming they haven't already been looted and you have to hop servers, you still, at least in Watoga, sometimes have to use shells to get it (you can run and try to grab them, but some of those ghouls hit hard). It's still time consuming and annoying, regardless.
---
Have gotten over a dozen of them myself. There no limit. Have about 50 white wolf hats to prove it. Lol
---
It is a known bug and won't just magically start working.  You will have to wait for a patch.  That is why you are getting dv'ed.
---
This isn't an anti Beth sentiment it's just a fucking hollow, crap event not worth doing.
---
You're wrong 
---
2 Ranger Armor Set and Icon/Emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st membership is active, but once they have been claimed they will continue to be yours after the membership expires
---
Yeah, with work, kids, wife, and the fact I have other interests, and other games, I can't play everyday. So I don't even bother paying attention to score.
---
Gunpowder, stimpaks, add up the weight before you know it. Aid tab is a good one to purge once in a while, small weights add up in quantity.
---
Also check your ammo tab, fusion cores, missiles are heavy, other things are lighter but add up in quantity.
---
And your junk tab, do the math on your higher quantity items.
---
Power armor pieces not on a frame take up unnecessary space, put the pieces on a frame, then store the frame for only 10 wt.
---
Sort your weapons tab by weight and get rid of things you dont use. Again, frag grenades etc add up the weight quickly.
---
I have two of these plans in my vendor for 9k caps, and I cannot shift them.
---
I just figured everyone had it already. \*shrug\*
---
Aquila non captat muscas. Neither should you, my friend.
---
It's your decision, if you go for the "daily-game-bait"..
---
Those baits are not critical to the gameplay.. (imho)
---
(We life in times who everything gets exploited.. - Just don't let that take to much of your freedom..)
---
You mean it´s a great blood eagle camp or that it´s a great place to camp?
---
it takes months for a minor change. a complete revamp would take years at the rate this team works.
---
Modded weapon’s weigh a lot. Take mods off if not going to use soon. Put ultralight on armor you are keeping I your stash
---
Oh that's pretty cool! Thanks for the response!
---
Got confused with my next sentence lol.
---
Have fixed it now
---
Not me, nukes can’t get you in a bunker bud.
---
Anything explosive
---
They ought to just make everything S.C.O.R.E. related be a weekly and have dailies be atoms again. This way your progression through the season can be done once a week if necessary, leaving you the rest of the week to do as you please (even if that includes more Fallout). This model would give players a way to get a drip of atoms as well - though Bethesda would have to do a proper cost/benefit analysis to make sure they don't give us too much. Gotta keep that microtransaction train going.
---
I'd say the only reason people were even able to play as much as they were this first season is because of the pandemic. There'll probably be significant drop off if season 2 is exactly like this.
---
Once again, it all stems back to Bethesda deciding how we have to play their game.
---
Let's just be real here everybody this all just stems back to the broken ass building system we have been putting up with or modding to oblivion and back to make usable. We shouldn't have to change walls to make structures that logically make sense to build work, we should have walls that can be wall papered on both sides, we should have a lot of things and should be able to do a lot of things that we "just can't". All the problems addressed in 4's building system were fixed by the modding community with tiny ass fixes that took days and weeks not months most of which were never addressed by Bethesda. Its an absolute joke that we they are making a game on an ancient ass engine and it shows, it was never made for an online game with building systems. I love fallout but tbh as a whole the decisions Bethesda are making and continue to make in some kind of sick compromise between gamers and share holders are killing this game and if this anything to go by I am honestly worried for the series.
---
how thoughtful of them, everything is better now
---
The 3 star legendary challenge the other day, was one, i as a newer player thought sounded much more difficult then chewing bubblegum. I dont remember if it had extra score attached.  So they occasionally have extra difficult challenges, but not every day.
---
It'll be the Cork top/lid.
---
said it for 10 months, this program shouldn’t exist, though their marketing materials said they ‘might’ add the things you mentioned, there was never a guarantee. if you thought that bethesda after all thia time had any capability to follow through, im sorry but thats buyer beware. like preordering a game that enda ip being terrible.
---
Forgot about that.
---
Energy big guns are even worse than 50 cal etc, because you might see \~20 cores but actually 19 of them has only 1 ammo left. At least normal bullet weapons these ammo goes back to inventory and are actually usable. It is always nice to go Scorchbeast queen fight with 19 empty fusion cores(I use ultracite fusion versions, because I want to move)
---
What a noob if you have to duplicate scrap. Lmao, I’ve never duped in two years of playing this hame and I have well over 5-10k per component. If you have to duplicate simple scrap, then yeah you suck at the game.
---
Give you one for free - IGN LoganRTX
---
This has already been discussed ad nauseum.
---
amen to that. Being compelled to play or fall behind is a sorry state to be in.
---
The entire thing or only the ones in my stash?
---
Beeswax
---
The standard ranger outfit is available, the elite ranger was a monthly special.
---
Luckily we can just refuse to let them in our bunkers and watch them all burn each other.
---
Ah yes, the old "performance issue".... Where did I hear that, the last time?.......Oh yeah, the Scrapbox comes to mind! Hooray for my memory.
---
Tell me why I should believe you, when you utter anything related to server stability? Hm?  
---
And if the servers are such an issue (which they are, they are running on minimum ram), why don't you let us, the users, run them for you?  
---
Because then you wouldn't have full control any longer. People would create all the things you have planned for the cursed "atom shop" and hand them out for free. 
---
You did promise exactly this, before you released the game. You promised private servers &amp; creation kit, so you could sell me this turd. Illegal in most physical parts of the world. "Bait &amp; Switch" - you know exactly what that is, don't you Beth.
---
FO2 had a ton of bugs at launch but the patch fixed the majority of them. Still my favorite game to this day
---
Hmmm well according to their website already half of it has been donated
---
Guess Appalachia doesn't need too many people then because we almost hit the steel target lol
---
File a charge back... That'll get it cancelled real quick
---
Once it's nuke just run your usual route real quick to make sure all spawns are loaded. Exit to main menu then hop rite back into private. They should all be there now.
---
I guess we're still on this
---
it's ridiculous that people can't just play the game because Bethesda has molded their patches around quashing exploiters, with little to no regard to how it affects everyone else. almost every patch has something about "fixing" exploits that I've never heard of, and those "fixes" break several other things every time.
---
Just go to the Atomic shop. I believe all of the bags you have are under “skins”. The instructions are at the bottom of the screen (you have the option to switch loot bag and death bag independently)
---
I'm rank 80, once I'm at 100 I'm gonna stop playing until the brotherhood are back
---
Alright buddy, time to go back to your Tinfoil layered basement.
---
Sorry, but for me "will be added at a future time" is the same as coming soon in quotes (Meaning when we come around to it).
---
Anyways my point is that Beth keeps on running their mouths while their actions say something else entirely.
---
Just remember the PA-Bug, it took 5 patches and for each and everyone ladydevann promised the fix to be included...
---
"sorry, we can only make one cookie-cutter marketing statement at a time"
---
I tried the power armor, it didn't help. I tried only collecting ores in the event. I only got 54 ore max because the ores respawn slowly. Plus 384xp.
---
If you read the BOT-STOP terminals it seems like it was or is gonna be a thing but I've heard nothing about it honestly, it would be a huge miss if they didnt
---
&gt; I hate how people think stop paying is the only way
---
It is the only way. You can see that membership as some sort of investment : You like the game and consider it's doing good? You keep re-subbing each month. You like the game but consider it's going bad? Time to invest that money somewhere else.
---
Considering how buggy the game was when it was released, it doesn't surprise me that those who purchased a full year of 1st when it came out are, in the end, not happy about it. Bethesda is not to be trusted anymore and they proved it many times those past years.
---
Patch 16 was the first 250 DRWR fix, which broke armor effects on legendary and power armors, as well as the primary effects on legendary weapons, if you reloaded pretty much any gun
---
It's certainly still fun, a lot to do and tons of players to hang out with. I'd say double the fun of fo4
---
Haha the SCORE is a CHORE 😂
---
That is correct.  I thought it may have been a visual glitch but it was not.  I did not try logging off and then back on because it was basically time to stop anyway.  I just hunted down a level 0 and completed the daily.  I have not tested this any further than what I posted, I am hoping it resolves it's self.
---
This is exactly why fo 1st exists, you have to pay to get more stash.
---
it would have made morse sense, if that was the goal, to do it during the event so people could buy rewards.
---
if they sold them, i think it’s unrelated. Materials are so easy to farm, either at a camp or just regular play
---
That made me so mad. I bought the game at 60$ USD just to watch it go to 40$, then to 20$ and now it's at about 10$ I think?!
---
Was there even a daily for lockpicking yesterday? I thought it was hacking a terminal.
---
So you were getting 500-700 score for those? It still doesn't seem like enough to me. I don't understand how some people finished the season like a full week ago. I *was* playing every single day before my game stopped working, and I'm only going to finish about halfway through.
---
if they are going to give us a generic, cookie cutter, marketing response, why bother responding?
---
Yes, please uncap S.C.O.R.E. so people can blaze through it in a week then make Reddit posts about how they have nothing to do until the next season starts. /s
---
They meant you'd rarely get any plan.
---
Is there such a thing as a roadmap for f1st?
---
The ones I know of just show the plans for the game in general, but as always, the given dates are just make believe.
---
never underestimate Bethesda'a ability to make a stupid business choice tho.
---
For the 100th time. 🤦
---
They are littalery scamming us since the beginning.
---
I just say canvas bags
---
i....doubt that.  
---
you're all overthinking this. fortifying atlas is a tiny little idea (wouldnt call it content) they borrowed from other games to give the players a goal to reach as a community and then handout tiny gift packs, no more and no less.  
---
at least, they are doing something. rockstar gave absolutly nothing for fucking 7 months and now? uh, shoot animals to extract samples? really?   
---
here, there is a roadmap with upcoming things (which can get delayed, whatever), we got event weeks and they try something new with the seasons. its all far from perfect but hey, give them a price for trying at least.
---
Some of the activities were kind of fun -- like the kill the scorched one. Handing over scrap to the people who have ruined the observatory is... less enjoyable.
---
it's almost as if this sub is made up of more than one person
---
except they broke more than they fixed. just like every patch that we wait a month+ for.
---
but yeah, let's pretend they're doing right by us.
---
"Heeeere human, human, human.... I've got a treat for yoooou."
---
And it’s expensive for a subscription that gives you basically nothing.
---
thats not whats the reason for fps drops, they changed something about meat piles, radiaton rumble is even worse
---
Thank you, will add you in due course
---
A fool and his money are soon parted. People tried telling you guys FO1st is a waste of money.
---
Ultracite you can hit up glassed caverns. Excavator armor might double your yield still.  Whitespring is great for flux stabilizers due to the ghouls. If you want a specific color of flux though check out the maps on mappalachia to find your best location for that.
---
Ultracite farming is killing Scorchbeasts and mining the ore from fissure sites and the a Glass Cavern.
---
oh shit!  my bad It was a terminal....I now feel as though my idiocy knows no bounds.. In my defense I was drunk and tired.  Sorry man.
---
* it depends which flux you want
---
* yes private world is best for this as only you can gather. You should also do 2 nukes, first one for the stabilizing agents from the creatures (WS still works best), and another one for the flux itself
---
No clue about the ultracite, I get enough scrapping. Maybe someone else, or google can help you out there?
---
No! Let it fail! maybe that will peek their interest!
---
Story is okay, mechanics are poor. Its basically a poorly implemented fps loot shooter atm.  None of your choices matter in the story everyone ends up at the same place. If gets ridiculously easy past level 30-60 if you spec in a power spec (bloody or junky bloody hybrid)
---
$14 a month virtual storage... Yikes.
---
I was just giving an example of another game that does challenges much better than 76. WF dailies only make up a small bit (1k compared to 4.5k from weeklies and 7k from the two elite weeklies) and said dailies pretty much are an easily doable thing (kill X enemies with Y damage, transmute mods a few times).
---
Honestly i’m more waiting for them to sell the lunchboxes, that would have more appeal to the player base
---
That's strange my subscription gives me 1600 atom's a month,  Absolutely unlimited scrap, A tent I can set up anywhere so I don't have to move my base to scrap a few items, Some pretty cool outfits, A private server if I ever want to try new content without anybody interfering, A couple player icons and I'm sure some more that I'm forgetting.
---
 So yeah "basically nothing".  If you have a job it's not expensive at all.
---
Wastelanders 2 is definitely still worth a play and 3 lands end of this month. Same type of game world
---
Excavator doesn’t work on Ultracite
---
You won't play a video game unless the company who makes that video game fires it's employees? This is a joke post, right? Because that's the most obnoxious thing I think I've read all month.
---
is it true that if i farm WS, fast travel away from WS, Leave my private server, go right back in and fast travel back to WS the ghouls respawn and i can continue this until the nuke zone has ended?
---
I do private server Morgantown nukes (solely as it's a new player area and they don't wanna do Final Departure against Lvl 60 scorched lol) and get a fair bit of flux- but the most underrated way is SBQ fights, or rather I feel it doesn't get mentioned to mid level players (I only found this out at lvl 150 or so....). 
---
You get flux (handful mixed) and ultracite from the Queen after meeting easy damage thresholds. Whenever there's a queen fight and peeps bail afterwards I always wipe out any glowing critters nearby and scoop up the High Rad fluid etc. 
---
Some peeps like Whitesprings but I got fuck all from there compared to Morgantown. Just my opinion.
---
And thanks for your answers.
---
I quit when the new season launched. cancelled FO76 and haven't looked back. It's such a continuous broken mess, I can't understand how anyone could justify sinking money into the game every month at this point.
---
i admit im liking lunchboxes myself, something about the cheesy noise and effects that just seems so entertaining to share with others.
---
hopefully they are repair kit prices, maybe even slightly less since you can stack it so they'll wanna sell more.
---
Yeah I wasn't sure about it. I just scrap bones and wings for mine.
---
I did some testing to figure out which parts of the bag the hitbox actually encapsulates, [and it seems to be the right or left 1/3rd](https://i.imgur.com/FZ0kF0y.jpg). Aiming anywhere to the right of my crosshair in this screenshot allowed me to loot it, and moving any further left put me out of the hitbox. I'd say easiest way to find it is to always aim at the side of the bag, and if you don't see the menu the first time aim at the other side.
---
It’s the only ore it doesn’t work on, but if your diligent in picking up every Ultracite vein in the cavern, you can end up with quite a few.
---
I feel your pain. I really wanted to destroy the raiders on my BoS character, but couldn't even hurt them. And I wanted to join them on my evil character, but they were so bland I just scrapped that character, just did their quest on my main.
---
Until they upgrade their dated, shite game engine then I wouldnt hold your breath, they were ahead of their time once but never moved with it, they stayed stagnant and stale, and 76 shows this, it in no way looks like a triple A title on current gen hardware, and I know I will be down voted by the people who can't remove their head from Todd Howard's ass long enough to see that this is the unfortunate truth, I love Fallout, Fallout 3 was top notch when it was released...on last gen, but let's be honest they haven't made much improvement since then, gameplay, graphically and less of bugs wise, they've actually got worse since then
---
Need your IGN if you added me? Thanks
---
Only two, Aluminum and Lead.
---
I started playing for the first time almost 3 weeks ago. Does it have bugs and some issues sure. I love fallout also and was waiting to play until they had a bunch of updates . I've semi messed up 2 characters because of special pt allocation but after level 50 you can move 1 point around each level to fix the builds. Your basically solo until an event pops up. Then you can play alongside others. The building of camps isn't as good as it should be but can get stuff done. No text chat, but they have voice in oarty and area. Gameplay is still fallout. VATS is still here but doesn't freeze time which is weird at first but you get used to it. Story isn't that great but definitely has its moments so far. Some pretty cool side missions. All together its pretty fun. I see myself playing for months to come. Fallout first subscription is worth it. Unlimited scrap box is amazing. Hope this helps.
---
Well I mean for 10 extra dollars a year you could have Disney+ and Netflix.
---
200 from notes and 300 from Smiley. Technically possible to do 500 in a day but also entirely disingenuous as it implies you can do it everyday.
---
It's a very interesting decision when you consider the industry awareness of a healthy balance in life. I remember way back when, Blizzard introduced rested XP in WoW to encourage people to log off at some point. This is the opposite end of that ideology I suppose.
---
how much flux do you yield from one nuke on morgantown.
---
Possibly being very extremely cautious of moose bites. They’re bad you know.
---
And thanks for your answer
---
I built portable camps on all characters for the time I gave up first. It’s a 1x2 little shed with all basic necessities including every workbench except PA and Brewing stations. I love it so much. Sure it costs 40 caps to move it each time, still cheaper than $13 a month
---
Yeah, actually, I quit...
---
Going by memory here.
---
I believe the chapters come whenever you buy the latest chapter.
---
The sub gets you the DLC, but the DLC usually comes to the subs a few months after it's released (or it goes to the subs whenever the latest chapter is released...not sure which).
---
But I was given an early expansion by a friend as a gift and it came with 500 crowns. They eventually had a sale where you got 3 of the expansions (including the one with the thieves and assassins guilds in it) for quite cheap, so when I bought them I ended up paying about $4.
---
As far as games go it's one of the cheapest I've found for the amount of content in it...the world is really large and well developed with quests.
---
There are dungeon packs but that's getting in to really late game  stuff and totally unnecessary to enjoy the game. Plus if you do get there, there are lots of dungeons that are openly available.
---
There's also a very robust in game player trading system where different guilds that form have merchants around the world in cities etc. where you can browse the wares being sold by members in that guild. You can pickup a LOT of near end game equipment pretty cheap.
---
Also, they have daily log in rewards that tend to get better towards the end of the month, if you miss a day it comes off of the last day of rewards. It's nothing earth shattering but it DOES have a lot of benefits from XP scrolls to new pets and cosmetics to 100,000 gold (this month has a little of everything).
---
That would be great for people who watch TV, I do not.
---
I'd rather pay $14 a month on a game that I play every single day.
---
 [u/ladydevann](https://www.reddit.com/u/ladydevann/) [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek/)
---
I got a 1* star fixer from that hunting blackbear lodge daily.
---
my ingame name is ggblade
---
yeah the 300 is once a week, so technically the per-day is like 240-ish
---
They've fixed that unfortunately.
---
I could stop if I wanted to. Noooooooooo
---
Just finished radiation rumble on ps4 and my god the frame drops where terrible.
---
If your on mobile, go out of this post to the main menu where you can see all the posts on this sub. Then go to the top-right corner and press the 3 dots.
---
Cool, will add u now
---
I received my first SS drop from the Queen...too bad it was a 2* nocturnal.
---
Ouch. I bought a plan for about 4.5K, then next day (on a whim) joined an Encryptid event: first time, got the plan. the RNG odds are so...odd.
---
White spring can get you 220 or so flourescent flux (green rhumb)  (20+ with agents). I would farm that and trade up to other flavors. Rinse, repeat. 
---
Also glassed caverns
---
They need to go the ESO route and remove spoilage, as well. I think it would have a noticeable positive impact on servers to not have to track all of the spoiling and cut back on character weight.
---
This is a person that can't even type a post that isn't a mess of several run on long sentences of anger. Of course it's obnoxious.
---
Sir this is the DMV, please take a number and wait your turn.   
---
What is that? You have been here all day? Well the average waiting time is 3 and a half day.
---
I bought it thinking it gave me the standard, advanced, and elite riot gear + paint. I thought that for 10$ a month that + scrabox was a decent deal. I felt ripped off at getting a shitty Halloween costume and just the standard riot gear.
---
Ahh, thanks.  Will try this (never thought to look there).
---
I Also don’t watch tv but I would still rather have that money to spend on other things than fo76.
---
Unless you get real hard-core and realize that you can turn in notes every 20 hours which averages that daily amount to approximately 280.
---
Yes, patch notes said it could no longer be triggered immediately after completion.   It did not mention not being able to be started 4 or 5 days after you last did it.
---
*panicking intensifies*

While this is what the community wanted and hoped for, that is not what this is. Fallout 76 from day 1 was nothing more than a cash grab. They reused most of the assets from fallout 4 and much of the buggy code. They have monetized this as bad as a mobile game and havent added anything fun or meaningful. Just a cheesy board game. The Far cry series did the exact same thing with Far Cry New Dawn. Its just a way to easily and quickly pump out a new 'game' with absolute minimal effort to boost sales and generate revenue. That is why this game sucks. Imagine if it had one of their AAA studios making it, 76 could have been amazing. While it got so much wrong it got alot right too, just not enough people working on it from a competent studio.
---
It is not unheard of for large production companies to move people around and assign staff from one studio to another to brace it up where it is lacking in skill or o ow how. Ubisoft does this a lot.
---
it's all relevant. should we give them a break about the Colossus event too? it's almost the end of summer and we're still missing half of the new features promised on the road map for summer. Months later we don't have legendary perks or the Colossus event. Fall starts in a month, do you think we are still going to get One Wasteland and the BoS questline on time? if not, do they deserve a break then too?
---
there is a subset of the community that likes to act like people are lashing out at one thing when the sub explodes like this, but it isn't *just* one thing. it's everything. everything is delayed. every patch breaks something and the next patch focuses on fixing those things.. while breaking more for *the next* patch. it's a vicious cycle of incompetence and now two years in, people are tired of "giving Bethesda a break." the community has given them plenty, and the quality of updates has declined terribly. the endgame is practically just waiting. waiting for the next thing to come in a few months to blow through it in a week - assuming they don't hit us with more freemium bullshit time gating.
---
i get what you're saying, and i was on this sub calling to give Bethesda some slack over issues too, but where is the line? when is enough, enough? im tired of perpetually waiting for the next disappointment.
---
I mean they had a ghoul in a fridge ff sake of course they would do this
---
Ignore the vocal minority who say it's complete trash (and yet play it anyway!) and jump in. The biggest change from FO4, other than being true mult-player, is the inherent limits imposed by it being an online environment - you'll hit limits regularly, some are necessary but other seem arbitrarily low, lag can be a killer in large fights, and other minor irritations.It's not a game for hoarders although FO1st can help if afflicted. 
---
Xbox seems to have a less disruptive minority than the other platforms (griefers, trap camps, dupers etc) but there's no denying they are still there. The good news is they can generally be avoided with a little commonsense (eg use pacifist, don't shoot back, avoid camps with corridors to vendors).
---
I'm 1200hrs in and I really enjoy it, mostly because I don't get involved in the more nefarious sides of the game, and recognise the truth that the majority of bugs and glitches are not game breakers at all regardless of the moaners. 
---
In summary - a good game, but not a great one. If you accept the limits and bugs its fun. If you stress easily walk away.
---
In the company i work people get fired if they show that level of incompetence,why do you find obnoxious the way the world works?.
---
Great so it will be another couple months before they fix it.
---
Opinions. Everyone is allowed to have them. Ours is clearly different and I don't disregard yours by any means.
---
I see it like a board of investors. You have board meetings on how to improve. 
---
I have pumped a lot of money into this game. I pre-ordered the collectors edition, paid for first, bought atoms etc. Personally I think it would be silly of me to stop playing all together after investing so much. Bethesda are aware that if they do not improve, they will lose a lot of money from their players.
---
Wait, what. In Brazil they were translated as nylon bags. Are they canvas in english?
---
Then I suggest stop bitching about not having enought stash space.  You should feel lucky we're not stuck at the 400 stash space anymore that we all had to deal with for a long time.
---
More stash is the number one selling point of fall out 1st. Don't hold your breath on them giving you more stash space for free.  It would be awesome if they did but I highly doubt they will.
---
OK, I've checked the link and EVERYTHING listed under 'What's Included' has been included.
---
Private Worlds, Scrapbox, Survival Tent, ATOMS, Ranger outfit, Icon and Emotes.
---
What you are referring to is noted in this section:
---
" Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as  expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop  persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing  Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to  private worlds in the future. "
---
It does not specify that these things are included.  The key words here are 'continue to evolve' and 'in the future'.
---
We have had discounted ATOM shop items, by the way.  they just haven't been clearly labelled as such.
---
Not going to make myeslf popular with this reply, I know.  However, maybe your post title should be questioning the lack of evolution of the private worlds or requesting a clearer timeframe than 'in the future'?
---
FO76 is aimed at a different player base. They added a token gesture of camp building &amp; a storyline to bring the old audience with them whilst they grow their new audience. There will be little further investment in the elements legacy fallout fans enjoy (immersion, exploring, camp building etc) and more centred on the Fortnite/COD type play (PVP &amp; rinse repeat events)
---
People feel duped because Bethesda were not clear in their intentions at the time of release, but hey, they are a business.
---
There’s also an element of grief. Bethesda intend to keep developing on this world rather than release new games (give investors more bang for their buck), therefore this is Fallout now and forever. It’s not just a bad game in a franchise but the end of that franchise if you don’t like that style of play, so it invokes a real sense of loss for some.
---
You are absolutely correct in all that you say, Bethesda are chasing the almighty dollar and a loyal fan base only mattered to get them through launch. Loyalty with Bethesda is a very one way street.
---
"Haha look at these idiots. We actually lied to them about getting perks for this stupid Fallout 1st subscription and they believed it! Just wait, we'll not add the content because that takes effort and money. Then you'll get half of them defending it!" - Todd Coward
---
I guess on a positive note its not just me. Unfortunately that means I can't progress the game until  they fix this. 😫
---
Are you talking about the Assaultron Helmet thing? If so, as of when? I made a few hundred screws last week.
---
&gt;  I think it would be silly of me to stop playing all together
---
I never said you should stop playing? My comment was about paying, you might have misread me! I'm still playing the game, just not gonna spend anymore money on it until it gets MUCH better.
---
Ah yes, the infamous bloodied build with a legacy weapon perhaps?
---
scintillating read
---
I'm not gonna stop playing it, I'm still having fun with the game.
---
Ask yourself when do you stop giving a company your good faith and benefit of the doubt? 
---
Many vaults executed unethical experiments in psychology on unwitting subjects. Vault 76 broke the fourth wall to become an experiment to find out the community’s exact price point. Shedding all ethical restrictions, how can maximum profit be extracted from each player for the lowest effort possible? All companies do this, but it is nowhere near as brazen as in Fallout 76.
---
We are data for them, to be referenced to justify adding shitty micro-transactions for a long time to come in future Bethesda games.
---
Dude omg thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
The steel number is probably right. There are way more players than you think there are and almost everyone has 1000+ steel. I know fo1st members with 100,000+ legit steel as they have stockpiled junk for a year.
---
I didn’t see anything about emergency maintenance, you sure it wasn’t just that the Server needed to be recycled and you could just log back into a new server?
---
C'mon, we aren't THAT bad. :P
---
But we have cookies
---
That sounds right but I highly doubt someone else placed 14 turrets as haphazardly as that
---
Whats that?
---
If they would add something like 10 more public events and normal events, much more fun and interactive dailies and maybe one more map, I would be ok with it
---
Just don't log in every day. I don't. Makes it more enjoyable. Who cares if you don't get every identical power armor in the season? No big deal.
---
What vault-tec scrap containers?
---
Omg dont grind for this event. If youre at end game then nothing it offers is worth grinding for.
---
lol...seems about par for the course.
---
Instead of armor I got a 2 star gauss rifle from a scorched earth event.
---
I feel like you guys don't care about player feedback unless you guys are losing money.
---
Dont lie to the player base, we know you don't care. You keep taking away cool things in the game, you add in lack luster overly grindy content (Atlas event,that god awful mole miner pail event etc)
---
The consistant bugs with the Legendary Run...etc.
---
I am sick and tired of your guys bs. You clearly dont care about your own game and it shows.
---
It gives you the ability to play the game properly.
---
They promised us canvas bags if we pre ordered the most expensive version of the game, but shipped us nylon bags instead. Around 6 months later they sent us the canvas ones because they were basically forced to. Not surprising that they didn't even advertise as canvas in Brazil.
---
That's great hopefully we will all get God rolls soon
---
I guarantee you that people who say they will quit, will continue playing and spending money in the atom shop.
---
Each time they pop up I normally do 2-3 per game session. I literally stop what I’m doing when that event pop up just because of how much exp 
---
Doing those events plus the score adds up to a lot
---
Doesn't matter regardless. The rewards are garbage overall
---
God dammit
---
guess it already did. One of the best perk cards for shotgunners, the crippling one, was nerfed heavily or the enemies now have much higher resistance to it. Freaking ridiculous.
---
I haven't played this game for about 2-3 months because i had nothing to do but i kept reading the reddit posts. I must say these updates Bethesda makes keep becoming more and more pathetic.
---
Bulk your junk items at tinkers bench
---
the ones available from the legendary run (mainly at the start of it) that give you an item containing scrap similar to bulk ammo scrapable
---
yeah i'm still waiting for the mod support they promised before release and are supposedly still working on. i really hope it isn't locked to fallout first, but it probably will be.
---
Commander Daguerre Follows me everywhere if I'm just running from my camp (not teleport), anyone else got this?
---
Which items loose weight when bulked?
---
Those who can do enough damage to the queen fast enough has the best method for FLUX as the do her 3 times a day in small teams and get all the FLUX and skip the concern of components.  That said, fair warning on public servers and the hacked weapons with folks 1 or 2 shooting you might get nothing....  
---
Ultracite in the Glassed Cavern is still a great place and at your level you can breeze through it.  Throw on the Excavator armor for added farming perk.
---
1) Flux. Depending on what you use. 
---
     Flourescent - The Mire or Whitesprings Golf Club (epicenter the clubhouse and not Whitesprings proper)
---
Violet - Harper's Ferry, FSP, Cranberry Bog (Abandoned Bog Town to General Steakhouse)
---
Cobalt - Morgantown (best for High Radiation Fluids and masses also), Clarksburg Area (use Toxic Lakebed as epicenter), Lake Eloise (best for cobalt), Northern Savage Divide (Hopewell Cave, Sons of Dane)
---
Yellowcake - Anywhere in Savage Divide region.
---
 Ultracite - Any fissure site or Glassed Cavern (nuked or not). 
---
There's others but these will yield at least 5-20 stable flux.
---
2) Don't do it in a private server. Enemies rarely respawn. When somebody enters a server the enemies will respawn quicker. Advice for masses and fluids, wait until somebody bombs Whitesprings, don't join in until after 20-30 minutes. After the meat piles diminish it'll leave all the remnants of the stuff that wasn't looted (HRF and masses a plenty plus you get fresh spawns because they initial rush killed the 'shit wave' of enemies). Same for FSP. Don't do Scorched Earth and repeat the same process for Whitesprings. People now are only worried about Score and xp. You'll walk away the winner. Underrated place to bomb solely for legendary/hrf/masses: Lewisburg.
---
What and get all the brand new NPC’s killed??? I’m not trying to be in an empty map again
---
I'm aware of the canvas bag scandal, that edition wasn't  even available in my country. The atom shop loot bag is what i'm talking about, It says it's a nylon bag, which got a laugh out of me as i though Todd was taking a piss out of that whole situation
---
LOL - show's you how much attention I've been paying to those rewards!
---
Ive been having a similar issue, the game feels like it wants to die the minute I click onto the legendary run board.
---
So like we are half way https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
This should have been implemented as a fetch quest to, at least, make it more engaging for lower levels and those without 1st. They already have the Roxy former raider quest to use as a base. Get a map location for a supply crate, go to it and fight off the enemies that are near it. Return to Russell with the supplies. Award scrip and/or treasury notes for the "event". This would have removed the dupability out of the event, if that's what they're always trying to prevent.
---
Personally I think it's because of all the duped junk
---
I never said you did haha!! 
---
All I'm saying is that the general consensus is that the only way to fix things is to stop paying &amp; playing, which I do not agree with (for myself). Anyone who chooses to do such has taken matters into their own hands which they are than entitled to do. 
---
But everyone does agree on one thing and that is change needs to happen... soon. I hope they pull their finger out.. no wait, FIST out their asses. Haha
---
The method I use costs budget but I place a mat down with the conduit or pylon I wanna use on it, connect the conduit to my power source, pick up the mat then move it like a metre or so to see if the wire stays, if it does then you can pick up the mat and place it anywhere in your camp and the game won’t detect collision on the wire so the wires will clip through anything.
---
I am gutted about losing the ability to swap wall types for building purposes though.
---
Entire thing
---
Can confirm, seems nerfed. Tormentor seems to be working better though
---
Do you *really* need 6000 steel scrap?
---
There is nothing mandatory about this though? Literally this is how every MMO-type game works, and its all voluntary. You don't HAVE to log in. They give you the bypass of using ATOMS instead ... so you get to choose, time or money (which is literally how everything works).
---
The only way I am waiting for someone else to tag a legendary is if there are only like two of us and the other guy is only level 50 or something low like that; IE: I know they are highly unlikely to one shot it.
---
Probably &gt;80% of the time, if I don't instantly shoot a legendary the second I see it, someone else one shots it and I get nothing.  So fuck that noise, I hardly wait for anyone anymore.
---
that was EXACTLY the problem! Thanks
---
the real question, is why was it even touched?
---
Can confirm on xbox one.
---
t hat was EXACTLY the problem! Thanks
---
Use courier service on discord. Or ask a friend
---
Why do I want to help fortify them? I'm just gonna nuke em when they get here anyway 🤷
---
I'm just wondering how you unlocked every serum recipe. The grind to 20k caps takes so long, and then you buy one and that's all your caps gone, and you have to grind from nothing again.
---
It’s just a nice location, feels like an actual game location. Would be at home in Rage I think. I get there expecting to find something I missed before and there’s nothing. Like there should be a secret cave entrance or something.
---
Lead and aluminum.   The rest have the weight as loose scrap.  You might gain 3 or 4 lbs of space if you bulked all the scrap, but that would just be the weight of the plastic used.
---
Shout out the the moron who wanted to take legal action because that had me rolling lmao
---
The only realy communities exist as monor satellite groups around fo76 streamers.
---
I seen people on Facebook in spamming post showing millions of junk items trying to trade for Legacies
---
Currently digging a new bunker to store all my steel, cork, and concrete that the BOS won’t be getting.
---
and it only took 30 seconds of trying to use it to notice it.....
---
Na it’s just a way of them trying to get duper’s to give up all there scrap
---
Hey guess what....you don’t have to spend your money on 76. I guess no one ever told you, you’re free to do whatever it is you like with YOUR money.
---
Bruh, what the hell? It's Just called the Vault-tec Duffle for us!
---
I'm so glad player shops are a thing now, makes filling out my plans so much cheaper
---
i really wish we just got a remastered new vegas with 4-player coop. or even just coop added to fallout 4. either would have been a million times better.
---
I’m guessing there’s still lots of exploits that go unshared. Any time a servers frame rate unexplainably drops super low and then you server only to find the same issue repeatedly, I’m guessing another exploit has made its way into the wild.
---
I've seen some of the machines in camps, but I don't think it's ruining the ammo market.  I make approximately 1000 5.56 rounds to put in my vendors and it's usually gone within about six hours of being in-game
---
Okay none of us know if it’s “older folks” or (youngsters) that play F076. Please keep in mind that both terms are relative to the age of the person using the term. 
---
Also FO76 is an age restricted game, so I doubt Bethesda are targeting an audience below their game age rating.
---
I agree with your second point Bethesda are alluding to adding new content whereas in reality it’s a rehashed skin or the same Event Mechanics but with a different event name.
---
&gt;We are actively looking into our available options to bring some of these building methods back to 76 in a more intended and secure way
---
Its better than not even mentioning a solution at all i think
---
That's why I said most if not all. 
---
Leveling up is usually the sole daily I may not finish.
---
That's just a huge waste of a nuclear key card and time, while also making lower level people's experience hell
---
Use the market subreddit
---
lmao
---
in Brazil it's "Vault-Tec Nylon Loot Bag". Hang on, i'll get a screenshot
---
Tuesday's patch fixed this.
---
I’m just saying for y’all sake, if it’s an atomic shop item, and we have to pay for it. People will riot
---
&gt;exclusive atomic shop discounts are nowhere to be seen.
---
???
---
last week it was the bloody arktos refrigerator, this week its the amateur inventor paints; they've been going on as long as I have had 1st
---
Yeah. Because what we all need to do is trade our freedoms from a authoritarian racist regime to an authoritarian communist regime. I will keep my freedom thank you very much.
---
I don't think you can send screenshots on this subreddit
---
Quit is little too hard word for me, but after I hit level 100 on S.C.O.R.E level I am gonna part my ways with Fallout 76 until I/WE get more actually fun stuff to do like new content to play with friends and new story content.  
---
To be honest, If I did not have friends via online that actually wants to play this game, I would be long gone.  
---
Now my current exit (s)tragedy is doing last 8 S.C.O.R.E levels to hit 100 and then uninstall this game and then waiting these promised story content etc and get back after we have more real content.
---
No perks on: 140
---
With Perks on: 45.44
---
remember we are made up of people who know how to engineer fusion generators, plumbing (kinda) wire electronics and make buildings out of pencils.
---
working together to remove the door, require everything and program the handies to not try kick us out and it would be a good city as any. hell you could even phase it so once you finish the main story and tell the overseer that we killed the queen it shows us a cut-scene of dwellers deciding to use their creativity to re-inhabit our starting point and making our mark on the world.
---
I've got 800 of them 😭
---
A fool and his head are also easily parted
---
I don't know.. my english is not perfect so i didnt know another word for future plans lol
---
It will not be allowed to fail. These types of events never do. Thats bad PR. The quotas will be fudged by the devs regardless of participation. The donations are gold/credit/cap sinks designed to remove currencies from markets while increasing player gathering/farming time. *Usually*, the rewards for such events are worth spending time participating for.
---
Leave it to Bethesda to create rewards so terrible that the social media community instantly laughs in their faces and boycotts the whole thing.
---
Probably wasn‘t, but something else was and then spaghetti code happened
---
I'm getting what seem to be random frame drops, but this has been going on since before the patch. So not sure. I'm on PC.
---
Absolutely none of them, coz if they don't play enough for any of this to make a serious detriment to their gameplay, they wouldn't make posts about it. It's all convenient that when Beth actually fixes stuff they previously asked for, it's never mentioned, only when there's stuff left unfixed. Especially the people who pay for fallout 1st, chances are they'll play anyway if they will pay monthly for it
---
I’m not telling anyone how to spend their money, I was just saying that it is expensive for a scrap box.
---
You're on the right track though. I haven't tried it myself in NW but in adventure mod the well gives dirty water with no rads.
---
I got one for 150 caps yesterday. Delighted
---
Well I ain't giving up my 673 cork for it! 😄
---
i think it kept the paper bag hit box.
---
Yeah but.... I can't be the only one that's noticed steel scrap everywhere in containers and even just lying around on shelves and the ground in random and not so random places? All over the damn map!! 
---
I'm pretty confident that this is not a coincidence. Relax.
---
I think the daily time-gate is the issue for a lot of people. Fold all the daily challenges together, let people complete them over a week, you’d probably see happier players.
---
Heck, show all the challenges for the entire run, let people complete them whenever they like over the period.
---
Yeah, also edited a bit
---
Wendigo Colossus
---
Other than that, nope.
---
Are you going to make another post about how naive you are to think that they dont already have all of this content ready to roll out and that they would simply scrap all that work they have already completed just because of some people that refused to donate all their cork in return for inventories full of useless "prizes"?
---
Gotta artificially inflate their DAU though.
---
I'm talking cork, not steel. Cork is MUCH harder to find
---
Other additions from other members is as follows: 
---
- Fix fast travel.  Im sick of having to do 156 attempts to get back to my camp...
---
- Fix loading issues.   I tried playing yesterday...  but crashed 7 times at that second loading screen
---
- Seconded on that Ammo Converter above...
---
- I get RNG.. but...  a 3* enemy should be dropping nothing but 3* items, etc...
---
- Put the weight of mainframe cores back to .5
---
- Put in an opposite of Bloodied
---
- Allow for more than 150 scrip daily when scripping at the machines
---
- Bump up camp budgets, and allow us to build communities
---
I can’t really tell the difference, I did it at 19% heath. Maybe no difference is a big difference as they are different damage on pip boy but the junkies can do almost the same damage as the bloodied does
---
well. you chose to do that.
---
Man, Bethesda can't even break a feature correctly.
---
Never paying for fallout 1st and not buying atoms is quitting in their book, so I've quit.
---
Did we ever get a fix for the parachute bag?
---
Like i said, i got heavily in the trading game. Traded by way up from my pipe weapon up to a nice arsenal of top tier weapons and two legacys. Started farming mats en masse and trading them for weapons. then trading those weapons and some mats for even better weapons. Then selling a lot of mats for caps. And now i sell so much through my vendors and trading that i haven't sold anything to train station vendors for three months or so as it´s more of a hazzle and im always at full caps.
---
There's also a cultists on the roofs of point pleasant (left side before bridge if entering from the north) who's always got a Gatling gun ..
---
It’s been mentioned, just seems to have fallen by the wayside. May still be coming to the game.
---
I would like it if they only had weekly SCORE. Add more of them and increase the requirements so they can't be done in a day.
---
Nice!
---
As a total mercenary, they won't be getting anything from me with those rewards.
---
I just wish that area was a PVP zone, like the workshops, so I could RP a highwayman and get my hands on some of that steel for myself!
---
Too many melee characters running around one shotting everything in events too. My melee runs with a rifle just tagging mobs.
---
We're still bitching about 250 steel? 
---
There's steel everywhere. Seriously. Get over it for fuck's sake.
---
Yep I play on both as I play a lot but this run is shit I decided not to do it on ps4 as well as pc and xbox as it would be too much
---
Don't mess around with workshops if you can't defend them. 
---
Workshops tend to be fairly slow to build up materials and for almost every items there are easier and more efficient ways to get what you are looking for without workshops.  They are more trouble then they are worth unless the resource output gets buffed.
---
Thanks for being the average typical hater.
---
Typewriters have gears, screws, *and* springs. Literally better than gold.
---
Lol I guess you’re right.
---
You can glitch though the foundation in most cases still, but it will probably waste some budget to build under the map to allow the connection
---
It's supposedly fixed but there has still been the odd post here and there of people saying it has happened to them.  So who knows.
---
Can you provide more proof then just your word?
---
Bethesda works in mysterious ways...not even their devs know how they fuck up so much.
---
*The Brotherhood of Steel wants to know your location*
---
All the stuff on the legendary run will just get dropped into the atomic shop when the board gets tossed in the bin. It's the way to make more money.
---
Shit learn something new every day
---
FO76 isn't age restricted, purchase is. Kid's can play M games if they want, they just can't buy it at a store without a parent.
---
the most xp from RR i got when I was with my teammate lvl 26 and some other guy who decided to go for the ore. We completed event with a whole bunch of deathclaws and floaters in the end. with 50% xp bonus from lunchboxes, bugged uny (+30 intead of +15) and as a herbivore + other mutations and chems I lvled up two times there from 386 to 388 or someth. like this. So full construction public team and all bonuses help a lot.
---
Even if they applied a limit the people who want workshops to fight will just wait until someone owns one and head there anyways. Once they hit the limit they will just server hop and do it all again. Or leave relinquish ownership and rejoin to do it all again.
---
I've missed several days and I'm still ahead. Almost at level 80.
---
Steel making bullets that are better used shooting the brotherhood out of the damned sky
---
Yea but when you get addicted and go into withdraw isn't there negative affects? I'm just going off what I've been told never personally done a junkies biuld
---
&gt; Every time I’ve nuked white spring on a private server everything is dead. It’s filled with dead glowing ones I wait for it to respawn and I wait and I wait.
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Aaaawwwwwwww forget the whole thing.
---
i just craft plasma cores. they are very cheap compared to fusion cores.
---
i used to have 100s of fusion cores but my alts used them all up. 
---
i'd be happy to trade for some but lately am just farming and using workshops.
---
The fact I wish Outer Worlds was an amazing game because I dont like the current business model Bethesda are taking, is childish? Don't make me laugh!
---
You want childish? Go back to sucking Todd Howards dick, bruh.
---
Forgot what company it was, but they something along the lines of: We've been asking ourselves what made those first one so good."
---
Well who knows whit what they came up with.
---
Buy it would not be the first time that fans of certain game/movie 'universe' knows the story and especially the small details better then the Guy(s) who took it over of the first/orginals writers.
---
Unless you like to keep strumble over by Tiny details and keep saying 'that is not possible' or 'that doesn't make sence, they didn't excist before 2220, the trip to get here from the east took 2 years and they arrived in 2221...!?! ' blabla
---
These days i am eager to say. ' You know what? They can have them ' fine, whatever!! }:‑)

Can you explain?
---
You're comment "sometimes" is a loaded one. No system is perfect and all are open to criticism, but I dare say that "sometimes" heavily implies "not usually". I dont give a damn about downvotes on "woke reddit" either (for you downvoters).
---
I understand that, I'm saying that there is steel scrap where there wasn't before. I pulled a dozen pieces out of containers at Uranium Fever last night. That's not a coincidence... they'll do the same thing with cork.
---
I do it for the atoms
---
&gt; Private servers. They're positively delightful and it's REALLY hard to go back to laggy public servers.
---
I also find I really enjoy doing a number of the events solo.  Uranium Fever, the Nightwalker one, few others.
---
I don't do it often - but find radation rumble solo a good challenge as well.
---
\#1. grow a pair or GTFO
---
\#2. doesn't matter after lvl 50 his stats dont increase anymore. 
---
\#3. if you cant handle the real work go ot a private server.
---
The childish statement is about how you wish you could give money to one snd not the other.
---
No one is making you give money to Bethesda. You’re making it sound like you have no choice. 
---
How childish. That abc the fact you clearly have trouble understanding what you’re reading.
---
why not relish and herbivore?
---
Maybe, but that sounds pretty normal to me
---
So much yes to all of it! I also run a Facebook group and am hearing the same things as you. The community is fed up and leaving the game  i hate to see that. Bethesda please for the sake of your game and its future please listen. I beg of you. You have a game that has helped me through some tough spits in life by taking my mind off things and giving me some friends i would have never had. They now have all left the game. It hurts .my heart. I miss the old days.
---
Lately I’ve been trying to help out the new people by stashing low-level weapons and ammo and duffel bags and boxes around vault 76 when I can find them. Yesterday I noticed when I put too much ammo into a bag the bag disappeared and all the stuff I had to put in there it was gone to.
---
Hope you were not trying to do it solo without the help of other account or a friend... Cause that's the dumbest thing ever :(
---
I would like to add that not even Fallout 1st was finished and items from it were buggy as hell
---
Yes but if you choose wisely it's minimal to your special stats. You don't have to keep taking anything to manage your junkies effecting your weapons damage.
---
This is one of 2 reasons I quit trying to hold workshops on public worlds. Always the chance of some wanker coming along simply to kill you with no intention of taking the workshop.
---
The other reason is as I leveled and got stronger I found better ways to farm.
---
Game pass for PC is a hell of a deal. Hell even Fallout 76 is on there lol
---
Well those guys did do a surgery on a grape so this can’t be that bad
---
This would never be truer if our president gets elected again. (Hopefully this statement is apolitical enough.) not trying to offend either side
---
Only I’ve got scrapper kits from the Legacy Run. There are literally craft benches all over the game. I did Line in the Sand, collected all the weapons. Was 100 pounds overweight. I just walked to Blue Caravan and scrapper it all. Back under weight, fast travels to ATLAS and dropped off.
---
Whitesprings and Morgantown are unstable for me on private servers. I blue screen(ps4). But if you decide to nuke those solo on a private you'll be loaded back into the server you nuked. So they will respawn. But the quantity of enemies is less. I did this last week in the Northern Savage Divide. Got a cool screenshot of a Sheepsquatch and 4 Mole Miners fighting 3 Wendigo Spawns and a Colossus 15 mins after the nuke diminished.
---
You guys think this is a lot, but in reality it isn’t at all. If my player count is half ass close than 30% of the community can complete all these goals easily.
---
Like in Space Quest 3, Astro chicken. Haha classic.
---
You sure they didn't fast travel away? I have yet to find anyone who is able to enter the mine.
---
I watched one of his L1 minions beat down a L7 mole rat last night at the charleston junk yard. Rad roaches take absolutely no shit from anybody.
---
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS USEFUL PIECE OF INFORMATION. WHY ARE WE YELLING, THOUGH?
---
Where are some good spots like that to farm xp? I'm level 50 now and am looking to ramp that up
---
I only got fallout 1st for the bog wanderer outfit, that's it. fallout 1st really isn't worth anything more lol
---
ahh i remember those days. a scrap box changed my life. and gave me thae ability to delete 6 alts.
---
They changed the quest in the patch and borked it up.  Try analyzing the blood sample then installing the fuse.  Apparently some folks have had luck with that.
---
i just looked now and that 75.19m hasn't moved, and yes i did refresh
---
I'll of my characters have permanent homes
---
Just take a good break and come back if you feel like the updates have been good enough
---
I wish that I could participate in it but I just have no ammo to really do anything
---
They goal will be reached. Bethesda will take care of it. They couldn’t effort a community challenge failure.
---
If they did fast travel away it was at a full sprint right into the wooden door, I wonder if someone who could complete the quest a few updates could still have access
---
Like others mentioned, it depends. My secondary char is a bloodied sneak commando/rifle build. She wears almost exclusivley unyielding wood armor pieces with AP regen (the additional sneak perk on this armor is so good, you shoot a double barrle next to a ghoul horde and they still don't find you) and a chameleon secret service chestpiece for the Jetpack.
---
My third char is a junkies heavy build. He wears a set of vanguard armor and is as tanky as it gets. Some secret service pieces in here as well, but mostly urban scout armor.
---
My main char is also bloodied. And hes my most precious. He wears my best unyielding secret service armor pieces i crafted on all my chars. A while back it was possible to transfer those items with a bug in the legendary scrap machine between characters. I found a perk point balance with him that let's me operate melee, shotgun, commando, heavy and bow on godlike levels. Of course hes only working with the perk loadouts mod.
---
Email Bethesda about it if you haven’t. They messed with the number of blood samples you need in that quest in patch 21 so they might actually have an answer for you.
---
Man, This was a joke, a common way to look at things in life. I wasn't going full Stalin, and you talking about woke reddit and down votes. I'm not posting for p or down votes. and you shouldn't either, people disagree and that's the whole point of thumbs up and thumbs down. I'm sure if i had made this joke on a libertarian sub i  would have gotten downvoted a lot. Seems like you are "fighting" imaginary "fights"
---
just tested it on mine and it worked as intended, must be a weird glitch, have you relogged to ensure its not just server related?
---
Fallout 1st to get fucked over
---
Its true open world maps, but with a very small player cap per world. I believe the player cap per map is something around 24 players for public servers. It is 8 players for private instances.
---
Cool I never really tried on maybe I'll respect my unarmed to a junkies biuld and try it out
---
same here.  there is enough angst posted here that i feel my first reaction should be to loot every extractor i find.
---
Yeah, we can build our own Vault.  With Blackjack and hookers!
---
expect it to update when the American West Coast starts normal business hours... so about 2 hours from now
---
I've met a number of 7-8 year olds.
---
Funny how RNG works... took me 27 queens to get one.
---
We're really grasping at straws now aren't we?
---
Those are excellent rewards for 250 steel.  My friends who have been playing since Wastelanders love it, they're getting tons of plans they don't have.
---
Great event.
---
My wife has had it done for a long time, cannot enter. My brother completed it a couple weeks ago, cannot enter. My son and I have completed it on other characters, but cannot enter.
---
I like the game too but calling it a "good" game is an insult to actually functioning video games.
---
While you don't get any more S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points after 50 the extra levels allow you yo fine tune your points and perks to maximize damage as well as extra play time which allows you to aquire better gear.
---
Not as a post, but [here it is](http://imgur.com/a/PP8x1w2)
---
oh another of these posts now :D
---
First of all Bethesda didn't actually put those mentioned features out as 'perks' like you stated but 'promises for the future', they didn't tell you you would get those immediately when you sub either. In the very post you linked is even a picture of the [actual perks](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/7zSViwcwXPdlhlqgDADRYM/a311ecf7731d4fdf4240d59baada7d27/Fallout76_Fallout1st_Benefits.jpg) included in the sub. Only because they said they would improve 1st worlds in the future doesn't mean "now"...or do you also complain to SpaceX why they haven't landed a human on mars yet despite them promising to do it in the future? The price may be very high, that was also criticised when it was released, but like others already said if you don't like it...nobody's holding a gun to your head forcing you to keep resubbing. Let it run out and ask Bethesda how far they've come with those features if they want you to resub but don't come here and demand features that were only promises, from Bethesda after all.
---
oh ok thx, they really need a protectron for this
---
Well, if I had an old car in a post apocalyptic world parked near my camp. It would more likely be a generator than a storage box if used at all. I mean, if I had to choose.
---
Shit, I've even used my car to charge my phone and other electronics when we lost power during a hurricane.
---
I know eh.. " Hmm.. I game I don't like gets semi okay reviews on steam!? Must be a conspiracy!"
---
Why would they ever release it like that?
---
Finally someone with the guts to help
---
Purely for the scrap box. I had it for the month I played the MQ and wastelanders then canceled it and I've never touched the games since.
---
it wont let me analyze it even though I loaded it in
---
It was a joke when they announced it and it's still a joke
---
Havent played in a few months.  What's going on now?
---
It certainly seems like they drop absurdly fast, but i spend very little time in PA.
---
Not sure about legacy weapon or not. It seemed like an explosive fixer.
---
It’s going to be embarrassing for them if we fail every one of the hand in challenges. I’ve donated 70k steel but I think I’m just going to sit on the sidelines now, grab some popcorn and hope we fail all of it.
---
Best thing I read today, great photo btw
---
I dont think you've paid attention in the BoS questline if you think Roger Maxson was more for confiscating tech than protecting civilians.
---
I had been dumping ammo for a while, so I get your pain. The whole thing should just be dump all of one type, but then it wouldn’t be a Bethesda game :/
---
I have and i haven't got a response
---
Hmm idk then.  Was just something I read in a different thread.  Best of luck but I have the feeling you might be waiting for a hotfix.
---
Sorry if I have many questions I just don't want to ruin the love I have for the fallout games, I usually play on the hardest difficulty on the fallout but not survival on 4, but is 76 "hard"? Like obtain ammo, resources, legendaries, power armour, armour in general etc, Anything i should avoid? I heard about the trade people do and take all your stuff
---
Easier said than done, especially when every other possible "goal" in endgame is just as grindy and time gated.
---
The grind isn't even the problem for most players here I believe, it's just the time gating. With the way Bethesda enforces the grind it just feels like daily chores instead of actual game play goals or content.
---
For instance I would sit down and grind the Mr fuzzy costume in a weekend if I could, but I definetly don't have endurance to login daily for 45+ days just to get it. It'd be half as bad if there was actual content to play while doing such grinds on the side, but there is not.
---
At a certain point all you do is login each day, do your chores, and log off again because there's nothing else to do anymore for the day. Either because you've done all your chores or because your daily limits have been reached and your stash is full with legendaries.
---
This is just bad game design, it reminds of mobile games and its obvious that Bethesda only does this to increase the traffic with the atom shop. It fits perfectly well with the unannounced rotation and limited time accesss of the shops content.
---
I have read this a couple times and I am right on the verge of understanding it, and I think it is important but I am lost. Can someone explain it to me like I am a feral ghoul please?
---
i wish leveling up wasn't always a daily.
---
100 levels by the end of this feels like too much
---
If the engine wasn't such a potato, this enemy would be the perfect event creature to fight on mounts or vehicles. A massive arthropod the size of a titanosaur spewing it's smaller kin from it's underside.
---
Another moose has joined the chat!
---
I think this explains why the current BOS event seems more geared for newer players. Bethesda is not as interested in keeping old players compared to gaining new ones.
---
Most games, unless it's horribly offensive will have more positive than negative reviews.   
---
Shocker, human beings enjoy liking stuff more than they enjoy hating stuff.
---
Maybe the translator thought it would be funny? l find the idea that Beth is once again bamboozling its players and got caught (again) rather amusing
---
The problem here is how would increased camp budget and build area translate into adventure mode. You talk about private worlds but the fact is that we never had real "private worlds". just private instances that are gone after we leave them so everything you mention except for the discounts are impossible to do right now anyway.
---
And to add to that there ARE discounts in the atom shop just for 1st players. They are just noch advertised at all for an unknown reason. There were a few posts about those in the past and they definitely reduced price for some things for premium players.
---
Hail Enclave !
---
Thanks! It's just I was really scared to play it when it first came out hearing all of the bugs and glitches but seeing all the updates and patches YT talk about seems like it would rather frustrating at the worst times and yes it looks so fun man 😂 all the new weapons and armour seems awesome to mess with
---
I think they meant the duffle bag with the collectors edition. 
---
Both seem to be the correct answer.
---
I dropped 2500 in, hopped up onto the donation case and then dropped every reward (except unknown Plans) I got, leaving a well stacked Vault Tec duffel for whoever came by next.
---
(I had already drained all the vendors for the day, and am sitting at 25k Caps)
---
Why keep your old players when you can just farm new ones Kappa
---
I haven't even been up there.
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
---
I totally get what you mean, but at the same time - You don't need every reward.   
---
There isn't really a point in the time limit if every reward can be casually gained, the stuff at the end of the run is meant to be for those folks who can sit down and dedicate the time to getting all their SCORE challenges done on time.
---
For new players. But what about those of us who have put, hmmmm, I dunno. Hundreds of dollars, sometime thousands? Those of us that have put in thousands of hours? Diluted reskinned Christmas presents are a real kick in the teeth to us veterans.
---
The game lacks content, has a very generic story, generic characters and no interesting fights or gameplay. If you like sandbox games you might like it, but if you're someone who actually wants things to do and can't 100% make your own fun you'd probably enjoy literally anything else more. None of your choices matter in the "story" and the endgame has no actual reward that isn't locked entirely behind RNG, so if you're someone who likes mastering a game you'll get bored when you realize getting good just means copying the same build as everyone else and hoping for a good drop.
---
The game is also barely functional and has had multiple bad bugs present since launch which haven't been fixed, so even on a technical level the game is a mess. It's a Bethesda game so they're usually buggy, but this time it has like 2 developers and they don't test anything. Every update something new gets added that has a huge flaw or bug that could've been solved if they just double checked their work, which they don't.
---
The game's world is pretty nice and it's fun to explore, but that's pretty much the only remotely interesting thing in the game.
---
TL;DR: Story sucks, gameplay sucks, characters are generic and suck, balancing sucks, zero variety in viable builds, ridiculously grindy due to the fact the only content has limits because it's easier to spread content out than make new content, but world is good. If you like touring maps and exploring play the game, if you want a game with actual gameplay play literally anything else.
---
Yeah I saw that, but favorites wheel, vats, and fast travel bug are things players use all the time to play the game and have been broken for a long time. How is that not a top priority?  Plus the rewards for this event are all junk, literally your junk is more useful then the present reskins. Half of the stuff they said they were implementing didn't get added. They're releasing broken paid skins. And maybe if they unbanned a bunch of the dupers without deleting items I would agree.  But how can you unban a bunch of the dupers without deleting items and then say that this was a top priority because it's a duping exploit. The problem is more so that their priorities are backasswards
---
what level are you? i just got to level 39 and started about a month ago.
---
nice gesture, better than those complaining about the rewards being useless. but i hear the vault-tec duffel is bugged and has a weird hitbox for looting it. if you do this again maybe use the normal bag skin, or any other skins you have
---
I think he/she is suggesting that you call your credit card company and tell them to reverse the charges and cancel the service that way. If the person didn't mean that, it's still a good way to go.
---
I thought outer worlds was fantastic but yeah, very short. I was happy to have companions again (!!!) and actual choices that impacted the world. I’m a big NV fan and had been missing that element in fo76.
---
Trying to get that sick PA skin. and i enjoy the mode
---
What is the difficulty compared to F4? I used to play survival but it was kinda bothering that I couldn't save when i wanted to so i played hard, but by seeing all the gameplay it looks kinda difficult, like seeing ammo being weighted and the diseases like Jesus I feel like ima struggle and end up getting frustrated with the game alot
---
Psssst.          
---
It’s all a dress up to show the “booming success” of Fo76 to investors.          
---
You think they added the legendary run for us?     
---
At the same time xbox gamepass opens the floodgates to thousands of new players. And I believe theres an upcoming convention?      
---
           
---
We are cattle on a farm. Moo.
---
Then it should be easy to add.
---
:surprised pikachu:
---
Are you on Xbox? I can let you onto my private server sometime if you want to farm without the risk of PVP.
---
Personally I found it really mediocre and kind of disingenuous considering how hard they pushed it as the 'Spiritual Sequel to New Vegas'. It doesn't come anywhere close to NV and even falls short of 3 and 4 in my opinion.   
---
That being said though, I don't regret buying it. No love lost really, just a bit disappointed, got to Tartarus and kind of just... Didn't feel the need to finish it, haven't gone back. Maybe the DLC will put me back on track.
---
Sry I'm at my dads what's the camp update please tell me
---
I suppose we will have better plans in the next steps. Farming steel is easy. what about cork...
---
Look at the zipper.
---
I would've loved to unlock that power armor but I just couldn't keep up with work + wanting to play other games. I stopped at around level 45 and don't feel like playing again for some time.
---
I had something similar happen on PC. Those numbers take a while to fully update, so sometimes patience fixes it. However, one time I did notice they took an abnormally long time to update and I took that as a cue to server hop.
---
It has an age restriction of 18 according to VSC rating board, and the image on the front of the game. Your argument is that anyone can play it but only over 18’s can buy it is absurd. The ratings are on there to advise on suitability of content, not on ability to purchase.
---
Hilarious 😂
---
I usually use Paratrooper, but I forgot it auto-equips when you get a new skin.
---
I'm a melee build, my FO1st one-month ended today, and I leave the Scrapper perk on. So I had over 5000 Steel, figured I'd give half to see if I could anything decent for a reward (I did not), so I just dropped what I did get in case anyone wanted to save their Steel.
---
Nice photo Mate 😉
---
What do you mean? the game engine is a senile Frankenstein at this point, it needs to be put down. I hope Fallout 5 will be on a new engine.
---
Problem with Fo76 i think is that Bethesda is way more excited about star-field or elder scrolls.
---
That's not what fascism means.
---
Haha this again. I wonder if this was a tongue-in-cheek joke
---
Mixed emotions about that!  Sad to see 2500 steel gone, but happy to hear of your generosity with the rewards.
---
Perk Loadouts anyone?
---
Imposter sheepsquatch
---
Lead Belly prevents rad gain from food/drink. Worth it for bloodied imo. But my two bloodied builds are both stealth, so i rarely have to worry about any other source or rads, unless i live bat gets too close.
---
When rads get to around 8.5%, chug a diluted radaway and it will bring you back up to 19 and change. For the rare death and respawning at 25%, i find a petrified scorched, break the body and sit in the rad cloud for a few moments to get back below 20%.
---
Though ive got enough experience and comfort with the build that i routinely let my HP sit below 10% for long periods of time.
---
It was half what I had in Stash, rarely use/need it.
---
Same and its worth it for that alone. Anything else is bonus.
---
Donating materials is pretty damn dumb. They could have made quest items just for this.(steel bundle, cork bundle, ect ect) We could be collecting these quest items and turning them in. It's not like this is a physical thing that's behind built. 
---
Or are there devs gonna come on and build this with a massive CAMP budget?
---
Hey, here's an idea; if your servers can be so easily lagged, how about you work on beefing up your servers so they can handle the load?
---
I donated 2k and didn't get any plans.  Such a joke.  Good luck with cork.
---
Theres quite a bit of opertunity to get score as it is, I dont play every day and im already around 70, so it seems somewhat fair, autocomplete aside
---
Its too big actually, it act like an object unlike the regular bag
---
Even though you can pay no dollars a month and still play the game everyday...
---
You can attempt to justify your terrible purchase to yourself all you want but it won’t work on intelligent shoppers.
---
Where do you track progress?
---
Hey there!  
---
I´ll help you out, craft some weapons and armor for you and give you some bullets and aid items. Also if you have any questions we can party and ill answer any questions you got. I'm in the GMT zone so 5 or 6 hours ahead of you. Add me gunnarkarlo
---
It will sell if you vendor it at a reasonable price.
---
They aren't going to revert or rollback anything 
---

---
Hurmmm, I still have it up in my quest log but it's been a long time since I did my dailies. Before the last update anyway. They made it so it couldn't be repeated multiple times a day, that could be the cause of it
---
I don't think breaking machines counts as "genocide," because every time I go on a bender at Chuck E Cheese, it's just "drunk and disorderly," not "genocide."
---
Atoms, Private server, Scrapbox - its worth it if you're like me and don't have a ton of time to play. between a full-time job, household to maintain etc. Has REALLY been helpful doing the Legendary Run now as well.
---
They always pick the worst times to make these jokes. Reminds me of the Watoga High lightbulb one.
---
where do you track progress?
---
Glad I finally got mine xD
---
I have never noticed this, just thought it was random robots
---
I used to have First, and transferred many items successfully using the private server method. Then one day I lost three middling weapons. A second account is as much or cheaper than a couple of months of First, so now all my transfers are face-to-face.
---
I know this is gonna sound really annoying, but just don't go into the Atomic Shop, don't buy it. You have to put up with a news screen when starting up the game that features atomic shop stuff sometimes, but it ain't that bad.   
---
As for the why in that they exist? They pay for the game's continued development and drip feed of free content like all the BOS junk we're getting later in the year. If they annoy you, don't engage with them, let the whales open their wallets and pay for the free content the rest of us get.   
---
Microtransactions aren't these coveted pieces of content that every player should be entitled to have, they're just meaningless side fluff so bethesda can sell pretty pixels to keep the developers paid. Let the whales whale and the rest of us can enjoy the fruits of their spending.
---
Preach brother. I love the game, but think about regretting losing out on SCORE if I don't feel like playing for a day.
---
Youre a jackass for trying to trash some new guys base because of something as utterly irrelevant as a board with spikey bits.
---
Oh, before the raiders..? How about before the game was released?

Not old man Maxson, the dick from fallout 4. Arthur? The one that advocated violence as the go-to response.
---
NOW WHO'S CLEARLY ON CHEMS?!
---
GO SLEEP IT OFF!
---
what are you even holding that much scrap for?
---
Ward keep mumbling 'I know you had your reasons' and bitching when I walk off.
---
Like wtf man.  I gave you half the gold.  Really takes away from the entire RP thing if my choices just spew any old voiceline.
---
Mmm it's still a feature they could implement in the future. If it fixed exploits then that's understandable, I believe this fixed the infinite camp budget exploits actually. But they could design walls that are automatically double-sided, so let's ask for that instead!
---
I guess what they mean is that Obsidian were involved in FO1, 2 and NV and those 3 are rightly held in very high regard by fans of the series. They weren't involved in FO3, 4 or 76, they were all by Bethesda with varied success.
---
Yes I feel ya, I just happened to give it a shot because I was out of other quests and was pleasantly surprised. Let us know if you were able to do it sans-assaultron!
---

---
The good news is that you will have about a month break. If you are at level 82, you will finish with just over 2 weeks to spare, so you will have even more time.
---
I tried menu relogging, I'll do a full restart and see if it works
---
Did 1k yesterday, gonna do some more. I want those BOS rewards and these kits are nice bonus
---
Same
---
Quick question ... what is generally considered fair vendor price for stable flux, masses, and high rad fluids?
---
If you are a regular player it's not as hard as you think. 1400 caps/day from the robots and whatever you make from your vendors adds up.
---
The double-sided walls aren't even the worst of what it's caused in my opinion but yea that seems to be the one that is the most easily rectified.
---
Thanks very much.  I'm the odd one that uses .44, 40mm, grenades,  missiles,  and mini nukes.
---
These ones are sentient though.
---
I started playing in July. Reluctantly. I didn't like the idea of multiplayer FO. I didn't like the idea of not having NPCs. But I love FO, so I figured I'd try it. I'm glad I did. The continued hate is undeserved. Is the game perfect? Far from it. But was it worth the subscription? Hell yes. Video games in general are a bargain when it comes to entertainment value per dollar. 
---
I played WoW for years. Raided for hours 3 nights a week. Did the dailies. Events. All the things. And FO76 is exactly the same thing. Some of the grinds are horrid. Some of the rewards are weak. But overall, it's still a hell of a lot of fun considering the cost of the subscription.
---
I don’t know. but somehow I never have the right materials to craft anything

[On Beths site here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Check the end of the latest Roadmap...
---
Orange man bad circle jerk in here because someone used the word "wall".
---
Thank you for taking the time to post this
---
I have one instance of it in my quest log in the completed section.   I totally understand not being able to do it several times a day.  But at least for me and my husband, it appears to just be broken since the patch.  I did just submit a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
Yep, I'm aware. But you can absolutely tell what the purpose was behind bringing that up - The timing, the abnormally long hold on the 'From the makers of Fallout: new Vegas' splash screen. 76 was at it's most hated, people wanted to fight it somehow, fight Bethesda. And Obsidian capitalized on it, took advantage of the nerd rage going on.   
---
Aaaaaand what we got was a pretty mediocre AA RPG that got flooded with 9 / 10 out of 10 reviews that it really didn't deserve because so many people wanted a way to 'fight' Bethesda.
---
Thank you, come again.
---
Infinite camp budget is the main reason they fixed it, they can't have people exploiting like that
---
Already planned just pushed back , I honestly dont mind waiting for sonthing that works rather than somthing that doesn't work but is pushed out too quick
---
I made another post after someone explained why they fixed it lol
---
Exactly! And quickly!
---
You may need to post at least 3 more threads about this. So they really understand.
---
with the enclave, my thoughts exactly. everyone trash talks the US Government and the Enclave is the reminiscence of said government so its a real mind boggler. sure they let you use Nukes but i mean isn't that a part of the problem to being with.
---
in all previous Fallout's if i could join the BoS i did it in a heart beat
---
But you can lose 10k caps because you can't alt-f4 fast enough when you're vending machine reaches max caps
---
I just wish I didnt need to get out my PA to use it.
---
Apparently if your wearing PA, your guy thinks he's supposed to hug the bottom of it.
---
Yeah man i look forward to it, enjoyed my time but the “devs” working on this game have no passion or interest in it and certainly don’t play it.
---

---
Well they didn't do a very good job..    FeelsBadMan
---
I spent more time fixing my camp up yesterday evening than anything else, cause of the shoddy patches and ongoing issues.
---
Probably spent an hour actually on quests and exploring and two-three fixing camp.
---
I totally forgot about any challenges until somehow I triggered a few rewards :-/
---
This one is literally the only one worth completing because it has functional value...
---
Nope I have received many
---
It could cause a huge leap in player power, assuming the robots were powerful enough to be of any use.
---
I think you need some kneepads
---
If you consider random encounters canon, the tardis does exist in the fallout universe
---
You and me both
---
Doch.
---
The junk left your inventory because it moved to your scrapbox. That's what that thing does. It doesn't give you junk, it lets you store your junk.
---
DMV, Whitesprings, Westek.  Re-log, Repeat.
---
Ok we'll just bitch and moan on reddit that can work too i guess.
---
I did that one yesterday, however i rarely go anywhere near Fort Defiance. It always triggers for me when i fast travel to the Watoga train station, as the fissure site you get marked on the map is nearby. Maybe try server hopping there? Might also be a good idea to clear some other dailies beforehand, the game has a limit on how many dailies you receive on every reset (the only ones that are guaranteed to show up every day are the repeatable ones)
---
Since you need a skin for it, at least they're profiting lol
---
LMAO nice xD
---
It's Bethesda so I'd expect September for the next update
---
That's entirely too low.
---
This is a non-event as far as im concerned. Donation rewards are literal trash items, and the end of event rewards are things i at least couldnt care less about. Even if the end rewards were given away freely for donating a single steel, i wouldnt use them for anything.
---
So im sitting this one out.
---
Look at [Mappalachia](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia) for locations of stuff, including flux
---
Forgot a couple more things
---
- Fire the entire QA team, and hire a competent one, better still... enable public beta servers across all platforms and let the actual players QA it for you
---
- Fix all bugs before releasing new content
---
Guys its not just working. Tried on another computer and its still the same.
---
What is? The reward or the amount of resources?
---
I feel you. I have already accepted I'm not getting all the seasonal rewards, I have my plushie and starry wallpaper and I'm happy with that. Not gonna grind and definitely not gonna pop into NW asi I don't like battle royales and refuse to suffer for S.C.O.R.E. Spending real money is out of the question in the current situation.
---
It helped that the first major reward I was looking up for was such a disappointment (ammo converter obv).
---
Wouldn’t the opposite of bloodied be Vanguards?
---
Oh, I see. I only recently got fallout 1st so I guess I was used to it staying in my inventory.
---
["I bet you're the kind of guy to fuck a person in the ass, and not even have the god damn common courtesy to give him a reach around."](https://youtu.be/P2vkiLHiTcY)
---
RIP.
---
nah, they enter it manually once a day.
---
You're traveling to regions that you're not strong enough for yet.
---
Came in a atom buy bundle, like the piper outfit that still might be in there now. Was only around for a few days or a week.
---
Amount of resources. I've donated triple that already and I've only been on for like an hour and a half. 
---
Scrapper makes this insanely easy.
---
These where sent to me from another member but I can only imagine that he meant maybe like a damage boost with full health??
---
I’m not worried about getting to SCORE level 100.    Most days I can log on for an hour and get my dallies done.   I’ll even do the NW ones if they are easy (like place a camp or survive for 10 mins)
---
In the past I’ve missed out on items because I did not grind for them like several of the mole miner pail rewards.  It’s not a big deal to me.   
---
If you don’t want to play every day then don’t!   If the game is not fun for you , then don’t play.  
---
Having said that I would like them to reduce the grind on some thing like the ally reputation.  It’s boring doing the same quests over and over again! 
---
Ps:   A shout out to all the nice players I have met!     Also thanks for shopping at my camp!
---
MODUS was kind of irritated that they never integrated him into the Nuclear silo control system too.  I just finished that part of the main quest on an alt so I just saw that again.
---
Yeah now its only the piper one which looks very bad
---
Do you have stutters on all your characters? Game can stutter like crazy on a characters with lots of items in inventory.
---
Ash heap is level 20+. And all of the ones I’m fighting are my same level. (21)
---
The devs don't care about us either.  Even if something is thrown their way they just banned everyone that actually played and was bored af at end game.  Oh pick up 100k ammo.  Ban.  Dupe some weapons people sell for insane prices on gameflip.  Ban.  Have billions of presents and guns and junk duped on an alt?  Oh your cool bro heres your slap on the wrist.
---
Np!  I have done it so many times =)
---
No, that one has only showed up in the Atom Shop once, and then only in a bundle with an atom purchase.
---
r/fo76 I have tried everything on my side. But the game doesnt let me in the cave. I installed the game on my other computer and still the same. I send ticket to the bathesda and they still sending me the "Trouble shouting prosedure" thing. They didnt even looked at my video in the mail. I already told them im playing this gam on pc in my mails. But they still sending me the xbox and playstation trouble shouting prosedure chart. Please guys help me out this. No one cares about this i know but i cannot earn any gold bullions on events. Please help me out. Thanks..
---
lmao you wasted 250k steel, you are a moron
---
Sneak for 2x damage.  Headshots for 2x more damage.
---
"Clear the stored CAMP budget" function :)
---
Yeah, it's really terrible even in solo world with a fresh character.
---
Super cool as usual!
---
Given their performance of late, any attempt to fix this issue will simply give each of the reports a 15lb weight - and they will still be stuck in our inventories. Were probably safer if they dont mess with it.
---
Since I'm never in first person I don't think this is the case. I never use first person in adventure or NW mode with the exception of eating hotdogs at camden park.
---
A single Assault Rifle with Scrapper is 20 Steel. I get insane amounts of Steel from tagging and looting everything in Uranium fever.
---
Excavator doesn't work on Ultracite.
---
Hey it's a good post with everything what the community wants and exactly therefore Bethesda is not going to reply on that...
---
Oh that masked sense. My only other suggestion is maybe Junkie’s? But I feel like you could argue a slew of damage boosts for full-health builds
---
If you are stickler for story and complicated problem-solving quests with multiple endings depending on your choices, then it's true, the story and quests are thin in this game.
---
If, like me, your primary joy in a Fallout game is creep in around a wasteland picking up garbage and luring mirelurks over landmines, then it delivers.  There's a big world explore, it's not exactly like other Fallout regions but it's recognizably the same setting we love, and it has some new elements that are fun to play with.  I actually enjoy the stash limit and pay-to-fast-travel limitations.  It presents an extra challenge; you have to maintain a consciousness of which resources you need more of, even at higher levels.  In FO4, you hunt for junk early in the game, but after 10 levels of clearing an area, and then mercilessly cleaning it of all junk in 2 or three trips, using fast travel to hop back and forth, you pretty much stop worrying about junk because you have a huge stockpile.  Limiting the stash means resource management stays a part of the game.
---
Never dont nuke all the things.
---
It's really kind of muddy. You technically become a General in the US Armed Forces. Then you get an Enclave Officer Uniform, but you aren't really aren't a General in any Enclave military system. The MODUS system and the launch silos aren't integrated, and the problem is that you have to become a General in the US armed forces to access them. The Enclave isn't actually part of the official/public US military system, rather a hidden sect that was secretly planning on running the world after what they saw as an upcoming apocalypse.
---
I think at some point everyone needs to realize these games are traps, designed to get you to spend all of your time and money here and not elsewhere. I think when you decide to put your attention where you want to rather than where they tell you too, you'll start having fun again. There's nothing in the season rewards that's worth grinding your life away.
---
I really wish they would just let us select ammo types, and then take the most it can by the set quantity that we have of each selected type.
---
Or, you know, let us just scrap ammo at the tinker bench for the base components.
---
These days when people leave they just abandon projects instead of fixing them. 😔
---
Downvoting system on Reddit is something indeed.
---
Yep, I would never do the yearly sub for any game for this reason. Maybe it’s a miracle and I play the whole year and I end up spending a couple extra bucks by going mtm. But I probably don’t play the whole year and save a lot more.
---
Blizzard was destroyed by the expectations of its fans. Bethesda is being destroyed by itself.
---
Yh I think everyone would jump ship for a high health high damage build , there would have to be a downside somewhere
---
Are you seriously trying to tell me that my opinion of it being a good purchase is wrong?
---
What are you some kind of purchase nazi?
---
 14$ a month means nothing to me I'm sorry you're such a broke ass.
---
I also tried to change the iPresentInterval= from (1) to (0), and the games feels a bit better. But still problems with stuttering.
---
yep of course the fanboys gotta do thier thing and downvote hate on actualy problems with the game. bunch of sweaty basement nerds. if we dont call this shit out how willl it ever get fixed
---
Think of it as a compounding revenue stream. Say you buy a serum recipe for 20,000 caps.  You have to sell 40 serums at 500 caps to buy the next recipe. Now you are selling two serums, and you only have to sell 20/each for the next recipe.
---
Do you really believe that people take those ratings seriously? If so, why are there so many kids playing CoD and Apex and any number of massively violent titles? The age limit is there to discourage kids from getting their hands on it true, but it doesn't work in practice. Parents either don't care or aren't even aware of the rating, or sometimes it's not even enforced at the retailer. Kids are playing these games, and game companies know it.
---
Same thing happened with warframe and its Nightwave system. In the end the devs triplicated the duration of the season so people could earn everything and not feel hostage of the game.
---
I mean if you bought the game 2x, paid for fallout 1st for a few months and dropped hundreds in atoms they already got everything they wanted from you. 
---
You were the best possible scenario and all they have to do is hook more people like you (and me) for a couple months before we see too many bugs to keep playing. 
---
This is why this financial model works and why its perpetuated throughout gaming now. To the detriment of the games themselves.
---
I wanted the firefly jar too thinking it would give my rooms a nice glow. It barely lights up.
---
Perks, perks, perks. You'll need some Rifleman/Gladiator/Shotgunner/Archer/etc to compliment the weapons you're using and boost their damage.
---
Also, mod your weapons, a number of Receivers increase the damage output, and some Magazines give armor penetration.
---
Gotta play to the audience 🤣
---
There are such things as objectively bad purchases whether you want to admit it or not is your call. A fool and his money.
---
If you don't think it's a good game, and I clearly noted it had issues, then why do you play it? Plenty of other options out there.
---
To everyone saying they are gonna take a break after they reach 100, you know theyre gonna do the same thing next season, right? You get to do more of the same then. Why would you continue to punish yourself like that?
---
That would be SUPER helpful !!!!!!
---
Nothing got nerfed recently.   
---
explosive harpoon guns ( and railway rifles I think also) are legacy now.  
---
I would do the gold bullion missions first (the wayward missions are not needed for the gold bullion system). As said here, do as much with both factions as you can. This means only really choose a faction when you have both the quests 'Siding with Crater' and 'Siding with foundation'. There are two unique things you should pick up during these questlines (slug buster and steel mill T51b helmet) by doing a little detour. They aren't top tier but if you are an avid collector, you might want to look it up beforehand so you don't rush past them.  
---
Once you have done it (5.5 hours if you rush through them), you'll get treasury notes from public events, which you can turn it for gold bullion. So until you have completed the bullion quest, you're missing out on treasury notes. That is why I would do it first.
---
I hope you reach those straws you're grasping for, dude.
---
I think you need to be level 30 just to be able to start the Faction quests, the Overseer tells you you're not ready until you hit that point.
---
OK, well then good luck.
---
you can remove your card the day before it comes out and they cannot charge you. the sub will end. But ending subs on ps4 is really easy to do from the subscription menu you can even do  it in a browser.
---
They have similar names. One adds new junk to your inventory, the other scraps junk you're carrying and puts it in your scrapbox.
---
It really isn’t any different than what they do now to camp and be stealthy:
---
- using the ghillie suit and headpiece 
---
- using chameleon serum/mutation
---
- using wood armor to blend in 
---
- using camo or tactical ops under armor 
---
- hiding in bushes, water, trees, tree stumps
---
- hiding in porta potties, or placing down porta potties or trees/bushes 
---
- hiding in secret rooms or the roof slats like the cabins in the Morgantown roof 
---
- hiding under the map, using soft spots to hide and glitching into buildings you’re not supposed to get into.
---
No idea why this bothers you so much if people want to use the ghillie armors. If people want to use them, let them. And stealth is a survival tactic, used by passive and aggressive players alike. The goal is to survive and win, and if that helps them do it, cool awesome. It really isn’t an issue. What is an issue is saying it’s bad by making camping worse and that it makes stealth easier lmfaoo.
---
Circuits is my main one. Used to repair turrets. I pick up every telephone I come across.
---
r/angryupvote
---
I make sure to "passively" farm Ultracite.  If I'm going to fast travel anywhere and there's a fissure within reasonable distance of the line of travel, I go to the fissure instead, mine it out, and travel on.  I don't ever make it a destination on it's own, but I collect plenty.
---
Another would be sort out the long ass freeze when scrapping a stored build  :/ 
---
I've scrapped the stored blueprint for a building before now , went outside for a cigarette for 4/5 mins and still been on the freeze when I got back 🤣
---
Not *finding* them so much, but you can buy them all from Phoenix, the BoS vendorbot in Watoga.
---
He sells all the t45 and t51 PA plans too.
---
But what about all the French Schoolgirls out there?!
---
What will they do without their little red hats.
---
I love fallout. I will play through the updates until I get bored of exploring and building my camp and my build. Honestly the Season thing is good for me, no complaints there. But I find plenty of things to do each day, and I just don’t do the things I don’t want to do. For example, I’m not interested the reputation grind so I just haven’t continued to do those dailies. I will say one thing: I don’t appreciate being guilted into doing an event I don’t want to do, like they’re doing with the “community goals” of project alpha. If I don’t want to acquire and donate a metric fuckton of steel then I shouldn’t have to? That’s all.
---
Closest ive noticed is people buying individual bullets for the daily, which at 1 cap per and that cap being removed because Todd says so, means I don't get paid, I don't care about the cap but thats the closest thing to "stealing" I've noticed
---
It's not that great from you either, to be fair.
---
Some times this doesn't work. But if you set a stopwatch for like 90 seconds upon log out, that sometimes helps.
---
Photo Op - Overseer's House
---
Vital Equipment - Foundation
---
Importance of Communication/Retirement Plan - Crater
---
Chow Line/Lucky Mucker/Dross Toss - Ash Heap/somewhat close to Camden Park
---
Cop a Squatter - Cranberry Bog/somewhat close to Watoga
---
At least that's from my experience. I think there's a number of them like that.
---
Did you recently uninstall/upgrade your GPU drive by chance?
---
" dont you have someone to test your patches?"  
---
They do, but it's other players who do so in their free time so it's not going to be thorough.  On top of that they don't even put all of the new stuff on the PTS for players to test.
---
Developers testing their patches themselves is sooo last decade.  Why pay employees to do it when you can make your customers do it for free HaHaThink.
---
first step for the bullion missions is to go to the overseer's house btw
---
Lol... thats... wow..  it tempts me to try it out... 
---
What have you done to me?
---
I equipped from the pipboy. I had just purchased it from a player earlier in the day, I hadn’t even used it yet so it wasn’t on my wheel
---
Seems to be doing it's job as you dropped from 197 down to 180 weight and the junk items were moved to your stash.
---
Have a look at the camo SS jet pack too - it currently thinks it’s a T65 arm mod!
---
:O
---
I feel like it's level 20 to start it. Idk for sure though haha
---
yes, then we'd also have an actual mule again to carry your stuff
---
The Raider and Settler quests are the same way. When you arrive in one of the five regions, it usually triggers the daily quests in that region. For example, when you visit the Purveyor, the Camden Park daily will trigger. When you go to the Mire, the Berkeley babysitter will trigger.
---
I honestly feel like Bethesda simply can't come out and say "sorry gamers, you didn't deliver enough junk and thus you now won't get the main reward."
---
Imagine how that will make all those people, who are actually grinding thousands and thousands of scrap, feel. You'll have to be content with the 10000 boxes full of booze and a few recipes you already knew. Sorry. No beret for you. Imagine the backlash from that. It doesn't take a huge portion of the playerbase to be pissed off because they worked seemingly for nothing, to once again make Bethesda take a dive in the poop pool.
---
And, after the steel one fails, does anyone think people are actually going to work to get the other ones done? It's doubtful, right?
---
Personally, I made 10 donations, just to see what it's like, and for my 2500 steel, I got a few beer bottles, so knowing my luck, and how likely it is that I will get absolutely nothing useful from those actual boxes, I don't think I'll be donating any more. Mainly because I donated most of what I had, and I definitely don't feel like doing extra chores just to get a hat.
---
I feel like the donations themselves should be worthwhile for what you get from the boxes (which, quite frankly, they aren't right now), and *regardless* of how much stuff total we donate, that "reward" at the end should be given to us, just as a kind of a celebratory mile marker, and nothing else.
---
I mean look, does it make sense to anyone that the community donates 124 million 985 thousand and 432 steel, and thus won't get the beret, because the goal was 125 million? That makes no sense to me. What a punishment that would be. But then again, can we even see the donation totals anywhere?
---
Yeah, it seems like this event is somewhat badly thought out, and might need some tweaking.
---
I wonder the same thing...Camden park dailies don’t trigger until I travel to the Ashe heap. Buried with honor, seems to trigger when it wants to. They’re inconsistent it you ask me, but maybe I’ve just never noticed.
---
Pretty much all of them have to be triggered by a location.
---
The transaction has to clear the bank before they assign the atoms. Takes a couple days past the billing.
---
I’ve actually been enjoying this, log in for an hour a day do the daily stuff and polish off the weekly along the way. Keeps my legendary scrip topped up too!
---
It was actually broken for me on two of my characters last night. For some reason it was working just fine on one, but on the other two I noticed it in their carry weight. Both of which normally show a capacity of 450 were only showing 380. Unequipped and re-equipped class freak and it was fixed. 
---
So for those who are only experiencing a visual glitch, or those who are experiencing an actual glitch, there’s a glitch that needs to be fixed.
---
If you're on XBox, use XBox Live's "Looking For Group" - it'll fill.
---
Yeesh... the punctuation on this one. Talk about needing quality control!
---
No, most of them they are triggered by the region, up until now only Photo Opportunity, Vital Equipment and the 2 from Crater are specific locations triggered
---
I miss the days when game devs made games, instead of slaving away at whatever scam marketing and sales execs who've never played a game in their life demand.
---
Are you playing on steam? I have this problem at times, if I bring up the overlay and then alt-tab out to the desktop. I fix it by trying to bring up the overlay again. works after that.
---
It was a pump action, no skin, I think 40% more bash and +1 to endurance if I remember correctly. Just put a silencer, new stock, long barrel on it
---
first time I've seen this mentioned, and it definitely is game breaking. The only fix for me is changing views and unscoping. Can't do that every two seconds in a fight...
---
I'm on PC :(
---
What about people that can play every day?
---
I need to find some more as the 40 I already have is useless now as I can't turn it in
---
Yeah I know, guess we have to wait for better options. Thanks to them not actually solving the problem lol
---
How much is ultracite scrap worth selling it in my vendors?
---
This post may interest you.

Is fuel still mislabeled as 10mm in the energy category?
---
I run Encryptid a few times a day, when I have the caps. I prefer to do it solo, because other folks usually screw up the event.

ITA I'm only using it for my death loot bag for that reason, lol

I just used my salary of 4 hours and bought the levels i had left. No regrets.
---
I picked it up last night on two differeant characters, south of the Abandoned bog town.
---
You arent guarenteed to get Heart of the enemy on every server, it rotates with cop a squatter I think.
---
So if you dont pick it up when you fast travel, server hop to a new server and you might pick it up.
---
I deleted BEFORE the patch and boy-- do i feel great right now! I'm just sitting here laughing at the reddit on fire.   
---
they aren't going to learn, you better learn instead.
---
Genius. And it’s going to haunt me all day why I never thought of it before.

I like to claim workshops after someone leaves and scrap all their stuff

by the holy nuka quantum, please stop giving these unethical bastards money
---
it his 2nd post.
---
YOU are literally on every post on this sub, sucking bethesda to the bones, AND YOU SAY THAT ! get a life it's gringe. really.
---
In one day you commented more than 100+ times (i lost counting after 100), IN ONE DAY.
---
JUST TO SUCKING THEM. it's really crazy.
---
I want something like this. Even if it was an event. Just the idea of a swarm of radroaches attacking followed by the gargantuan roach has me excited, first thing that popped in my head after reading the post.
---
👏👏👏
---
We wish
---
Me too. It's summer here and in Canada, you ENJOY summer cause damn our winters can suck (I am working fulltime too)... I feel so burnt out having to grind this out because damnit i want those last couple of items. Yes, I know I could drop atoms but I grinded hard to get those too and they are so rare now... I got level 75 yesterday and man I can't wait to break.
---
I cancelled FO1st yesterday and I'm taking a break for awhile.
---
The score thing is boring to me and just want some new stuff to do. I was waiting for the Wendigo event and maybe meat week.
---
I'm just tired of paying for nothing new and poor updates.  I started playing Borderlands 3 again and have some new DLC to try out.
---
What? You really think they have that much faith in this game? It seems more like they’re trying to rid their hand of it so they can get Bethesda Austin to do something else. If the main studio was working on it it would be more believable but they’re not. The main studio can and most likely will make a new Fallout game after ESO 6.
---
Bethesda, I hear your statement about the building exploits,  however there are several other bugs that need to be addressed that actually effects CURRENT gameplay that have been ignored which is what people are so up in arms about.  PLEASE HEAR US!!!!!!!!!!!
---
My wife, a very casual player stopped playing cause she wasn't able to continue her CAMP build the way it was going.  If this update is forcing the most casual of player to stop playing,  imagine what I will do to the newer player base that Xbox game pass will do...  
---
Again,  PLEASE HEAR US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
It’s useless in PvP
---
Oh enjoy, I really enjoy OW. Looking forward to the DLC.
---
One of the Mothman Cult locations, the big house with the tree fort in the top of it, has an assload of decanters.  Clancy Manor?
---
The hit box, as I have painfully discovered, is located on one side of the bag, and only the very end of it.
---
The Lode Bearing issue. Does it only happen to you there? Lucky Hole do it to you also? I don't know if event based pick ups are under the 20hr reset. But if you were able to reloot the same ore nodes over and over before 20hrs. That was the bug. The fix is not being able to. 
---
Headless ghoul is a connectivity issue. Or you showing up to an area before they can spawn in proper due to people farming and server hopping.
---
Your unstable lag spikes, care to expand on this on further? I get these from Whitesprings (its a cabin with ginseng root in it) so severe it bluescreens me. Whitesprings again when there are more than 1 camp on the golf course. Most players camps who have more than what they show be budgeted. The latter is so bad I stopped visiting camps. And play primarily on private.

The other things you mentioned I cannot comment on. But I hope this is informative and helpful. I got 1300hrs in this game and those are my only issues I have ever encountered.
---
You'd think that the elements of Zenimax and Bethesda who were trying to milk these games for profits would want to test them to ensure they're working and effective in order to get the maximum returns for their efforts. You're going to make more money from something that works and has a great reputation as doing so, than you will from something that's consistently broken.
---
Absolutely. 
---
Mark Twain once brilliantly summarized it:
---
"Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do."
---
Playing Fallout 76 shouldn't be a job, it's a game, for God's sake.
---
I see, something else must be bogging down my weight. It just confused me since the scrap remained in inventory before I had access to a scrapbox.
---
That was an important fix,yeah!
---
Thank you!  I do have a cop a squatter in progress.   I will clear that and see if heart of the Enemy starts.
---
Sounds like you need to get some weapon perks. Shotgunner, Rifleman, etc. Stack those to increase your damage. I use a combat shotgun, which I've been using and upgrading through the entirety of the game. I'm level 68 now and I still use it. I have all the shotgun perks and I burn through most enemies with little issue.
---
What happens to my camp when I switch from a Bigger Camp budget to a small camp budget?
---
God. Yes. I was playing Project Paradise last night and it shat itself royally. It went close to 8 bit it was that bad. Radiation Rumble shit the bed too this morning. I have an Nvidia card and newish is PC running on ultra. New update maybe?
---
I want to know which shady character you got over 1000 bog maps from :o
---
Excuse me mr.grammar police!,english is not my native language.
---
Are you on PC? If so, I could help you. I usually get the pylons.
---
As a nearly exclusively PC gamer, I can tell you that gaming laptops are a sham. The PS4 is probably so cheap at this point that you're better getting a dedicated work laptop and a console. Plus you don't want to be putting to much stress on a PC you're using for work/school, you don't want to put yourself in a bind if it overheats and needs fixing when you have a report due in 4 hours. 
---
That said, I'm not a console gamer myself. So I'm just curious, why not focus on your school work for now and wait until the PS5 launches? Isn't it 100% backward compatible or something?
---
I pointed this out in one of my other 100+ posts, and it seems important to point out now:
---
Being anti-stupidity does not make me pro-Bethesda. Those are two completely separate concepts. I'm not sure if your pathetic attempts at gaslighting work on other people, but they sure won't work on me.
---
Man just log off the internet for a while you sour weirdo.
---
There is a lot of negativity in this sub.
---
Thats what I thought would have happened,I was not expecting to see my turret ring with a few spaced in the wall gaps and on the roof of the porch after a couple months
---
There still isn't really any tangible goal, except grinding for gear and trading says gear for some better gear. Sure, they've added more ways to get more gear, but the way they did that really just surfaces new questions and frustrations. 
---
I mean sure, I guess it makes sense(?) to have to grind the game for a month to be allowed to gamble yourself to the legendary modifiers you want on the new weapons and armor, but then they go ahead and say "nyaah, you can't trade them though."
---
WHY?
---
Bethesda: *shrugs
---
What wastelanders does is basically to separate the main goals halves from each other, essentially making the game partially pointless.
---
(Bethesda, if you're reading: Don't worry, you don't have to change that for all I care. I don't see myself playing for a lot longer.)
---
Nope just like the idea of a harmless joke that might make people laugh.
---
and you are not PAID. THEY ARE !!
---
I quit a month ago
---
Is it only the bog? Thought it was everywhere but the forest. I had about 400 for the bog, the rest are spread everywhere but the forest.
---
I've put in 1.1k+ hours and also buy them when ever i find them for less than 100c. They have piled up to say the least
---
Please don’t improve the rewards. I don’t care to grind this event and I don’t want to have FOMO.
---
Learned a ton, but didn't get the ultracite gatling laser plan yet....
---
I used to play every day trying to earn a few atoms here and there on the challenges. Not really liking this new direction. Seems like every time we take one step forward we take two back.
---
Long live the snakes....when they arw formed in 200 years 
---
I'm cool with it though. At least they are a Vault faction
---
Let me double check I could be wrong
---
Yep. Icon is missing, but it still works.
---
I know its easy but anytime i try through the ps it says error. And my phone never lets me sign into psn on the browser.
---
Well you don’t have to, you could just donate every once and a while to see what you get and be done with it.
---
Yes, he said that, thx tho
---
I was trying to do the 3* legendary daily, and no one was around. A 3* gutsy showed up, I killed it, and got neither credit for the legendary or a 3* legendary. Shit is broken! But later I did another quest and a level 4 3* legendary event enemy counted for my 3* requirement. So weird.
---
Look, I wanted to play Fallout without some shit emoji or d-bag high level running around ruining my game play. I wanted single player.
---
I have the disposable income, so I signed up so I could play alone. It's been great until I had only the SBQ quest left and I just can't solo her yet.
---
The originally advertised perks were bonuses that pushed me over. I want my permanent shops so I can pretend I rebuilt Appalachia. I paid for it, so giff plz.
---
Lol happy cake day
---
I do think it being a stash is an odd choice but i get it though. You just supposedly cram items inside the car. I do feel it would have been better as just a decoration with no functionality, although your suggestion is quite ingenious. I would not mind something like that to be added. I kinda hope they add different version of wrecked cars to build.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I want proof. What specifically does blocking us from running a wall through a door stop, that's so damn breaking that it has to be stopped.
---
You guys need to realize that there will \*always\* be bad actors and there is NO SYSTEM YOU CAN DEVISE that will completely thwart them. Shackling people who are not trying to be jerks is not the answer.
---
Floating camps are still possible.  The Staircase/Post blueprint bug is alive and well, and it's far more serious than anything we've been using.
---
Why are't you fixing things that are broken in camps?  Conduits can't be attached to ceilings as they were in Fallout 4 Automatron, making them almost COMPLETELY USELESS.
---
The foundation wall block I've used to make large concrete walls. I was overjoyed to get a corresponding wallpaper recently, but the same needs to be available as an exterior structure. I grew up in Appalachia, unadorned cinder block houses are fairly common even now cause a lot of folks can't afford siding.
---
What about the fact almost none of the terrain is level? On more than one occasion I've carefully put one foundation block under another when I should be able to just stack the damn things so that they do match up. 
---
If you guys really cared you would at least get the UI to work. I don't know how many times I've been able to place structures that had red outlines or, far worse, have a structure with a green outline refuse to place. Simple errors like that scream to me that you guys don't really care.
---
yes. it doesnt pop up every day like some other daily quests.
---
Script gain and cap needs a huge buff. 150 daily legendary scrap is not enough.
---
My most useful was nukashine that I hadn't encountered yet. That unexpected vacation was nice, wish it was roundtrip tho
---
Sorry I worded that badly. You can have cop a squatter and heart of the enemey in your quest list at the same time, but you wont get both dailies in the same session and server.
---
Ie. If you dont have either quest, and enter the cranberry bog, you will get one or the other, but will only get the one daily unless you server hop, than once you server have a chance of getting the other, if its being given on the new server you enter
---
though that's the thing these suits don't seem to get and instead just try to milk the franchise 'Fallout' itself while completely destroying its name in the process.
---
I had a murder bot in that game that was more dangerous than I was, had to stop using it because it trivialized the game
---
You dont matter, two 13 year olds will replace you instantly now. You guys had the chance to make the game better and you didnt. You complacently ate it up, now this is the result.
---
Damn well that'll bring my map count way down lol. Guess I leave the other ones alone, or try to sell them and buy different ones lol
---
Edit, thank you for the info! Youve saved me some time haha
---
It was a limited time offer for BE3 2019. 
---
[Here are the details.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2wU959pkgw2VOsCMPZSpCg/celebrate-be3-2019-with-the-e3-atom-bonus-bundle) 
---
It’s a really sweet outfit; perhaps they’ll bring it back one day, or a variant of some sort. 
---
Same thing with the Mechanist and Pint-Sized Slasher. Limited time Atom Bundles.
---
And what's even more hilarious is for me it doesnt work.
---
All hail King Midas, awsome 👍
---
I doubt people will want to donate 1000 steel for a chance of getting a crappy legendary and considering that the pool is open to every item being a legendary there’s over 200 possibilities of getting a crappy item.
---
Thanks for the Advice, i´m acctually not a young collage student. im 27 and going back to school. have had great jobs and have no problem with work - life balance. I´m doing my first year in a relatively small town with not much to do so id like to have something i can do once im finished with my day.
---
Yeah I plan to pop in at least to see the sight. I was also half joking.
---
I dont see the probem here, purge the mutants, and let not the synth live.
---
I feel the same. It's a damn chore I don't wanna do anymore. Especially since I just started The Witcher 3 for the first time and I much prefer playing that.
---
You would be surprised to find out how even nowadays cars work!
---
but yeah i have heard so about the gaming laptops.  just wondering if anyone here has experience with them.
---
If you can, Float up with a jetpack and stand on it. For some reason that fixes the floating boxes when they happen.
---
They haven’t even fixed the gold handmade skin after so many updates. Even if they make one for the fixer in 12 months I predict it will be just as f’d up.
---
\+Its not about your pc or your files. We checked all the trouble shouting steps and it still the same.
---
No problemo.  That spreadsheet is an awesome tool made by the community.
---
In a way it’s kind of the same thing.   Since there isn’t much point to playing more than 1hr a day which is how long it takes to max your score and do a few events/west-tek for levels.  
---
But I also would much prefer to be allowed to play &amp; grind for 4hrs one day without a cap.  Then ignore the game for days without worrying about missing out on gold/scrip/tokens/reputation/caps
---
Cancel it... I don’t understand . I had it for two months and realized Bethesda is full of shit. You’re getting ripped off and are waiting for them to actually come through.  Sorry to break this too you. They won’t
---
Where exactly at the palace are they?  I comb that place yesterday and didn't see any ash rose.
---
No kidding - besides the community "rewards" none of the event rewards mean anything to me at all. 
---
The resources are far more valuable to me, than to put them into a black hole.
---
I personally sell stable Flux for 100 and Ultracite scrap for 20.  I've seen different prices though.
---
Scrip definitely needs to happen above all else. But every day that I get 300 scrip worth of supplies, it’s followed by a legendary desert. I’d just like more consistency
---
:) Awesome!
---
If there's no difficulty to it than there's no point to it.
---
Thiccer than a snickers
---
Was just sharing you are not alone as I have only experienced that during that event, tis all
---
Definitely. Will be saving it haha
---
Thank you very much.
---
Damn, maybe I'm the only one who actually enjoys them and is the reason I came back to fallout after almost a year off... I enjoy the grind, but I did grow up on MMORPGs so maybe that has something to do with it?
---
That is till better, than having the backpacks go inside your characters backs and shoulders.
---
Shit I've been caught!
---
i said to you to STOP what you do. it's absolutly not " pathetic attempts at gaslighting ". YOU ARE PATHETIC. AND you "gaslighting" just take a look to your entire lasts 100+ posts.
---
you pass your entire time to defend a BAD company and shaming others when they don't think like you, nothing more. it's wierd. very wierd. i hope you are like 12 and your father works for them or something like that because if not...
---
YOU ARE REALLY WIERD!
---
Ah thanks for the heads up! 😁
---
Honestly the daily challenges does not take long time. I used 30 min to complete them all. Maybe it sometimes take a little longer, but honestly just drop the hard ones that you only get 250 from haha
---
I doubt it would be different if they changed.  Instead of people logging in for 1hr every day.  People would play 1-3 times a week for 3-8 hours per pop.  There would be natural stagger.  And they’d probably have better stats of players on hours spent.  And people would be more willing to drop money in FO1 and atoms shop stuff knowing they get to play with it more.
---
Im amazed people still play this game let alone give more money
---
Bloody junkie hybrid?
---
You do realize that almost as soon as FO1st was launched, they changed what we would get. The items you get are the current things listed on the FO1st page, not the old stuff. 
---
Companies change things all the time. You either live with it or stop buying it. Period!
---
Gotcha. Well don't let me tell you what to do with your money. BUT if you're getting PS5 on launch, then your PS4 is just going to be plastic waste after that right? And there's something to be said about delayed gratification. Again, your money your rules. I just figured since you weren't buying a high end gaming laptop AND a PS4 there might be some small consideration for budget.
---
dude the support team is so damn useless look at this [https://imgur.com/bnqqlvW](https://imgur.com/bnqqlvW)
---
Are they Normal or Ultracite cores?
---
I got time, I got steel. Might as well give it to him and get free caps.
---
Normal
---
I agree. I was fine when my son was at grandmas for the summer but he's back. I was going to log on last night and I crashed on the couch so yeahhh we kinda have lives
---
he could have the ammo perk enabled, but I agree, I have never seen that much ammo drop from an enemy on PS4
---
Why tf are ya'll still subscribed
---
This is the most likely cause, and legitimate as well. 
---
I noticed that when I still had my credit card linked, it took about 24 hours to get my Atoms. But I switched over to Microsoft credit, and it’s happening on the renewal time immediately. Which makes sense because there’s no bank to clear payment; everyone already got their ‘money’.
---
At the very least the drum magazine could use some love.. its basically useless at the moment.
---
If this is true (which I suspect may be the case) then it massively sucks.
---
Did you both use an overlay/mod, or just you? Could they have detected the mod and instantly assumed you were duping?
---
Man, if true, this does suck.
---
Oh you are right. These people hang o. To what was said before it was all changed. They can’t accept that what they list was removed by Bethesda and only what is on the CURRENT page is what you get. Hell I could use the online archive and pull up stuff from years ago that some company or another promised. LoL
---
Not according to my strength!
---
Luckily, toggling it off, then back on, fixes it.
---
Yeah I was about to say what are you talking about? I'm looking at my screen right now with both Quest active at the same time.
---
Bloodied is easier to maintain, try switching it up.
---
yeah i get that no worries
---
This only works if your master is not your own OCD... :D
---
wow
---
For the record, literally any other service offers you a better value for this kind of money. Backblaze, office365 (family), Spotify, Hulu, Netflix...
---
These people not only pay for infrastructure to host some of the most data-intensive applications, they do so for less while in some cases paying out rights-holders and making sure they have near 100% uptime with no bugs. What is Bethesda’s excuse?
---
First thing that came to my mind is that your account might have highjacked during your away time, and used to duping etc.
---
or
---
You are just lying like most dupers who come here and try convince people to back them up (which i doubt is the case).
---
true
---
you know how it’s usually be you log in for a hour and stuck for eight
---
Reminder that Fo76 is a vault-tec experiment, and we are all unwitting participants
---
Palace of the Winding Path is a good place to nuke if you need flux and have plenty of high radiation fluid, hardened mass, and glowing mass. It doesn't have the concentration of enemies that is usually considered ideal. But, it has as much raw flux as one could reasonably need. Of all types. I think it's an underated nuke target.
---
I’m pretty sure Zenimaz and BGS know exactly the worth of this game. There’s a reason that ESO has been gaining popularity so quickly when it started at so weak. They know what they’re doing, but between a crippled game engine, rough start, smaller fan base, and competing mmo gameplay and costly subscription services... Zenimax is probably trying it’s best to make sure 76 isn’t competing for the same market. Meanwhile, the devs are probably using things like the PTS because they can’t afford to waste the time with a limited team.
---
A few ppl in the industry have estimated the entire game is probably being supported by as little as 10 devs most the time. That’s a lot of room for easy mistakes to slip by.
---
thanks for lmk
---
What are the must have perks for bloodied?
---
i mean i took a break to go play rust again but i'll probably touch it later down the line
---
Hey, that's Mr. Underpants! :D
---
I'm kinda confused, what's the big deal about it being nylon?
---
I'm new to the game and I feel like I missed the joke
---
most suggestions are just stupid so they do care when someth has a huge impact like useless ammo convert machine and this bug fixed for camp (like 20+ posts were made). So actually they make changes based on what players want. The sad part is all about new bugs and vulnerables on top of not fixed/partly fixed old bugs.
---
And if you don't keep the promises you're making to your board of directors, you get fired. I want to know who they're firing for all these failures.
---
You already did the iPresentInterval fix I see, so maybe you can find something useful [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gfsrwd/pc_i_wrote_a_big_guide_for_performancevisualaudio/). 
---
I have a probably medium spec Intel/nvidia system and no issues with fps (used iPresentInterval long time ago), I do get micro stutters once in a while playing with a friend several time zones away though.
---
Atleast no Nvidia hookers :D
---
I may be at max number of total active dailies.  I will clear some tonight.
---
Those cores you have.. Are they really fusion cores and not ultracite fusion cores or plasma cores?
---
Hmmm. 
---
 Try stashing all your cores, getting out of your PA &amp; collecting it. 
---
 Relog into a fresh server, take one core out, deploy &amp; enter your PA as normal. 
---
Might even be worth taking off any atomic shop skins too.
---
I've seen some on top of Watoga once in a while with 500 rounds. It's usually one with the boss crown and it's the one hanging out under the Vertibird. It's weird when it does happen because it is a strange amount.
---
I have, but only from bosses (The ones with the crown icon above their level). The one in West Tek usually drops 500 5mm and 3 missiles for me.
---
You can still make double sided walls at the moment. Use brick walls and a flamethrower trap. 👍
---
I donated 4,000. And it was all from grinding the actual weapons. (server hopped west tek about 15 times)
---
And I got a decent amount of crates.  I wanted to display them in my camp and found out I couldn’t. Or trade them or anything. So I figured I’d just open them and see. I got a lot of alcohol.  Caps. Not a single plan. Weapon. Armor or anything.  4,000 steel for alcohol and a small amount of caps.
---
I wish I could turn the flies off to improve my laptop's performance.
---
Good to know, bro, thanks
---
I love this idea! Although it would end with some dicks nuking all the human areas all the time lol
---
Basically what I said. Read my post.
---
Both of us did discord overlay. Nothing else.
---
Weekly challenges only!
---
That's all? I'm disappointed. The community can supply that in less than a minute. ; )
---
If you’ve got a lot of legendaries you want to keep but aren’t really using dump them on a mule character
---
Defo normal
---
It’s entirely possible that while you were away from the game your account got hacked and was used to dupe. There have been numerous accounts of this happening, and before they enabled MFA it was pretty easy. Basically, the dupers got into accounts, went crazy, moved stuff to other accounts and sold it for real money online. It’s extremely unlikely that it has anything to do with using Discord. 
---
Sadly, you’ll probably have no way to prove that one way or the other. Hopefully you can get some assistance from Bethesda to take a closer look.
---
I am on PC and generally minigun mutants drop 1 of 2 quantities.  100 most often and sometimes 500, no ammo perks.   I had never had more than the 100 drop up until like the last month or so.  It's happens fairly often now.
---
What about me, someone who isn't affected by the wall thing and also doesn't give Bethesda money? How can I help?
---
I think it’s cuz the enclave actually has good rewards and what not in game. The brother hood of steel have shown that theyre determined but week as they failed to do what people running around naked, heavily irradiated and drugged out of their minds can do. Plus fallout 4’s BOS kind of left a bad memory in a lot of people.
---
Tried it. No success
---
Junkies is much easier to maintain. I have played a lot of both. Junkies is super simple. Bloodied you have to manage your rads
---
Wait, So people who are dissatisfied shouldn't speak up? Why does it bother you seeing other people having problems with the game? This post is mostly well written except the last part which is unnecessary in my opinion, the point is understood without that language. If you don't like it just keep scrolling.
---
I did not have any issue getting back into my account, so it hasn’t/couldn’t be hacked.
---
Rads is easy. Stand in water lol
---
I like your point of view, just gave me the other side of the story on the limitations there, I like your response
---
Nice of you to add, that I might be lying. How do I prove my deafness and that I didn’t cheat?
---
Exactly why I think legendary incentives would be way better than assorted garbage. If you had donated 250 scrap 16 times you could have at least gotten 8 legendaries or guaranteed 8 legendary items for 500.
---
They have been doing the discounts. Here is an example: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gz8dv2/fallout_1st_no_discounts/ftfe0jh/
---
The Coal Dust Excavator Power Armor Paint is on sale now for First at 80% off.
---
That's sorta what a bunch of people did in Welch. Check rifle gaming cinematic YouTube videos
---
I couldn't even get halfway through the Run and I got burned out.
---
Character lvl can be misleading. That blood eagle camp will lvl with you to a degree and uses a lot of gear that damaging against basically any build, even if you have high survivability they can do a good number on you for that quest.
---
My advice is to google top builds based on the weapons you like and see what sounds interesting. Bloodied, junkies, vats/stealth, etc. once you find one look up that build and someone will probably have said build posted. From there, you can use website like Nukes and Dragons to edit that players build so you have a character with perks proven to work and can make it your own based on your preferences.
---
Yes but it still takes management. And when you die in an event it can be a pain to get them to the right spot.
---
Junkies once you are addicted that's it. You never have to do anything else
---
Not saying bloodied is super hard to maintain. But junkies is the easier of the 2
---
Drop the titles bro which games?
---
I'll participate in the ones that benefit me, and I won't in those that don't.
---
BTW, thanks for the hat I don't want.
---
Mine was part murderbot, part pack mule. Having the extra carrying capacity made a huge difference
---
Trust the Process
---
And on top of the increasing the magazine size; different guns should have different ammo capacities. The .45 Submachine Gun should have the largest ammo capacity of all of the Commando weapons. The Assault Rifle as well should have the second largest ammo capacity. 
---
Something like that might better diversify our weapon choices without having to do much balancing at all.
---
HA
---
Yeah... Hate that guy you know!
---
The collector's edition of F76 included a vault-tec canvas duffle bag. A bunch of people pre-ordered it and when it was delivered, a nylon bag came on the package instead, and Bethesda said it was because of a "shortage of materials" (canvas is one of the most abundant materials available). After some time getting clowned and under a threat of lawsuits, the company apologized and said they would make and give canvas bags to collector's edition owners.
---
My favorite part of this story is that they also gave 500 atoms along with their apology. At the time, the atom shop had a postman outfit. Said outfit came with a canvas bag. The price? 700 atoms. So they didn't even give you enough atoms for a virtual canvas bag.
---
SPOILERS* Also I'm not trying  to tell you whom to side with but you should do all the quest for each faction before raiding the vault theres gunna be a point in both where it will say no going back I'm not sure what the settles give you from raiding but during the raid with the raiders you get slug buster
---
If it did come back Bethesda would find a way to fuck it up
---
Huge pita getting those plans, have two left myself. If only they'd come up with some type of new BOS event where they could both recycle rare things that already exist in game as rewards and promote an upcoming expansion....
---
The reason i added that is because vast majority of these "i didn't do nothing wrong" posts are from people who actually did do something wrong and are here just to get people to back them up as they somehow think they can get their accounts back if there are people supporting them. You being deaf has nothing to do with it. And it's not us you need to prove that you didn't cheat. Try contacting bughesda. Usually the first responses from them are automated copy/paste messages, not actual people.
---
Same happened on ps4 during one violent night. It looked so messed up that I seriously thought my console/tv was dying.
---
Shit I quit 4 months ago, so I’m confused af about what’s going on but glad I don’t have to deal with it lol
---
Sure it could.   Only way you wouldn't be able to access the account was if someone changed credentials...  if someone was using your account, it would be wise of them to leave credentials as is, so that you would be less likely to notice that they had access.  If they changed your credentials, and you were unable to sign in, you would instantly create a support ticket and have your password reset.  The hacker instantly loses access...
---
Just jumped Into low health and nerd rage. Definitely a notable difference from junkies. Goes through a lot more stims and I have to be more careful. Still pretty fun though
---
Actually it skips 760, unless they fixed that too but I'm 300 hours in and my next goal is the 7600 hr one
---
Lol! Seriously? Whatever! Sorry I didn’t let you enjoy this hate jerk off in peace.
---
It’s in the files already. Don’t let them atom shop it. . .
---
In real life it's a game using mostly impossible physics/chemistry/biology.
---
Some things you just have to accept and go "woohoo, shot the car and got a mushroom cloud!"
---
I wonder which one does more damage.
---
Damn, I’m at a loss. Do cores you pick up in the world work &amp; do your cores work in a gatling laser? 
---
 Just thinking your cores might be bugged or something.
---
Here is the schedule, for those who need it:
---
Don’t worry. The conspiracy theorists that say it’s rigged will be here any minute to shed some light on this topic for you.
---
&gt; I'm just sick and tired of wasting all my caps to try and get the Fixer plan.
---
It'd probably cost you less caps in the long run if you just bought the plan from another player.
---
Probably bloodied
---
I am retired. Can't go anywhere or do anything bc of Covid.  I still am over the grind.  It has made me revisit my second character for levelling up easier and I am revisiting the quest line with him.  He fares better now that I know what the hell I am doing and that I can keep dumping scap in my 1st Stashbox.  But I am still tired of having to play every day.  And F*** NW where the only time I killed another player was someone who loaded on AFK.  Passing the spaceship marker on the board finally I should feel like I can relax but I am waiting for the new dailies to roll over so I can knock them out.  I love the casual teams though.
---
This isn’t much of an event that you’re going out of your way to complete. Most players are just playing the game with scrapper and getting 1k+ steel. Perhaps a small amount of scrips per a package like caps would be better and an easy add without major RNG reliance
---
I did and they’re all “our decision is not taken lightly, and final” on me. Won’t accept my argument that I did not cheat and I only used discord.
---
I have a gaming laptop and never had any problems with mine but it really all depends on the games you're trying to run.
---
Currently at 109 million.
---
Yeah it would have been so nice if they were in the drop pool for this event. I'm kinda hoping they're made easier to get threw the bos once they get here
---
But I'm not counting on it lol
---
Sweet that you only need 2 more
---
The 2 dancing emotes go away. Mine got taken away after I did 1 month and when I bought it again for a month they came back. Everything else stays besides the tent and use of the scrap box by putting stuff in. The emotes cannot be selected once 1st runs out.
---
Not me!
---
I just cancelled my subscription last night, had paid for the whole year so apparently I still get the benefits until the day my subscription was meant to renew. But...yikes. I don't know if I'll ever pay for it again, and if I do, it would be month to month. I'd have to *really* get back into the game in order to justify paying for a whole year again.
---
Well i will be getting the PS5, but at the beginning there wont me that many games for it. But maybe you are right,  that you will be able to play your ps4 games on it. Then maybe i´ll wait. Thanks again (:
---
Yup. Picked up fresh cores. Game counts them but non go into the PA. They also work perfectly fine in a Gatling laser.
---
So 50 or 25 scrip?
---
Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!
---
Steel is easy. But I seriously doubt people have this much concrete, cork or plastic.
---
I canceled my sub a few months ago. They weren't offering what was promised, and I held hope for far too long. I'll get it again once they deliver what was promised.
---
It's broken on console as well. Looks like a global issue. Good ol' Bethesda patch work at it's finest.
---
Thanks. I’ll give this a try. Every time I try to place it I get either the intersecting or floating message.
---
That might actually be advantageous for a death bag
---
You're weird to harass someone like that, man
---
I’ve started putting them out of their misery. You only gotta tag it once, but there’s 7 people standing there rifle butting it to make sure they got their tags (and graciously letting others get theirs, you guys are awesome), but at some point someone’s gotta put the damn thing down. I’ll usually wave people over and take a moment to look around after all interested parties get there for their sucker punch. Once I notice everyone’s done their thing I just shoot it.
---
I donated 8k and got a whole bunch of plans I didn't know yet.
---
I think I have two factors login set up, need to check. I’ve been trying to figure out why they’d ban me.
---
For real. I've been playing since the release, and I remember how hard it was to find or craft food/water/weapons/armor when coming into the game blind. Because of this, I make an effort to give at least food, water, radaway and stimpacks to anyone coming out of Vault 76. It would be fantastic to have a small community outside of Vault 76 to help new players/characters get on their feet. I would love to be part of that city.
---
Double int walls is in the files?
---
It's up to you, really. I don't need Caps, and I don't really need Steel, so I donated 2500 Steel.
---
I´d want to play Fallout 76, fallout 4 and then games like cities skylines and Aoe definitive edition.
---
How is Fallout 76 running on your laptop and which one is it? hows the battery life?
---
My last check showed 105.86 million. That last 30 million from when you posted came in fast.
---
So weird....looking at it on my pc it says 75.19 lol
---
Kids are lying to their parents with excuses akin to the post above (18 to buy not to play) we’ve all done it &amp; sure some parents don’t care.
---
My original point was that Bethesda would not be tailoring a game to a market that it outside of their games age rating. Bethesda have to give the rating some consideration when advertising or expanding the game content. To do so would invite legal proceedings. 
---
Whether your Mum takes it seriously, I don’t know. I do know that shop owners can be fined for selling a game to somebody outside of the game age rating.
---
Sure COD and other turn a blind eye to underage users, but were someone to make it “legally obvious” (ie can not legally deny knowledge of) they would have to react or face legal action.
---
I consider floater grenades to be trash anyways, so really the only thing useful was the plan which doesn't even fit into my build. I can't even use power armor save for the excavator suit because every other suit drops my carry weight from 335 to 245.
---
I think it's updated manually, so not sure how accurate it is depending on when you check. Given the change within the past hour.
---
I put the power armor down, use "transfer" to remove the fusion core from the frame, then get into the power armor. If course it will insert a fusion core during the enter animation.
---
This has solved it for me several times. If all else fails, remove everything from that frame and put it in another power armor frame.
---
You can stop logging in and playing. It’s a live service game with 2 key factors that determine its direction and future - (i) continual revenue generated and (ii) engagement (number of players and thus number who will potentially  spend money), for either of those to work you need a viable player base, nobody online = game changes to get them online or it dies.
---
Don't believe those numbers. Firstly those numbers are updated like once a day (was at 75m for past \~20 hours). Secondly they can and will put any number in there just to motivate us to empty our scrap boxes.
---
I'm all for this cause but at the same time people like you were morons for paying for something that wasn't in any way guaranteed within a specific time frame.
---
The price was very clear upfront on what you got for it. Yes, they had planned future expansion of content as listed but you got what you paid for. If it wasn't worth it for the base features, you should have just waited til the value met the price.
---
Also by your post rationalisation twisted logic, if in future Bethesda proposed further features for 1st, they should increase the subscription price to compensate.
---
Just face it, you backed a bum horse and you're paying for it. Caveat emptor next time. Also, might be an idea to not renew your 1st sub until these promised features are implemented. Seems only fair, right?
---
Nah. We both know you're going to complain to justify the buyer's remorse &amp; you'll keep paying for the sub like a sucker. Though, more than happy to be proven wrong.
---
That has literally nothing to do with this...but thanks 👍
---
This was extremely helpful. Thank you so much!
---
well I gave up 35k steel and got 7.5k steel back already so it is easy to recover. my donation was compensated with a lot of caps, plans to learn/to sell and so on. How it is possible for newer players to donate 125kk steel is a f\*cking great question. Not everyone is a 1st member and newbies cant acumulate that much. This bos thing is an option. If u dont see any advantage for u just walk away and do urs.
---
The mesh is at least
---
Chems, gunpowder, 40mm gernade/missle/nuke are usually the causes for me.
---
&gt;A lot of users paid the yearly option because it made more sense financially and for the big atom payout.
---
And who's fault was that, exactly? Who's fault was it that, after the absolute disastrous launch where Bethesda broke promises on multiple occasions, some people still decided that paying a year in advanced based on more promises was a good idea?
---
You can blame Bethesda for a lot of shit, but that kind of stupidity is not their fault.
---
Hail the Hasselhoff!
---
Sounds solid. But there's no fusion core in the power armour apparently. It shows up graphically, but it's not actually in the inventory. :/ So I can't remove it. Can't add one either as it just won't transfer.
---
Bloodied give 80% damage at 19% hp. Plus 20% from nerd rage as well as 50% from adrenal reaction.
---
Junkies does 50% at full health
---
XB1, I private server nuke WS once or twice a week, place your tent in NW corner of area, it’s 2 straight hours of farm-exit-enter at your tent, one big circle of the property counterclockwise with full respawns every time. No traveling away, just out and in. Never had a single problem. Ghouls all dead at first visit, jump out and back in and it’s fine. Avg runs for me yield around 40-50 of all flux reagents and no less than 10-12 legendaries, often 15-20. Wait to pick flora until fallout goes away to maximize your time in the zone. Best spot for me.
---
Yea the mobile page from the link you gave looks to be a live feed where the web page is old. In the time you sent that link it has gone up another million
---
agree to disagree. in Fallout 4 i did a playthrough with every faction to see the outcome. siding with the Brotherhood gave me the most satisfaction. siding with the institute annoyed me with the exception of watching the Prydwen burn like the Hindenburg. my guess with the Brotherhood coming back is that now everyone will focus nukes on Atlas instead of the Enclaves homebase being The Whitespring. 
---
and when you think about it, yes the BoS trade values are horrid, but is the Enclave any better? sure you can buy serum plans and other sweet stuff but at 15K caps for a recipe? ya no thanks i consider that highway robbery as well.
---
So, if I paid for a whole year, if I cancel do I get a refund of the remaining portion? If not, then stop telling players to cancel their membership, BGS already has your money.
---
It would be nice to have though. I want people to spawn in at the entrance at my camp as i put a lot of effort into my builds.
---
It’s working as intended, but the magic health regen glitch no longer works.
---
I'd love megathreads on topics personally. It gets really fucking tedious reading the same 100 posts about the same subject. Especially after a patch or event when some people turn into shrieking children
---
Always be part of building team because INT boost and also brain fungus soup (with herbivore mutation) helps with boosting INT. BTW, what are best for Carnivore mutation?
---
I would love that they could add it back in and just make a boundary for it that it cant be close to traps.
---
Well, its matter for sure. Some people grinded lvl 100 in 1 or 2 days with that, killing mutants non stop
---
"Hellscape battleground" has to be the most over blown description of PE I have have ever heard. And aquireing cores that way feels more like a chore than a champ. But that just me.
---
I do think the other milestones will go faster as some of those items imo dont get used for anything. I know I myself have like 10000 glass lol
---
Haven't played 76 on it. I use mine more for survival/crafting games that'll never come to console. But I can tell you I can always run those games on ultra high settings without a problem. Pretty sure I got an Omen, been so long now I don't really remember. As far as the battery, it just depends on what your using it for but I do always keep it plugged in while gaming.
---
Most people with FO1st didn't buy a year.
---
Imagine creating a problem and then charging for a solution
---
Also being able to stack foundations is a big deal too! Hoping they'll find a way to bring that back as well as floating walls so we can make shapes that aren't just boxes.
---
I mean if we are going by IRL versions the drum mag should hold 75 rounds not 30.
---
Well in my case a voodoo ritual of old, I mean a bar
---
Well when it comes to serums I buy from other players, one of the reasons why I’m on team settler/responder. I want to help others, not go around and forcibly steal materials, resources and the like like the BOS. If you read into the lore and what the BOS has done in Appalachia, they’re almost as bad as the raiders.
---
Source?
---
I don’t think ppl realize how active some of the reps used to be on reddit. We used to have some say with Bethesda, but there’s too many bad ideas and posts that are just made to complain without any sort of actual request or solution to the complaint. It’s impossible to use this sub for anything positive for the game now. 
---
Not defending Bethesda, but threatening them every time isn’t going to make them listen. They’ll just start following the money every time they aren’t sure what to do and we won’t see any good changes
---
Oh for sure.
---
I'm just personally interested in how the things like fusion cores are supposed to work in the Fallout world, and also, a lot of people often tend to forget that a "nuclear-powered" thing, such as a submarine or ship in real life, or possibly even some space ships in fiction, are actually basically powered by *steam*. Not like steam engines in that steam pressure would mechanically move pistons and so forth, but using steam generated by nuclear fission, to mechanically move a turbine, which then generates the electricity used to turn an electric engine and so on.
---
Before, during and after, please.
---
same, but it's really case-by-case, honestly. you and i are in the minority, for many long-time players the plans are useless.
---
Megathreads would be soooo nice. Especially a complaint one, where people can just go complain. Definitely dont need that negativity on the feed all the time haha
---
also you loss all the gold bullions that you can earn in events cause you need to finish all the quests.
---
My camp has an excellent view of ATLAS.  Maybe I should build a nice observation deck...
---
I'd even be okay with 10% of what you spend at the Purveyor going back into the machines the same way Caps at Vendors do.
---
I feel like less is more yaknow? I've seen arguments for and against but having multiple threads seems to be counterproductive
---
Yea having the game die would totally benefit us /s
---
I stopped doing Encryptid because getting nothing but White Fedoras is fucking infuriating.
---
Screw this idiotic RNG.
---
Gotcha gotcha. So voo doo. I’m interested and wish to subscribe to your monthly newsletter.
---
I’m convinced that Bethesda is intentionally trying to kill this game. *Someone* has to be. I bought it ages ago and quit playing because I got sick of finding nothing but absolute garbage no matter what I killed or where I searched. It sounds like absolute shit now. 
---
This game can fuck right off. I’ll go back to playing New Vegas with mods.
---
I mean how many posts and comments have you seen on here before this patch “Building my camp is my end game content”. Restricting that is gonna cause damage even if it’s not people directly quitting. 
---
I love this game but my motivation is lowered right now as I’m sure others’ are. They’re gonna cause people who spend hours building each week to lose interest and play less, if they don’t fix this quick. With a shallower game you’re gonna have empty servers.
---
You can do all of the wastelanders quests starting at level 20
---
Counting magic, the Junkie's is absolutely better regardless of your build.
---
Discounting magic, they're both good. Use whichever prefix matches your build
---
So you are playing Rust and stuff like that? I´m very into survival games so if you'd share what games you are playing it would be much appreciated.
---
You checked when it was that value and your browser cached the page, it did the same to me, was stuck at that value for ages :-)
---
Does that mean this is the last year of content?
---
Maybe the frame is bugged? Can you take the armour off &amp; transfer it to a new frame. Last thing I can think of!
---
Yeah, I might do that. Aren't they like 5-10k caps?
---
No skin as well? I saw a post mentioning there is no warning anymore if you drop a weapon with unique skin.
---
they have a 3D IQ?
---
Yeah, that would be alright. It's difficult getting around to all of the complaints especially when they're spread out. I feel like maybe a weekly or monthly thread with regular updates could help gather data effectively, but then searching for posts is easier. It's a bit of a pickle
---
Well how would u feel after getting shot in the back by a bushwookie that has been staring at u for the past 5 minutes after u have been putting some actual effort into the match. It's a battle royale, not extreme hide and seek lmao. The ghillie armors would encourage bushwookie tactics imo.
---
This must be around the 30th post I’ve seen about this in the last 24 hours
---
Ah gotcha. Sounds like Bethesda is trying to bring that back at least judging by their forum response. That would be nice, especially if the camp budget is smaller because of it.
---
It is part of Windows 10 DLL file. Finding it missing likely throws and error because the file is incomplete.
---
Then why cancel? Let it run out and don't renew. No need to cancel. If they see no one is renewing then they'll get the message. Cancelling it is just throwing money away on your part, you paid for the service, use it until it ends, don't quit in the middle.
---
Hahaha. I appreciate it. But yeah, I have a separate frame of T51-b but it is exactly the same.
---
Every engine can be modified to a extent for use. Take a look at the wonders the devs did with the Ion Maiden game and the build engine that made Duke nukem 3d. If they actually had time an sat down with the engine and fixed it from the ground up an made it far more efficient than its ever been like what valve did with the source engine, it could keep up with other games instead of looking a bit dated and rough around the edges in performance. The lighting shows the potential of it in both 4 an 76. It just needs some major streamlining in the coding and optimization of the game engine so it just runs overall better.
---
Very important question to ask.
---
I believe you meant:
---
"Todd works in mysterious ways."
---
Honestly? I just start down voting the threads after I've seen the same complaint 4 or 5 times in a single day.
---
So whether they're unwilling to use the search feature or are hoping for a boost of karma I see no reason to reward them.
---
Are we surprised?
---
I feel you. I think the drop rate should be higher.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/3cP83OCJszhZnUes1gxwL8/bethesda-next-gen-console-upgrades
---
"And while we don’t have any news to share just yet on our remaining catalogue of titles, we can confirm we are committed to offer free upgrades for current generation console owners of existing Bethesda titles we bring forward into the next generation of consoles."
---
This is just a material sink, as we collectively had a fuck tonne of mats built up, mostly 1st players seeing how high they could get their steel count etc... :-)
---
Doubtful. The Xbox one and PS4 will still be getting new content and games for the next 3-4 years
---
So you are just stating an opinion and want no response?  Ok.  ______
---
Stuff like this totally zaps my motivation to log in at all. I don't have a few hours to dedicate every day so knowing I won't be able to complete the challenge means I just won't bother trying.
---
Serves them right, mole miners are dicks.
---
Use a world container like the overseers chests or blue suitcases/cash registers @ train stations
---
Paper bags are notorious for going poof at the worst of times.
---
&gt;We have paid plenty. Time for them to give something back to the players. Double for longtime fallout 1st members
---
So is paying out more in atoms then subscription cost, tent, private server, discounts and unique override not paying out to them?
---
My underground house is amazing though.
---
I think 25 for 500-1k is reasonable. Collecting 1k steel a day would get me a legendary module which would make my life much easier.
---
That's true. I think the original post should get the spotlight IMO. Otherwise every other post just causes the original to be lost.
---
Didn't mess with rust, more of a solo player. But I got 7 Days To Die, Stranded Deep, Scum. Games like that.
---
Yeah, steam what overlay?
---
That's not what it says. It just doesn't have 76 listed. There's nothing one way or the other that indicated that it'll never come to next gen.
---
It's a curious omission but nothing more than that.
---
I'm more surprised a next gen skyrim hasn't been announced given how many platforms it's on.
---
You now get treasure notes from public events.   Be sure to turn those in once daily as you can only cash in 20 at a time.   They can really build up.
---
Yikes
---
To add on; they're focusing on one of their biggest title and the most recent first.
---
How many of us are actually gonna quit? Well I mean I can at least say one. I want to like this game, I do. I’ve played since release but stopped about a year ago yet always kept it installed just for that rainy day, Tried to come back about two months ago hoping the game would be in a better state (which it is) but it definitely isn’t near where it should be after all this time, so it’s finally been uninstalled. Will I ever be back? Maybe, who knows
---
Hmm I don't get Bethesda PR, why would you say that when you know damn well 76s large community is gonna freak over not being included out over it. Its not like we don't pay attention.
---
F
---
I don’t think that tweet says what you think t does.
---
I wish that some how the raiders would have rebuilt it. I personally think that could have had a intresting plot point
---
Canceling does not shut it down immediately. Canceling stops automatic renewal. You still have it for the time you paid for.
---
Because I had just seen like 5 posts complaining about it.
---
Well that's awesome. I use that site quite frequently so it's nice to see new additions.
---
PvP solution: world mode that turns pacifist mode off. Everything else is the same. 
---
The only thing that would need to be changed is the Pacifist option. Much like taking a workshop, you’ll get a warning saying entering this mode is subject to PvP. 
---
Too easy.
---
Add sneak damage to bloodied and holy fuck lol
---
Honestly I like junkies a lot more for a heavy gunner. I played about 400 hours as a bloodied heavy and the same as junkies. I have junkies much more fun and I still melt everything
---
Now for a commando bloodied is the way to go. Since you get so many boosts from uny. It just makes sense haha
---
 Perhaps that just means those 2 titles will be written for the next gen processor/hardware.
---
Sony has already stated many/most PS4 titles will run on PS5 via hardware emulation.   Sony did the same with the PS3 - first gen PS3s had PS2 hardware built in, so you could run older stuff on the new console.
---
The wastelands horse.
---
It's a good idea but I think it would be better for more localized pvp rather than server wide as then its just bringing back survival and as we know Bethesda doesn't seem to want to shell out for more sever space
---
Bethesda says something about FO76 - FO76 community freaks out
---
Bethesda doesn't say something about FO76 - FO76 community freaks out
---
I'm detecting a pattern there...
---
Very easily, yes.
---
I do it all the time. Stealth suit and a shotgun.
---
If you don’t mind dying a lot it’s possible to do solo. I managed to get to the launch phase as a level 70-something alone, but due to a mixup with the launch code ended up wasting a launch keycard. All that trouble for nothing. Lol
---
Ah, wasn't sure exactly on the level
---
I miss how it used to be.
---
I'm a junkies heavy gunner. It's really fun. With t65 nothing dents me lol
---
It doesn't say anything about other games not coming. Just that these two have been announced specifically
---
the lode bearing issue was happening the first time i entered it. i dont play the event much so i hardly ever loot the ores. outside the event same thign was happening i dont loot ores hardly at all. with everythign else  wer hardly issues untill the update. after that it all wet down hill hard
---
 The process is exactly the same with the espCompare Tool (5):   
---
\-load a esp Special Edition   
---
Which one should I load?
---
I got clear about a month ago LOL The fear of missing out was powerful indeed but ultimately there's got to be a reason for the grind, as I won't simply do the grind for its own sake anymore. If the colossus event kicks ass that might get me back. If not we'll see what actual content comes with the Brotherhood stuff when it launches.
---
Before the games release they announced that their intent is to build on the world and not to follow the new game cycle any more. It’s what their investors now expect that matters to them, not whether you or I enjoy the game.
---
Also unless this games dies a horrible financial death, they cant revert to their previous style of game development. From a business perspective tailored, story led games are too expensive &amp; completed/shelved too quickly. Investors want the game that you keep coming back to, keep spending money on without the expense of developing “real” content. They don’t care if people like it, just that they keep playing it. If they lose money then they’ll care a little but simply move onto their next venture.
---
I don’t think the issues lie with which 
---
Studio is working on it.
---
Yeah, it's really strange
---
Silos are supposed to be a one person thing...it does take alot of ammo if your not ready for it..some troubleshooter pieces  would help here..armor and weapons make sure your specked for max damage and it gets easier the more you run the silo
---
Single thread is easily ignored. Allowing for multiple threads on the same topic over a period of time shows a particular interest in that subject sustained over time.
---
An issue that keeps coming up each month stands out more than a megathread with regular updates. After a very short while the megathread will be buried &amp; forgotten.
---
Do we know if Todd works however? He just stated "It just works!" not that he would just work
---
At THIS point? This is Bethesda, this is par for the course from all I've experienced with them.
---
Funny that most of dupers were unbanned with their "earnings" untouched. There were threads about this approx week affer ban wave. Just my 2 cents.
---
well im excited about the new one  [https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/elder-scrolls-6-redfall-being-developed-on-bethesda-new-engine-motion-capture-real-life-npcs-and-more](https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/elder-scrolls-6-redfall-being-developed-on-bethesda-new-engine-motion-capture-real-life-npcs-and-more)
---
Yes you can solo a silo.  If you're struggling it's probably a matter of gear/build and just knowing where to go.  Watch some videos of players doing silo runs to study the silo layout and what to do.
---
That's true.  But there are some decent ways of farming a lot of steel and lead.
---
Yeah, it just seems odd to not mention anything now. People are going to start speculating on whether this is the end.
---
In a lot of ways it's easier. More players in the silo will cause more robots to spawn.
---
I unlocked it and then immediately unequipped it because I just *assumed* it'd be bugged and didn't want to deal with it.  
---
Turns out I was right. The only thing BGS do consistently is release poor quality content.
---
Without knowing the details I'm guessing you have problems opening the bag.
---
The issue is that the bag has the same hitbox as the paper bag, so you can only open it if you target one of the sides.
---
Maybe remove all the parts, scrap the frame, logout, login, then find a new frame in the world and reassemble? I understand it may be difficult to stash or carry all the parts.
---
Every nuke I launch is done solo.   First one I was round lvl 80.  It's actually easier solo as the game increases the number of robot spawns to match the number of players in the silo.
---
Im not a BoS fan, and don’t like the look of the any of the berets, and while I am a completionist and have to have all rare and locked loot... this time I said nah. If it was enclave gear locked behind the steel and cork donations I’d be grinding for it. But BoS... nope. Just not a fan. Besides, BoS already have 4 different power armor models, multiple paint jobs for each, a wide variety of in game outfits, underarmor, hats and custom painted armors. But hey let’s add more stuff for the BoS fans. “We want more BoS stuff! Where’s my BoS flag for my steel box camp?!” So there’s all this stuff locked behind this donation event, plus a likely atom purchased power armor skin and jet pack on the way also. You’d think the brother of STEEL would come with their own steel instead relying on donations. Unless they plan on using it to make their lasers actually do damage instead of applying what equates “owies” roughly equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by putting a candle out with your fingers. #enclave #plasma
---
Edit: forgot to mention the BoS paint job for the minigun.
---
Can I have a link to that interview or announcement?
---
Long time players can sell the plans to all the new people who haven't been able to aquire enough junk themselves to get the rewards.
---
Do you then play on console too? sorry for a lot of questions?
---
Honestly it's even worse than that in my opinion
---
I just got into the game less than a month ago, and even I am burnt out of the daily tasks
---
I have plenty of quests I could do still but right now all I do is do my score dailies and log off again, rinse and repeat, I don't really progress in the game and I don't have the energy for it I agree with people saying it just feels like a chore and I hate the way they enforced it
---
I would've rather had more weeklies you could do in your own time instead of the dailies
---
It's a hard balance to strike - keeping daily players occupied with enough things to do while those who play only on weekends don't feel overwhelmed.
---
Well, let's see... I bought a game for $60 two years go, and it's provided me over 1,000 hours of entertainment. And I play it now more than ever. 
---
Maybe my definition of "potential" is different than yours, but that seems pretty fucking good as far as getting more than my money's worth.
---
Take me around 10 minutes to do one. Though I am level 358 with tons of gear haha
---
That's true, one post could go unseen whereas another could snowball. Good point.
---
There is that potential but having it pinned may help out.
---
awesome thanks!
---
Yeah, y'all get all weird when I eat them afterward though.
---
I feel like this game has a healthy enough player base to continue support.
---
\+1 this issue.
---
It is a MAJOR progress blocker.
---
Lol, it's all good. That's why we're here. I do play on console, I'm on Xbone.

If you kill a mutant with a Minigun and another picks it up it'll almost always give you 500 rounds. Most instances its 101, 70 (if they drop a gatling gun), and extra 500 if they drop a legendary Minigun. I pick up probably 10k 5mm every 2 days by farming hotspots.
---
Likely it was just that server going down for a maintenance restart. 
---
When servers have been up for long enough, they can start doing weird stuff. The workaround is to restart the server after X amount of hours.
---
Always check the splash screen on the top right of the main menu if you get dc'd for maintenance. If it doesnt show a maintenance message, you can generally assume it was only the local server went down and try to rejoin a new server.
---
I usually tell people to take it slow read all the notes listen to all the holotapes. But is seem you are going in with the right mindset. People complained the game had no storie before wastlanders and that's just not true, they just ran through everything to power level and missed all the storie and lore.
---
i make it a point to be able to for all my builds.
---
The first area with the radiation is the worst for me. Use lockpick 3 and terminal 3 to bypass it.
---
The rest just requires a bit of turret sniping and maybe a set of power armor for the last defense phase.
---
People think the Earth is flat and that we didn't land on the moon, too. Doesn't mean we should cater to them.
---
Gotchya
---
I just meant that that's what your comment seemed to convey, but I wanted to make sure.
---
Where can I find more info on b.o.m.b? I have no idea what it is.
---
in more ways that one you are correct about them being bad like that. when it came to helping Appalachia, i feel it was a well intention mission that failed horribly. not defending the BoS fully, BUT, the Enclave is no better. they literally explain to you in detail how to access the Nuke Bunkers for you to launch a Nuke which in turn creates more chaos than the BoS stealing stuff, or at least that is my take on it.
---
and with the Serums you and I are the same, i haven't purchased any of the recipes, only ever bought or was gifted serums. to this day i scratch my head wondering how the hell i got around without Marsupial
---
how the hell did the raiders clean up that shitpile
---
We're investigating this issue, if I need any more information I will reach out to you.
---
i feel like they scale with multiple people. My friend and I kept getting swarmed with gutsy's and assaultrons. but solo, i breeze through it.
---
Oh wait we get 4 days for just the steel?? Wow I read that wrong

---
Truthfully, I don’t care if I start anew. I have no personal attachment to items on all games. Just entertainments.
---
I don't think Discord has anything to do with it. Maybe check other characters on your account, see if somebody didn't put something on then...
---
Loss of revenue is the only thing Bethesda is responsive to. They've shown that to be the case with both player vendor/display case issue and now with the wall issue.
---
As for promised fixes in patch 21 that didn't actually get implemented, since no one cancelled their sub over the issue, no response from Bethesda.
---
I cannot enter my character selection if I’m banned.
---
Yea I can see that...I have fo1st and to be honest I depo my scrap and dont think twice...same when I am exploring...I grab anything and everything
---
THANK YOU.  People who bitch and moan about this game constantly and keep playing it are completely lacking in self awareness.  
---
I bought this game a few months ago and despite the bugs, very much enjoy it.
---
There is usually a couple in the WS bunker desks. I will go find where they are then Fast travel back and forth. I believe there is usually a few in the Watoga high school also.
---
Oh yeah my $/minute ratio for this game is waaaaay lower than what I usually get.
---
It was before the initial game release, you could dig it up yourself. 
---
It was also repeated in a round table interview with Todd &amp; friends when they were showing off the new “perk cards system”, again prior to game release.
---
i saw that a bunch with the faschnact event. 
---
thought it was cheater until my friend confirmed it was my local game rendering.
---
I have stuck with the game since the beta and not plan on going anywhere
---
It's the reputation grind again. Also I miss daily challenges for atoms, at least I felt like I was accomplishing something every day.
---
My thought was to avoid the possibility of anyone griefing anyone that didn’t want to PvP through some exploit. 
---
Explosive bait, Nuka mines, and more. 
---
We have to account for the player base that doesn’t want anything to do with PvP. 
---
Other idea: 
---
New world mode that’s PvP only and everyone starts a new character, no pacifist mode and everyone starts the same. 
---
No taking or bringing in anything from other modes. That was the failure of Survival Mode. It was placed in during the height of duping so many had god rolled items that a player wanting to try it would get killed before they even spawn in. 
---
No one actually survived in Survival Mode... they went back to adventure to lick their wounds... they didn’t farm in survival either. 
---
Up the ante... when you die you get looted like Fallout 4 NPC... bet that would be a game changer.
---
I know, I know. I just didn't realize about the creative word until you put there. Pls. XDDDDDD
---
You only need experience, When you launch thousand like me you launch a nuke whith eyes closed in 5 minutes
---
&gt;Edit: Also, how are you all this incompetent when you have ESO lead to follow?! Look at ESO Patch Notes! Each major change will have developer reasoning below it. They communicate! What do you do? Pass things on to ~~the developers~~ the void.
---
Sorry but as an retired ESO veteran i have to disagree. The developers there also completely disregard what the playerbase wants. Scrapping and overhauling skills that did not need changes, ruining combat mechanics and addressing the main issue eso has never touched with more then a broom..  server stability.
---
Just because Zenimax communicates there changes with paragraphs does not make them transparent with there community. For example the forums for ESO had a poll that was 90% against and 10% for a specific change. With like 10000 people in the poll. Zenimax still went the stupid route and vouched to change the game for the worse. Its easier to nerf and change the game then improve the servers.
---
Right now they are thinking of putting cooldowns on every aoe in game simply because they are to incompetent to improve the servers.
---
Zenimax is the same as Bethesda. They don't care about their players and they continue to create more content for the cash shops. They never touch combat or quality of life improvements. The game will die once the cash shop whales stop buying.
---
Th only reason i play Fallout 76 is because of the building. The wanted system is void. The camp destruction system is void. PvP is void. Half the world is void till it scales to youre lvl or they give out a "Hardcore Adventure mode" for veterans or a "seasons modes" so pvp might be more playable at the start.
---
Fallout 76 could be amazing. Take away fast travel and make the map house 100 players? Revamp the map so it scales to youre lvl? Maybe balance pvp and have developers do 1v1's on various builds to make it practical?
---
I mean this game isnt hard to fix just the people behind it that hold the ropes have no idea what their playerbase wants.
---
I really liked this to begin with but quickly switched back to the paper bag. It's fine for adventure mode but a few times in NW I've found my teammates struggle to find its hitbox when I've gifted them smthing. Just not worth the agro.
---
Are they your ally?
---
Yeah it's 4 days per component.
---
You don’t have to travel away. Place your survival tent inside the blast zone (before the drop is best) and travel out and in of the server repeatedly at your tent.
---
Well you know what they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
---
They are outside, near the water feature in beds.  Watch out for the charred feral ghouls
---
The wiki. It's not the most accurate information, but it's your best best
---
The tiny bit of wall that he actually managed to get built fell over in the freaking wind 
---
That would have totally absolutly worked like intended
---
When I see these sorts of things, I usually just imagine it's some sort of electron decay from fissionable material in the batteries.
---
The batteries are filled with an unstable fissionable material that as it decays releases electrons that are captured to provide power...not terribly realistic but sounds good. Perhaps they are "charged" from fusion generators by having the power from the generators bump the material in the battery to a higher energy state then their decay then releases energy as needed.
---
The Fission engines I imagine must have some sort of direct energy capture rather than heat/steam as we use in order to be as small as they are. Maybe (now total sci-fi science) capturing excess electron flow resulting from fusion processess? As fusion is accomplished it releases large numbers of other particles which are captured via magnetic containment and channeled to create a particle flow which generates the electricity. 
---
Mostly mumbo-jumbo (I have a couple of Physics degrees from University) but it can easily sound good with a little pseudo-science.
---
The guitar is hers, not yours. Get rid of her guitar &amp; you'll be rid of her, too.
---
Or OP was victim of a false positive from their automated system. It happens, it has happened to me. 
---
Out of the blue in April I received an email saying I was temporarily suspended for using third party devices to exploit and dupe, pending investigations and all. One week later, despite my pleas and requests for explanations, they told me they found unrefutable evidences of my wrongdoings (which they never shared) and my account was now permanently suspended without appeal.
---
... Only for them to silently unban me a few days later without ever telling me, or apologizing or anything of the sort.
---
I was never given an explanation or clarifications and I never got the chance to talk with a human being, only automated answers. As of today I still don’t know what happened. My best theory is that I may have picked up something flagged as a dupe in a loot bag or something and it triggered everything.
---
You can’t very often with games and subscriptions without there being some other form of compensation for it.
---
If they're your ally, scrap their item. If they're a random NPC, probably not.
---
WhAt system?
---
Right no skin I just hope this ends up being really, really rare
---
I mean, you brought it up, the least you could do is link it. But I’ll try and find it.
---
There are limits to how many you can pin and read comments heavily bias those posted &amp; upvotes early. Very few people are going to dig through all the comments to find quality commentary that happened to be posted days after the initial post. Pinning won't do shit for that issue.
---
Hahaha I remember that , I used to log in and go stealth then do the Unique weapon challenges haha then I'd scarper off back to adventure 🤣🤣
---
I give the thumbs up after I tag generally every one follows suit then will kill the mofo.
---
Text posts don't give karma.
---
Bethesda being Zenimax.
---
More robots!
---
Be they allies or enemies, i don't really care, just want more robots...
---
Yeah normally 5-10k (on xbox any way. I don't watch the pc market)
---
Large quantity of ultracite in glassed caverns.
---
A number of ultracite nodes surround every fissure.  You’l get a gaggle of scorched for each node you loot.
---
In a nuke zone, some iron nodes turn to ultracite.
---
Best place for violet I’ve found are toxic valley and around fissure prime
---
WS is good for all flux except violet.
---
Morgantown is good for cobalt.
---
Basically when you get to a certain point (like when you’ve done and seen mostly everything) building up your camp is a fun way to spend your time and resources.
---
You’ve probably seen what camp building is like now, you have to make a foundation, and attach walls only to the foundation and build a roof or stairs.
---
Before this patch people had ways to build outside this basic method. Resulting in octagon shaped buildings, free standing walls (no foundation), running wires (low budget cost vs the conduits) through walls, having wall papers on both inner and outer walls, being able to build on destroyed houses, etc.
---
This lead to a wide variety of building options and creativity for camps, (flying ships, compounds, round buildings, expanded pre war buildings, etc) while not having an insane amount of budget lost to stupid restrictions. It was almost like it’s own mini game within 76 that kept people logging on and motivated in the game. Well now people can’t do that anymore and they’re pissed.
---
Not if it's stickied.
---
I thought the T60/plans only dropped from Distant thunder.
---
I do it, And no problem, I can kill he solo in 5 second, my IGN is same reddit
---
Ooh right. Yeah, I mentioned a couple of minutes ago that posts can be searched for. Good point!
---
-MORE LASERS!
---
-you can take more time to answer the questions sir
---
-i'm done
---
That's definitely true,, but with so many people who live to see this game fail at every turn why even give them material. Like they really couldn't wait, its not like the next gen is next week. Atleast until they confirmed 76 so we don'thave to see "the end is near for 76". To be fair I we probably are 3rd behind those 2 games. 
---
For the record I ain't stressed its gonna get an upgrade regardless. I'm sure Fallout 4 is even gonna get a upgrade.
---
Just the post itself or any up votes it gets as well? I honestly have very little idea how karma works here.
---
Yeah agreed its just a case of dipping a toe and see if the fans they are hoping to reach (us lot) take to it. I'm hoping they do expand on it moving forward it has the potential to be a brilliant franchise and I enjoyed the bitesize game and storyline.
---
Distant thunder and Ash heap/bog treasure maps
---
It's easier solo because less bots spawn.
---
Ah yes, then it's possible for it to hit trending sooner.
---
If you are in a public team you cannot build in your teammate's camp.  Need to form a private team.
---
I got Fo76 when it came out. I asked my mom to get a Xbox bundle for me and I got both the Console and the game but I saw how much the game was unfinished so I waited into I can see what's the best move.
---
With a million more on the way!
---
Are you in a public team or a standered team? You can not build in teammates camps while in a public team
---
If you were in a public team together that’s why. You need to be in a private team.
---
Got loads of them to dig up nice one thanks.
---
Wish I was there....I need 5 violet fluxs lol
---
you can ignore that, the article is about the Skyrim Special Edition. i only used the first 4 steps and the strings worked after starting the game. the final step is "finalize".
---
I think the Toxic Valley is the next easiest after the Forest.   Maybe do that area before Ash Heap?
---
If you are in a public team then you can not build in teammates camps. But if you do the old fashioned private team then you can build again!
---
Events marked with ! provide treasury notes, which are tradable for bullion.  
---
IIRC, You can collect T notes, but you cannot trade them for bullion until you have completed the raid.
---
Ya same but its worth it for sure. Only thing I wish is that there was cross play between consoles and pc. I have game on pc and Xbox but without characters being on both my Xbox is getting left behind.
---
As a mom, I feel ya. I can't always play for hours on end, but I still hit the scrip limit so quickly (along with the other limits) that I've had to make mules just to hold the excess crap because I don't want to drop everything and lose out on tomorrow's scrip, etc.
---
&gt;The number of people telling OP to stop paying for FO1st, even though OP predicted this would happen and explained that they paid the 12 months upfront, is genuinely astounding.
---
Then OP is the idiot here for doing that.
---
Can’t find it. Point me in the right direction, would you kindly?
---
Haha! Only aid item I brought in was Salt... nothing else... it was kinda funny seeing your character get kicked around after because they didn’t get anything...lol
---
Did get a message saying it was funny...lol
---
Every post on this sub is “I love this game BUT...” or “I didn’t think it was possible for the Devs couldn’t be more incompetent but...”
---
Honestly mind boggling how people still play and enjoy this game at that.
---
My favorite part was where they doxxed the customers who put a claim in for the new bag
---
I think they just put out a patch completely baked at home during Corona shutdown. Give them a break.
---
They do discounts, it's just not labeled. It's not a lie just bad design. No surprise on the bad design, pretty use to that at this point ( cough, cough... ammo converter.)
---
Anyway I’m not looking for a handout, but I do appreciate all the emotional support. It’s good enough to know that there are still a lot of really cool people out there playing this game. Even when it has a tendency to screw us over on the reg
---
I had a lot of fun up to level 100 or so, then the plethora of one-shotters started to erode it a bit. I still enjoy the game, but I've finished the two main questlines and I'm now just grinding SCORE and rep.
---
when you flush the toilet it turns on the microwave. game of the future.
---
You get downvoted because this sub, while really fun and full of great people, has a neurological disorder that makes people incredibly trigger happy with voting.  You could post the sky is blue and be upvoted or downvoted +/- 10 times in about 5 minutes.  Don't take it personally or think of it as a sign of approval or not.
---
For the record, I prefer mega threads but can live with either.  That said, I do wish there was a mega thread enforced for the 'I've finally finally had it Bethesda I give up I quit' posts, which are generally mind-numbing accounts of players who can't quite shit or get off the pot.
---
Only comments, posts that go directly to links, and images/gifs/videos directly uploaded to reddit count toward karma.
---
Have you tried to repair or modify it at a power armor station? Perhaps that will reset it.
---
This is OP I'm pretty sure that is what happened to me but I put the t-fuse in then the blood sample but it won't work anymore after hours of re logging on it just keeps on saying put in t-fuse in and test blood sample it kinda sucks as this is my first ever fallout game and I hope if I get a new fo game this doesn't happen again i think the only way to get pass this is just making a new character
---
Just like Fabreeze said, if you accept the quest and just immediately talk to him again, it still recognizes it as completed just like before, just an extra step now.
---
Oh I see. Thanks for explaining! I just rebuilt my entire camp and I had weird bugs where the door perfectly fits and is green yet it says cannot build because it's floating. And I noticed that I had to put a lot more power connectors than before. Pretty annoying. Also noticed you cannot choose which side to put the wall. I saw people using the wall in reverse, so you could put the wallpapers on the outside, which made the structure look better. Such a pity, don't get why they changed it, it's not like it hurt anyone..
---
Never tried it with a freind but I'm sure your right as far as scaling...even events feel like its easier to solo
---
Ahh ok. Search YouTube for a glitch involving Lode Bearing. Most people glitch, loot, server hop and fuck the others. Its a power armor clipping deal.
---
Does it happen at both sites? Kittery and Elaine? Are you playing solo on private or on public servers? If your playing on private its more in likely a 20hr reset. If public, somebody got it before you. Or its the exploit.
---
I'm sure
---
Its easier solo.
---
Factions and Vaults should all be free.
---
200% agree. Settlers, moaning all day. Raiders, grumpling all day. Brotherhood of Steel, dying all day.
---
I'm pretty sure I got hit with a freebie last night.
---
Thanks for that! Other bullet points are still valid but OP should probably lose that one. Unless it's specifically the lack of discount notifications they are unhappy with.
---
How is it helping for legendary run?
---
I wouldn’t do that. I’m fairly certain they forgot to remove the requirement for the other blood samples for quest completion. So what’s happening is it’s searching for the other two even though they aren’t attached to the quest anymore. This is an opinion but I’m sure someone who understands the code will figure out the issue
---
We destroyed 79 door. I guess we can find a way back inside 76.
---
A DLC? Well Destiny DLCs have been anywhere from 16.99-39.99.
---
Why should games come with private servers free? Many games feature private servers at a cost, or they are offered through 3rd parties.
---
I’ve got demolition 5.   Vats doesn’t hit worth a fuck.  Have a Furious 33 vats misses most all first shots.  It sucks.  Also have a quad.  That’s what I’m talking about.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4suwj/it_seems_that_fallout_76_wont_be_crossing_over_to/
---
So I should search for the other 2 samples as I've already put tin the feral ghoul sample
---
Its only 113 days. It hasn't reach 365 days. Pun intended.
---
I noticed that when I complete something in power armor and then take it off... then it shows the score
---
I'm not too fussed, I'd rather have a reason for it but I'll live haha. It does seem like this sub has a selection of oddballs.
---
Oh I've seen so many, even on the market of all places.
---
This hasn’t touched the ammo economy.   I still sell 10mm, 5mm and .50 just about as fast as I put it in my vendor.   .308 sells even faster, and 2mmEC faster than that.
---
The people doing this are only playing themselves.
---
I'm not quitting but I'm not playing until some actual substance is added in. Hopefully the BOS questline will be enough to get me to play, then log off until the next questline is added. I'm done with doing the same repetitive dailies and I quit the season at rank 70. The rewards are all junk to me. No way in hell I'm doing Atlas or meat week for more useless junk. Literally the only thing I want in game right now is a fancy shotgun but the RNG on these tickets is horrendous. I've turned in well over 100 and gotten junk, a dozen western outfits and a crappy 1* nocturnal fancy revolver. I found a player selling 38 tickets for a total of 950. I thought "this is it, I'll finally get my fancy shotgun with this many tickets!" Nope, junk. This game is too shallow and broken right now. I need to play games of quality that are worth my time. I'll be back in fall or winter.
---
You can server hop megasloth spawns and get an arbitrarily large number of xp, screws, silver, caps and armor and weapons to break down for more materials. If you have a bloodied or high strength build you can usually beat them to death pretty handily so you dont even need to waste ammo.
---
I'm dropping plans at ATLAS to stop donations.
---
I got a plan I didn’t know. Grenades to sell for more caps. Booze to stock all my kegs with. So all in all it’s ok, I would have liked to see some rare plans included in the mix but it is what it is.
---
With the way that bugs get patched, then come back, How should it be posted?
---
Def getting free score as well.
---
I was scraping helmets the other daaayyyyy.
---
Interesting. Thank you for the information. Always nice to learn something new. 
---
I can see i earned some down votes myself. I wonder if that's because I was wrong about something or they simply disagree with my posts.
---
Haven’t donated anything and don’t plan on it.  
---
Has nothing to do with all the backlash going on.   I just find it pointless for me.  I log in to do my dailies and as soon as I get my atoms from 1st I’m buying out the rest of the season and putting game down till we get actual content.
---
If it is you’ll need a sample from a wolf and a mole rat. That is if the game even allows you to collect the samples anymore. If it does that may be a fix. Most likely this is a bug that will affect all new characters and not a localized case. I’ve been seeing a lot of reports on it and each of my characters who haven’t done it yet are effected. So I wouldn’t delete or start from scratch as you’ll likely be right back where you are now
---
They dont? I thought you get karma from comment upvotes and post upvotes? I can see on my profile that I have a mix of each or have I misunderstood you?
---
That's the post I saw but they still don't mention 76 in it
---
The ammo converter should use the crafting interface and be based on a workbench template. That way we can see how much ammo we have available to convert like we can with junk and spam as appropriate.
---
We tell them to playtest the thing so they can see how poorly it is designed, and they just swap to another design that sucks making it clear they still haven't playtested it. At this point I don't even use the x10 or x100 conversions they added to supposedly improve the item because I'm not sure when I meet the thresholds, resulting in the "You don't have enough ammo!" error message and even more wasted clicks than before.
---
Ridiculous. Did Todd Howard's son program this piece of shit? What is their attachment to this horrid interface?
---
&gt; The Fission engines I imagine must have some sort of direct energy capture rather than heat/steam as we use in order to be as small as they are. Maybe (now total sci-fi science) capturing excess electron flow resulting from fusion processess? As fusion is accomplished it releases large numbers of other particles which are captured via magnetic containment and channeled to create a particle flow which generates the electricity.
---
That sounds interesting! Seems like a much better explanation for the ability to miniaturize nuclear reactors the way they have, rather than them just being the regular steam turbine setup in a smaller form. Especially with the fusion cores, although they're the biggest offender in all this I feel, if they're honestly supposed to have some kind of a reactor inside them.
---
IRL versions are also highly prone to jams and double feeding.
---
Thanks, ill try it out now and see if this works. I do hope the fix is this simple but if not I guess I'll have to wait until a fix for this is found.
---
Edit: sadly it hasn't worked when I found the tolerate it only said take or transfer which kinda sucks but thanks for trying to help ill try and search on google to see if anything can fix it.
---
Doesn't mean anything.
---
Welllll looks like I won’t need a PS5 haha.
---
A fully decked out assaultron was just too powerful. A factory armor one was strong, but not OP.
---
Exactly the old methods I was talking about would fix all those problems. So apparently according to what Bethesda said there was some “exploit” probably used to lag/crash a server with camp building. So people could dupe. (Which is being called out as bullshit because it got patched apparently)
---
People are angry, because rather than fixing the exploit method itself they cut it up stream and got rid of the least common denominator (the walls snapping to a floating roof). What they didn’t realize is that method is also the only way for people to build creativity.
---
the problem is I have no idea how to find things. on the page for backpacks, it has a list of "every" appearance modification for it, but the list is outdated and doesnt show the majority of how many there actually are. I only knew too search for the blue ridge caravan ones because I saw it in a youtube video
---
Yes you can see the total. We are at 108 rn
---
Not OP but for me personally having a private server means I can bust out the "Kill 3 Legendaries" daily without a level 365 one-shotting everything my weak ass tries to tag in an event.
---
There is actually hints/rumors that PvP will be removed and workshop persistence will be added(in adventure mode too). This allows pvt servers to cycle into the adventure lineup or visa versa. Since the rumors seem fairly fresh there maybe something behind this. Imagine being able to build on other creations/maybe full city like creations could be created. The vendors could be like community pools where you can leave items for sell and perhaps even a wanted section(edit:or auction house maybe?) The resource machines could also stock community pools that can sell in vendors.
---
None of it will be fixed. Come to think of it, they may even give that guy some atoms.
---
Trade up? Could you explain what you mean?
---
I wonder if it’s awarding score when a teammate completes a challenge? I noticed last night I got score a couple times while I was building a new camp and I assumed one of the challenges was camp building related but when I checked my challenges nothing was marked completed.
---

It will auto-complete. Don't worry
---
Are you reading my mind?
---
Dupers used the wall glitch to crash servers as it was part of the dupe method a while ago. If the glitch didn't affect servers, bughesda would have left the thing alone.
---
Crimson, cobalt and violet are typically in larger demand. While just as valuable flourescent is kind of seen as a lesser valued flux.
---
The ratings are overzealous, can you imagine telling your 13 year old he couldn't play halo because it's rated M? The ratings were made to satisfy overzealous parents, not give realistic expectations on what's suitable for children, because that's massively subjective.
---
the more that quit the easier it is for me to get on a world where my campsite isnt taken.... go ahead losers quit.
---
Why? For shits and giggles?
---
Comments, links, and stuff directly uploaded to reddit count.
---
I honestly didn't mind until the patch that came out this week. The game feels the worst it's felt since before Wastelanders. It's buggy as hell, my melee attacks take three power attacks before the damage numbers register with the enemy hp. Building was broken and completely killed the urge to build a new camp after getting the junkyard bundle. The servers are just unstable as all get out with no new content except a community event with no unique rewards for shoveling out tons of scrap.
---
Bethesda stopped being my favorite company when they re-released Skyrim 10 times instead of making Elder Scrolls 6 or a new Fallout. I'm not even gonna get into how much I actually hate Skyrim because that's not really the point. But to resell and repackage for literally 10 years? Come on guys..... even if I had liked it I wouldn't have wanted to buy it again.
---
Ok? Seems like something to be posted on eso or doom sub since it is relevant to them, not 76
---
Yeah this is sad. I just wanted to try that and they fixed it, lol. I feel so lucky.
---
We bring it up of course but I'm asking weather duplicate posts are worth it
---
I've been doing The Legendary Run exclusively through the challenges and I can confirm I have this problem too
---
I'm in 
---
Already running the local franchise of Vault Mart. Might as well go all in as I am also sick of all these assholes rolling into the territory that us Vault Dwellers have relatively secured and thinking they get to call the shots 
---
What's you platform and plan? 
---
I'm built over at Whitespring (and technically in a legacy camp) but I'll move to a more appropriate location if need be
---
The real heroes of the Wasteland
---
Rolled about 20 times to get a junkies, finally got one and realised I didn't really like the gun anyway. Nice waste of resources lol.
---
I just don’t think there’s enough going on in 76 to play a whole year—I’ll come back to it for a week or so every few months, but honestly it’s probably less than even that now. Before wastelanders I’d be inclined to make new characters but I’ll be damned if I do that fucking reputation grind ever again.
---
Yea, the wiki for this game sucks. Maybe try YouTube. 
---
Lots of videos of people showing how to get certain things.
---
It took my forever to get the rolls I wanted. Unyielding is probably the hardest to get. But my full set with good perks on, is really powerful. The extra radiation resistance is really nice too.
---
Had to stop reading and comment when I saw you got a TSE gatling for 10k. That’s awesome lol
---
Do you start at the NW gate and make your way to the golf club, to the employee parking lot and then along side the cabins back to the gate where your survival tent is waiting, exit and enter and repeat?
---
You can, there's a mod that turns meat piles into present boxes. Assume it would help, but not certain.
---
Thx for posting this. For awareness. Send me your ingame name. Hope you are on PC as well.
---
They don’t mention Skyrim either which has been ported to everything under the sun. All they did was announce two titles they are actively working on with more pending.
---
You can’t build in public teammates camp. Stay in private team if you want to build.
---
Shouldn't it have the same chances to roll as other prefixes?
---
Because it's pretty much on par with most other server rental services?
---
Those services just don't also provide you premium currency and additional cosmetics/features.
---
Having the private servers to tackle a lot of the challenges and do events solo/gain XP. I obvs have to switch to public for challenges requiring player vending and grouping up. It’s been a lot quicker for me to level up this way. I’m still a little behind and now I’ve been out of power for a few days so that’ll set me back but the extra Fallout 1st atoms will help me buy levels at the end if I need to.
---
What level are you? If you are running a shotgun build you should be able to switch those perks out for a melee weapon when you go farming. 
---
Additionally, if you have the ammo converter, you can just make something that doesn't require plastic, and then convert it. 
---
Apparently arrows are pretty cheap.
---
The caps are so minimal by the time imyou are doing the daily grind 25-60 caps per travel shouldn't matter. Could it be free? Sure. Does it matter? No. Please focus on delivering new content and fixing bugs over worrying about anything related to caps
---
My 3rd SS chest roll I got a uny/luck/harder to detect chest
---
Just stop playing. There are better games. I was obsessed with the game and have multiple accounts and days played but I stopped and I have never looked back. I don’t miss it. I did everything. I don’t need to collect shit in a broken sandbox anymore. I’m not trying to be negative but it’s really bizarre to me how people still enjoy this game. Especially day 1 players...
---
It’s really unreal how bad bethesda has people in this sub by the balls....
---
Actually Angry Turtle of YouTube explains to use said bag you must use the tiny zipper on the bag. Genius who would have thought of something so amazing. Use the zipper to open the bag! (Sarcasm) lol.
---
That's exactly where I'm at.
---
So when do you get your first check from Bethesda? Seems like it's late, for their most criminally underpaid intern.
---
Thanks. Your tools are rather handy.
---
Why the downvote? I'm asking a question
---
No. They are going to make interior walls ATX items. If they were really concerned with an exploit this would have been patched months ago when people were duping strangler heart PA. I don’t buy their reasoning.
---
Submitted 2 support tickets. @ [Bethesda Support](https://help.bethesda.net/app)
---
Both got a auto reply, Asking for less information than i provided, BTW. Both were resubmitted with info again. Going on 24 hrs with no response.
---
I see replies like this all the time.
---
No dice on my end. There is no option to collect a sample
---
Nice. My third gauss shotgun I got b33
---
Unless you have a ton of stash space, only roll as much as you can carry in stash. I effed up and crafted a ton at once and had full stash and walked slow for a week since you can only scrip or destroy by dropping the pieces
---
I'm level like 160 or so. I have started to acquire the Melee perks, but I don't have a decent legendary weapon yet for melee (story of my life, Only one of my 3 shotguns is a good legendary). It's probably not a bad idea to swap to melee for farming. I really enjoy the feel of shotguns, minus the annoying parts. 
---
I tried the ammo converter at one point but it was SO annoying. I heard they improved it; I might have to give it a try.
---
i quit playing long ago, but for me, i love reading the passionate posts and comments in this sub, along with the ragequit posts and watching bethesda ignore everything.
---
fo76 is such a shit game, but people who stay in it truly love it and want it to improve.
---
Nope, it doesn't matter who completes what in your team, unless it's a quest, for which you get a few caps.
---
Agreed. I love Fallout just as much as the next guy. Even more than some percentage of fans I'd argue. But when I fantasized about a Fallout that I could play with my friends it didn't require an MMORPG style grind where you have the stay ahead of the curve to be relevant or have a community objective to earn rewards.
---
It's not small -- it's the same size as the default paper bag hit box.  But it isn't centered on the duffel, it's on one edge only.   In other words, they developers half-assed it.  They SHOULD have increased the hit box, or at least centered it on the duffel.
---
Right? I used my Microsoft reward points to get some gift cards for the sub this month, but even now im debating cancelling it and refunding the points to an indie game or save til big sales ye know?
---
And the bugs and glitches in NMS will give you that Fallout feeling.
---
Yes.  It should.  Therefore 11111111 is just as likely as 10001101.  The only reason why rolling 5 nocturnals in a row seems weird is because we assign a certain value, (or lack there of), to it.
---
OP has every right to be mad even though it may have been not the best decision at the time. We did not receive what was paid for although i did not purchase it I had many friends that did hoping to get a larger camp budget. And at the time the website said that it would be coming in the near future like every other feature bethesda blows off
---
Reddit is the most humorless place on the planet where everyone tries to correct peoples logic and show how smart they are compared to you. No need to insult people
---
haven't used the class freak for a while.... didn't even notice lol
---
I acutlly have plenty of stash, I've been clearing all my excess cps out of my Stash
---
You’d think so. But it seems a lot of people have trouble getting that set. At the purveyor I get 10 or 15 zealots troubleshooters lead piles before I get the one bloodied weapon. It takes time. But the armor is worth it in the end. Some people say server hopping might help get what you want. Try anything within reason to get the gear you want. Good luck.
---
I'm getting a lot of repeat junk prefixes as well. Alas, I finally rolled a great lifesaving piece last night. 
---
What I like about the SS armor is you only need modules and mats, and you don't need to go hunting legendaries specifically for them.
---
Might I suggest; save your scrip, get it to 500. Buy 10 modules, chem your luck as high as you can (15 max), equip *Armorer* and roll the piece you're trying to get.
---
I immediately got 1st for the free space for junk, but other than that I’m feeling burnt as well it is sad
---
That's why you have to go with wastelander gear man, then you can grind for the weapon and armor you want, all you need are the effects.
---
I don’t have an issue with the grind as all mmos have them to varying degrees. I feel like if you don’t want to play a game for a couple hours a day then maybe it’s not the game for you. I can see how burn out happens though as I played DCUO pretty exclusively for about 7 years and got burned on it. But that was way more than 2 hours a day. 
---
I do agree with lifting certain limits in the game though. Like the scrip limit and the daily amount you can turn in limit. What difference does it makes how much scrip I have or how many legendaries I turn in?? Neither affects gameplay of anyone but me. Also the daily bullion limit should be raised. I’m sitting on several hundred treasury notes. Because I can only turn in 20 a day.
---
The sink is clean...not the water.
---
Grinding should have been done away with long ago.  
---
Even if a game is considered really good by over 75% of the players if there's little to no replay value then the game 'sits' for the most part. God of War is one I went back and completed 3x within 6 months. The 4th play I haven't touched in maybe 10 months.  
---
76 isn't inherently bad. IMO, you have to look at it unbiased pros and cons. Looking at the story and lore what is 'good' and 'bad'(inbetween) and see which aren't condudice to the game.  
---
IMO, when you're at your CAMP or someone else's your thirst/hunger should not move AT ALL. No need for wasting a Perk Card idea or space for it.  
---
That shows a small hint that people in 76 are working together on some level by providing visitors with food/drink; no animation needed.  
---
A smart BGS exec and director would hire fans and even pay for temporary relocation to help 'fix' it. The people who create and design it take that input and execute.
---
if only the rewards for trading said juk wre new not the same items inthe last 2 events. then i would of glady given away said junk. but i have everything offered. but the ones for being a part of it. and im not all that excited for a retextured berrett hat. or outfit. my scrap is worth more then that. the double sore dailies for 3 days . still don't care, o and 50% off the prevayor. yea guess what still dont care . i got my guns and armor. o and a extra week of a event with so far no new reveled drops..... did the same person who designed the first menu system for the bullett machine come up with this event?
---
Reddit downvoted for God knows what reasons. I just got downvoted for explaining karma.
---
They have an entire storyline that hinges on this event being successful. Even if Bethesda pulled the dick move and say you get nothing then it would prove to the community that FOMO ain't that important. Eventually Bethesda will repackage and give these items away in a future event. 
---
I also think there is enough players that might want some of the BOS stuff? And those that have not checked the forums to see how bad the rewards are. That they are gonna probably end up getting plenty at least for steal...plastic and cork they are screwed 😊
---
I honestly don't know whose idea it was to say these 2 things specifically:
---
&gt; • increased camp budget for private worlds
---
&gt; • increased camp build area for private worlds
---
It's like the PR department was given a task of making up benefits and no one thought of how this is going to work when you go back to public works with your extended camp or when your membership expires. I can already see them attempting to implement it and break the whole game.
---
Full set of uny scout armor and a prototype hazmat suit is all I use and I go through the silo pretty quickly. I prefer to do it alone less ads
---
I just don’t understand the fast travel price. Why would you make it 40 caps to go somewhere far away, but make it so I can just travel to the vault or join a public team and reduce the cost by a lot. Why not make it cheaper from the very beginning. A fixed cost for fast travel would be better imo. Adding free faction fast travel would greatly reduce the cap sink ability of fast travel. It is meant to reduce the overall money held by the playerbase. But again, the economy isn’t very good as it is now anyway.
---
Id love to bring Berry "muthafucka" jones to 76..i loved the nuka arm parts that shot yummy nuka death lol
---
You get XP when teammates do quests. I've had my weekly repeatable achieved several times from this. One of the many reasons why everyone should be joining teams.
---
i HATE having to level up everyday. i get their point, but can't i just enjoy being the level i am for a second without having to move on to the next one every. single. day? be more creative with your challenges, beth. every day it's go buy 3 bullets for one cap each and level up. it's old.
---
Yeah I just couldn't see how they would work with miniaturized steam turbines with such small reactors so I thought this sounded plausible enough for a sci-fi world and would explain the reactor sizes.
---
They have fuel stops for loading up on coolant, so they must burn through large (relatively) amounts of it, so likely no additional temperature regulation from water flow from steam generation. So assuming direct power transmission we can also assume it's not nearly as efficient (which sort of suits that era...doesn't have to be efficient, just make more!) and that's why you can use a fusion generator to run a building instead of a city.
---
Yeah the fusion cores don't make a lot of sense unless you assume that they're charged by adding energy. So let's say that they charge up by having energy put into them to cause the fusion of several elements. Those elements may be somewhat unstable and their subsequent break down releases the energy back. So essentially a battery using nuclear material as source of energy storage?
---
I'm even seeing visual glitches in textures. Black squares. I immediately run away from the zone, I have fear.
---
We get the rewards even if no one donates!! They don't even have the ability to track such things!!! Beth wouldn't take the time to develop this event and then not hand out rewards!!! This is just to bait the dupers into depleting their stashes!!!!!! Can you imagine the PR nightmare that would descend upon them if the community somehow failed??? IT'S ALL AN ILLUSION!!!!!!!!
---
Did I leave anything out?
---
Same. Huge whale here and don't care. I'm having fun with it all. Not going anywhere.
---
I thought so too, but I noticed something off. I don't know if it relates to you, but in my situation I was just getting score with a huge delay. So I complete a few challenges, they award score, I can claim my reward, BUT the bar with a typical sound of the score points adding up appears after some time. To me it happened every time I exited power armor, even if the reward was already claimed. It's not free score, but just the server lag or asynchronous score rewards. At least in my situation. You can check this by simply counting the points.
---
I only had about 20 maps, then started seeing vendors chock full of them. I think I acquired the helm and left leg plans thru maps, the rest I just bought. Same for Raider, T-45, and T-51b. Cost me probably about 5k in caps in total(I wasn't aware duping was THAT widespread so I really should've paid like 30c each but hindsight and all), but I can now craft every power armor in the game.
---
Shhhh. We're too busy being annoying trolls on Reddit for actual discussion. Stop ruining the viiiiibe!
---
I know that’s how it’s supposed to be but I’m wondering if they goofed something with the update. I’ve seen a few posts and several comments about players receiving score even though they didn’t complete any challenges.
---
Problem is the atom shop sucks. You literally have to look at it with and without first to know what's on sale because of first. 
---
Similarly, you have to look at the atomic shop with an account that has never bought anything to know if "that thing" you bought is still available or not. (Applies if you have friends and they like something you got)
---
Plus slogging thru what you own to see what's on sale. Slogging thru what's on sale to pick things for NW. Slogging thru what's in sale to see what you own. 
---
It's part of the larger "76 UI sucks noodles" problem.
---
2 weeks for new content...
---
I don't know what to do with my treasure maps. I'm still hoping that they, someday, will expand their reward list.
---
That backpack is sick!
---
Everyone is going to have it but I don’t care.
---
I’d go with a gaming Laptop over the PS4Pro because I’m a pc nerd lol.. however gaming laptops don’t last long (2-3 years) before heating issues and death. But if you can wait a few months the PS5 will be available and that is much better than both options.
---
It’s videos and articles I watched and read 2 years ago, no I’m not going to troll through them for you. Believe me or not, I don’t care &amp; I hope I’m wrong or  that old reliable Todd (he of failed FO1st promises) was speaking out of turn again. 
---
There was a 45 minute video of sneak peaks into the game and Todd and others where he reiterated that were planing to build on this world (like ESO) and therefore the more people played it the better it will get. He also went on about issues with the “new game release cycle” and why they were opting out.
---
Just stupid luck on my part. I'm beginning to wonder if there is something odd with the drop rates on them. So far I've never gotten a duplicate, and never seen someone selling the t60 piece plans. Don't forget to do distant thunder, I actually got a piece from that. And supposedly the level 3 toolboxes at the red rocket workshop station and basement of the generals steakhouse have a slim chance of having them, but I've had no luck at those.
---
It is an MMO be it limited in # of players.  
---
Why should it have a 'catch-up' system? Pretty sure there are young kids in school and others who have loads of free time so that last part of your comment isn't needed.  
---
I don't pvp and when I have as of late, it's for 2 reasons:  
---
Stupid score requirements which I don't do anymore.  
---
Reminding myself why I hate/LOATHE pvp.  
---
Limited MMO or however you want to be 'technical' about it it's still an MMO at it's core.  
---
I've played since the BETA and even stopped for a good 6 months. Deleted my first char b/c he was so messed it it was pointless in trying to fix by myself. My new main is no level 97. A level I've never obtained in the few MMOs I have played and in solo games. Unless, I'm playing a Fallout game on PC then I console command and mod like a power hungry god.
---
They put that on the road map but specifically said that it was a long term goal of the private servers and NOT something they expected to have available at launch or even quickly after.
---
&gt; Yes you can see the total.
---
Where can we see it? I've searched all over the donation area for a terminal or something but I can't seem to find anything.
---
&gt; We are at 108 rn
---
108 million? Well, assuming people keep donating, we should at least be able to hit the goal, and then there'd be no need to worry about what Bethesda does if we don't.
---
Scrap pipe weapons for cork.  
---
Scrap laser rifles for glass. Same for plastic.  
---
The tricky one would be concrete as nothing drops it. I know some events will give concrete but events pop at random so it's hard to say that you can have an effective grind getting concrete.
---
If you are not a PA build, pick up a full set of troubleshooter armor (-15% damage reduction per piece from robots and turrets). Does not matter if it has only 1 star or 3 and fits your build or not. You may need some rad protection for the reactor room, so maybe bring some PA or chinese stealth suit for this part.
---
There is not much use for troubleshooter besides silo and awol, so people usually sell it for cheap. If you are not too squishy built, you can pummel an assaultron to destruction with a level 5 rolling pin while drinking some coffee and not paying much attention. Okay, exagerated of course, but it makes silo runs easy mode.
---
This started recently with fastnach, people were making post here and getting upvoted about how it's oky to afk that event. Don't remember it being really a thing before.
---
Gotta have your buried treasure
---
and its blue both of my armored edition ones are green
---
See I just finished mine and I’m still doing the challenges every day even though they don’t count for anything. I guess just habit from two years of getting them done. I don’t mind it gives me something to keep track of while I’m wandering around the wasteland with my friends.
---
Here ya go 
---
FO76 is no more buggy than any other ES/FO game, so it was pretty much on par with what I expected. 
---
I also expected some additional difficulties as they wandered into the online service world for the first time in FO. 
---
As a person with disposable income, the 12 and change or whatever I pay per month for 1st, is no skin off my back. Plus I'm a camp builder so the atoms pretty much make it a no brainer for me. 
---
I get that some people reaallllyyyy care about money, and where they spend it, even the small amounts. I get that for some people, 12 bucks a month is not a throw away purchase, and can eat into their recreation budget, and thus expect the best bang for their buck. 
---
I can see why 1st's value isn't a huge motivation to spend on it for those people. 
---
If you've got a comfortable amount of expendable income? It's l14 bucks I'm not going to miss. My bank fees cost me more than that. Christ, I give more than that to a pan handler named Jerry who hangs out around where I work, and I'm pretty sure he just buys booze...

I plant the tent in between the housing in the NW corner of the blast at the edge of the fairway, the closest I have found I can put it. The gate will be northeast of you. You’ll make a kind of counterclockwise circle. Start south (to your right from the tent) through the housing along the fairways, then past tennis courts into the clubhouse, then east to more housing, then north through maintenance bldg and parking lot, then north to last of the housing where you travel west and will end up back at your tent. Dump your haul and jump server, rinse repeat.
---
&gt; as always thankyou for the effort you put in as we can all acknowledge you guys can receive a lot of underserved flak at times
---
Imagine apologizing to a AAA company for the massive incompetence, greed, and illegalities they continue to exhibit. 
---
Really sad you don’t have the cojones to hold companies accountable for consistently shitty practices and instead drop trow and wait
---
The horror!
---
We do get a pretty damn cool backpack today at least
---
I thought that it might be lag at first. But every time I server hop to look for events I get Score. Either 1000 or 1500. If it was 250, 500, or 100 I wouldn't have been suspicious.
---
When did they ever break something that made players benefit from it? xD But could be. Or maybe as someone else mentioned you just get xp. You could try to calculate how many score points it awards you and then compare to the active challenges. To me doesn't give any random score, but awards it with a big delay, specifically after I exit power armor.
---
Live. Not updated numbers. If there's a database taking the donating numbers you can put it live in the web in minutes.
---
It's random, you have 1/18 chance to get Uny, and then I suppose a further 1/3 to get a 3 star (but I think the game is fairly generous about that, didn't really craft a lot of 1 star ones so far...).
---
It is what it is, we're talking about the best armor in the game atm... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Y'all must not have ever played an MMO. Half an hour a day to complete dailies is literally nothing by comparison.
---
8 always do distant thunder when it's up just in case, plus I enjoy it haha. A good quick event where there's enemy's bunched up
---
Well then I'd just accept it as a compensation to the latest shitty changes xD
---
I’m not gonna break up with 76, but I may start seeing other games on the side. I still have a few games sitting just waiting to be started, like RDR2 and Jedi Fallen Order.
---
Yeah don’t expect them to do all that though lol they don’t care enough
---
Even the t60? I can craft all of them but the t60 haha
---
Sorry for your small peepee
---
It’s because it’s subjective that an objective view is sought from Standards agencies. That’s the whole point, it’s something we can’t all agree on so an agency makes the decision based on agreed upon criteria, I believe 76 is cited for “blood &amp; gore”.
---
you don't need to look with and without,  I've noticed the discounts say on sale for 1-2hrs.
---
pretty obvs.
---
Lol. I actually dance about the stupid thing to get my loot. It seems the texture was changed from short to long but they kept the short bag so you have to touch one edge. Like a magic sweet spot.
---
I agree the last part is unnecessary and am deleting it. That last line probably undermines the position that I intended to assert, and makes me seem immature. I appreciate your feedback and support.
---
I’ve experienced the delay. But last night I was just building in my camp for my whole session and it showed I hadn’t completed any challenges but a couple times the blue score bar would pop up showing me earning score.  I have no idea how much score I had when I started last night so I would be guessing if I tried to compare.
---
yeah once you have completed your build and the game and caps come easy many prefer to buy ammo rather then crafting so they spend their caps
---
I'll offer a different perspective. I came from FO3. I played it over and over and it never got old. I regret never playing FO4 but I had kids and didn't have the time. My biggest regret on that is I'm a builder. I really like base building. 
---
When I heard about 76, I got excited about the notion of FO as an online MMO with other real people including building and an economy but when it came out, I didn't get it because the reviews didn't excite me enough to justify the time or money.
---
When 76 came to game pass, I figured I'd try since I have it and it's there. Well, I'm glad I didn't spend money on it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good time sink but it doesn't live up to the hype.
---
I figured I'd try FO1st since I'm grown, can afford it, and have spent more on a 12 pack. I bought a month of FO1st. The scrap box and tent are nice but I'm on the fence on whether it's worth it. Keep in mind, I'm new and don't have most of your experiences. That said, for me, add in private world workshop persistence and I could be persuaded.
---
Overall, it's a way for me to waste a few hours when I can't sleep or when I have nothing better to do. I'm not sucked into it like I was with FO3. I haven't seen a lot of other players. I've had a few players buy from my vendor but I've also taken advice from here on selling. I haven't been grieved over FO1st but I don't advertise it just to be safe. Overall, the online players have been either neutral or really polite. Now, I do like the private world but without workshop persistence, it's still meh for me. 
---
I understand the veteran players' frustration and anger and based on my limited experience it's not unfounded.
---
It seems like it has the potential to be great, however the big picture does look like a money grab. 
---
I guess I'll play until I don't want to anymore or until it's removed from game pass, whichever comes first.
---
I don't know if I'll renew the FO1st though, I'm not convinced it's worth it.
---
A very big Lol! at the updated calendar. Like were really getting any of that content in September!
---
honestly, I kinda miss how the space station was before the raiders  came. I felt it looked better then.
---
Yeah but trap camps can use too
---
Cancelled as of yesterday.

This is why I only build on flat land. No designated fast travel point gives me the chance of becoming road pizza if built on a hill edge. Yes it has an 'area' of landing. I just have bad luck landing on hill top camps
---
Assuming you are using green thumb..Morgantown will yield over 200-230 raw cobalt, small amounts of others. Airport has a lot of scorched for reagents, and a fair amount of bloated ones around town. 
---
WS 120-160 raw fluorescent, a very good amount of yellowcake, est 40-50, and small amounts of crimson and cobalt (enough for at least 1-2 stable flux). 
---
SBQ fights and the bog/forest yield up to 200 raw violet and well over 100 crimson, and a fair amount of fluorescent in the forest. The scorched escort parties for any SB can yield reagents. Glowing ones at the military outpost.
---
Top of the world and all the surrounding villas are filled with scorched and can yield 40-60 of all flux reagents. Not much flora of note.
---
Private server gives you 2 hours real time to farm. Travel light.
---
You freaking nailed it. 76 is just a mtx test bed for future games made with as little effort as possible. It doesn't matter that 76 is shit, they know it is shit, and they don't care because it is a means to an end. That end being future multiplayer, always online, mtx nightmares. Single player Bethesda games as we know them may be dead... forever (you better bet your ass the next elderscrolls game will built on 76s foundations.)
---
I enjoy it too and I've enjoyed fallout since 3, but to see the state it's in almost two years after release is slightly deplorable to say the least. Since this is only my second patch since being here, yes I would have to say 'at this point'. Clearly the errors made in this update were enough to strum some kind of chord
---
I have never wanted FO1st. Also I have not spent any money towards Atoms. My only investment is my initial investment. Which I continue to play. I will milk this game until it dies. And I can say the teet is very sour at this point. But, I will suck until I get powdered milk. Not a dime from me! Which is what you all should have been doing. I'm getting my money's worth out of this. Wether they like me sucking or not. I want my milk!
---
&gt; Yeah the fusion cores don't make a lot of sense unless you assume that they're charged by adding energy. So let's say that they charge up by having energy put into them to cause the fusion of several elements. Those elements may be somewhat unstable and their subsequent break down releases the energy back. So essentially a battery using nuclear material as source of energy storage?
---
Due to the fact that the fusion generators have a slot for the fusion cores, and because (as far as I understand it with my limited knowledge) you need to heat the plasma to get the fusion reaction going, the way I've thought about it is that the fusion cores are just incredibly efficient batteries that can dump their energy in a very short period of time, which then allows the fusion generator to get the fusion reaction going, and then the same core can be recharged while it stays in the generator. Similarly, the cores can then be used in power armor to run that beast of an exoskeleton for relatively short periods of time.
---
I don't know if having such super batteries is any more believable though, but somehow I'd be more willing to suspend my disbelief thinking they're that, than miniature reactors.
---
It's for the best, I'd hate to finish the quests, get rep, farm some bullion, get plans. Really saving me from enjoying myself.
---
A buggier time, but a less grindyer time. I don't know which one I would prefer more at the moment
---
This is a very good idea and I'm sure people will agree. But I wouldn't want it now when so many players like to put traps for no good reason. This can make it even worse than now. They just needs to either remove the traps all together or make them not to trigger at other players unless engaged in PvP. When  that happens doormats will be a great addition.
---
Ummmm, I think they uploaded the old community calendar instead of the new.... it still says Colossal Problem for August 4th.... 🤦‍♂️
---
People have resulted to that since Bethesda is horrible at answering the community and keeps f-ing things up.
---
I mean its been like this for 2 years, what makes you think Beth is going to change now?
---
Seems like a lot of people are just reading the title and jumping in to victim blame.
---
September 2021 maybe, right?!? LMAO we are hilarious.
---
Any game time for the next week will be filling my scrap box to the gills lol
---
Ohh... Well, it being on a website explains why I couldn't find a terminal with that information in game. Derp.
---
I must have missed this link in the patch notes and/or latest article. Thank you so much!
---
I didn't leave the Forest until level 30, and then went to Toxic Valley first, as recommended by someone somewhere.   It worked.      
---
Have you tried a baseball bat with a heated coil?   It delivers some damage, and you don't have to worry about ammo.
---
Or several years after, apparently.
---
So I don't trust the numbers.
---
Pretty weak ITV. No new info at all, not even any updates on PTS or some responses to the community outrage :/
---
I mean I’m not a lawyer but isn’t that illegal?
---
No problem I only know cuz I saw somebody else posted it
---
Yesterday i attended a very aggressive and crowded one. I joined there just as the first legendary got killed, and there were angry emotes everywhere. I didn't even see the second one before it got taken down. Then i happened to meet the third one first, bashed it and gave the emote. The first two arriving tagged, the third one one shotted and took off. The rest of the people came around the corner and it rained emotes for me, because obviously the lvl500 in the room must have done it.
---
Legendary Run would probably be getting better Yelp reviews if it didn’t come off the heels of Bethesda introducing us to a very slow faction reputation system with limited daily repeatable ways to rank up. Combined with time gated currencies limiting cash flow and inventory management per session, changing up the overall player Atom earnings, persistent challenge bugs that have robbed SCORE from some players, and just all the stuff people are dealing with right now in the real world, feelings of burnout and resentment are valid. And Bethesda should be paying attention to this as they may have a problem keeping sustained interest in seasons
---
A fool and his money... give money to Bethesda.
---
No I understand it all
---
Or it could be use to grief camp visitors.
---
It just works LOL!!!!
---
Um infinite camp budget is still in game
---
It is a horror when you realise there's been no actual new content since Wastelanders. Wasting Resources Atlas for an *awesome* beret and a double score event we're owed for free isn't content.
---
I've just been standing at the observatory with my protest sign equipped
---
Wow that’s an awesome site, I was wondering if someone put up the challenges (I’m asleep during reset and can’t play until after work..). Great work!
---
I doubt we’ll see this happen. With all the glitches in camp building still I can see floor mats, whether intentionally set or not, putting players in bad situations. Biggest issue rn is that Bethesda just drops you in any location near where you port with no concern for clipping into objects. 
---
This is still happening with permanent locations. I tried playing project paradise and ended up stuck inside one of the experiment pods. I think their focus needs to be stopping the randomized fast travel locations first, then fast travel mats can be discussed.
---
Your comment made me heartily laugh out loud! I'm going to keep doing what I always do. Thank you for the good laugh. ;)
---
That's a promised feature, never fulfilled..
---
Yeah, I'm wore out of the season. I'm on the last stretch, but I do not want to do this again anytime soon.
---
Noticed that too... whoops.
---
Sad how we only attend this event for daily score rewards and scrip and fight over it... smh
---
You're welcome :)
---
“yeah fuck the bag”
---
“He’s right, fuck the bag”
---
*Of course this was just what Bethesda expected what would happen*
---
I donated 1000 steel and got nothing. I'm not gonna donate anymore. Regardless, the BOS comes back and it gets built anyway. 
---
I guarantee they have no plan B in place if no one donates. I'll just wait until Steel Dawn
---
I quit after 1300 hours but thats cut they wiped my characters and I refuse to start over.
---
Def worth it.and as far as rolls it is random.but many swear by only rolling on certain locations when crafting. I craft mine at a armor station near westeck I probably rolled 60 piece's so far but for every 10 I roll at least one unyielding. Not always a 3 star but at the moment I only have one 2 star unyielding piece.try your luck you need to spend the gold anyways
---
It makes sense, it's just like in fo3 , fo4, and Skyrim where I had to pay 120$ a year to have infinite stash space. What, do you think these items are just like some ethereal thing represented by a few bits of information that could easily be stored to near infinity with modern tech? Keep dreamin, Sparkles.   
---
I really have to ask. What is the point in buying into a subscription service that doesn't already include the bonuses off the get go? Considering Bethesda's track record, why would anyone continue to pay them when they can't even do the the free content right? Subscribing to 1st is literally rewarding them for abusing your good faith in them.
---
In regards to the whole "scrapbox arguments" in general; is there a reason why people should pay Bethesda for a solution to a problem they caused in the first place? Imagine if Mojang busted Minecraft's inventory system so you can only have a limited amount of resources, then they sold you the solution in the form of an infinite chest.
---
I can understand the other benefits such as discounts, camp budget/area and just a tiny bit on the private server side. That's usually a norm in terms of game subscriptions out there, but not the scrapbox.
---
Melted steel is the best steel.
---
I got a full set of unyielding SS (eventually). Now to start the uphill of getting unyielding 3* with good secondary/tertiary stats
---
Friend experienced the same thing today and he was sure it wasn't lag related. Apparently he was just getting out of his power armour and got it. Also he said he got it donating steel to ATLAS which I didnt
---
It's one thing to have a broken game; it's another to have a broken game and pretend like it's an isolated incident when a link was provided to show that it isn't. SMH, Bethesda
---
The first times getting through a silo are tough.   Think about this strategy.  Spend a little time just sneaking around the resedential section (first part.) Get to know it, then leave.   Next day do it again.  When you’re comfortable add a little more.  In other words, don’t set the goal of launching a nuke, just break it down to manageable chunks.  Get familiar with the layout.  
---
If enemies are giving you trouble, analyze why that is and think of solutions.  Perhaps your build isn’t dealing the damage it could?  Or your defense needs work?
---
Once you get all these things together you’ll find the silo to be quite routine.  Those of us that do it daily rarely use a stimpak or even Radaway.  You’ll get there to.  It just takes patience and perseverance.   
---
If you’re on PC I’d be happy to walk you through a time or two with pointers on what to look for.  I struggled at first, then started running silos with a team that taught me some tricks.  Later I developed my own strategy and found it more efficient to just solo it.  Having a mentor can eliminate some headaches, lol.
---
Not helpful
---
Thank you for doing Bethesda’s job, because i had no bloody idea since they’re not in the damn fallout first page,
---
What am i supposed to do? read some month old inside the vault to figure this shit out?
---
As one with over 3,000 hours put in, I'd say I've gotten my monies worth. My wife keeps telling me to get a new game, lol. And quite frankly, it's getting tiresome having everyone tell me what I should be doing with my account.
---
Does anyone have the active player count for FO76 across all platforms? If you do the math, it is only 500,000 individual donations of 250 steel to hit the target. According to one site that I just found through a google search, there are 32,000 players online right now. If those were the only players, it would take a little over 15 donations per player to hit that target. Many folks are donating bunches of steel and there are more than 32,000 active players. It is definitely reasonable that the targets will be hit legitimately.
---
Haven’t seen that pick up Atlas’s fortifications before. Looks a lot better than the tiny junk walls I had seen before.
---
I think If more people stopped acting like the game is just about grabbing all the leg  egg nastiest possible in hopes of that most magical piece dropping they would have a lot more fun.
---
Fuck yeah, how do I break into this business? Is Bethesda hiring?
---
If patch 22 is really coming in next month I'm gussing it's release date will be around September 62nd.
---
That was only 4 months ago and a pretty large content drop. How frequently do you need new quests and events added for free? I’ve been enjoying the ride for 900+ hours. I can wait 2 weeks for an event if it means it will  play smoothly.
---
Best value for atoms available. If you build camps, it's an easy purchase.
---
Yeah that was a barn burner man! You and I should be charging a cover price to get into this joint!
---
1 Flamingo worth of decor.
---
A little you say?
---
Screws. Ballistic fiber. Fiber optics.
---
Its funny because private servers are good simply because public servers are shit.
---
But not via the same exploit as it was before the update. It happens when you're able to replace an item with a reduced budget version. You were able to do this with floors, walls, etc. Now you do it with generators, but expect that to be fixed the same way (meaning you won't be able to replace any item with another version)
---
The fact these features are still missing is part of the reason I'm considering dropping the sub. Also, the game just isn't fun anymore. Building, which was already a chore, just became harder. No thanks.
---
Its given me something to do but its become pretty tedious. Ive got 20 levels left then i can rest until next season.
---
...And the Brotherhood event.
---
'Sadly had every plan I was awarded from all the provisions I received.'
---
Obvious. There's nothing to get.
---
The backwards compatibility on the PS5 only works for the top 100/games at launch not sure which games these are maybe worth looking into.
---
Awesome! 
---
Coming, fourth quarter of 2022... Double sided walls! 
---
Only 800 atoms.
---
4 months content drought for a live service game and constant last minute delays is embarrassing, especially when what was released 4 months ago took 2 days to go through, still broken in many parts and there's things missing that's been promised from before the game was released. Just because it's timegated behind insane rep and bullion grind doesn't make the actual content "large". Content needs to be added as frequently and fully as it's been promised if they are to maintain any trust with the community.
---
And stop it with these "it's free" nonsense. None of it is free. We paid for the game. Now the game is missing features that have been promised since launch. Some of us paid for FO 1st which is also still missing features promised from the start. Their own page says that [Legendary Run](https://imgur.com/jzBHJ9k) and [Atlas](https://imgur.com/N6bgKye) are parts of the purchase, not some free blessing. One of those was broken for a month robbing people of progress. They are part of the purchase and the download, not some additional free DLC. They specifically tell you that you pay for these features at purchase. 
---
This kind of mental gymnastics apologist mindset is why the developers are able to get away with it. Companies don't need PR departments, there's plenty of people online ready to defend all their shit practices as is.
---
Did you rename the chassis?
---
And what is the deal with Feral Ghouls? Who are these people?
---
Never noticed it before, and it's REAL obvious when it happens.  What platform are you on?  XBox here
---
The company made some bad choices , a lot of bad choices,  but from my point of view if your on this subreddit then I can only presume you play the game which in turn means they made some good choices 
---
With that I am too quite sad that people like you dont have the cojones to admit there has been some positive times instead of just negative ones ... 
---
Sometimes I have to phone up companys to fix things and I'm usually angry , but I don't scream or shout or use profanity at the call taker because there just another human that answers a phone , same with the devs who may or may not see this , they get paid to sit at a computer and code stuff because the board team ect. Decides that's what's best to do
---
I feel ya, I’ve been solo in the wastes since my team moved on to greener pastures.   35/m, heavy gunner PA tank build.   Be more than happy to have some company out there instead of doing my buddy-for-hire gig. 
---
Psn is boredomshaman
---
This is actually a great point
---
If you remove him mothman will hunt you down. When you put it on it’s on for life
---
Hey! I just started playing when Wastelanders came out, so kind of the same boat. Unfortunately, it does not appear that you can alter the brightness settings in-game.
---
Personally I like the S.C.O.R.E. Thing. 
---
I am a very casual player and don’t have the time in the week to spend half a day on anything let alone Fallout.
---
The hour to hour and a half time needed has been perfect for me, and I’m pretty excited about how much progress I’ve been able to make on the board.
---
When the Legendary Run started I thought I would be lucky to make it halfway through the first bit, but now I’m almost caught up to Zorbo!
---
&gt;Thanks for your response.  Helpful tips, but about the private server i heard thisto get the respawn. is it then not true?

---
Thank you so much, this will help me a lot!
---
This has made me get on before work everyday to knock out as much as I'm able. Boo...
---
I’ve been playing since the day of release and I love the whole FO series. In fact, 76 is really the only game I’ve played seriously since. I’m a very loyal player, buy almost everything that comes out in the Atom shop, and I’m a First subscriber. I reaaaally want that fireplace door because I love building camps, but I’m so burned out on it right now. I have to play 4-6 hours a day to level up and get all my points. Sometimes more if I have to level up in NW, too. I also work full time and have young kids and don’t want to spend 8 hours a day at my work computer and 4-6 hours a day at the Xbox just so I can get some really cool rewards.
---
You're not the first to mention power armor. I'm starting to wonder if it's a power armor glitch. I use power armor for most play, but I get out of it when I enter a conversation because of my Unyielding armor set. Things that make you go...hmm.
---
You'd be a dick too if you were deformed and fused inside of a mining suit.
---
I said this when the pass came out but people just said I was lazy. I think it’s ridiculous that they limit your progress to daily objectives. I would love if they just integrated the pass with XP earned in the world. Then add weeklies and dailies for extra S.C.O.R.E. But nah, cause then Bethesda wouldn’t have a way to incentive people to hang onto their 1st Subs.
---
Work smarter, not harder. Been playing since Beta boy-o.
---
Agreed. They already took the atoms out of dailies. So there is no point of making it so close where people begin to see the game as a chore. It's transparent how much they want to reuse the rewards in the atom shop.
---
It needs Bluetooth so people can play it with their wireless controllers... apparently that’s a thing people on pc do idk
---
Play something else, this games not worth the problem your experiencing.
---
BTW it has a nuka-cola secret door
---
Oh, so you get to keep the scrap box, tents, outfits, etc. after you unsubscribe?  I thought those benefits vanished if the subscription did.
---
Oh yes, Bethesda fucked you, they fucked you good.   
---
   
---
However, if there is ever a case of throwing good money after bad it is subbing to fo1st. It was clear early on that Beth couldn't get their shit together and buying services from them based soley on a promise that maybe, someday, they would add some features was a foolhardy mistake. You don't buy a hamburger with a promise of a bun being developed and given to you in the future. You don't buy a car hoping that manufacturer will get around to adding wheels to it a few months down the line. Don't make video game purchased based of promises that it will get better.
---
Right back at you chump.
---
Edit: lolol
---
Your level depends on legendary encounters.
---
 Most enemies that spawn in from level 50 up have a 5% chance of being a legendary enemy. If your not at least level ~80+ your chances diminish for max level items. 
---
And yes, I can prove this. Look for your pairings of enemies. Are you always encountering Super Mutant Warlords (68) and Super Mutant Overlords (48)? Charred Feral Ghouls (62) and Gangrenous Feral Ghouls (42)? Scorched Conqueror (68) and Scorched Leaders (47)? If not you aren't over level ~80+.
---
These pairings maximize your legendary drop rate significantly. Only Super Mutants will always guarantee a max level weapon or armor piece. Because most all weapons/armor max out at 45/50. Scorched legendaries are so fucking rare. I've only ever found them at Harper's Ferry and the Satellite Research place by NIRA. 
---
More than 90% of all 3 star enemies I kill will drop 3 star gear or high end 2 star gear. But something tells me your bloody? Those are just rare due to there damage output. The other 10% of weapons I get fell off of 3 star enemies are 1 star junkies/bloodied weapons? 
---
The short of it is that if you expect endgame gear at level 1-80 you're fucked unless you trade. Or get that 1%. Which is reasonable. Bloodied/junkies and unyielding/vanguard armor are rare in general. Not sure on the cavalier/sentinel. 
---
This is my personal experience repeated twice on two characters which are combined leveled 650. I really don't think its coincidence.
---
I finally visited atlas yesterday. After looking at how much steel I had and the 250 they were asking for..... I left.  Maybe today I will but my resources are low as it is
---
I love this video.
---
They will most likely be thru the atom shop so you can craft on all characters
---
This was my first reaction when I started playing this game and found out the travel costs caps. I think they took it from ESO, but as much as I hate that game it still has smarter fast travel system, there are fixed free travel points around the map. You travel to a player? You park at wayshrine for free. You need to travel somewhere from where you are? Pick a wayshrine but at a cost, unless you get to another wayshrine then travel is free. If you traveled somewhere recently, the cost is increased for next travel, but drops with time. Ofc the map there is much bigger, but adding at least 2-3 points like this would greatly reduce the stress. Even if you have over 20k caps it's still a waste to pay 40-60 caps for just traveling somewhere.
---
After unlock they should be in the atom store for free. They should then function like other atom items.
---
I'm glad you got that amount of return out of it, I expect to say the same. And our views may be different but the potential I am talking about is heavy quality of life fixes for stability, and a rework and refocus on end game content and HOW it is acquired. 
---
When most of us thought "online fallout", I'm sure it was excluding most of this FOMO and time gaiting bullshit. If they actually wanted to create an mmo lite rpg, they could have used the many games and forerunners of those mmo and rpg genres to borrow systems and structures from. Instead, they chose to go in blind.
---
All in all I just wanted to see what peoples thoughts were. If you truly have been here since release, then thats all the more reason to hear from you guys. Knowing why the vets suffered through all of bethesdas misgivings helps. I love the fallout formula so much and to see the current team in charge of it do such a misdeed in managing it hurts.
---
Word on the street is class freak is broken
---
Same here.  I’ve had the ‘need to exit and re-lock’ bug for a while.  But after this patch things are worse.  Can’t VATs lock at times.  Dropping out of VaTs for no reason.  And lots of times (with a 33% more chance shotgun) I’m suddenly only doing like 1/3 the damage I used to.  As it seems that my spread has gone to shit and instead of point blank all the bullets hitting.  Now they go out at 45 degree angles everywhere.
---
The list of free skins in game is very small and frankly would still be a little confusing. There are just too many categories of "free".
---
1. Freely earned in game skins (backpacks untradeable, but power armor skin can be applied by someone else) - Blue Ridge Backpack (riding shotgun), Safari Crocolossus backpack (limited time event treasure hunt), Possum backpack skin (possum badges and nearly identical to base tadpole skin), Power Armor Skins - Nuka T-51, Nuka X-01, BOS T-60 paints, Military X-01 I think, T-51 steel mill helmet only. I don't believe any armor or weapons has skins or paint in adventure mode in game.
---
2. Freely earned from Nuclear Winter by ranking up to 100 (but atomic shop locked so non tradeable). Check the wiki for the full list. Several power armor paints and a few weapon paints. I don't believe any backpack skins or armor skins.
---
3. Earned from Nuclear Winter during limited time events that are now gone (also atomic shop locked so non tradeable). Halloween armor skin, Snowflake armor skin, and a couple of weapon skins. No limited time power armor skins yet I believe.
---
4. Earned in seasons (1st one is the current legendary run) (also non-tradeable) - see wiki. Skins for power armor, weapons, armor and a backpack skin. Also likely to be unavailable once the season ends.
---
5. Free in atomic shop (untradeable) - they had a few twitch prime bundles that are gone now that included some weapon and armor skins. There is a free backpack skin coming this week for QuakeCon that will only be free for a few days and then gone or back to full price. This list only matters while it is currently free and would only rub it in about the past freebies you have missed.
---
There are some UI issues for sure. Checking score challenges and a few other things is too many clicks. I'd agree as well that it has quite a cluttered feel to the atom shop. I have a LOT of stuff I've got with free atoms and there should be a filter. Just like we can filter at work benches.
---
Definitely different to saying the discounts don't exist though
---
I have all but 1 UNY now and probably only rolled a max of 5-10 pieces a week for the last month or 2. Not god rolls, but most are pretty great and definitely best my combat armor pieces with a much better rng
---
The turrets. Too many turrets while repairing the reactor. I can deal with the rads, the assaultrons, the gutsys, the robobrains. Next time, I'm going in with a few thousand rounds of 5.56 and a hand-made. lol
---
It'll eventually make its way back around
---
Really?  Before I figured out the plastic-from-wes-tek-with-scrapper approach, I used to hit the Watoga High School for almost 100 plastic.
---
You reply like that all the time
---
Yeah the daily time sink is making me ignore quests because I’m chasing the dailies. Add in inventory management, and it’s just dragging. 
---
I really want that spacey PA, but I have my doubts whether I’ll making. And, I have other games to play, Bethesda. 
---
Maybe make it a point system? So as long as we bank enough points, we can exchange them for the rewards we want?
---
As I mentioned, in principle I'm with OP in that's it's a bit much that pretty much nothing has happened with these features but their argument about it being overpriced &amp; should have reflected a lower price until these features were implemented were laughable.
---
That was the thrust of my main point. If you only saw the price meeting the value with all the future proposed, you were a moron for paying upfront for something that has yet to be implemented. 
---
It's not even possible to say that you were caught off guard &amp; had your trust betrayed. Bethesda has telegraphed for a year before 1st's launch that they cannot deliver &amp; shouldn't be trusted and yet people keep throwing money at Bethesda &amp; are somehow outraged by the outcome when it was as clear as day to so many people.
---
Bethesda should work on delivering those features but it's your fault 100% for paying Bethesda before they delivered. They're never to be trusted. That should be the takeaway from this.
---
That's why a high powered melee build is so handy for farming runs.  No ammo used!
---
I got bit by a duck when I was 5
---
I was confused as well. Googled it. It seems as if before the game released people thought the space station was an orbital station meant to launch nukes to earth

You can lower this by about 3K caps if you use Hard Bargain, grape mentats, sweet roll, and booze with Charisma boost.   If you are on a team, the Magnetic Personality perk is great too.   If you don't have it, check to see if any of your teammates can share it.
---
I got all of mine by playing too many hours per day and doing cap stash runs.
---
Well thanks for everyone who tried to help but unfortunately there is no fix for this big at the time I am making this
---
Nope, you cannot which I find really weird and kinda stupid, because you can do so in photo mode.
---
There is nothing to maintain on a Junkies build.
---
Eh, they got quite a bit of new traffic with steam release and game pass, that's something. But knowing them and their track record it won't matter :/ they probably won't see it as a reason to change the current model
---
Maybe some wallpaper on that red barnwood... oh yeah never mind. On a serious note, you're the only person I've seen that takes the time to align the floor pieces so the stars match. For that 10/10
---
Yeah you provide genocide. I wouldn't say that's useful😆. I'd say you provide good target practice for an AM Rifle🤣
---
Definitely not smarter, just plain laziness and cheating pretty much. Duplication was never part of the game and they never intended for that. You probably spend a lot of time on YouTube looking exploit youtubers on FO76.
---
What does you playing since beta prove? Nothing, cuz I’ve been here since beta too “boy-o.”
---
They hang to the things that were promised when they purchased fo1st. Bethesda told them it was one thing, took their money, then changed their minds.
---
I'm keeping Mothman. Who lives in my CAMP at my cost can have the Jangles.
---
Only because you pretty much get parasite the moment they see you.
---
I was already playing at least an hour each weekday and longer in the weekends so the dailys are working well for me. Keep in mind that they want you to spend more money on cosmetics so if you can't do the dailys you gotta pay. I bet a lot of these rewards will be available later in the Atom shop too.
---
Okay, but you could totally play as you’ve described if they changed it to a weekly cumulative goal, right? You could chip away at it daily, while others could just grind it out in a day or two.
---
That way, more play styles are supported, and everyone wins.
---
Things that make you contemplate using power armour all day to test this theory 😀
---
Oh trust me this grind? it's only going to get worse.  
---
Of course handy options will be made available in the Atom store, how exciting!
---
Yes this is it.
---
You can get automations with the highly underrated FO76 sequel, “Fallout 4”, which is almost identical to FO76 except that it is single player, highly mod-friendly, and doesn’t suck.
---
So what is that thing on Mr.Fuzzy’s head?
---
what others said, just scrap the ally item. it's worse when the ally constantly uses your crafting stations, there's no way to use it until they're done, like what are they even doing there?! so because of that I had to put an ally outside of the building, so now they don't even enter my house xD
---
I am a Day 1 player, yes. 
---
If I didn't enjoy this game, I wouldn't still be playing.
---
They are either lazy or paranoid. Too lazy to fix the present loot pool or too paranoid about people duping unique rewards. Regardless, the rewards suck and I am keeping my junk
---
Whataboutism is dumb in any situation. Don’t be that guy.
---
It would be nice if there was a difference in ammo capacity depending on whether you were using an automatic receiver or not for the weapons that have the option
---
&gt;Schorched and mutants and scrapping their guns. Gives ~6 steel each at the cost of 1 or 2 bullets
---
Stick to the low level areas and kill them with a melee weapon. Be sure you're using the scrapper perk when breaking down weapons. This is the most efficient method of actively farming steel.
---
I really appreciate this man, thank you. I was going for a shark in the sky look
---
And all of the secret bonus perks. +25% swing speed on cultist blade. Faster reload. Increased sprint speed towards point pleasant. Free fast travel to Mothman places of worship. And the comraderie of the group. And don't forget the dance. Man that emote dance gets me every time. Praise the Mothman!
---
I am on Xbox. And taking a screenshot like I said is just more tedious bullshit when it should show up on the terminal like before. Just makes no sense to have changed it
---
This is who we trust behind the wheel driving the future of our video game 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Right!
---
you need to finish the wastelanders Quest line. 
---
Which i believe is progress blocked since last patch.
---
See this [POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4scul/carleton_mine_bug/).
---
Or check out this [clip](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AiixKY7lOcZMzxMSGHlVEysYJO02) showing the blocker.
---
As per last comment, try unequipping and then re-equipping class freak.  Some people claim it’s merely a visual glitch while others maintain it is actually broken.
---
Yep!
---
 I read it from the latest Bethesda F76 blog post.
---
33 Days.

---
If you have the scrapper perk card (under intelligence) you are able to get more steel out of every gun (weapon/armor) you scrap.
---
 I usually go to top of the world and kill those scorched and scrap all the junk in the buildings.
---
Get scrapped perk card and put it on when scrapping you get double steel and everything else
---
Most times with Project Paradise I end up ghoul food as I land smack into one.
---
It’s going to end right about the time it’s over.....
---
 Don't use it. It's like eating candy with a cavity.
---
I think that may be part of it, but even 300 x 4 = 1,2000 damage should have taken out an angler.  Something else is also broken.
---
If they will do stuff like this I literally have no hope for the game they got what they wanted from us ...now everyone has been playing for so long the just deal .... oh and bitch but it falls on deaf ears cause BGS looks at it like this ( “should we fix it “ nah they still play ) not that anyone cares but I canceled my 1st membership yesterday if we hit them in the pocket shit will change and if not i can go play a game for 60$ and not have to shell out more money for shit .... oh i have played since beta and have 3000 hours just fed up
---
$17.99 in Canada
---
Double sided walls:coming to a limited time 2400 atom bundle in the atom shop!
---
We've been asking for a free fast travel to Foundation and Crater once you reach Ally since Wastelander's first day. Okay maybe second day.
---
Are you going to answer my simple question? Or just rant? If you are just going to rant I’m not going to engage further.
---
Steel is one of the easiest materials to collect. Most junk and weapons contain steel. Wait till we have to collect cork!
---
If that’s quitting I quit after I preordered the game.
---
I like that idea, I played survival when there were good weapon rewards,  it was actually really fun at times, I remember about 10 of us cooperating during death blossoms, then all hell breaking loose at the end.
---
I still look back fondly on some of the battles I had
---
But we need out water cooled bonesaw.
---
Makes me want to test exiting power armor several times then server hopping. Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
Getting to build FO4-style settlements anywhere in a quadruple-sized multiplayer Fallout environment sure seemed like a total win back when it was announced.
---
Getting to build FO4-style settlements in regular old single-player FO4 seems like the better win now.
---
10 week event and I think this is week 6
---
I'm considering not renewing. I've never said I'm quitting.
---
Knowing the pattern now, they probably never actually updated the damn thing
---
It's nice to know my memory hasn't failed me yet. ;)
---
Thanks man I have a small case of ocd so I pay some attention to that stuff
---
Trouble is that dollars are the only metric that Bethesda actually sees. As long as they are making money everything is fine as is and there is no reason to fix or improve it. By giving them money one gives them the confirmation that, yes, this is the kind of game and service one wants. They have zero incentive to look any further than that.
---
I’ve been saying this since the beta. This game desperately needs bot buddies. (And a FightBot Club, but we don’t talk about that.)
---
Wait so what is that in millimeters?
---
I only ever have to travel to and from my survival tent. Once the nuke drops I travel straight to the tent, and I don’t have to leave that location until the fallout ends. Just exit and enter server. Never have to travel away to get things to work. If my stay put method works, traveling away then jumping server would also work. But that takes up more of your farming time. Have dropped a good 25 to 30 nukes to farm in this way and haven’t  had any problems. The only thing you ever have to deal with is everything being dead upon your first arrival. All you have to do is jump server and hop right back in and things are A-OK. You could also pre-run any of these places and kill whatever is there then your first visit post nuke will have things up and running also. I’d rather save the bullets and time. Totally up to you how you want to handle that process. Good luck to you, farming WS can yield some great legendaries!
---
&gt; $14 a month virtual storage... Yikes.
---
No.  $14 a month for private servers.  Let's be very honest here - that's the cost to Bethesda.  I get people think about the perks (scrapbox, tent) - but really;  it's the private servers that cost them money to offer it.
---
I had issues since the update.
---
Or the rest of the game for that matter.
---
You seem to have an extensive knowledge about game breaking glitches
---
If your hunting Weapons, load the scrapper perk. If you’ve got a copy of guns and Bullets 5, you’ll get even more. I’ve been able to get up to 40 from heavy weapons.
---
Maybe it’s only broken for some mutations. I have 351 carry weight which falls in line correctly with the -2(ish) I get from Bird Bones and Egg Head. 
---
Egg head gives me -1 STR and Bird bones shows as &gt;-1.  And my Ultracite GL hasn’t lowered in damage since the patch and I had grounded on before and after. So I suspect it’s either something else or only some mutations are broken.
---
Good game. Supposedly there’s an expansion coming up unless it already dropped. Might need to play that again
---
The original statement was that it would be "at least a year" after launch, with heavy emphasis on the "at least" part. I've been operating under the assumption it's the lowest thing on the totem pole of importance, and probably won't get pushed out until they hit a slump for other content (or a programmer has a eureka moment).
---
I already answered your question - as frequently and completely as promised. Not delayed and half-assed.
---
Yes there’s over 100 items in the game that give steel outside of weapons and armor.
---
Thanks, man I try to keep up with that stuff
---
I posted the same thing like several hours ago, but people more like some raging, or *im quitting* posts, this thread gonna die like mine lol. But talking about real problem, not some walls
---
Do they still charge for it? I though it was basically f2p at this point.
---
Probably A....but I liked the sound of BJ the day before 🤭
---
Visual bug. Very easy to test and see if you compare your specials before/after removing/putting back the class freak.
---
The marshalls attack you for a reason.  They are part of a different quest. 
---
IIRC, you have to read the arrest warrant (lootable from the marshalls) to start that quest.
---
I have a bad feeling it’s gonna be a limited time atom shop bundle exclusive item...
---
Mods are going to spike this post but I wouldn't be at all surprised if we don't see that feature in the main game this year.
---
They've already delayed the Colossal Problem event twice now. Why should we expect any different for any other feature.
---
I did it solo first time when I was slightly above lvl 50. If you have good gear and good amount of stimpacks to heal yourself then it's not that difficult. Most people say it's even easier solo. It might be a bit hard at the final stage with nuke launch prep, but not too much.
---
Enclave gang, Enclave gang
---
It's only visual. Been tested extensively by people here on this sub and youtubers.
---
Doesn't look that bad! Not sure if you have the beer stein thing from the last fasnacht event. It's under floor deco and I like to turn 2 chairs together with 2 beer steins on the bar. I don't like all chairs straight at the bar you know what I mean? Maybe some succulents too on that bar if you have them from atom shop. But otherwise I can't say how to improve more
---
Well, as for the OP, he was foolish enough to pay for a year up front. Really shot himself in the foot on that one.
---
Weak and inconsistent calendar aside, I do want to point out that they’re giving us two free items. Sure, one is just a re-skin, but the other is a pretty fun backpack, but at least it’s not just another round of lazy player icons no one uses.
---
Class freak is not broken, its only a visual bug which has existed in some way for several patches. The mutation lists do not show the reductions, but your actual SPECIAL stats do reflect the changes. If you read the threads posted about it, they come to this conclusion but the posts don't get the same upvotes that bitching and whining about stuff being broken get.
---
The same as the conversion rate from Schrute Bucks to Unicorn Nickels.
---
Get upvotes on threads and comments you make.
---
I looked at the official numbers just before posting this. I'll update the dailies in a few minutes and apply the new (108.86m) as well.
---
Okay good, sorry if I double posted. But more attention on this issue the better I think?
---
This might be of interest. Don't really feel like posting the same thing again.
---
Upvote for your Karma.
---
I have the beer steins but I don’t have the plans and I can’t find them anywhere, but thanks for the idea!
---
Steel Dawn: The BOS is back and grouchy because their base sucks. 
---
They're going to be even more angry when they realize they can only put wallpaper on one interior wall side.
---
If youve been stocking up on the 2 handed melee perks I would recommend just making a couple of baseball bats and trying to get a puncturing rocket mod on it. Even with a base version the damage output, swing speed and armor negation should make it an easy fight. Running dodgy and blocker are probably good as well
---
are they doing any tracking for the items delivered?  
---
It was nice to see that with the scorched and schorced beast kills.
---
Yeah, you guys were right it was that. No more guitars allowed in my house. No more NPCs constantly using my stuff, making noise and opening my doors.
---
I feel the same way. mind you i'm at fault for one shooting the bastards myself. i go in with my instigating shotgun, use VATS and always seems to be a one shot kill. if i don't VATS it takes multiple shots. but when there are several moleminers coming at once hitting VATS just becomes a normal reflex. 
---
i actually had someone scream at me over the mic for it once. being decent human being i apologized for it not meaning any harm just happens to be my normal reflex in most events, almost everyone else there was cool with it but this one dude just wouldn't let it go even after i offered to give him the 1\* legendary it dropped.
---
Well he isn't wrong about Bethesda never committing to when fo1st members would get those things. Technically, fo1st subs got everything they payed for.
---
They could fuck up bottling water next to a tap.
---
I'll finish the legendary run - already most the way through it, so will see it through.
---
After that, I'm moving onto a different game. Maybe I'll be back. Will keep on eye on how it develops.
---
I was already getting quite jaded with the game and bored with lack of meaningful content, but the CAMP changes really clinched it.
---
I've turned my Fallout First subscription off, it'll lapse in a couple of weeks.
---
Pretty nice, but you are missing a few tables in the open area to give it that dive feel
---
Uranium Fever. Tag everything. Loot everything. Scrapper Perk. Scrap everything. 
---
Also, never discount the coat hangers found in Whitesprings and the Golf Course clubhouse.
---
Thanks. I am pretty sure I have most of the mods. Do you know how much I could use having preset loadouts for this!? Ugh. Regardless, yes, I have a lower level melee build that still uses a basball bat. Puncturing rocket eh? I'll look out for it. Thanks!
---
Great review. The Run has been one of my favorite additions to the game. I'm on level 75.
---
Why would they? they clearly do not give a fuck.
---
If they’re prepared to *really* work to regain the community’s trust...
---
Perhaps, but it was the rest of the community that complained that the extras that were cut out was not fair as they were things that were wanted all along. So they cut them out and changed things. I have FO1st and don’t feel that the originally promised stuff should be given exclusively to FO1st members. It should be for everyone who plays the game.
---
Nice list. I can probably add a few bugs if I think about it. 
---
I disagree with your take on power armor though. It's tanky but not tanky enough to be overpowered. I lose gun fights to non-pa players a lot more than pa players. I still usually don't even pick it up because it gives me a bigger hit box and reduces my accuracy. 
---
If anything in the game is overpowered it's explosives.
---
15 times? One distant thunder gave me like 3500 steel (with tent abuse)
---
Why am I not the least bit surprised.
---
At least we have a 'before' roadmap to compare all the changes to.
---
I only dare to travel there when I am at full health and in PA... too many times I ended up in the cages with the ghouls...
---
Those bastards know that someone will spawn there, and they are waiting their food...
---
Damn, you aren't kidding. You have -1. You should probably get better at Reddit. Mostly, karma is useless but sometimes you meet someone with NONE.
---
you get one point per comment unless you get downvoted. Try checking out some friendlier subreddits and participating in the discussions.
---
If you use aid items and buffs to crank your intelligence up, like berry mentats, you level much faster. Right now I'm walking around with a 56 intelligence. Even without lunchboxes I am getting about 500 to 700 XP per super mutant. So events like scorched earth I will hit the repeatable weekly challenge 3 or 4 times. This makes you advance much more rapidly.
---
If something is not on the internet there's a server in discord, they have a lot of useful info and it doesn't matter what platform you're on. I used to be there as a new player and I found out a lot of useful information.
---
You have to craft them in the tinkers workbench  and place them on the beer stien display outside of build mode. You'll have both unlocked if you completed 1 fasnacht event
---
I find it easier alone. So yes.
---
I don't like pranking players with punch bowls, i leave whiskey out for players who equip party boy and triple the effects of alcohol after buying my stuff at the vendors. I also leave my lead/junknodes unlocked and water purifiers so players can help themselves. Also sell all ammo for 1 cap, just not stocked well.
---
Try to make my base as newbie friendly as possible, it's always hard starting out.
---
That's why I said it's optional you iliterate stupid fool

Before online gaming, DLC was about the same price as the game, give or take, or more likely there was none... and no patches either, so your game breaking bug remained forever. You also had much smaller crews for much less complex games selling for the exact same price games sell for now.
---
The choice is simple. If you want AAA games, get used to it, because that keeps them afloat now. Or did you also forget just how many of yesteryear's game companies folded or got bought by EA?
---
If that vexes you, do as I do and focus on non-AAA games. The one great thing about modern game programming is that you can do simple games like sidescrollers and the like easily enough.
---
i quite,just play some other mmo,such as eso,swtor.
---
I'm just waiting to see if they come back to a shitty base and Russell try to explain it. 
---
"Well, you see.... I ask some vault dwellers to donate ludicrous amounts of scrap for some water and some ivory grip plans. For some reason, they just didn't donate... can I join plz." 
---
Then he gets reduced to ashes for trespassing.
---
I just dont craft often so i dont know where to find most things. Obviously getting steel is quick, its getting as much steel as possible from the fewest items! And yeah, i dont even know where cork SPAWNS.
---
Yeah I’m planning on expanding it soon since it’s currently too small to do that
---
Thanks for the info! Any idea if that upcoming backpack skin just going to be on atomic shop or it's gonna be something like a twitch drop that you can claim later in atomic shop? might be a stupid question but I just want to be sure xD
---
So they aren’t allowed to miss a deadline? Have you ever missed a deadline at work or had work pushed out? Particularly, have you ever had to delay a project because the quality wasn’t up to snuff?
---
Of course you are. But that’s how we get things done. If you want someone to know they’re an ass, you just shove yours where it doesn’t belong. Eventually they’ll get the memo.
---
Bethesda never actually promised those things in any concrete way. Technically fo1st subs got everything they payed for and wishful thinking doesn't hold up well in court.
---
Whenever we need anything it always comes back to Uranium Fever, huh?
---
Same here on XB1 🙋🏻‍♂️
---
Yep and they’re not going to spend the time on wastelanders and the bos content coming up to bin it off in July next year.
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
Oh, I just noticed, you are the maker. Thank you so much for this tool!
---
Why the hell did you get downvoted 😂
---
I edited my reply mate, yes its better, so its okay to post another
---
By all vaults would that include Whitespring bunker because that would be great honestly
---
Yes but you and everyone else is leaving out how it gets done in under 10 minutes. The OP, along with all other posts seem to be doing it without any sketchy moves.
---
Donated 15k steel.  Took 120 button clicks.  The care packages were flashing on my screen for 20 minutes.  I open them to find I'm overweight, so I have to drop all the alcohol.  Got 1 plan I didn't know.
---
No, no I won't be donating anymore
---
I think the one wasteland update is the next major evolution in fallout 76 that bethesda is basing all their content on. It's a combat overhaul essentially where glowing mythic deathclaws are probably always going to hard regardless of your build. I think they are removing weapon levels as well...Hold on to your level 35 god tier drops!
---
Also if they are making all the content for one wasteland update then that explains why the updates leading up to it are kinda shit. The whole game is about to get re-balanced.
---
Available in a bundle for 2000 atoms
---
It’s crazy you guys call this a grind. You’ve never seen a real grind. You can do most of the daily’s in an hour or less. It’s a joke.
---
you get a care package (similar to a gift) for every 250 items you donate. So for my 1750 steel which was just taking up space in my stash I got like a dozen stimpacks, a bunch of caps,a bunch of radaway, some plans (even a couple I didn't have) and (sadly) a bunch of those floater grenades, which I now just toss at things to see if they do any good (they don't)
---
Scorched beast brains. However, cranberry relish basically has little to no effect with that mutation. I would go with herbivore and use brain bombs and cranberry relish. It just works better. Cranberry relish alone is giving me a 25% XP boost.
---
Only workarounds are joining a team(public or private) or go to your social tab and look up recents. If you remember any of the names on there you should be able to join their world.
---
1 shooting mobs is ok
---
Not cool to 1 shot legendary
---
And get over it it happens. Or nuke the base
---
Yeah those small business loans in the wasteland are a pain in the ass
---
There is a strange narrative that has floated around here that Bethesda needs more money to develop the game and if players don't pay for things that aren't in the game yet those things will never be added. How a company the size of Bethesda fooled these people into giving handouts is beyond me.
---
Geez, resorting to whataboutism to excuse this. No point in continuing. If I turned in a project in this state still after multiple delays with half the shit missing, I'd have no job. Neither would you. Stop excusing it.
---
So everyone is the asshole here, well at least I’m glad I’m not the only one. 
---
Though I don’t like being one but I’m forced to be
---
That is without sketchy moves. And the only time I've done one. Took me all of 10 minutes
---
At a bare minimum we'd need to see the senior management team fired. Without that, we won't see any change, for better or worse.
---
Bethesda has demonstrated time and again that there is no deadline that they won't overshoot &amp; that no good feature goes unpumished.
---
Doing the same thing over and over isn’t content. I’ve been playing this game since reclamation day and all I ever get from the queen is mr. handy buzz blades, vanguard combat chests, and ultracite plans. Repeating the same tasks over and over to get the best gear is a joke. The legendary run is a joke. I’m not going to use like 80% of the stuff on the board. I’m a bloodied unarmed build. Why do I need 5 PA skins and a couple of gun skins? I have fallout first, why do I need scrap kits?
---
Me too
---
Bro. You don’t have to play 4-6 hours a day. Make a new character to get your level ups quickly. Use your noggin please.
---
A bugged release from Bethesda?. They’re a company of entomologists at this point.
---
I'm just happy they removed this atrocity.  I mean did you see what theses people were doing with this glitch how dare the largest part of fallouts community making such beautiful camps, fucking bastards, you know I can't count how many servers that I had been on that this glitch single handedly crashed. In Tod we trust Amen..........
---
Didn't bother to read the entire text but here's the thing...
---
No, you are not an asshole.
---
The way the things have been since wastelanders hit is that it's first come first serve now. If you try to wait until someone gets a tag, they will one shot the enemies (legendary or not) themselves. That is just the way it is now. And it is bughesda fault not players.
---
I personally don't care about it anymore. I see something, i will kill it. You didn't get a chance to hit it while you were looting rad rats and admiring the view then sorry, not my problem. If i didn't get to tag that one legendary mob that spawned in, i also don't care as it was my fault i wasn't ready and expecting the spawn.
---
I'm level 49. I really want the Outcast paint job
---
To be clear: You keep the scrap box, but can't add to it. You keep the cosmetics and emotes, and any atoms from it. You lose the tent and access to private servers.
---
So, in my opinion, regular enemies are free reign to kill as quickly as you want but legendaries should be tagged and left alive for others. Others may disagree about the regular enemies, but there is only so much I can handicap myself. That being said, it is very easy to get caught up in the moment and accidentally kill stuff that you only meant to tag. Maybe he wasn't thinking about it. I have definitely one-shotted things I meant to tag by accident. I would have let it go if it was only the one legendary, but if it was repeated on other legendaries, then yeah all bets are off.
---
Honestly? No not really. The game is fun in its own way but I think 76's problem is honestly Starfield. All of the companies focus is on that with not enough people working on 76. The time between patches is way too long, for either content or bug fixes. They consistently come across the same glitch over and over, then only bandaid fix them. (Which might suggest it's either a engine issue or the fact that the entire game is server based). I can't get friends to play the game because optimization is so poor that it's hard to get 30 fps sometimes. QA is basically non existent. There's no anti cheat for NW and NW hasn't changed since it's released. Every time they fix one thing another thing breaks, I could honestly go on. Hell you could probably get a bunch of modders from 4 and have the game fixed in a month. I think Bethesda's upper management either doesn't care and is more focused on Starfield or doesn't understand, and I'm leaning towards the former.
---
From inside the vault last week. No idea if is goes away forever or of might come back and charge for it later.
---
CLAIM FREE LOOT

To celebrate QuakeCon, we’re adding the new Beelzebilly Outfit and the Mr. Demonic Backpack to the Atomic Shop for free all weekend long! Head in-game to claim yours starting at 11:00 a.m. CT on Thursday, August 6, before they leave the Shop on August 10.
---
The only time I use sketchy moves is to get in to people's locked camps haha
---
So all I have to do is comment and I’ll get karma?

I hate to give away my secrets, but adhesive, aluminum, lead, plastic- all are in abundance in the asylum. Surgical trays are lying all over the floors, tape and glue out and in drawers, toys are weirdly in lots of containers and on the ground, and all of the enamel buckets have plastic. I run this every time I log on, and also collect the straight jackets to sell for 40-50 caps apiece, depending on if I can be bothered to change perk cards.
---
You need to be hacking the computers and shutting the turrets down. No need to be wasting ammo on them.
---
I don't know if you've seen [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4951h/recent_camp_fixes_in_update_21/)-- they've said they're "looking into" making double-sided walls and other build changes, and while it's nice to know there's a plan, obviously there's no concrete info on when and how we can expect them to be implemented. I personally wouldn't hope for more than the instanced interiors update or so. :/
---
Okay, that makes sense, thanks. But I'm pretty sure people were playing this game using wireless controllers even before August 4 patch (which does not mention 'wireless' or 'bluetooth' at all)
---
Well fuck, one of you two read it and copy/paste it here because I don't know who to believe any more (and I'm too lazy to find it myself.)
---
Can you give exact details about what is causing server disconnecting issue? And can you show that these issues are mainly internal and in Bethesda’s side only?
---
Yeah I was about to edit my post saying it’s visual. I usually make tables of weapon damage so I know if it’s applying correctly and on the effects screen it says -50% NRG gun damage but mine is still reduced by ~-12%.
---
I get it. It stinks.
---
What would happen though is after those that grinder it out in a day or two, those same players would start complaining that they couldn’t do more or level more. It’s always going to be a cycle of casuals, hardcore, and no middle ground because the 2 play styles are extremely far apart.
---
How do we know how much has been donated? Can we see if there is any way we can actuallt get to 125 Million pieces of scrap?
---
So it's ok to pay for poor quality services when you have too much money? Again, sweet yourself but dont be surprise if nothing gets better, then. I'd rather play f2p for a while than validating bethesda's behaviour.
---
&gt; FO76 is no more buggy than any other ES/FO game, so it was pretty much on par with what I expected. 
---
On that point, I disagree strongly. I played FO3, NV, FO4, Morrowind, Skyrim and even TESO for more than a year (pre-ordered the imperial edition and paid the membership for a whole year, also participated to some beta weekends) and let me tell you that FO76 is far more buggy than all those games combined. (and the bugs of the previous games were highly situational ... they did not systematically appear during each and every game session like it's the case for FO76)
---
Ok, the previous fallout games did had bugs ... some were small, some were huge, but thanks to the modding community, there was a way to fix them. We all know Bethesda isn't good at fixing their things and the fact that FO76 is still a buggy mess 2 years after it's release shouldn't be surprise. Too bad for us, the modding community is powerless here and we rely solely on Bethesda. 
---
BTW, speaking about their other titles, I played TESO for pretty much one and a half year and I never had to complain about anything. The game mostly had balancing problems but can they be blamed for that? They have  multiple classes, races, a ton of skill lines and item sets ... it's obviously a nightmare to balance things well on these kind of games. They also had bugs during the launch and some quests could get broken and unfinishable  but it took them 2 weeks top to fix them on top of the more urgent bugs. So, saying that FO76 is as buggy as the rest is, IMO, absolutely not true.
---
I got the Jangles BP and I really like it. It looks pretty good with the jet pack - I would've liked the Mr. Pebbles BP, maybe someday.
---
i did it with an axe
---
You card 😂
---
But the devs have been so gracious as to grant us the ability to spend real money on skipping ranks so we can catch up!
---
The cap on vendor caps especially.  After playing for about 15 min I’m scrapping weapons and armor due to inability to sell them.
---
Like you, I specialize in leaving a sliver of health. I've gotten pretty good at it. With legendaries, I let them aggro on me and lead them around. At a high level it is ridiculously easy. There is no excuse for one shoting anything. Accidents do happen, crits do tend to kill stuff a bit quickly, but your story is a classic. Three cheers for the good guy!
---
Are you using a stealth strategy?  Or power armor?
---
The Grounded mutation cuts incoming energy damage in half.  I highly recommend it.
---
Yes, do it all the time.  My first nuke run (with a friend) was exhausting.  But once you learn where everything is, and how to do the run effiiciently, it's actually a fun little "dungeon" to run.
---
Hints:  have a high power Troubleshooter weapon (I use a plasma caster) to take out turrets.  Use a melee build to cut down on ammo used to take out the bots.  If you take a lot of damage, find Troubleshooter armor (a full set makes you nigh invulnerable to robots).  Mapping out the base will make your runs a &gt;lot&lt; easier.
---
Oh God I hope its F) it will never come into this game. The patch I have so much fear for. They don't even get the easiest things fixed, but they want to overhaul the complete gameplay with the scale? I got the feeling this will be the last patch for fo76 until the game is totally broken haha
---
So we’re either gonna get exterior wallpaper skins in the Atom Shop next month, or we’re going to be stuck with this system for a year at the minimum. Seriously, with how long it takes them to fix even the most game breaking bugs, I’m really not going to hold my breath for this one.
---
He is right though. It takes little to no effort to finish the dailies. 
---
Complete an event (do manhunt)
---
Level up Once (make a new alt for it)
---
Buy items from players (Lawd haha)
---
Eat bubblegum (laaaaaaaawd)
---
The shit is trivial and as far from a grind as you can possibly get.
---
You’re not just an asshole, you’re a fucking asshole
---
You know games had patches before online gaming right?
---
I'm doing it on 4, while also trying to grind gold on 15 of the 20 characters I play. I'm losing my sanity, but that's my fault.
---
All the plans are same as the heavily duped xmas presents server hop a few times and you'll see those vendors with hundreds of plans.
---
What's worse is not only the loot table the same as those presents its watered down version.
---
Do a stage for the instruments! 
---
Little bit of imagination and right kind of tables you get nice elevated stage. I used one of the office desks and put few of them together. Then some lights and voila!
---
Don’t do it then. Last time I checked , you don’t need the rewards to play the game.
---
This. 
---
People seem to think hours played us an indicator for value for whilst ignoring all the poor service, missed deadlines, unimplemented or poorly implemented features and expect us to be thankful for it.
---
If Bethesda was in any other industry, their actions would have lead to a lot of people being fired and compensation for customers affected.
---
Lousy Smarch weather...
---
Yeah I bought the last few ranks too. I only did the NW that were deploy a camp. Overall I enjoyed it, but I hope next time they make the weekly challenges a little more challenging.
---
Two items I know of that have cork are Crystal Decanters and Globes. I'm sure I could google it, but where's the fun in that?
---
Don't fall for the fear of missing out. It's just a backpack and it will probably be back next time they do mothman shit. Check the greatest hits on Tuesdays. You might even find it discounted 
---
If you're on PC I have the crock backpack and the blue mountain backpack for sale 😁
---
That’s what I’m thinking as well. IMHO they have seriously overestimated just how much scrap will be donated by what’s left of the player base.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been a diehard BOS fan since Fallout 1 and am excited to see them arrive in Appalachia, but those numbers they have come up with are ridiculous.
---
Right, but even he didnt prioritize technology over the mission or civilians, otherwise, they would have raided the Institute before atomizing it. Jeremy Maxson would be the closest to your example, a radical, even amongst the Brotherhood, who was one of the main agitators of the NCR-Brotherhood War.
---
Over 1 million steel already. This community never ceases to amaze me.
---
If update 21 is delayed or is a flop like 20 I will take a long break from the game. Otherwise my play time has simply been cut in half now since this update sucked and I’m replaying older games that I haven’t touched in a while. I personally recommend doing that to everyone reading. Replay your old games and re-explore the great stories and gameplay. I’m playing dishonored again and am finding news ways to tackle levels, very fun!
---
You mean 100 million right?
---
To be clear: The hit box is the same size and shape as the paper bag, and is focused on one of the ends of the bag (fairly sure it's the end that faces the direction you were facing when it was dropped).
---
Fuck doing 4. 2 is enough for me takes up so much time along with everything else
---
Just watch the enemy game piece on the board. He takes a step forward every day. As long as you can keep ahead of him by a few spots you’ll be good to complete the event.
---
Why should any of these have limits in the first place?
---
I don't buy it, I time my self and I use the photo mode to get through the two doors and my best time is 9:36. And some how you manage to repair all the pipes, cores and destroy cores all in 30 seconds. The launch prep room alone takes 7 minutes.
---
Maybe they are trying to simulate that with the VATS bug?
---
Came here to say the exact same thing.
---
i didn't know instigating weapons, unyielding armour, and the ninja perk were mutations - colour me shocked.
---
Why does it bother you? People are angry &amp; upset, it is their right to express their views. 
---
Also stating “I’m going to play less frequently” or “I’m only playing until something better comes out” does not have the same ring to it.
---
The intent of their message is to express their displeasure, who are you to write a “don’t let the door hit you on the arse on the way out” post?
---
So you got it working now? When I was playing around with the tool, I didn't set the dest language and it generated the strings only for French by default.
---
Raider collectron is well worth it imo. Rain collector is great for RP
---
Or just remove them.  While I'm sure they have some reason claiming it's to fight duping, the limits are dumb and only hamper gameplay.
---
Not me.
---
I swear to god, just when I think they've run out of ways to make me laugh they come up with some new and creative way to fuck things up lol. Be it incompetence or apathy, Bethesda sure knows how to bungle a project.
---
No it’s really just about getting rid of duped materials and it won’t work, duper’s will keep their junk and I honestly think bethesda will just give us the rewards anyway, let’s be honest.
---
Lol. From booze to a 3 star legendary by doubling the amount given? Total greed. Like there’s not enough legendaries in the game.
---
I’ll be in a group or public team and one of them will get disconnected every once in a while, sometimes it’s just one, sometimes 2 or more. I’ll join a public team and I’ll get disconnected, come back and see that there’s only 1 out of the 4 of us that managed to stay on. What’s causing it? Well I can’t tell you, which is why I’m trying to bring more attention to it. How is it internal? Because it’s not just happening to me, myself, and I. It happens to different friends I play with on any given day.
---
Hey thanks for the link, I had a feeling they were planning to add double sided walls, my only fear is that they are either for 1st members only, or are added to the atom store.
---
I made a post the other day and discussed this back ad forth with a couple redditers, I have a conspiracy that this was done as a way to sell solutions to the players, I hope I'm wrong.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3rg6p/the_reason_they_removed_the_wall_trick_for_camps/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Okay, maybe 15 then haha. Either way it doesn't take long
---
:o it actually works, thanks for the help
---
after all this time..... nylon bag again....and the cycle goes on...
---
Not a clue. It's getting tiresome having everyone telling me what I should be doing with my account. The bugs, I deal with and accept them as part of the game. I rarely build at my camp, so all this outrage over walls/CAMP building doesn't affect me. I hate going to elaborate CAMPs, where they need 10 cutouts to point you to the vendors. If you have more than one, you have too many (IMO).
---
The only reason I can think about is to make sure you will log in each da if you wanna may out everything...
---
Hey! I’m not a bro, I’m a 47 year old mom who normally doesn’t get a lot of time to play and commit that kind of time to it, and I also just like to play free range and wander around the wasteland so a) I suck at combat and only play melee so that already gives me a disadvantage and b) I never know the cool tricks. 
---
So that said... if I use another character, will I get the rewards in the inventory for all of my characters? Even things like GB? Or is that just for apparel and camp items? Either way, that’s a pretty perfect solution for next season but right now I’m close to the chicken coop and that was another one I wanted, so I can’t start over this season.
---
The goals per event are the reward, the boxes during individual drops are just icing. They could have said we get nothingunless we hit the number.
---
Yeah I am not sure I increasing limits is the only solution. Maybe get rid of the limits would be better...
---
Excuse me. To clarify: Before the internet grew to the point of offering patches to download. With the rare exception of companies who could afford to send out game-breaking bug fixes to customers who knew enough to ask, or sometimes slipped into a gaming magazine's bonus disc (remember them?), patches generally did not happen.
---
(EDIT: never mind console gamers. Still remember the bloody Super Mario Brothers door bug)
---
Thats what she asked!  I had to lol
---
I want this too but I feel like it will never happen. They have their model on how to maximize players logging in daily. It sucks but they need to should their overlords the numbers and that’s what matters
---
AFAIK after cancellation, you will still have your fo1st until the billable date, but you won't be charged for another year.
---
And I also don’t mean to be rude to the Bethesda team, mocking them about their decisions because I don’t know what they’re planning for the long run. But I’m just trying to amuse myself while I suck it up and just avoid workshops from now on. Downvote me please 🤩.
---
You can still get a legendary through donating the base amount, just a 50% chance.
---
Which I don't understand. By being on the board he should be the gauge on where you are in completing in time.
---
If you are behind him you won't finish on time. 
---
If you are ahead of him you will finish on time.
---
If you are on the same piece you are right on schedule.
---
Having him advance one spot each day if it doesn't actually coordinate with the end of the event is just dumb as shit.
---
For some reason my dumb ass figured that since this was already in fo4 that of course it would be part of 76 right at launch. Whoops :p
---
Well that’s what happed. Can you tell what caused it?
---
there's many "should"s with Bethesda and 76.
---
The time spend ingame doing the "chores" is in no way gaming, engaging or fun.  If you think Fallout 76 is a hardcore game then you are a casual gamer
---
I’ll try that thank you!
---
Let’s start at the launch, in was so bad it was practically illegal, not just the game but pretty much everything that had to do with the game. Nuka Dark, bags, helmets, customer service. 
---
A game company sold a less than acceptable game in a less than acceptable way. No matter much you liked the game, it was an objective fact that fallout 76 was not properly functioning. It just don’t work Todd. 
---
However, it was not yet the end for fallout 76. They could still turn things around by fixing bugs and adding cool new content. 
---
And they did. As much as they could. Just not in the best way. And a lot of changes bethesda brought made a lot of people unhappy. They also did good changes. Adding npc was good. 
---
Yet I can’t seem to understand people who are ok with this situation. You have the right to like the game, you have the right to play it for as long as you like. But you can’t say it’s good. It is nowhere near as good as what it was supposed to be, what it should have been. A company should make sure its products function correctly before selling them. You know that expensive medical equipment you bought? Yeah, not working yet, might fix it in a year, if you pay the suscription we’ll have to money to take care of that even if most of it will go to the ceo’s salary or something. Yeah, games are not quite the same as medical equipment. It’s a matter of principle. Do not sell a product that does not work, do not make the customer pay for fixing mistakes that should have never been easely avoided.
---
You can enjoy the game. That’s a great thing if you liked the time you spent on it. But you should expect more than what fallout 76 is. It is an objectively bad game made with a lot of bad decisions. People who are ok with fallout 76 are people who are ok with mysery, who do not demand greatness out of things. The rocket exploded halfway and missed the moon but close enough we had fun while doing it. Now let’s make a rocket that goes to Mars. You will not achieve anything without better expectations. You harm the franchise and the gaming industry by thinking the enjoyment you get out of fallout 76 makes it right, makes it okay, makes it any good. 
---
In its current state, fallout 76 is a mediocre game. It is a game you can enjoy, it is a game that you can sink a lot of time into, but it is not, under any circumstances, a good game. 
---
The recent patch shows that the people in charge of the game do not know what their players want and do not understand what is wrong with their game. It was clear from launch that the people in charge of fallout 76 were not really good at making decision, even worse, failed to correctly follow bad directions. I do not know how people can still expect the game to become good if after 2 years the team still struggles to make a patch that does not lit a garbage fire.
---
Bethesda doesn’t care.
---
Sorry to be a cynical dick, but they really don’t. They got everyone’s money and gave you what they felt like giving you. 
---
Gonna stop paying now? Good! Still, Bethesda got what they wanted from everyone and will just keep rolling along.
---
They screw you here, and they’ll screw you with more glitchy patches, and Bethesda fans are going to just keep bending over and taking it while saying “They’ll fix it! It’ll get better!”
---
Why?
---
Because, to borrow some language from the carneys: YOU ARE A MARK! 
---
They know they don’t have to deliver on things anymore, because they know people will keep paying to keep things like Fallout and Elder Scrolls alive, because you are a mark, and they’re gonna keep treating you like a mark until you wake up and decide: Know what? Elder Scrolls 6? I’m gonna pass on it because I know Bethesda is going to half ass it.
---
It won’t happen, but I can dream of a better world.
---
Be sure to buy Skyrim on the PS5!
---
If that's true its just sad... I think its also from management point of view not a good choice because I think it's not good for long term aspects
---
This really should be a class action lawsuit. It’s blatant false advertising and the fact that they changed it means they have no intention of making those Fallout 1st perks. Everyone who purchased a year while those perks were advertised should be entitled to a rebate.
---
I stopped once I got the UFO playground at rank 26 or something, logging on everyday just to get a colored skin-tight suit with a ball helmet at rank 99 or something might not be worth the grind.
---
When dis they say they were removing weapon levels?
---
You missed the point. A 3 star legendary from doing the easiest thing in the game? It’s ridiculous OP
---
It *does* coordinate with the end of the event
---
This is hardly a reasonable review. You paid for the last 10 ranks. You literally skipped more than 10% (probably closer to 15-20%) of the gameplay required to acquire those final ranks.
---
For the next season, do the complete run without paying anything to skip a solid chunk of it &amp; tell us then how feasible it is for the average person to complete.
---
I'd rather craft a bunch of ammo than donate all that steel, or even sell it at a vendor for the caps.
---
Re-read my last comment and you’ll get your response.
---
DoNt Do It ThEn
---
don't like my comment? last time i checked, you don't need to reply to it to read the thread.
---
This is the only logical outcome.
---
This has been happening to me on PS4. Every time I do Line in the Sand it happens a few waves in and gets to the point where I can barely move. I just work my way (slowly) to the road so I can at least hit the SB. It doesn’t help that it has been spawning all of the enemies in the center instead of the road. The exp is nice but it has become almost unplayable.
---
Has one that nuked every rad roach it saw. Then I was trying to save that silver shroud nut and couldn't save him and couldn't save him and decided to just say fuck it to trying. Brought the robot in expecting the guy to die and just wanting to finish the quest but to my surprise the bot was able to just nuke the whole place before the baddies got a shot off.
---
West Tek Research Center is the best place to quickly get steel from weapons.
---
I solo solos all the time. Just get a troubleshooter weapon And it’ll go even faster haha. Use anti armor perks and you’re set.
---
Crazy lucky
---
Infinite budget camps do lag out servers, so glad you understand the need for that fix lol
---
I’m enjoying wastelanders so far, but damn thats a really stupid feature, or lack-thereof
---
Bump
---
And this is where I grew up
---
I think the present owner fixed it up
---
I never knew we'd ever went without
---
The second floor is hard to sneakin' out
---
who said you HAD to?  Ten weeks for a season is plenty of time to get the ranks without needing to be on every day, that’s your choice :)   The people who do go on every day deserve the motivation as well lol...
---
At this point the term “Karma Whoring” is Karma Whoring right below “Circle Jerk”. 
---
Some people will stop playing, some won’t. Not many better options out there. When Cyberpunk 2077 is released more people will leave &amp; Bethesda will have a more difficult job of retaining them because of perceived slights like the latest patch.
---
A story as old as the game. Personally during rad rumble I just mow everything down however I am normally there with 2-3 others in my public team so someone gets a tag on a legendary so we all get it.   
---
I try and be courteous and sweep the legs during events like uranium fever and encrypted, but rad rumble is a shit show all the time kill kill kill if not gathering ore.
---
People thought they were gonna do this with dirt tiles too, but we got that behind the buillon grind
---
It’s the same for me, I mostly get to play on the weekends once the wife and kids are sleeping. Since finding a good farming route I’m constantly stocked with crap legendary gear that won’t move in my vendor but since I can only really get 300 scrip a week I don’t want to drop it in case my farming doesn’t go so well the next chance I have to play.
---
Let them burn 😈
---
Get ahold of a few pieces of Troubleshooters Armor, a full suit if you can. I don't launch many nukes as a LVL 270 player, but after crafting so many Secret Service pieces in trying to get Unyielding Armor, I wound up with a enough pieces of Troubleshooters for a full set. The other night, I thought I'd put it to the test, and I practically walked all the way through the silo and never got below half damage on my character. Drastically different experience from the first couple of trips through a silo where I died numerous times and spent practically an hour trying to get through it.
---
Sounds like you haven't read anything slowpoke everyone here doesn't care
---
That's what I said. Like that Japanese soldier fighting WW2 in the late 80s. A Free States is totally in a bunker unaware of what's occured
---
I thought you had to continue taking the drugs.
---
Yeah, it looks like they gave it a paper bag's hitbox but also stuck it all the way on one side
---
I tried that but the only options I get are to add friend and the other irrelevant ones. Ty though, if it happens I’ll try again :D.
---
I'll continue to do my part by not donating.
---
It usually takes between 5 and 10 to become addicted. When I did it (pre Wastelanders) I read a few comments which suggested taking one chem/alcohol, exiting the pipboy, go back in and take another, exit and repeat until you become addicted. I believe there were reports of it not working if you just spam the chem/alcohol without exiting.
---
Yeah but the chances of a good items are ridiculously low since it’s open to any item, including armors and weapons. There are over 150+ items that can receive a legendary effect, meaning the one item you want will most likely not be given. So you can get a legendary or scrip it. 
---
Or, perhaps reward scrip instead of that’s what your getting at. Like 25 for 250.
---
I think about 50% of my fo4 play time was pissing about with robots. I loved making them into death machines and then using them to run trade routes between settlements. You'd be out adventuring and you'd go over a hill to see one of your robots just decimating raiders and monsters. Added a lot of life to the world.
---
Thanks for clarifying that.  So you could subscribe for a month and spend the 30 days just loading the scrapbox with any and everything you can find, end the subscription and live off the collected scrap until it's all gone?
---
You missed the point. You are demanding that they do something. But you don't even know why it's happening. I'm done with people like you that keep demanding things be done and fixed, and you think it's all Bethesda's fault.
---
And when pointed out, you can't handle it.
---
Truth is...the game was rigged from the start.
---
&lt;The player then starts the first playable part of the game&gt;
---
They all drop laser weapons.  Laser weapons are Terrible for steel.
---
I hope they add some event-duration challenges, that are harder in difficulty but reward a lot of SCORE (or specific prizes).
---
Kill 100 Scorchbeasts, kill 1000 robots, etc. Things that could take a long time and heavy grind, but have much better rewards.
---
Fo1st is, unfortunately, a scam. If bethesda spent the same amount of time and effort adding and refining content in the game as they do with trying to monetize it, then this game would be so much better than it is now. Imagine if every single atomic shop item was added into the base game and they keep adding more items every week or so. That'd be nuts. But of course nowadays instead of paying $60 for a game you're just paying $60 for the privelege to pay more money.
---
I cancelled my subscription after the whole display case exploit. Any time I hear there’s an exploit I just stop playing until it sounds like things are getting better. 
---
Though that means I haven’t played in months now because it’s just consistent bad news.
---
It's good that they were able to learn from the mistakes they made with 76 to craft a far superior game.
---
I have logged out and in three times to new servers. No luck, the fuse re-checkpoints, but not the blood sample. Hoping if I wait a day....
---
I've developed a system, but it's just not fun. I don't actually play for fun anymore. I used to log in to whichever account and character I felt like running for a few hours. Now, though, I need to use a specific character on each account to quickly try and knock out all of the daily challenges before switching to the next account. Generally takes me about 2 to 3 hours, depending on the challenges and if the servers are booting me off like normal with random disconnects.
---
I agree with all of this, but let's face it. They have you over a barrel with the scrap box.  Let's say they never come through on any of what the promised. What you gonna do about it? Cancel your subscription and go back to cramming everything in to an 800 lb stash?  Bethesda knows that you won't do that.  It's  a really dirty and ruthless business model, but it is what it is.
---
The entire Fallout first concept is built around the stash box and the survival tent.  Over encumbered with junk?  Well you can slowly limp to the nearest train station- or you can pay for fallout first and plop down your survival tent right where you are and toss it into the scrap box.
---
It's a standard dirty business practice of these online games. They build problems into the game,  then sell you the fix to fix the problems that they created. 
---
And I am saying this as someone who has Fallout first.  I bought it, but I am not lying to myself about what it is.
---
just happened to me but its only doing it on the one at a workshop. I tried to reset game, and when that failed I tried scrapping it. It scrapped a part of it but left the rest leaving the thing broken and removing the floor under it afterward to make it go away (hoping that would fix the problem) left it floating in the air. I then tried removing my building starting at the top and now I have crops flying in the air. I attempted to switch toons before this (IK am on a private server solo) thinking my other toon might be able to change it but it put that toon in a diferent server so i swapped back cuz I dont wanna rebuild everything (I will just ignore the problem).
---
What really pisses me off to the point of closing the game is when you are trying to do this bullshit dailies and you can't travel to a location without opening the map and clicking the damn thing 4, 5, 6 times, that shit is really painful.
---
Yeah, the event tracker updates once a day, I think. Maybe more often. 
---
We only need 17M today, which I think is doable. I’ve got about 5k more I plan to donate. I’m keeping 20k for myself, though.
---
About to cancel mine as I haven't been playing daily but the rewards for having first are a couple of icons.
---
It just works.
---
$50 says legendary perks get delayed until next year.
---
Another $50 says everyone will hate it, and they will break multiple existing perks.
---
More like a lynch mob.
---
We apologise again for the fault in the subtitles.  Those responsible  for sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked.
---
Not every single player is meant to complete it.
---
As mentioned, a stage could be a good additions. Perhaps have it step up so there’s a little more variety to the floor plan? 
---
Think brick may be a good choice if you’re going for a dive bar feel. Making it look like an existing brick house/bldg and expanding the size with wooden additions could give it a cool aesthetic and feel like a pre-war bldg you renovated with what you could find.
---
People do that for the Score bullshit. I've noticed it over the course of 3 weeks. They plant random crops, random stairs and walls, shelving units and turrets. One person will claim 3-4 of them and 20 mins later they're gone. I doubt if they got disconnected from the server at that point, if they did, why give a fuck? They're 500 Score away from a cosmetic items that they'll piss and moan about on here for 6 weeks after the fact.
---
They seem to have taken note of this as there are FINALLY some solid discounts and free items being offered to First accounts. Definitely check the Atom Shop today if you're a subscriber - I was pleasantly surprised by the free backpack and outfit.
---
I was experimenting last night with the flame thrower and couldn’t get it to work with wood walls but it worked with brick walls.
---
Right now my PS4 Pro is a Brick.
---
I had zero problems until that last 76 update.Nothing,no lag,or weird behavior.
---
First sign of problems was the PS4 telling me the 76 game files were corrupted.
---
Now i am stuck in a perpetual loop of Booting up in Safe Mode.Only to see the error code  CE-41813-7  pop up with Data Base is corrupted.
---
Tried every option in safe mode,even initializing the PS4 back to factory reset.
---
Nothing working.
---
Only option left is to buy a better hardrive.Maybe a seagate SSHD Firecuda.
---
Gutted,it is not even 2 years old.
---
Bethesda just put up on there website today they're trying to fix it.... I'm still so mad I'm stuck and can't do the main story with out it until they do tho.. I hope it's fixed soon before I lose interest in the game all together 😭😭

---
Isn't outrage fatigue a thing? It's been nonstop outrage for this game literally since it was announced(some of it very well earned some of it outrage for the sake of outrage), I imagine it"s whitenoise to some by now. It seems pretty endless.
---
Yeah, does no good to "cancel" anything, these posts should be using "do not renew" your subscription. Once my year subscription posted, I went into my Xbox account and turned off "auto-renewal".
---
the sheepsquatch plushy already was
---
I don't see how my comment is whataboutism considering the game is referred to as an MMO. It's literally comparing this MMO to every other MMO. Daily quests are a staple of the MMO genre and have been for years. Every game as a service with MMO and RPG elements has some sort of daily quests either to drive engagement or serve as content filler.
---
But keep resisting genre staples because you want to deny what the game is and attack people who don't agree with you, that's cool
---
It worked for me with the regular wooden walls. Brick. Metal. And farm.
---
I wish there wasn't a scrip limit at all. I find myself having weight management issues because of the amount of legendary stuff I'm carrying or due to the heavy legendary stuff like fat mans or miniguns. I would totally be playing a lot more if I could just scrip as much as I want. I don't mind the fact that we're allowed to only have 100o scrip at the max, I would just like to scrip as much as I want in a day.
---
Paid your bail money for early release. I guess I can’t blame you, but aren’t you slightly curious how long it would have taken to finish by playing it all the way to the end? To see where Zorbo landed in your wake when you crossed the finish line?
---
I mean you earn atoms through out the thing and atoms from fallout 1st *(if you're paying for it)* last ten levels should be only 1500 atoms 😂
---
It was a great day when I finally finished the rep grind. Not that they are hard or time consuming but, it certainly gets tedious.
---
He advances one spot a day but you have the ability (especially early on) to advance multiple spots in a day. So you're not necessarily behind if you're behind him. Depending on how far behind you're of ofcourse.
---
Also being on the same spot as him won't always be a safe bet as the later rank ups can require 2 days worth of dailies to be completed.
---
Him reaching the end will coincide with the last day of the run.
---
Good for you,well done.
---
thx for the reminder. forgot that was coming out this month. maybe i just dont believe them.
---
Because the Brains do not work with Herbivore. thats a cheap +6 INT you are passing up. plus i like Carnivore way more
---
Vote with your wallet, but nobody ever does.
---
Yes. I got a month earlier this year to see what it was like and it was a better deal for the atoms than just buying the atoms, and I still have some junk in there. I never bothered to clear it out, so I think it's down to bone shards or shit like that. Next time I decide to get a month (maybe at the start of the next season), I'll probably spend some time loading it up now that I know about that.
---
I definitely see your point, and I might be able to do it weekly except that the daily challenges has given me a structure to follow and that’s helped to ‘keep me on task” so to speak.
---
It does actually. He reaches the last spot on the board on the last day of the run.
---
We’re you placing solid walls or window walls?
---
Try this combo for some non-bloodied fun:
---
Find an exploding Submachine Gun (Tommy Gun), equip level 5 Demo Expert, apply Scorched Killer receiver. 
---
The Demo Expert amplifies the damage from the explosive rounds and the SK receiver is glitched and makes it fire as fast as a minigun without the spool up.
---
Because the fire rate is glitched it doesn't have much effect on stability when firing and the ordinance you blast downrange will present shock and awe to your targets.
---
I'm impressed that you can do Radiation Rumble alone! I've been there with other people, died multiple times, and still failed.
---
PC or console? It's entirely possible someone hacked into your account, and ended up duping during this last exploit, which would have gotten you banned.
---
Grenades are fine, even unperked. Managed to get -3 with single plasma, they were like 50m away and i was with chameleon mutation, surprise 😁
---
Wow.  I meant to say does.
---
Exactly  hundreds of thousands of players was using this shit.  When it comes down to it I'm on here giving you hell cause my game keeps crashing peroid
---
Good post OP
---
You get some rewards on every character ( like unlocking skins or building items). Other rewards ( like repair kits and lunch boxes) you only get on the character you are playing when you claim it. You can unlock rewards on any character, but if you want it on a specific one, log onto that character before claiming it.  As for creating multiple characters, I usually make one, use it for a few levelup challenges, then delete it and make a new one. It is much quicker to get a level on a low level character than a high level one.
---
Well the patch DOES include it.  The files are now in game, it's just turned off.....
---
It's been exactly a year since the Legendary Perk system was announced, and it's only available in Beta (PTS) right now. Judging by the feedback there, it's quite a ways off from being ready.
---
You could always just exploit the clip size bug that they still haven’t patched that allows you to get up to 500 rounds in a clip
---
Oh it's easy, find a power armor random spawn and scrap the parts
---
Oh yeah for sure. I waited till i was like level 95 and breezed right through it
---
Now this I like
---
I'm 100% in agreement here, but "objectively bad" is an oxymoron that probably is going to dilute your message. It's a poorly optimized, slowly patched, buggy game with a team that has no QA, and I would consider that stuff bad, but saying the whole game is bad because of it might put people off who have different definitions of bad. (Sorry for the English lesson)
---
I find that annoying too. Personally I wish they just evenly spaced out each rank than trying to get everyone hooked on “how easy” it is to rank up the first 40 lvls just so it’s an awful and boring grind the last 40
---
Which promotion?
---
What's the free goodies
---
I'm honestly happy to see all the comments and decisions
---
I have a mod that turns meat piles in three balloons as on the lemonade stand, it's the same with massive fps drop to a slide show. Not the texture but some code linking the pile to a data base probably.
---
I did 5 addictions in a minute yesterday, are you alternating between 2 different drugs when doing it, seems a quicker way rather than spamming one drug.
---
I was just checking the date thinking I'd missed something
---
Camp fix. Already exists. Fo4 mechanics. You were able to stack foundations, attach floors to foundations. Had better stairs that don't take up a ton of floor real estate. Floors did not require stairs so you could create nooks for flowers displays etc. Quarter floors existed and Floors could be stacked. These are just a few things I can think of my head. 
---
They don't have to add everything, but....
---
I was able to build a fully automated Brahmin slaughter house using the conveyer and spawn points with the creature spawn boxesI could imagine some really cool single player instances being created at workshops by the players and workshop persistence.
---
nobody is making you play it every day.
---
In contrast I think NW is poorly designed and the challenges are a chore. The fact that the game doesn't wait to start until everyone is loaded in is a joke. That 1 simple change would at least relax my opinion on the mode a little. Yesterday it took me 6 games to get the 3 creature kill challenge done. In 3 of those games I was killed without a gun because I spawned in at a location with enemeies and they had already looted the weapons and were waiting for me to spawn since they could see someone else was spawning there on the pregame map. That makes the whole ordeal a huge waste of time. The time it takes to get into a game from loading into the vault, waiting for the vote on the map, and then actually loading into the game is too long. Especially just to get immediately killed because other players loaded in faster and have already looted the area.
---
I see you are troubled... between this Jangles you refer to. Also a Pebbles.. may we come in? My brethren and I would like to talk to you about... please I wouldn't want to impose. Mothman is divine... his light guides us in the darkness of Jangles space. Space is but an empty void. Denounce this! Stay away from the void. Come to the.. Chosen... place of worship. Let Mothman guide you. We do have an event occasionally it's at the light house. We would love to have you for dinner... to introduce you to our brethren...
---
How do you get these goodies?
---
Look into the exploit on how to do it on YouTube
---
Thanks! I have that mod will remove it and test it out. Thanks!
---
It’s not whataboutism. Also not making excuses, just trying to understand what you said. 
---
And that’s not true at all. I manage a $350M budget. Projects get delayed and reprioritized daily. You don’t fire someone because the reprioritize or delay something that isn’t ready to go out to the customer.
---
**What we wanted:** Plans for glass greenhouse building set from FO4 for ultimate scenic building and crop enclosing.
---
**What we expected:** A direct import from the old game with no changes - but to be charged atoms.
---
**What we got:** A circular prefab we couldn't make full structures out of and that has been "Fixed" so often I have to move my entire freaking camp just to be able to delete the budget hogging monstrosity because "An Unspecified Error Has Occurred". We can't plant inside them. We were charged atoms. We were charged atoms for the fake plants to put inside them.
---
Give ME your junk and I’ll give you legacy weapons
---
I really don't know why, maybe I look really young at my picture but I was definitely present when windows 98 was still running my dude
---
She sent her dwellers basically naked into the wasteland. Not sure that constitutes care.
---
It’s not on par, you’re paying an unjustifiable premium for features that could have just been in the game. If you think the storage of junk uncapped bobs down the server, you’d be wrong. It’s a stackable item, it’s just a number in a database. As for needing to pay for the servers, the amount they charge for a piece of power armor alone is worth more than some of the official DLC of previous games. The other services I mentioned require much more infrastructure to function and somehow they do it for less, with less bugs.
---
Bethesda seriously underestimated what people would pay for a continued stream of actual content, but instead they release overpriced crap because it’s easier and people are buying it.
---
Not sure why your down voted.  I swear the majority of people that are on this sub are considerably dense.  A lot of them defend the actions of this company as if they were on the payroll.  Time and time again they have broken things in this game unnecessarily.  And what you said is correct, if this was such an issue that needed to be addressed - it SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED MONTHS AGO.
---
Nice, wasted 13 hours of your life for some crap, bethesda is happy
---
Your mistake to pay a whole year upfront for something that wasn't there.
---
But hey, at least you got the "BEST VALUE"!
---
I've been to see her for 3 days in a row and she won't even issue me a quest. Rocksy on the other hand has had me kill 2x the population of Crater by now.
---
No orange man bad for many reasons, not just a stupid wall.
---
Too bad. Not sure if that’s a system issue or user preferences. I use all the team boosting skills though so I’m useless if I’m not on a public team. So admittedly I don’t need the join recent options often. It could be it was someone currently in that world-they left or something and you hadn’t noticed? They definitely need a fix for it
---
You mean to tell me Bethesda kept their promise and the Beezlebilly and demonic backpack are actually available when they said it would be????
---
Here comes the circle jerk of hate and "I'm quitting post"
---
Do u have the stealthboy mod? That messed me up for a bit, it eats your AP
---
I hit the high school, huntsmasters Lodge, and cabins by the scout leader daily as well as generally grab anything I see on my travels but still don't have enough for my bulking and shotgun shell needs
---
I think you’re the one missing the point. I CAN’T fucking figure it out. I’m not sure if you understand what I’m saying as easy as I thought you could. My mistake. I’m trying to bring attention to it so I CAN try to figure it out. It’s the same way people couldn’t figure out the fast travel bug without bringing attention to it and conversing amongst each other to help reach a conclusion. So, my current conclusion is that you just don’t really have the mental fortitude to talk about this. Bye 😘.
---
It's never been on a roadmap. They mentioned it as something they wanted to do, but never offered a timeframe or even words like "soon" or "in the near future". To be honest, it's one of those things that they probably spend what little spare work hours they have on... which are few and far between because between actual near future plans like the BOS return and putting out fires, they probably have very little time.
---
Actually, I half wonder how far Wastelanders set their long term plans back.
---
Someone told me the secret a bit ago. But I really meant I'd like to have a legit one hahaha. I would like Bethesda to maybe just add it themselves one day.
---
guess you can chalk fallout up there with the dozen or so other multi billion dollar franchises that have been scorched earth over the past 10 years
---
What do you mean  by nonsensical exactly?
---
I've eaten 30 buffouts in the last 2 days still no addictions. Does the luck stat have something to do with it?
---
There's a perk that prevents you from getting addicted to chems. Not sure what its called. But look under Endurance for it. 
---
Long shot here, do you run power armor while doing it? If so, do you use the blood cleanser mod? If you do remove it.
---
I'm at level 70 right now not to worried about that whole *u WoNt FiNiSh iT* ordeal I have extra atoms from fo1st and won't mind spending some on the last couple of ranks during the last days of the legendary run
---
&gt;	as soon as I get the last 20 levels
---
Ie just in time for the next season to start.
---
Are they bugged?
---
Ridiculous
---
And at the end of day 2 is 90% done.
---
Or nonsense
---
This will help me get closer to finishing the Atom challenge, so I think it's helpful.
---
Cool!  It makes it more appealing that you're not handcuffed to the subscription at the risk of losing everything you paid for.  Cheers!
---
Why didn’t I think of that 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
So, I just took a look, but feel free to check my math. 
---
Zorbo is 31 spaces away from the end. That means in 31 days he’ll be at the end.
---
Today is August 6th. Which means that 31 days from now is September 6th.
---
But the season is supposed to be ten weeks long, and the season started on June 30th. Ten weeks later or September 8th. 
---
It looks like Zorbo will reach the last space on a Sunday, but the event is supposed to end on a Tuesday. 
---
What am I missing here?  Is my math off?
---
Good point😂😂
---
Gotcha! I agree. Underground instanced bunkers like the free states would be really cool
---
Some people refuse to believe some stuff is scripted to be rarer and blame everything on rng.
---
The BOS is coming to Appalachia to save humankind from its worst enemy: itself.   The Brotherhood having a base of operations is important to the future of Appalachia than some mercenary's damn reward.   Mercenaries only think about what's in it for them.  But this is bigger than you. Ad Victoriam.
---
I couldn’t agree more! I’m fatigued just by being a bystander to all this outrage.
---
Grrr.... but hopefully a bundle that includes vertical half walls too.
---
Maybe a couple hundred. At most. Considering the amount of overlap I see on posters in the angry screed section of the sub, maybe significantly less than that. And honestly, half of them probably quite regularly, then come back when new content comes out so they can play a bit, enjoy themselves, and the foam at the mouth and quit when they get bored. Fairly common thing in contentious gaming communities.
---
Fallout runs on Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10. Need help getting Fallout to run? Please check the [sidebar / drop down menu fix guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/wiki/fixguide) for a list of fixes that will get the game running.
---
Sounds like good times to me. Of course I like Nickelback.
---
Yes, we are in Week 6, just let the halfway point. 
---
I don’t know why you’re being downvoted for providing accurate information.
---
Still OP. Even quests don't give 25 scrip.
---
Cancelled mine today. 
---
I love the game but this is one of the most mismanaged online games I’ve ever played. No excuse especially considering how successful ESO is (in comparison). This last patch was the final straw. I have enough mats stockpiled to last the foreseeable future and I will be keeping my now legacy camps. 
---
This doesn’t mean I won’t be back. If Bethesda actually follows through with their promises to get the game back on track I will definitely be supporting FO 1st.
---
It really does feel like I’m helping to pull the plug on the future of this game, and I hate that. My SO and I have put way to much time than we care to admit into this game, and I’m sure many of you are in the same boat. But if we continue funding this “half-baked” approach Bethesda is taking it will continue to disappoint us.
---
To the dev team: We appreciate you and we support you, but we need some honesty and transparency here. I have faith the game can get back on track!
---
It was a little known of method to crash the server, I'd first heard about over a year ago, but I've known very few others that have even heard of it. I never spread word of it, and never used it.
---
Yeah, that's solution, because I can't just MUTE you
---
I just did it at the grafton dam
---
Lmao so we get a second helping of meat week from September 7 - January 1st???
---
Idk if you’re attacking me or not but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. But what I’m talking about is that I’ll see workshops like ACTUALLY built up for the resources. My friend and I will walk up to it and say “wth, why’s nobody here.” And I do understand that there is the possibility of them leaving the server on their own accord. But I’ve seen plenty of times where that’s not the case.
---
Given the complete lack of true PvP gameplay (outside of NW which puts everyone on a level playing field) there’s no real gameplay reason for resource caps in this game. More and more I believe that it’s due to engine issues and limitations: more resources means more ~things~ which the engine was never really built to handle. This seems to be the common denominator with most of the issues in this game, which is unfortunate because it really puts a damper on all of the things that they have done well.
---
Ma'am, this is a Long John Silver's.
---
*canvas
---
What do you mean? They seem to be working fine for me
---
I prefer the bag - nice one.
---
Atomic shop
---
Oh yeah, asked a bit too early, sorry. I've just logged in and saw it :p It looks cool. hope it's not as broken as free loot bag we got xD
---
For sure.
---
Look at this photograph
---
Yea, there was couple posts about it after the reset.
---
Food for you but i mostly when i join a public team turn my audio off for player chat  ecause otherwise i keep hearing ehwhbdebshdbrjejd bla bla bla blq
---
Or 6k caps poorer!?
---
What a joke, can't even proofread their blog post.
---
Just asking.
---
Well I attempted to spam them and had no luck so as soon as I get more chems ill try to take one at a time and exit pipboy
---
They could do the whole; 
---
~~800 Atoms~~ **350 Atoms FO1st**
---
As an example lol
---
It's a little off.
---
The event last till September 7th. If it lasted till September 8th then the event would actually be 10 weeks and 1 day.
---
I can't check ingame right now but I believe last time I checked (a few weeks ago) he would reach the last space on Monday. Still giving us that day to get the last pieces of score.
---
The issue lies in once a door frame is placed you cannot switch it to a different wall type though I believe.
---
Pffft, theres nothing left in the game i can buy for caps
---
Ah, man, I had a perfect screenshot of this place as well, not nuked, but my character doing the look to the future emote with the image of the space station before
---
Unfortunately I had to reinstall not realising all my images would be deleted - luckily, I think my Gallery would have them all
---
Poor sentient Ward, longing to explore Foundation, now chained to the desk and immobile.
---
A+ response.

Unpopular Opinion: Legendary perks shouldn’t exist. The way they’re trying to implement them is straight stupid. They should do a skill system like ESO’s champion point system. Give us some skills we can increase by small increments each level after level 50. The more skill points you sink into a skill the smaller the increase. So let’s say survival is a skill. If I sink a point into it my hunger and thirst meter decreases 1.2% slower, 2 points 2.3% and so on. It would allow us to actually try other builds with the array of perks we have. I don’t know about you guys but it frustrates the hell out of me that I have to sink 9 points into rifleman to do decent damage. 12 points if you want tank killer
---
I don't recall questioning your age. I was literally commenting on the "bonus disc inside!!!" thing.
---
And do not charge for it, give the players interior walls and any other tools they need to build camps with style, that might restore some good will
---
Must have missed them!
---
You troll people about video games what a loser, get a life. I usually drop steel, it's worthless. Poor people are such penny pinchers.
---
Yes I know that. Which is why people are complaining. Figured I’d let people know that although it’s not what they want. At least it still works on door frames.
---
Wasteland milk builds adamantium skeleton.
---
I loved the beta and any Fallout before but then..
---
For new comers it’s very attractive. My first 100 hours were what I always wanted out of fallout 4 playing with friends. 
---
My tips would be:
---
-	get drunk and:
---
 -	go to the lighthouse &gt; find the where am I holotape 
---
 - find Grahm
---
 - get your newbie ass kicked by a mothman
---
 - give bivvvvv company
---
 - sass the overseer
---
 - find the guide-stones
---
 - find an eldritch horror
---
-	savour the story - some of it is really good if you listen to the tapes 
---
-	do events
---
 -	meat weeks coming
---
-	mutate yourself
---
-	check out YouTube for the rapidly dwindling building . . . “strategies”
---
-	food buffs are pretty good imho for new players - cranberry cobbler is so easy to make
---
  -	I find herbivore easier / better for xp 
---
-	get a flaming bow for line in the sand
---
-	Atoms - save your atoms for the stuff you like the most. Stuff gets firesaled like once a quarter or when they need the numbers to go up
---
  -	as a new player you will get them rapidly but they are hard to get after. 
---
  - use the wiki to see what’s come out and it’s og price to make informed decisions about stuff
---
  - they are not above things going on “sale” like two weeks after you just spent 1600 atoms on a bundle 
---
However once you reach the endgame - the final boss is Bethesda’s retention / monetization strategy and suffice it to say you will be *polarized* one way or the other. 
---
I love it but after level 100 it sucks your blood like the ticks at Dolly Sods. 
---
Oh and Waiting a year for Faschnaut (just missed it when I started) was annoying af but it was a blast even if it did get old after like 2.5 weeks
---
So we can stand around and give each other dumb ass heart emojis?
---
I can build us a fusion reactor!  ;)
---
The what? I never said those words?
---
Yeah 10 rolls at a time feels better than 3 every day, that gets discouraging pretty quickly.
---
I mean, I'm always in my own party chat specifically so I don't hear the area mic (because I don't want to hear abusive epithets and/or incessant eating, breathing, nonsense chatter, or kids getting yelled at by their moms... so you get to listen to Nickelback and I get blissful silence anyways.
---
Whatever floats your boat, I guess.
---
Edit: I share a card.
---
I hope it is even more broken. Maybe it will make the backpack appear on the front instead so it looks like we are caring a demon baby in baby sling.
---
That would make not donating SOOOOOO much better
---
If you're slightly newer to the game, just get level 3 hacker and make the turrets do the work for you! Lol
---
Xbox still has this issue today
---
You could lose legendaries to the punch bowl?
---
Yeahhh, I’ll be keeping all my resources thank you very much.
---
Hahah, that would be funny to see.
---
Was on a team not so long ago and the guy was talking to his mum on the phone about his court dates. Must have been on speaker too, could hear the whole conversation, was pretty entertaining.
---
Yeah, this. Thought I was about to get banned for SCORE duping until I realized it was just replaying the animation 🤣
---
Every team I join is total silence.
---
I would love, so much, for there to just be goals for each level or something, and you can meet them as you go, when you want. Overachievers are just gonna mainline goals for a week straight and then take a nap, casuals will meet them when they meet them.
---
But yeah, I am basically scheduling my day around the reset, and if I meet all the goals I just log off. My poor secondary characters are withering at the vine. ;A; I miss them but what's the point of playing them at this point?
---
certainly the chest piece is worth bc the jetpack mod is a game changer
---
Nah, hook headphones up to my computer and listen to music on that so I don't hear Nickelback.
---
Snark attack!  Snark week!
---
Nah, people are doing it. We’re already about to pass the milestone already. I’m personally not doing it cause for one I’m taking a break from the game. It’s so damn broken in so many ways it’s just unneeded stress, and if I was playing I already have all of those plans.
---
There's always one. Lol
---
I find if you put them on the opposite end of camp from your fast travel point, they are a lot less annoying.
---
I mean...76rs are technically the tour de force of appalachia. Nobody else even comes close to what a single 76r could accomplish. A whole city of 76rs would be unstoppable....where do i sign up?
---
Blind loyalty. I was the same way. Always thinking they would get it together and not give us the run around. Did it for 18 patches. Than one day I realized if they still can’t get their shit together 20 months later it’s just not going to happen. Takes some people a little longer than others to take the blinders off and see it for what it is instead of what you hope it’s going to be.
---
I have 2 charisma so get over it.
---
No. I did.
---
&gt;...  or sometimes slipped into a gaming magazine's bonus disc (remember them?), patches generally did not happen. 
---
That's the only place I could think of where you could get the impression I was questioning your age. Although I point out that Windows 98 is still running, it just does not get any support (which was pulled in 2006)
---
I know what the word means.  Ridiculous in what way
---
Lmao this sub is full of knee pad wearing Bethesda fan boys, not all but a lot for sure.
---
The amount of motion assist servo plans I have from distant thunder is unreal lol only got the helm and chest plans after weeks of doing the event
---
i love it i played every day before so i see no difference
---
E.     /s
---
If you already rescued him you have to build his bar in your camp to get him.
---
After I hit max rep, I stopped doing them. Of course they are worth treasury notes, but they are so tedious.
---
Can't say I will ever do them again.
---
Just my perspective.  The rewards are more geared toward newer players, I’m good with that.  I plan to donate 1000 of each item.  I don’t see the point in going overboard.  I’d like to contribute in the spirit of the event.   
---
Anything Bethesda want to do in the way of new content I’m going to support.   So long as they are trying, I will to.  Only alternative is to quit and go play something else.  I’d miss my friends if I did that.
---
The idea of the S.C.O.R.E. system is good — there’s a reason why the mechanic has become so popular in games. The implementation is lacking though. For the next one I hope they way simplify it to be less challenge focused and more focused on “events are worth X points,” “legendary kills are worth y” etc. Maybe open up bigger challenges that can be accomplished throughout the season rather than daily. 
---
It’s hard to say for sure without all of the data, but I would imagine the focus on daily logins make it difficult for a lot of people to progress in the Legendary Run. The challenge of it should come from gameplay, not artificial time gates. And it will only get tougher as more and more people return to work/school/normal life once the COVID situation improves.
---
Thank you for your input. « Objectively bad » is indeed a rather worrying contradiction. I should express my idea in different terms. No matter when or how I analyse the game and the phenomenons that accompany it, I always end up concluding that it has done more harm than good to humanity. It is still, in the end, a subjective perspective. It is not as if there were (was?) any objective bad or good.
---
I was probably overreacting cause I didn’t read it right. I thought I only need to craft and not scrap that’s why I was thinking of it like that
---
I don't even know what that means, but I'll reiterate.
---
Your use of fascism would fit just as well if you subbed in communism. 
---
I'm not trying to be all "hurr durr ur an idiot," because it gets misused all the time to just mean "nazis/authoritarian dictatorship," so a lot of people just go with that because it's so common.
---
Don’t know what tent abuse is. But that’s awesome you got 3,500 steel from One event or mission
---
I only do the kill the raider one now. I’m not waIking around trying to find those things for wren. I reached ally with foundation, and haven’t done anything for ward since. She can go to the prison or that damn mall herself.
---
I used the wall to doorway and vice versa when i was at max caps to seal my vending area or to reopen when caps were below 25,000.  Now I have to save the wall and just leave an open space or reinstall the wall from Recent.
---
We may have been talking about Lev, not Meg, but Meg eventually comes around.  If you betray the Raiders, she ultimately says that she'd rather not make an enemy of someone like you.  Which is the proper response.
---
I don't think we ever find out what Paige has to say in the same situation because, despite being told that Paige wants to talk to me, he never has anything unique to say.
---
Absolutely, yes. There are also many, many ways to glitch straight into the command center, skipping the difficult parts.
---
i bought my monthly on xbox, filled up the stash pretty freaking good, then cancelled my sub before it ran out and got the refund bc of how microsoft works until the last day, you can cancel and get the refund. im not giving bethesda any money until they fix basic things 🤣
---
This needs to happen. The time gate is what pushed me to quit playing altogether and cancel 1st. I won't come back until the limits are all weekly... or they release something so amazing I simply have to play it LOL
---
Mr. Pebbles is the one true savior. Only his chosen wear the pack. Maybe one day you too will see his divinity (when it's next in the atom shop).
---
Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate! Light wood laminate!!!!
---
People in the eso sub were stronger than me at lower levels than 30, so idk what I did wrong.
---
That quest has been glitched since BETA - I went 12 months without it ever sorting itself out. I just ignored it and moved on, until they decided to lock the Wastelander's quest line behind successfully completing this.
---
Anyway ... I guess the fix didn't fix it :)
---
Simplest solution - raise a support ticket and they'll reset the quest for you so can try again.
---
then don't play everyday? The daily score is there for daily players. If you don't wanna be a daily player, then quite bluntly and obviously, don't play daily? It PISSES me off how everyone thinks that just because they purchase a game, they are entitled to become a completionist of that game with less-than completionist effort.
---
Nope, it's a known bug. Also happens when you are building things in your CAMP (SCORE not awarded until you exit CAMP mode).
---
I wonder is max troubleshooter armor pieces would really help
---
A. Why should this one be any different than all the other delays.
---
I love Fo76, but me having to log in every day to do my challenges is leaving me very little time to play anything else
---
For real right. I got a 9-7 4 days a week. I got a 3 year old at home. I got a wife I need to keep happy. I also have other games I'd like to also play. Can't I just pay a flat rate of $30 to unlock the season
---
It’s fine no one goes to the event anyway
---
Ok that’s really good move on Bethesda!
---
pc
---
&gt; delay something that isn’t ready to go out to the customer. 
---
Fallout 76 is continuously in the state of "not ready to go out to the customer". Responding with "well, what about you" is whataboutism.So is your, "well, what about me" story. Stick to the topic, don't deflect. If above quoted sentence was the case here, we could continue this. However, it's not. The fact that you simultaneously believe it is and play this game is insane. Shit continuously gets released both late and in broken state. None of this was ready to go out to the customer from the start. But none of it matters because there'll always be people to furiously fight for excusing it. As long as they exist, these broken games with broken promises will continue to exist.
---
I Know! got 200k caps and don't care about buillions any more!
---
You a Bloodied build?
---
I have all of them except the chest piece.  Distant thunder event awards the plans for the difference piece, but man the RNG for that event is so awful. 99 percent of the time you get motion assisted servo mod plan.   Lately plans for armor pieces seem to be dropping more, but they are duplicates of plans I already have.
---
Eh, this event is pretty buggy in general.  The Waiter robots make little attempt to get to the dining room anymore, which leads to a lot of standing around at the end because the actual battle is happening somewhere other than there.
---
I never reached more than 5000 caps. I always feel poor and always worry about missions making me fast travel multiple times.
---
Because they had banked CP points. Those carry over for every character once you get past 50
---
Very possible.  I even prefer it since it spawns less enemies and goes quicker.
---
Yeah, you never seen anyone do that? Load up on chem addictions, add on adrenal reaction to boost the damage as well, and be low health. I have a few friends that do it. It's pretty strong
---
Thats the biggest factor right there. This game is beautiful and has SO MUCH UNTAPPED POTENTIAL. for those of us who have been along for the ride its just that much more frustrating knowing that it will lokely never reqch its full potential...and so we all come to reddit to shed those bittersweet tears : / As a side note, there have been HUNDREDS of great ideas mentioned on this sub (some would even be quite easy to inplement) i wonder if there is a way we can highlight the best of them and really push them
---
I was on the same 8pm schedule, so it was nice to double-dip this week with the reset.
---
You mansplaining every thing to me like I didn't exist before 2010 gave me the impression. I have no idea what you are trying to say, that games are entitled to ask for micro-transactions because they keep their game up to date? I have bugs in fo76 that have been there from the beginning
---
only really the cheat, and only if you care about the jetpack. the DR boost is mostly going to be irrelevant
---
Woah, I did NOT know that, that was never mentioned.
---
Or I dunno....MAYBE ADD THE BOS PAINT PLANS EVEN
---
I won't uninstall as I've spent too much time grinding for gear that if something worth playing  comes out I refuse to miss it. I did cancel my 1st sub however and haven't played in about a month. Really getting the itch for some NW however
---
You'd be surprised how many people don't and get salty and leave. I know full well that's a possibility.
---
Yep! If you have the stealth suit and a sneak build, its really really easy
---
Almost the same here :D
---
Ah.  Having to specifically craft 3 would be annoying.
---
We are eventually getting perk load outs, but I would like this as well because I imagine they're going to limit that too for some reason.
---
I wasn’t saying “well what about you”. I’m trying to understand if you really think if someone misses a deadline they have no credibility. It seems like a really strong line to draw. I’m not trying to deflect and apologize if it came off that way. I want to confirm that you really meant they are not allowed to miss a single deadline as you suggested.
---
Anyway it seems like you don’t want to have a calm discussion so I’ll excuse myself out.
---
da bomb. thank you.
---
And expensive scrap wise
---
Two of my characters are junkies and two of my characters are bloodied.
---
They need to make it work like a vendor and replace caps for ammo points. It’s the exact machine everyone wants/needs but the UX makes it near worthless.
---
Lol I had forgot about first rewards then yesterday as I was playing atoms just appeared in my game I was like wtf thought maybe Beth was being generous because of a sucky update lol 😆 didn’t figure it out until you posted this
---
I noticed that actually, didn’t know what’s up. Got out of my PA then suddenly all of the  pop ups started coming up.
---
Golf Balls have cork.
---
You can get 100 from Whitesprings and 30 from Tyler and Hemlock.
---
Baseballs, Globes and Crystal Decanters yield Cork. 
---
Tag ‘Cork’ as a search item and you’ll see its in a lot more things than you may realize. 
---
I think Pipe Weapons have Cork as well. 
---
I’m sitting on about 8k myself.
---
Lol a few of us were attempting it then we were lost looking for the last one at my camp
---
Funny. Not "this needed its own thread" funny, but pretty funny.
---
A Zipper Box will be released in the next patch. It can be yours, too, for........ Atoms!
---
Quickly open your Loot Bag with a Genuine Vault-Tec Atomic Zipper!
---
It rewards with nothing.  Forgive me for wanting satisfaction from completing a task.  If you are fine with it, power to you. 
---
Not everyone is the same, if they where it would be a quite different world, just picture it, only one car, all the same colour, one cell phone.. it goes on.  
---
People find different things valuable and others find it annoying.  Deal with it.
---
I'm gonna spend my remaining atoms on the legendary run cause I'm so sick of it. I'll cancel my fallout 1st for a while and I'll probably hop back on once some new content drops. 
---
I don't much care about the double sided wall problem though it was admittedly a shit thing to focus on fixing. 
---
I'm just bored and the game needs endgame areas that are strictly level 50+. Areas that are difficult and require us to sneak or team up like when we were new.
---
This is a prime example of self entitlement. The perk share system is far from perfect. And now that it only uses BASE stats your just being a jerk. Not everyone is rolling around with 15 chrisma. So your lucky if you get a level 1 card shared out and it might be useless! Most people already have the good ones equipped. There is also the issue of shared perks falling off. Either the player changed out the card or the game decided it doesn't like you sharing that card today. So in short be grateful for what you do get or shove off.
---
That's what I mean, easier, but expensive
---
Better than Shart Week.
---
I did once, because someone bought all my weapons and armour which doesn't happen always. But before that I also was constantly around 3-6k and paying for fast travel was a bit frustrating.
---
Read [this](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic).
---
Golf Balls, Baseballs, Globes, Crystal Decanters, Pipe Weapons.
---
Good to know I'm still gonna attempt to do it at some point just because why not
---
Is this real life?
---
1 perk card loadout for every 500 level, or 5000 caps.
---
I will play but I cancelled my 1st and I will not give them and more money
---
This patch made the game stutter and freeze more. Especially on nuclear winter. Why is this happening?....
---
Block for session &gt; simple.
---
Here's a quarter.
---
Um, memorize the spot to look at? I'm sorry for sounding sarcastic but the issue here is so insignificant that I'm quite honestly baffled you have so many upvotes. Literally just look at the right-side (with respect to the logo) of the bag and aim at the zipper and it will work 100% of the time. It's second nature to do with the precision handling of a keyboard and mouse.
---
Oh you're a console player? Well the dumb ones learn the hard way. Get a pc.
---
that's why the same experience exists in-game
---
I’m afraid to start. I’m addicted enough trying to get the best gauss minigun roll, I think I’d lose my mind trying to get a good set of SS armor.
---
Nope, I believe that may have been so early before I ran any Junkies characters, but no longer so.
---
I like that you said "it just works"
---
As much as one could reasonably need? Here I thought the game was to collect stuff to an unreasonable extent. Hmmm I have 30k adhesive in camp, maybe I should... omagosh... is that DUCKTAPE?!
---
*rep at Bethesda*... "Now now we require you to play everyday so you can make sure you look at the atomic shop daily to buy our overpriced armor and camp items!! Don't think you can't play it everyday you're REQUIRED to play everyday if you want all the armor and camp items for freezer. Silly person you🤗🤗"👌 😏😆😆
---
Oh a disingenuous post complaining about stuff? In the FO76 sub? Who'd have thought! Mods mark this as misleading please.
---
Or just don’t buy fallout 1st at all because it’s a sham that shouldn’t exist
---
It started at noon on Tuesday, June 30. If it ends at noon on Tuesday, Sept 8, that’s exactly 70 days.  Ten weeks on the dot. Not ten weeks and one day.
---
I’m not sure when exactly Zorbo’s meter fills up. I though it’s as at noon ET but could be wrong.
---
I was a little disappointed in it in all honesty. The metal bars kind of ruin it for me. It would look better if they just made the mothman a little bigger and removed the bars.
---
If I could just pay for the pop up tent and the stash box I would. 🤔 would they even give us the option...
---
Did they do anything strange with their Power Armour beforehand? I've seen a couple of people glitch through walls by sprinting at them and either equipping or unequipping Power Armour. (Getting behind the counter at the Rusty Pick for eg)
---
Wonder if this is a temporary 'fix' for this issue.
---
NL, is that you?
---
It's just a matter of making sure you're conclusion isn't inside your premise. But again I agree it shouldve been handled completely differently. There were a few mistakes made from the beginning of design thats been causing issues all the way till now. Main ones being using the creation engine instead of making a multiplayer engine from scratch, making the entire game happen server side, and having one team make the game, then hand it off to a different team for them to patch. I think those 3 things are 90% of Bethesda's issues.
---
Use concise language. It was an exploit, I did use it. Have enjoyed the game more since 
---
This game, particularly with Fallout 1st, is not difficult but is time-consuming. I don’t owe anyone my time.
---
:) I switched to the settlers quest when getting this bug, and it went fine up until a point, but now that one seems bugged too. 
---
Without spoiling anything I had to get something for an NPC, but after giving it to them, and exhausting the resulting dialogue, my quest continues to say 'Give 'itemss to 'NPC' and quest marker remains where it is.
---
Presume a patch is impending. lol
---
When I gave up and stopped looking at the drop pool suddenly found an imitation sheepsquatch outfit in my inventory...
---
I really dig the concept because I’ve never really considered the fact you start in that vault pre-war so you would have to have come from somewhere close. It would make a cool Easter egg at the least. Even if it’s just rubble and some notes to make you like “oh shit this was home”
---
I learned from our lord and saviour.
---
Same opinion, but for a different reason.
---
With the advent of Lunchboxes, which will inevitably be sold in the Atomic Shop at some point, Bethesda has essentially turned XP into a backdoor real money currency.  The Legendary Run prioritized maximizing your XP gain, and that's not going to stop when Legendary Perks come out.
---
On one hand, it's nice that XP beyond Lv. 50 means something beyond a vague suggestion of how long a player has spent with the game.  But on the other, it incentivizes a gameplay style that is even more grindy than anything we've had before, and it makes the game far too "gamey" for its own good.  You don't see the Super Mutants as tragic, or West Tek as horrific.  It is all objectified as wandering XP in a place brimming with XP.
---
Unless you pay to make it go faster...
---
Imagine paying 130 bucks for a broken game made by a company that obviously doesn't give a shit about it's customers.
---
:kekw.gif:
---
What do you share? I have only 4 charisma, so I can't share much. I play mostly "lone wanderer", but if  join a team I switch to share "strange in numbers", since that's about all I can share. Would you prefer a group of four all sharing "Strange in numbers"? I doubt they stack, but if they do, all the better.
---
The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai
---
I don't even bother looting at any of those events you mentioned. It's totally undoable at this point. Xbox
---
You're an angel. One of my first solid bases withball bells and wells was right over bridge from the Wayward. I had SEVERE issues trying to get into an available server, ontop of my friends havin trouble in other spots. I've moved slightly to bum F Egypt in The Forrest. No FO1st subbing from this guy though, they only getting my dollar off of gamepass.
---
the game is literally a lie in comparison to what Todd hyped up. It's your fault you bought-in to what they advertised. no pity here.
---
I hear ya, I think it's also blind optimism.  I too wanted to see this game get better, genuinely wanted to see this game improve, but instead, time and time again.. stuff like this happens.  It's sad really, some in the building community are really nice people - these same people were the ones buying the most from that Atom $hop... just, what a bone headed move on their part, they've done plenty of those already, but this latest one, it really takes the cake.
---
You can already play it on the Series X though? All Xbox One and every current BC-capable 360/Xbox title will be playable
---
Lmfao I actually cackled at the C. H. O. R. E and scared my wife. I always tell her I'll brb that I'm going to "work" when I log on
---
Oh yeah if you look at it like that it does end on Tuesday.
---
I meant that the last challenges will be released on that Monday. 
---
Sorry for any confusion
---
Well you can filter so you should need to scroll forever
---
Can you explain what this about? It looks super interesting but I have no clue what any of this is.
---
in Russian variant the colossal problem is listed for September
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/etuGduR](https://imgur.com/a/etuGduR)
---
Wait scrapping counts as crafting it?
---
I only pay fallout 1st to get the scrapbox and actually support the game, did not know people actually cared for the other things.
---
Private servers? You mean the forever alone world?
---
LOL - here this is again, for the 4th time:
---
Dude my friend and I already donated 50k
---
There's a discount right now on an excavator power armor skin and the doctors mask, I think.  It's usually an item from a previous atom sale at a discount, found on the same tab as free items.  There's nothing to indicate it's because you have FO1st, which is a shame.  If you were to switch from steam to Bethesda launcher, or visa versa, it will only show up in whatever launcher your FO1st is tied to.  Recently the cement tires were on there and I also got the Vault Boy/Girl PA helmet that way.
---
They are never gonna fix this game, just move on
---
Even in 1 attribute it gets annoying eventually
---
It's a mediocre game that is playable and fun with friends.  And I never expect it to become more than that. At this  point there is no reason to.
---
Glad to know it's not just my save and hopefully a fix will be imminent.
---
Not only this, but (Spoilers for Settlers side follow)
---
I switched over to the Hornwright missions. After fetching Penelope the Pip-Boy schematics and other bits, I took them back to her, exhausted the dialogue to send her to Foundation and that questline seems bugged too. As soon as I leave, it directs me back in to her, and the quest directive remains as 'Give Schematics etc to Penelope'.
---
So for me, both branches of Wastelanders are blocked at the moment. :)
---
Didn't you hear? Some guy on YouTube didn't like the patch so Bethesda shutting 76 down. The servers are going offline at midnight.
---
I didn't rescue him when I found him, I just looted the room and left him in the cell without speaking to him as I already had Sofia as an ally at that point.
---
I don't think I've ever seen a CAMP anywhere near there before.
---
It does say "craft or scrap power armor pieces"
---
Very cool tool - thank you for putting that together!
---
Baseballs also provide cork.
---
1st doesn't increase your camp budget. It gives you about six new things in the atom shop, two of those are emotes and one is a photo frame. Oh, and you get a lag box. Remember when they said having a higher stash limit would make the game really laggy and glitchy? Giving them $99 didn't change that.
---
A Doomified Deathclaw icon could be pretty badass though...
---
True, the last Daily challenges would be released on Monday, agreed.
---
Communism and fascism are not interchangeable.
---
A DISSENTER IS.. among us. We welcome you and your pebbles. Come with us. We must introduce you to the clan elders. He who is shall divine your... saviour.
---
Where did I suggest a single deadline? Please... You've used every possible way to excuse this. The whataboutism now followed by putting words in my mouth I never used.
---
Once again, clearly spelled out - shit's been broken, late and missing since release. New updates bring even more issues and rarely fix anything. Multiple features are missing from the start. This is systematic, not a single deadline as you try to say.
---
I tried having a discussion. Reaching for excuses, deflecting and twisting what's being said to try and discredit it is not a civil discussion,  so I stopped treating it as one.
---
... Really? Mansplaining? Here, on the internet, where gender only exists if you offer it, it's mansplaining? Never mind the laughable assumption of my gender you have to do to apply that label?
---
I am not saying that games are *entitled* to microtransactions, I am saying that AAA game studios need them to survive. I am saying that 1) games cost a hell of a lot more to produce than they used to, 2) sell for almost the same price as they did before online gaming, 3) patches almost never happened before online gaming became a thing because there was no reliable delivery system, 4) and at this point, having seen you defend your age repeatedly and watching you act like online gaming started in 20-friggen-10 and that Windows 98 was somehow not an online platform, I rather do think that you are certainly not old enough to remember a world where you couldn't hop online to patch out a bug or look up a walkthrough.
---
In short: You're both belligerent and full of shit, making you an unarguable and bonified member of Reddit. Congratulations.
---
Why would the rewards be better?
---
108/125 now
---
Its the typical "Divide and Conquer tactic" similarly used by governments when they get criticized. 
---
* Camp building enthusiasts get upset at Bethesda with the patch "fix"
---
* Bethesda says "Badman Dupers because &lt;insert excuse here&gt;"
---
*  Camp Builders now blame Dupers instead of blaming Bethesda
---
Ok bucko 😂😂😂
---
Or just put it on the FO1st tab
---
Can we get past this already? If you don't want to donate, then don't. But asking for improved rewards for turning in junk is pretty ridiculous, and frankly not gonna happen. 
---
Just about everything in this game is minimal effort lately... seriously folks. I have a full time job and can only play a couple of hours a night and I still participate... because it's EASY AF!!!
---
I kind of assumed it was a trepanning helmet or something.
---
Yes, it's a widely known thing.
---
They even snuck their theme song right into the game:
---
 I'm hunting bugs, I'm hunting bugs, out here in Appalachia there are spiders, ants, and slugs! 
---
 I'm hunting bugs, bugs of all kinds. Some come out at night, but they're cool at all times!
---
Can confirm with some certainty that this is likely correct
---
That’s been reported a few times. Seems like it just a weird delay bug.
---
You'll be done with Outer Worlds in a day. I enjoyed it but fuck was it short.
---
In my case, it wasn't just an animation replay. I am consistently gaining Score. I'm gaining ranks because of it. A lot of ranks. Not as much as the previous glitch where folks were getting to rank 100 in a single day, but gaining over 12 ranks in two days. I'm still getting 1000 or 1500 Score per award per server hop while looking for events that yield scrip. I'm still server hopping to farm events and I'm still getting serious Score. This is definitely some kind of glitch.
---
the parts for the robots are in the files. would not surprise me if they bring a version of robot crafting in the future. probably will be camp bound though.
---
Try the nuka cola plant near vault 76
---
Why would you buy them now?  Wait until near the end, just normal play will gain score
---
May as well be a billion. Beth is just fudging the numbers regardless. Every goal will be met, or they'll say we were close and but they'll give us the reward for good will and "being an awesome community!".  
---
Working us.
---
Sometimes I really get tempted to pull out my bloodied Gauss mini gun and just let rip.
---
On riding shotgun the other day I was playing with my level 12 and was joined by a level 300+  I called him to 2 legendaries (couldn’t kill them anyway) we get to the captain he jumps up and wastes him even before I can get a shot in.
---
I was so tempted to fire up one of my high level characters and screw up every event for him.
---
The selfishness is getting worse, even when you call people to a legendary it’s usually 1shotted by the first person to arrive
---
Yes, this is happening to me as well! Very weird.
---
Might wanna try the Nuka Cola plant.
---
"That's what my new Entomologist badge is for!"
---
Where did you see it is scheduled for patch 22?
---
I played the whole game. There was one bug where I couldn't loot a couple NPCs. It didn't crash once the entire time. There weren't map holes.  All quests were completable.
---
 It was a nice change.
---
On today’s roadmap
---
Oh yes, definitely. I’m just pointing it out.
---
I was gunnu same the same thing. I don't get the hate lol. I like em
---
Thank you for your time and effort creating/maintaining this!
---
Gets better. The mole miners don't even approach until we start up the drilling machines that make the entire underground complex shudder. If we weren't greedily mining ~~uranium scrip legendaries~~  them, they'd never have approached.
---
The agriculture center usually has some. And out front of the white spring gold course
---
From my experience, it’s been *less*buggy lately. I wanted to test out if having a leftover place setting could be put in a display case, and went to the event. The robots practically made a beeline to the dining room and there were two other players that joined. We got the entire event finished with almost a full satisfaction bar. 
---
Maybe it was that I’d done it so often before ai knew a good path for the setting pieces or had a good vantages point to watch for enemies, but it went really smooth.
---
Even screwed that up. There aren’t any spiders or slugs in the game. Lol
---
Absolutely not attacking you. Stating that if you read some posts here people blatantly do that shit. Lately its because of the Score shit. Whether its for a free 20caps, xp or a chance to greif somebody walking by. Most prominent at the Abadoned Bog Town and Hemlock Holes. But over the course of the past 3 weeks the culprit has been the Score system. But in a very small percentage of cases its server disconnects. Which falls on unstable servers (3 nuke zones, duping, glitching) and connectivity issues on the players end. Those affect the server you are in, which means if you got disconnected. Whose fault is it then? Is it yours? Nope. Is it the people/person doing shady shit at a workshop? Yes. 
---
Does this need a fix? Absolutely. But don't throw Bethesda under the bus if you don't rule out all possible scenarios. Every disconnect I have had since beta ranged from carry weight glitch to over budgeted camps fucking my frame rate up to Whitesprings. And my connection fucking up from time to time. Which is 80% of the causes. 
---
Look at it now walk past camps grouped up in one area and tell me your frame rate doesn't tank. 
---
Apologies for the rant and I got off topic slightly.
---
I really don’t care about donating or the rewards, I already did my part. It’s the other people who are complaining about having no incentive.
---
Yup broken for my alt right now as well.
---
When does he reset?
---
Fellow Brethren a PSA! There is a free demonic cat backpack in the atomic temptation shop. Do not be tempted. For the wrath of Mothman wills it! I shall not be tempted. I shall not be tempted. I shall not be tempted. Well let me unlock this. I must investigate this further.
---
the top three were discussed on a similar post a few weeks ago, and we came to the conclusion it would be difficult to implement increased camp budgets/areas due to the fact that when you jumped to an adventure world your camp would be bigger than the server allowed and possibly wouldn't load so they would have to implement two camps for 1st users one on private worlds and one on adventure worlds. The same would happen with workshops a 1st player wouldn't be able to bring their workshops over to an adventure world. 
---
I also think we haven't had them yet as they've been waiting to see how well Private servers worked, so I'm hoping they figure out a way for us to have two camps one which comes with us to adventure worlds and one that stays on private worlds with the increased budget, build areas, and the persistent workshops.  
---
And you're right I'm still waiting for my 1st Discounts
---
I found myself stuck in the exact same problem. This game is still so buggy that they'll have to redo it again.
---
There is a soda bar at the upper floors inside whitesprings mall, that sells different kinds of nuka colas.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
This needs to be a priority.
---
Thanks. Seems unlikely.
---
I hate dupers and find them borderline stupid, but I won't blame them for the fuckfest this game is, really.
---
Bugs, glitches, inconsistencies and just plain bad programming are part of the DNA here. 
---
We are playing a game where shotguns can be either magical or useless; a game where you can have "legacy" items which can't be removed, etc. 
---
So, dupers suck. But Bethesda has been sucking too.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Enclave bunker service enterance. Not far from there there is a stone fence, with some building. There is a nuka cola machine, most of the time, it is full of colas.
---
Red rocket truck stop has 4 machines.  If you have a private server as an option best to hit that up.
---
Whitespring nuka vendor Bubbles (upstairs from the shops) has several varieties on sale.
---
Sadly, nobody has any Vim!
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4tltu/_/g0knieu/?context=1 you said right here it cannot be delayed. Take a moment to reflect on this conversation and tone throughout. One of us sounds agree. The other is just confused about all the hostility.
---
It’s better business to push your best games out to build hype. Not your worst.
---
traitors...
---
A Jukebox maybe?
---
The patch notes say Monday now, but i am not sure if it is an 8pm reset like now or if it got changed to noon with the other daily resets. It use to reset at 8pm on Saturdays but Smiley always says he reset on Monday if you talk to him so they changed it to Mondays with the recent patch.
---
First time finding out about this site. Thank you so much for doing this!
---
Regular (non-legendary) enemies are always fair game; there are plenty of places/opportunities in the game to farm for XP.  For most events, it’s good etiquette to allow everyone to tag a legendary.  However, Radiation Rumble and Project Paradise are my two exceptions.  The priority on those events is to keep the NPCs/creatures alive; unless a ton of players are at the event,I’m trying to kill all enemies (including legendaries) as quickly as possible.  I feel this is an appropriate approach, but would be glad to hear everyone’s comments.
---
Dirt easy, death has no consequences there is no difficulty as it's an mmo.  You'll feel weak at first but once you get your build going its mindless easy.
---
We are aware and working on a fix for this one ASAP
---
Pre patch, I've found its easier to become addicted if you alternate between slamming 2 different chems. You can spam the same one in a row but I doesn't seem to work as quickly as alternating. When alternating, it took about 5-10 to become addicted. Sometimes you get lucky and it happens sooner, sometimes unlucky and it happens later.
---
As he sits clipping into his chair
---
Then let them complain. They'll complain anyway... no matter what happens.
---
Rofl I misread that and didn’t realize you already cleared it. I would’ve don’t the same thing 😂
---
Nowhere does it say "single deadline". You bring a link and immediately attempt to twist what's said while the original is right there. Stop lying to excuse this and excuse yourself instead already like you said you would. This amount of word twisting and lying is insulting to look at.
---
Alright thanks
---
1. Yes you got setup, you turn passivist mode on and not worry about that ever again if you want.
---
2. You became Wanted because you picked an owned lock. Don't do that. 
---
3. Quest is currently broken. You'll probably have to wait for a hotfix.
---
4. You can't build a camp at a Workshop or any named location on the map.
---
5. At your level it's best just to setup your camp in a place nearby your current quests. Later on you'll find a more permanent spot that suits your play style. You don't need to hook up your  purifiers to your sink and toilet. You do need to hook your purifier up to a power generator though.
---
6. You build a vending machine and sell your ammo to other players. 1 cap per piece. Or you can drop it if you want.. Ammo is easier in this game than most would have you believe. You can also do the SCORE challenges to get the ammo converter, it's pretty low on the reward list and you should have plenty of time to get it before the season is done. It's tedious to use, but free ammo is free ammo.
---
Fair enough. My point stands, though, regardless of the exact individual: I want protectors and good guys, even if they're cut off from the rest of the Brotherhood.

Lol I thought it was 4 for all 4 components, I just assumed it was once you unlocked that reward you’d move onto the next like the last one
---
Honest question here, what is the incentive to hit level 100 on the legendary run? I haven't changed a single thing about the way that I play and I think I'm around level 37 or so on it, but can't say for certain. I just log in, do my thing, and log out without so much as glancing at the challenges. I like the power armor skins, and getting some free atoms or caps is cool, but I can't help feeling like investing any time in doing daily this or that isn't worth the trouble. I apologize if this seems rude, but is it some sort of obsessive FOMO that keeps people tethered to the legendary run?
---
You said it cannot be delayed to meet your expectations. Sorry if I misunderstood.
---
As I said, I’m going to go. The hostility and overreactions are a little exhausting. Have a good day.
---
&gt;4 months content drought for a live service game
---
There's a bit of a distinction here between a live service game with a monthly sub, like FF14, versus what 76 is where you could technically buy the game for $20 and that's all you'll ever pay.
---
Make no mistake, I am disappointed with their sluggish output.  But I'm more disappointed by how they wait until the last minute to announce delays, and how said content often doesn't meet my already-measured expectations in terms of quality, or how they don't bother to fix things that have been broken from the beginning (It's a Trap, anyone?).
---
I would rather they have a consistent stream of modest updates rather than these big drops in A~~utumn~~ W~~inter~~ Spring that we blow through (and are weirdly incentivized to) in a matter of days.  We know from Wastelanders they are capable of a lot better.  Instead, we have this A-Team/B-Team situation where we deal with B-Team's unappetizing scraps throughout most of the year.
---
I rolled 3 1 star unys so far.....i just want some friggin poison resist plz!
---
You will be happy. Played through that pretty eagerly and a replay. Fallout should leave it to real RPG developers to develop their RPG
---
Use the CSS or full Troubleshooters set, Llvl 3 Sneak.  Avoid repairing the reactor with three Lockpick cards keeping left as you enter reactor room and lock picking door to room to use computer to open door out of the area(requires all three hacker perk cards).  I have found that shooting the turrets is a lot quicker than deactivating them with the computers.  A Prime Troubleshooters Fixer for the turrets and all robots but the Assaultrons.  I use either a Instigating Gauss shotgun or Instigating combat Shotgun in VATS to ambush the Assaultrons and one shot them 90% of the time or, they can be killed with a full magazine from the Prime Troubleshooters Fixer.  Usually switch to my T 65 PA in Control room and Prime AA LMG to tank out the robots there.  Then switch to Excavator when ready to launch as I have so much weight I need it and a Pepperoni Roll to Fast Travel to the Blast Zone.
---
I’m in Canada but I can help every now and the message me and we’ll exchange gamer tags
---
From what Ive heard the Atom shop discounts are there, they just arent advertised as FO1st discounts so its hard to tell which of them are since, although you're being shown the discounted price, you're not told that it's a discounted price
---
Does anyone know a new method for stacking foundations yet, or one that still works?
---
Cool, didn't know golf ball's had cork. I know about the search function, just never needed to search for cork.
---
So not actual bloody weapons?
---
We are totally not quitting, we are just complaining, we need something to complain or we go mad.
---
I'm probably gonna play this till i die, and i am paying fallout 1st too, cause nobody can play this game without scrapbox
---
&gt;Grenades  and mines seem to be fairly harmless when not perked for them,  including the stronger ones (nuka, nuka quantum, plasma, pulse).
---
Are we playing the same game? Last time I checked most grenades one-shot even when you're not perked and can be shot with VATS to explode early. Even 40mm grenades can one-shot with enough buffs.
---
September 22 - 28
---
Yeah i added enough to say I did my part but not going overboard
---
They fixed it. It no longer clips!
---
Depends on the group and the levels of the players.
---
Ah. Ok well yeah now it makes sense why everyone is so upset. I’m annoyed by all this other stuff too tbh.
---
Bethesda adjusted the backpacks in Patch 21 so they didn't clip into the player's back.
---
Clearly, no one bothered to do this with the *new* backpack.
---
No, but you're still technically a bloodied build
---
The BoS probably doesn’t know that radiation in west virginia has caused ressources to respawn infinitely.
---
It's their first game. I'm expecting outer worlds 2 to be far far superior to their first draft
---
This is an amazing suggestion.
---
When you turn off auto renewal, that is called canceling membership. That is even what Bethesda calls it. [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/48732/\~/how-do-i-cancel-my-fallout-1st-membership-on-bethesda.net%3F#:\~:text=To%20cancel%20your%20Fallout%201st,cancel%20or%20modify%20your%20membership.](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48732/~/how-do-i-cancel-my-fallout-1st-membership-on-bethesda.net%3F#:~:text=To%20cancel%20your%20Fallout%201st,cancel%20or%20modify%20your%20membership.) Canceling your membership is turning off auto-renew. And to do that, you have to click a big red button that says "CANCEL MEMBERSHIP" .
---
Woot? Drum is 30????
---
The time it takes to do that, you could have just shared a card.
---
Is there an example, a picture of a double-sided wall vs a normal one? I am a total noob in camp building and cannot understand what it means.
---
I found great balance with a bloodied SMG. I can be tactical, but I will make enough noise to keep it realistic. Small bursts kill most enemies, bosses need more. I am powerful enough to kill and at the same time I am vulnerable enough for some tactics to be required (it is not fun when you can tank everything, there is no risk).
---
I have bloodied faster fire and explosive versions of all weapons (2000 hours in, several characters) but it stops being fun when there is no challenge.
---
An antiarmor handmade or fixer is also cool. A furious or executioner combat rifle can rock. Limb damage is great for crippling, which makes sense when fighting bosses, etc.
---
Actually, cancelling does get their attention. That is the only thing. It does not look good to investors to be losing a revenue stream, so if they need to spend a few weeks fixing bugs they will. But this management team has no respect for their customers, so a few weeks is probably about the best we can expect. But who knows, maybe they will actually hire a few seasoned developers to show their team of summer students and interns the ropes.
---
You guys will complain about ever tiny mistake
---
To come back and do the same thing again?
---
Yep, said in my post that I wasn't looking at bloodied players. 🤦 I know you all can't share them for the most part.
---
Probably will be fixed in next patch if they decide it’s important enough for them, since they know how to fix the problem. They were supposed to shift some backpacks that were clipping away from the player’s body. Clearly they shifted the wrong ones.
---
When you capture a workshop your basically agreeing to pvp.  So if another player tries to claim it from you or you from them it aggros you to the player. When you kill a player your aggro to others I believe. If you break into another players stuff you become aggro and can be attacked. There is no karma in game. Cant hook up water purifier to camp just get water from it. Ammo is very low weight for the most part so I keep all on me. Except for heavy stuff like energy ammo , missles, nukes. and .50 cal balls. Subscribing to fallout first for a month is a good way to relieve yourself of materials. Put as much as possible in for a month then you can pull out of there until out. It lightened my storage box alot.
---
I refer you all to, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/i4n2u8/same_same_same/).
---
way to be a bad fo76 player, I have donated 600k steel so far and plan to do atleast another 10k today.
---
Honestly my only gripe about FO1st is that the Scrap box is a QOL feature that shouldn't be behind a paywall after buying the game. It's really the biggest reason I have FO1st. I rarely, if ever, use private worlds. The survival tent is a nice perk but I could take it or leave it. And the Atoms... well without those I'd feel like the price is a rip off.
---
One day someone came and bought 2k worth of 1 caps bullets. I was so happy because I never sell anything because my camp is far away in the  south.
---
Fo1st members place the tent at the mobs spawn point,  near the mountain, so they start to spawn at one spot. Like 20 mobs at 1x1 square, easy to pewpew
---
Thats mosrly true for a combat situation but not always the case in my experience. I have an original Russian top loader thats ran just fine in the 10 years I've been using it, and a couple Korean ones that are similar to the ones in the game that you load from the back by popping them open and twisting the little key on the back to tension the spring afterwards. Outside of feing flimsy as hell the only time it has any issues is if you load it wrong, both of them are time consuming as hell to load either way.
---
I’m 700 hours into the game idk and I have never got a god roll on any weapon of any type... I have all my toons ready and waiting though.. it will be a glorious day lmao fuck me.
---
Just fantasy.
---
This was always going to be a bug fix focused update.
---
Expecting a big content drop when there's no indication for one is a sure way to let yourself be disappointed.
---
It is a bummer that the Colossus got delayed once again and that there were some bug fixes that got rid of glitches that were populair with the building community and that is something you can hate. But there's no reason to say that this update was lackluster because of having your expectations wrong.
---
Not     gonna     happen
---
Shit. My handmade never even empties the mag. It gets to 9 and auto reloads if I'm holding the trigger. I can burst fire it to empty though. I'd be happy if they just fixed that. But yeah 25 round mags are weird. I'm not even sure they make those IRL.
---
I've met some of your Bretheren just outside of Berkley Springs, but when I tried to talk to them, they shot me in the leg! I barely made it back to the overturned bus I've been living in, not exactly sure that I want to come to your event, especially after this really bad case of gangrene that is setting up in my leg because of the gunshot from your members!
---
My statement is correct, and stands. Just because it’s a staple doesn’t mean it can’t be scrutinized and disagreed with. And saying “that’s how it is over there, so that’s how it should be over here” is just limited thinking.
---
Shit, the MMO genre is ~25 years old. Why is “log in, kill 10 rats, log off” still the idealized state of play? It may be ideal for a micro-transaction driven game that relies on FOMO, but only players who can commit time on the daily can really benefit from it. Everyone else just feels pressured to play - whether it’s for four hours, one hour, or even 30 minutes. 
---
“Dailies” are stupid. “Weeklies” are much better.
---
Honestly, going off the math it should only take 3k steel per a person at most, and this is assuming the playerbase is at its lowest possible figure. If everyone contributed 1-2k, the dupers and FO1st would cover more than enough
---
seconded. considering the backlash, not sure how one could go to the effort of changing this thing and this is what you come up with
---
I'm usually one to defend the game and it's issues... But there is no excuse for this type of oversight. Fixing a bug that inadvertently messes up camp builders I get. But uploading an old calendar shows no care at all for the brand or it's players.
---
It rly is a small consideration, just for the lower lvl ppl who are relatively newer and arent jaded from the purveyor script grinds yet
---
Well, you can ask a refund. Provide a screenshot, and they will refund the atoms AND you can keep the skin too.
---
Just dont be greedy, use this as rare as you can, or they will ignore you.
---
FYI you can hit the right arrow from the map for challenges
---
Canceled my first, I’ll come back in 6 months and see if this game got any better
---
That’s your own fault. You should have tagged them before you called him over. You’re level 12. You weren’t going to steal it from him. I would have done the same thing. I would have assumed you got your tags and needed help finishing it.
---
Side note: If we click the BACK button numerous times, we should be able to LEAVE THE TERMINAL. This is definitely a bug.
---
Does anybody know when the season ends? I’m rank 52 right now and will have to take a week off from the game next week so I’m worried I won’t make it at this rate
---
On one of my alts:
---
***Charisma 4***
---
*When solo:*
---
Lone Wanderer 3 (4)
---
*When teamed-up:*
---
Field Surgeon 1 (2), Team Medic 2
---
Which perk would you like me to share when I’m teamed up?
---
While they’re at it, the radium rifle can do more than 15 rad damage. 50 or even 100 would be perfectly fine. Human enemies aren’t meant to be tanky, and as you say, pvp doesn’t need to be accounted for in adventure.
---
Agreed or like me.. once I get 100% plans (super close) I'll be seeking out new players to dump my thousands of plans I have saved. I have tons of seasonal plans going back to beta. So there is no lose here. Someone is getting the goods.
---
Look at all that salt. 🤣😂🤣
---
I doubt we would get private servers with the way fallout 1st works. But mod support is a must.
---
Yes, that way we can finally use that info Davenport was asking us to gather,destroy foundations generator,burn crater's crop's,use that small camp as a sniper's nest etc etc.
---
Yas. I modded mine to bladed. Also Lfg unarmed punching only. I'd love to get an army of punchers to take down sbq haha. The rule: only use lvl 10 ranged weapons dropped from leader of the pack to get sbq to land. Just imagine 100 players punching the sbq.... Just imagine
---
SMG is my favourite too. Second is radium rifle, now that I have modded it to its best.
---
The SMG feels raw. Fuck those silenced multipliers!
---
I just wanted fallout 4 coop.
---
I'm didn't quit playing, I just stopped paying. So, I guess I quit paying.
---
I don't care which one. If you have the ability to share one just share it.
---
I haven’t had power since Tuesday afternoon, feel like I’m missing so much!
---
They don’t stack
---
I have 4 Cha on one of my alts and run Field Surgeon and Team Medic 2 when on a team.  I can’t share either of those.
---
Or how about they reward us like eso by logging in daily
---
The backpack is so cuuuute😍
---
I had something simular happen to me ,store the cores then log off and on again, then take them out of the stash and try them. This worked for me.
---
Well I uninstall and reinstalled the game and it seemed to fix it. Hopefully Bethesda can fix this problem, this isn’t the first time I’ve had it happen sadly.
---
If you hold down (B) it overrides backing out of fourtyseventhousand screens. I agree though. It's like these updates are designed to torture us, mind boggling.
---
Camden Park on the playground in the back by the river there is a bunch on the picnic tables
---
Yea it'll be playable on Series X/PS5. The only thing as of now is that they haven't said anything about wether or not it will get a free next gen upgrade
---
Are there really that many players though? There’s an average of 10k a day on steam, the largest gaming platform, I can’t imagine it would be higher on console and BGS and this sub has 200k
---
I just deleted mine. I would legit rather just dump ammo than deal with that useless thing.
---
I will not be participating in the donations, because the junk is more valuable to me than the rewards are. But I think that's because my characters are all pretty "mature". My main knows most plans in the game, and my other characters all know most of what I want them to have. I could see how the chance to get plans would appeal to a good number of players.
---
Lol. Seriously people need to take a deep breathe and not resort to button mashing when something isn't happening the way they think it should. Pro-tip, hold the back button for a second.
---
If weeklies achieved the objectives that the designers (in this case managers) wanted to achieve they would move to them exclusively.
---
My argument was not that how it is, is how it should be. My argument is that within the framework of existing context the dailies for this game take much less time than comparative games within the same genre.
---
You decided to take my statement, change the context and attack me for it. That's on you.
---
Fallout 1st will make absolutely no difference with your problems.
---
I'd start by reducing your graphics bit by bit to see if that makes any difference.  There are also a few posts floating around about increasing your FPS with INI file settings (not an expert there, but there have been a couple lately posted here), that can help a lot.  If you're running at a high resolution, consider reducing that (I'm able to run at 4K, but *barely*, I'd turn that down if I was having issues, and I'm thinking about it anyway).
---
Lastly, look at your system.  You don't post your specs (and it's not necessary really), but this game can tax even really good systems.  If your system is old or minimal compared to the requirements, go a little more crazy with the stuff above. Also, do a health check on your ram, and verify your graphics drivers (sometimes updating helps, sometimes rolling them *back* can help (though that's somewhat unusual).
---
I'm by no means an expert on all this, I've just been futzing with PCs and games since the two first met.  It's a *really* complicated and deep set of issues, with lots of possibilities for things to get messed up, but conversely a ton of possibilities for making improvements.
---
Ok thanks all
---
They are making more content for new ones and delay content for old ones.
---
Sometimes you can get on a super laggy server. Just server hop once or twice and see if you get the same lag on different servers.
---
THANK YOU!!!! I thought I was to force close the game upon writing this.
---
How does one quick level lol
---
Very much so. I do a few a day for funsies.
---
Ok so I'm only at level 35 but here's my opinions:
---
1: really anyone can murder you (whether you want to fight back or not) but luckily all you loose is any junk you have on you. (I generally store it every chance I get.)
---
2: you're pretty much asking to die and make enemies if you're picking locks lol playing the tube wasn't the issue, b&amp;e was.
---
3: a few quests have been glitched at various points in the quest. You might can reach out to Bethesda for support.
---
4: with the workshops, you are already using personal junk to build, so for me it's useless to use your camp in a workshop because it doesn't last when you log out and you can defend it well enough without the camp.
---
5: your camp can have both toilet/sink and water purifiers but they can't be connected. I have a line of purifiers to make to consumption and to sell.
---
6: I have too much ammo constantly after scavenging at places. I always give the 'low level' ammo at no charge from my vending machines, and 1 cap for any other. If you do want to drop extra ammo (or any other stuff for that matter) definitely pass it on for someone else to have/use, always pays to be generous.
---
The issue isn't necessarily double sided walls, the cut here goes deeper than that. You can longer switch a wall to a doorway. This has many negative effects in building as doorways were a good tool for builders and blueprinters. A lot of advanced building techniques are no longer possible due to the inability to change a doorway to a wall. You can change a wall to a different type of wall or window, but not as a doorway.
---
If it ain't not broke then don't fix it.
---
I want to build but I'm so mad that this game keeps back pedaling and becoming more and more restrictive.
---
The best kept secret in the game is the unmarked information center's nuka cola machine, its downhill from the investigator's cabin.
---
It can take a while. Try switching back and forth between chems.
---
I’m glad to hear it’s not just me or else I probably would have deleted the game and reinstall it
---
I did tag them.. but couldn’t get close to the captain..
---
this patch broke the wastelanders quest cause u can no longer enter the carleton mine and broke some others too
---
This event has been so good for me lately that I can solo it now. Only occasionally I'll get a waiter bug where the waiter doesn't spawn into the world with the others and shows up much later. Usually the one just outside the dining room out back.
---
u/valseek This move right here, would turn all the negativity right now into a huge positive, and without a shred of doubt be a positive boon for Fallout 76 across many influencers and players alike. 
---
Come on!
---
you find a high level player and follow them around throwing Molotovs at stuff they're about to kill
---
I’m pretty sure they’ve been working on incorporating a dedicated server from the start. If it’s not attached to a server rather than the player, mods won’t be able to happen and promised features like permanent workshops will be nearly impossible to implement. 
---
Guessing Bethesda just didn’t realize how much work it would take to redo many of their algorithms since normally junk items and some enemies just don’t respawn after being removed from a temp server.
---
"This design was Vault-Tec approved!"
---
As far as I can tell this is all backpacks now...
---
And if that doesn’t pan out, nice CV addition.
---
Wait... 3k steel per person? How little people do you think play this game?
---
I'm getting rather close to going this route. I just had an over abundance of ammo in my vendors I could convert for use for my fixers. The "buy 3 items from a vendor" challenge is nice and easy, but people literally only shop for 3 bullet's at 3 caps... lol
---
He has two Junkie’s characters. 
---
Let’s be honest; a LOT of players viewed Charisma as a dump stat. That’s been a thing in RPGs for over 40 years. 
---
Some people don’t have enough Charisma to share useful cards. Pretty much my entire build on one of my alts (non-bloodied) has nothing lower than a 2-point card, with a Charisma of 4.
---
Threatening punitive actions when you don’t know the player’s build is silly.
---
Simply make the suggestion of what are good perk cards to share. If someone can share them, great!  If not, that’s okay.
---
Donated about 6K steel on the first day.  Didn't open any packages incase they patch the drop table. 108M of the 125M needed  has already been donated so I probably won't donate more unless Beth says something acknowledging the bad drops.
---
What I don't get is how the hell the community is supposed to produce 200 Million cork.  You get like 1 cork per pipe weapon scrapped and I can't think of any other common sources.  I probably have less than 2K cork between all my characters compared to steel which I had probably 30x the amount.
---
No where is it indicated that F76 isn't going to be upgraded. 
---
Believe it or not, Fo76 is a Money Maker for Bethesda. With the subscription service, Microsoft paying for the rights to have it on Gamepass and atomic shop sales, Bethesda would be dumb to not do that. 
---
But they're upgrading it, no cost, so we have nothing to worry about.
---
I really hope if we fail then they arrive to nothing.
---
Gotcha. Don’t think the other guy is an asshole though. If I see a low level player motioning to me I’m always going to assume they need help.
---
May the geese be with you
---
I don't think that's the issue bro. Issue being they market shit off like it's coming sooner then it really is. The road map they have up is more confusing then anything. I'd say, quit hyping up your shit when it's foul.
---
Wheres that one dude with 1m of every resource we need to complete this dumb shit lol
---
&gt; discounts on atom shop items 
---
These exist both in the form of 1st-only discounts (for example, right now 1st playaers can buy Excavator Coal Dust Paint for 80% off) and *free items for 1st players only*, like the hearts bed and rug that we can claim currently. Last month we got the Bog Wanderer outfit.
---
On your list, this is the only item for which Bethesda has not only delivered on their promise, they *over-delivered* by giving us free stuff and not just discounts. 
---
Do they need to make it more obvious that these extra deals are 1st-only? Absolutely; it would be wise to put them in the Fallout 1st section of the Atom Shop. But it's unfair to say they have not delivered on this particular promise.
---
Now that that's out of the way, the rest of your post is valid and I completely agree.
---
I’m stopping once I get the chicken coop.
---
Dude, they’ll still be on your hard drive. I play PS4, all my pics are in the capture gallery.
---
I'd drink there.
---
I assure you, bulletpyton, nobody here deleted your photos.
---
They need to go and shit on their desks.  Something has to happen or we all may as well quit right now, because stupid limits and daily chores will only increase until people quit en mass or change occurs.
---
I use it cause it looks cool😎
---
Lol. Im monthman til i die g. Cuter than a button and savage as a storm
---
 Just like ny babe :)
---
So I have the options on screen that say "X to Take (Hold X to Use)" but I am supposed to know holding the button exits a terminal?
---
Power armor after the pipe spot seems to super helpful WINK WINK HINT HINT
---
For today, I hit 3 birds in one stone: I went where the Uranium Fever starts. I killed 5 glowing moleminers, and found a PA with 3 parts to scrap.
---
Do you charge the same amount of caps for all the ammo types?
---
Yep, up close and personal the smg excels at but I've noticed there is a little glitch when the explosive prefix is added that no matter what barrel you put on it ( I have a stub barrel it looks cooler) it does damage at any range 😉 even far away
---
Math says 41,667 total players at 3K steel each for the 125 million total.
---
So you can still get the same amount of score, if they go for kill six legendarys you would only get score once AND be forced to do "both" even if the score reflects it
---
That’s fair enough but do you hurdle the barrier before it explodes then jump up and kill the captain before the only other person doing the event can even get close enough to tag?
---
Just tried it. No luck
---
Who the fuck is downvoting all the comments?
---
You can't. You could get plushies and stuff from the atom shop and put them places. But junk can only go in displays
---
I actually did it.
---
Got one, waiting for a dupe to come lol
---
If I didn't check reddit, how the fuck am I supposed to know about these events? No in-game notifications at all, great job guys. Jesus Christ.
---
Door. Glitch.
---
The plushies you'll see on couches and whatnot will be atom store items. You can display toys you find out in Appalachia in display cases found under "display" in your camp build menu
---
Stealth Suit and the perk that gives 75% chance to Hack Robots to turn friendly.
---
***Neither of those can be shared.***
---
They are both 2-point cards on a build with only Charisma 4. 
---
A character with a Charisma of 3 to 5 can only share 1-point cards. If their build doesn’t *use* any one point cards, they have nothing to share.
---
I think we should beg the f4 modders to do the unofficial patch mod but for 76.
---
I think the point is not every non-bloodied build has more than 2 CHA either, I have a full health sniper, she has 1 CHA since she doesn’t need more than 1.
---
Same problem here. Both me and friend stuck on this quest.
---
It’s their first Outer Worlds Game. But some if the people behind it made Fallout. So they actually have a lot of experience. That’s not a knock at the game.
---
I tested it yesterday, and the poster/rug glitch still works for getting wires through walls, and looks cleaner too.
---
Really?  They  cAnt make this one work properly. I dunno if I’m ready for a next gen port!
---
Same. It’s never come up and rarely needed for anything, which is probably why I have so much stocked up. I’ll probably be able to donate more Cork than Steel, just because I use Steel regularly.
---
Considering 9,000 players are on steam alone at this second, that doesn’t seem to make much sense. I bet there are that many online right now across platforms, but daily user count would be much higher. 
---
Anyway I read the comment as 3k needed per person for us to finish the remaining $16m, which would mean only about 5k players, which would be even more crazy!
---
Nope, they'll be fine!
---
Thank you for the update!
---
Hello
---
Diseased lvl 95 noxious shit log floaters have the worst aoe
---
I have a CAMP that has a junk pile and lead resource as well and it's fantastic.  It's super unlevel so get ready to build some stepped foundations.
---
This is exactly what they're pushing for man, it's exactly what they did with that mole miner event that required caps to craft them if you wanted. Just like this event.
---
If it works like in Fallout 4 then you would be more or less knocking 100 damage off per shot against ghouls in that case
---
Have a magic shotty. :) nothing special but everyone deserves some magic. Ps4?
---
I've quit last year, started again a few months later, and quit 3 weeks later. I'm only here to watch the dumpster fire burn.
---
Caught in a landslide
---
Or even a Charisma of 5 but doesn’t run any 1-point cards.
---
Yeah-yup. Game design should be intended to make user friendly content.
---
Thank you for this, I would rather have this open on my phone than frequently check my challange screen when I inevitably forget every 12 seconds lmao
---
When I say junk pile I don’t mean the lootable ones I more mean stuff that you’d see at say the scrapyard workshop near Morgantown or around raider camps
---
Keep in mind that the game was released on the BGS only at first. Steam probably isn't that accurate.
---
Conspiracy of the green goo pools next to glitched naked enemies
---
Don’t call him over than. Get your tags in and let him do the rest. If you call me over I’m killing anything that moves so you don’t die and can complete the event quicker. If you don’t call me over I’ll just check on you every so often to make sure you don’t get overwhelmed. If you’re on a low level don’t motion anyone unless you need help.
---
Bethesda laughs.. If this happens, people don t need to enter all the days and bethesda don t want this.
---
Escape reality.
---
True, but it's one of MANY events to quit the game over.
---
If you find out let me know.... For afriend
---
It works, but it has a very, very small "hit box."
---
I also accidentally scrapped mine. I think the only way to get another one is to start a new character and do the quest line, or buy it from another player.
---
Still, if the game isn’t doing to well on the largest platform on the planet, then I can’t see Xbox and PS4 and BGS having more than 10K as well
---
I hope they don't upgrade it. They'll probably ruin it like Fallout 4. That game needed a performance boost, but oh no, we got a 4k sub 30 fps upgrade instead.
---
This is correct. All of your in game album should be backed up to your capture gallery or similar. If you delete the game save data, then it WILL delete your in game album as well as your character display pics.
---
Thing is with this loot, if not unlocked, nobody gets it.  Therefore nobody misses out.
---
Sadly it was placebo effect.
---
I play without FO1st, and steel is a life boat for my survival as a Vault dweller. Why design something to empty duped resources, but not adress all the Ammo machine bs going on, or Christmas presents? Wadu?
---
Yeah. I cancelled before my renewal tomorrow.
---
Mainly due to the price £11.99  which is a little too steep. I may consider purchasing again after season 2.
---
They should consider a "fallout 2nd" deal, you get the tent, scrapbox, rewards. But no atoms for like £5 a month. Then I would just grind out the dailies for the atoms instead.
---
Yeah, quite likely a possibility as well.  Especially once we start seeing people scrap cards to earn perk coins.
---
Anyone having trouble find ingpower armour to scrap?   I used wiki and have now gone to 9 different places and can't find any.
---
The purveyor loot table was added to events. So if you have the fixer plan learned, or gauss shotgun, etc they will drop now
---
As it should've been
---
The game feels a bit disjointed and random, why the hell don't they just make fallout 5 with local multiplayer ie, I hop in my buddy's game or vice versa like old LAN Doom make it where 2nd player or even 3rd temporarily replaces  companions
---
Ash Heap sounds right up your street! There's a trailer/coffee shop you can build in/around. Pretty cool wee place. There's a ginger cat that lives there too. I'm not 100% on the location though!
---
They added it, yes, but you have to learn the plan. They can drop Fixers too.
---
I thought that’s what loot pool they were added to? Events.
---
Oh were in agreement. I just meant their first outer worlds game. They created a new interface, new history and lore. I'm more excited to see where they take it next. I think they've got a great team to develop the universe they started into something special.
---
Nobody said you owed anybody any time...? Wtf? You’re an idiot. 
---
If an exploit is a duplication method, then it’s a duplication exploit. It’s still a duplicating either way, and it’s considered lazy, and cheating pretty much.
---
No matter how many times you try to justify jumping through loopholes to easily get 10k of each junk component, it’s still lazy and cheating. 
---
Time consuming? Are you kidding me? Lol I spend maybe three hours a day on Fo76 5-6 days of the week and I get all my dailies, quests, and challenges all done within 3 hours and I add at least 150 pounds of junk a day. Time consuming my ass, you just suck at being a vault dweller.
---
I got a Troubleshooters Exploding mini G that says you can 😂
---
Donated 2k and planning to farm for more, but to be fair I am a new player so the plans are good for me
---
We apologize for the inconvenience. Our brethren can be a bit over zealous at times. I will speak with my people and see if we can accomadate you with one of our pamphlets. Please stop by and use one our healing temples of worship. Mothman welcomes all souls. Praise be the light of Mothman!
---
I am allready in fallout 76 detox for a week,i know now that i can survive with out it, i stoped trying to pay my groceries with bottlecaps and i am not on a steady diet of spam and nuka cola dark,also my landlord is not a ghoul although he is very ugly, last time he came by i paid the rent and i didnt chased him around with my Grognak axe, so yes i guess i really quited
---
Looks like we are pretty similar. I wouldn't bother with lucky break or lucky draw. Also ordinance express is a waste imo, but I never use explosives.
---
Ah good stuff, must have misread.
---
They will be nuked.  Don’t you worry
---
Brotherhood of deal, you drive a hard bargain
---
Aslong as I dont have to keep turning in osmosis kits to Joel Embiid
---
Oh I actually was setup there at some point last year, I like it but as I’m building a workshop which (in my head) is supposed to have vehicle access it’s a bit too off the beaten path for my liking.
---
I mean, yeah, but it’s a radiation weapon. I’d expect this. The gamma gun behaves the same way.
---
Russell is going to be assigned to milking brahim.  The brotherhood will walk all over him.
---
For me personally, it fits in my gaming budget just fine. I don't generally get more than one new game a month. And lately nothing has come out that really made interested me and I haven't gotten a new game since RE3. So spending 14 bucks a month on F1st isn't really breaking the bank for me and just grinding away on 76 keeps me entertained during my pandemic free time.
---
That being said, this last update soured me pretty bad and with the fall games on their way I'm probably done with 76 all together soon.
---
Oh lol. I haven’t  logged in and checked yet.
---
I saw someone ranked 246 recently. Like... how? How in the world? How many hours played is that?
---
*The Enclave would like to know your location, for your safety*
---
Meh iv donated around 10 - 15k, im going to get the steel while grinding anyway, the little box is just a bit extra i get for my standard grind. I highly doubt ill be touching the other donate materials though, that stuffs just too precious and out the way to farm, that most certainly isn't worth the rewards, which is a shame as i want the community rewards =/
---
Better to just block toxic clowns like you.
---
I don't know how anything in this hell-mouth year would surprise me, yet, I continually find myself surprised. Probably because I'm an irredeemable rube. 
---
One of those things that's absolutely shocked me was how quickly Bethesda squandered any and all goodwill that came from Wastelanders (which, for the record, I enjoyed and thought was good). 
---
They've allowed massive dupes, shut down player vending and displays for an extended period, introduced EXTREMELY cynical "events" like the treasure hunting and this junk-a-thon that's currently on-going, have not addressed basic functionality like broken perks and legendary effects BUT took time to erase beloved building techniques, and worst of all for me, have leaned so heavily into time-gating and daily log in demands that it is nauseating. 
---
PLEASE stop this, Bethesda. PLEASE make some overtures to your player base and demonstrate that you have some interest in creating a worthwhile experience.
---
As did I, I’ll donate wood and some plastic, but that’s all those freaking are getting from me before they return and I use my five nukes on their base.
---
Imma finish the stupid score grind then I'll at leas take a break for awhile until they get it together
---
So idk about anyone else but "replacing a doorway for a solid wall" just sounds like you need to delete the wall and rebuild another one. It's not that difficult, and if you're going to spend all this time knowingly manipulating glitches, you can certainly use some of that time to dismantle and rebuild a wall. It takes five seconds tops.
---
Is this with the bow or compound bow? I haven’t had much time to use my compound since the update. But the few shots I took felt the same as before the update.
---
Okay cool!
---
Check the grafton dam and red rocket stop in the mire, i almost always find PA with 2-3 pieces behind it
---
We need a lot of uncorked wine, and a lot of ppl dying from alcohol poisoning
---
Thank you, wasteland scientist. Guessing mostly yellow flux farming around there?
---
You buy Nuclear Winter perks with those. When you enter NW vault you can use them when you are in your perk menu.
---
Anyone else notice how the doctor dude in the beginning looks a little like Rick?
---
Sounds like quite the improvement! I’ve know my landlord prior to my fallout 76 addiction and I’m pretty positive she is in fact a ghoul.
---
I'm having more trouble with power armor stands either causing the server to not respond or telling me someone else is using them when I'm all alone in a private server.
---
Its already known, but its just a visual thing, you still get your score points, so nothing to worry about.
---
Ooh thank you
---
I went to Blackwater Mine. 
---
- Killed a Glowing Mole Miner (250)
---
- Killed four more (250)
---
- Leveled Up since I logged out last night super-close to the turnover point (500)
---
- Scrapped the pieces of Power Armor in the shed (250)
---
- Drank some Nuka-Cola to celebrate (250 *burp*)
---
- Earned my Gold Star (250)
---
- Popped over time the player vendor camp that is next to Whitespring Station, because there is *always* one next to Whitespring Station and bought a few pieces of ammo (250)
---
2000 SCORE. 
---
Now I just need to find an event to complete while in a group. Fertile Soil, here I come!
---
Thanks so much, but I am on ps4.
---
Then he’s  hanging from the bars in crater
---
Thank you for the feed back!!
---
Solo is so much easier imo. I'm down to 14 min
---
It's their QuakeCon promotion, free outfit and backpack skin in the Atomic shop.
---
I just bought a few at watoga station. Didn't feel like searching.
---
Junk you cannot. Only atom items and it reauires a bit of camp knowledge and tricks.
---
I know Blackwater mine has a frame. Might try a private server if you have FO1st
---
If you play it like it’s intended, as in, not skipping anything and exploring everywhere, doing all side quests, it can easily take up to 40 hours. So many people just flew through it because they were doing to do multiple play throughs, but not everyone plays like that, and I think the people that take their time will enjoy it more.
---
There's a bunch of spawns in and around wagaona
---
That's wiki wiki wild!
---
There is a decent amount of people that just like building and now they added even more things to get in their way.
---
if it were any other company i'd say they would make currently owned packages unaffected by any drop changes, but it'd bethesda so who the fuck knows
---
Would be awesome if you connect it to a water purifier.
---
That doesn't apply for console. I had to purchase through Microsoft store on my Xbox for my FO1st Sub.
---
No game should make you question this much. I was just as confused when I started and almost gave up were it not for all the cool people in the game and these forums.
---
There are a few 1-point cards I run on my main, like Travel Agent or Gun-Fu 1. But even that second one, some people don’t like because it interferes with how they use VATS. 
---
Personally, I think there should be a way to disable a shared card from affecting your.
---
Rad Sponge couldn’t be used to troll Bloodied team-mates anymore, for example.
---
Yeah, no problem. The fact that they have been sloppy with showing rewards for First in the store is really bad with so much scrutiny. This month's items were in the Special tab of the store and I only know they were my First rewards from another Reddit post...
---
Open your eyes
---
Except for the part where they specifically said it will get a free next gen upgrade.
---
I did a week ago when the Red Dead patch came out. Only played this game till that one was fixed. 76 was fun, but the devs don’t know what they doing. The legendary run is what really broke me. Too much grind and I can’t look at 76 every day without hating it. Too ugly, too many unfixed and unfixable bugs.
---
This is a lot better than this BOS BS Bethesda took so long to think of.
---
Funny, I've been playing and completing every daily and weekly challenge besides the NW ones (though I have completed several of the easier ones of those). I've done lots of the weekly experience bonus ones as I went. All this and I'm only around 74 or so.
---
Having all that extra time to play every day means you must have picked up a ton of the experience ones to put you that far ahead. 
---
Honestly I want to see how close the more average players like myself get...I've been putting extra time into this game at the expense of others I enjoy just to try and get every single daily I can - especially now that there isn't enough daily score to level up each day without the bonus one.
---
why would they change it? as you said, they got your money.
---
I would wager to guess they would lose a whole lot of fallout 1st members. Not sure if fallout 2nd would make up for it. 
---
I wish they did my idea of introducing new features in fallout 1st (first) before going to general public. So fallout 1st members got scrap box 6 months early, or fallout 1st gets survival tent 6 months early. They get things... first. Oh well.
---
You don’t say...
---
Did this start after the last update?
---
"Save Everything" is already a simple mod that fixes basic QoL issues easily but stupid game doesn't let me enter NW (when I'm forced to) with it on. Dude, just add it officially. So sad how easy a modder fixes something that shouldn't even be a problem. Bethesda needs to start asking the modding community for help fixing and improving things cuz clearly they know how to do it and Bethesda doesn't.
---
i want a double drum for the lmg lol. or just a belt.
---
but yeah, 35 round "drum" mags are just asinine.
---
That would of made alot of sense. But alot of players would of held off playing the game for 6 months till they get the content for free I imagine.
---
It's amazing we've been reduced to "brick walls and a flamethrower trap" tricks to put up a bit of wallpaper in our camps.
---
They ruined building for me with all the ridiculous creativity-killing restrictions. I have little interest in it now, despite the hundred+ hours I put into it in Fallout 4.
---
I just rebought the game lmao
---
Have you even played NV?
---
I'm dropping 750, I paid like £7 for the game days after launch, having played beta. Safe to say I've had my moneys worth and then some. Dont mind helping a little, it's like 3 button clicks of my time :-)
---
I'm faily sure that a lot of the people joining on the outrage and threatening to quit are actually already gone or have never played in the first place. This way it may sound like ac actual threat. If they said "I have quite 3 months ago, but boy am I angry now", noone would give a fuck.
---
The way I see it - if people are still playing after all the ups and downs, this latest patch won't change that.
---
I just put the poor thing out of its misery right as I see it. Only if there are level 250+ with explosive legacy weapons.
---
Poor thing got stuck in their suit to overtime mutate into a monster and love their humanity.
---
It's on game pass and was a top-20 game recently. Not sure where it's at right now.
---
I prefer more wacky quests, The wierder the better.
---
How about launching a V2 rocketbarrage loaded with nukacola ontop the scorched?
---
Agree completely. Just relaying a tip for others.
---
Honestly, you really shouldn’t  expect much from the 76. The game released about 3 years ago in 2018, hasn’t changed much since then, and, as an example, No Man’s Sky released 4 years ago in 2016.
---
In that time span, Hello Games has put out many major updates for the game that added vast amounts of content and bug fixes.
---
Just to make it fair, we’ll talk about No Man’s sky as if it was last year’s build, so that both games would have 3 years to be improved by their developers.
---
So, since launch, Bethesda has put out only around 3 major updates, and a good few patches. Not a whole lot of content, and it’s made worse by the fact that every single update and patch has failed in some extent at patching bugs. They have over 400 workers, and this is all they have to show for it.
---
I’m the case of No Man’s Sky, Hello Games has put out over 9 major updates since launch, including lots of content such as vehicles, multi tool and ship rarities, an overhaul to the storyline, visuals, multiplayer, etc. they have also put out a massive amount of bug fixes since launch, and this has all been accomplished by around 25 workers. 
---
So, no. I have absolutely no faith in Bethesda that they will fix 76.
---
This is just like the mole miner and got the same pathetic response from the community.
---
It's great for beginners.
---
It's also good for competent players who would otherwise just be tossing steel on the ground because it's worth less than nothing.
---
It's \*not\* for you if you expect to get the rarest plans in the game for 250 fricken steel.
---
It's also not for you if you have all the plans already and are not competent enough to be able to equip the scrapper perk and get so much damn steel you wish there was a Liberty Prime you could build in your base so you have something to do with the cruise ship's worth of steel you always seem to accumulate.
---
The long term players are likely the vocal minority. I bet a majority of players could use some plans still, especially with gamepass players.
---
I have over 3000 Atoms saved up just so I can buy the last 20.  I like the other grinds to take my time and not have to worry about the Seasonal Challenge if I don't have to.
---
Maybe. It would be a constantly flow though, where fallout 1st always got first access to quality of life adjustments. 
---
Anyway doesn’t matter now. I’m just not a fan of features being permanently behind a paywall.
---
Not until i nuke bos
---
Lol, toxic. Bless ya.
---
Stealth is key.
---
Unless you have a powerful enough gun (Handmade or Fixer). 
---
Otherwise you'll churn through ammo and some enemies will annihilate you.
---
So that means if you own the game on ps4 you won't have to buy it again on ps5?
---
Yes and I told them that but they counter with that being Single Player instead of Multiplayer. I told them about the clubs in NV as well as the prostitutes in most games and even the Porn Studio in the first fallout.
---
Yup. We'll see how long before that gets "fixed" as well.
---
"HOLD ON! I ONLY BROUGHT ONE DRUM! *click, click, click, click...."
---
Are you.... wanted?
---
Adding that you can also "Track" your challenges from the map as well. On PC hit "T" on the challenge you want to track and it's pinned on the map when you open it. Also pops up as you complete objectives for the tracked challenge.
---
Oh, I see.   
---
Do I retain the tents and other things, after subscription ends? Or all the bonuses are no longer available/buildable as soon as your subscription ends \[tents, scrapbox, etc\]?
---
It's absolutely terrible, how much the performance can get tanked by the meat piles. In Rad Rumble my FPS dropped below 1 in one spot.
---
This is a serious issue and I cannot fathom why this is like a second post about this, while people are raging about CAMP glitches that affect much much lower amount of people.
---
...yes
---
I'll donate everything but plastic, that's too short to spare. Not a ton of them, but a couple thousand of each on each character that have it stored up
---
Yeah, I too expected they made ATLAS part of a repeatable challenge for SCORE, to give the chance to catch up to late starters and people who got hit by the autocomplete bug...
---
Exactly. Just because you have a certain number of hours doesn’t mean that there is that much content in the game
---
Finally after 14 stops I found some at Wade Airport.
---
PC
---
Alright so there is a theory I have and use. Roll 3 on a server those will be the common uncommon rolls for that server. Roll 5 and odds are you will have the rare for that server. Seems to be the same with stars if you roll 3-5 and they are all 3 stars or two then out of 10 you should only see 1-2 1 star.   
---
It is not an exact science but it is how I have gotten 7 uni SS pieces (6 are 3 stars, 3 are god rolled rad+ WWR) and how I got my 3 bloodied gauss mini/shotty/plasma caster(and vamp mini quad shotty plasma) Sounds odd I know but try it yourself, I am sure you have rolled 10 pieces and noticed you get 3-4 of say regen 3-4 bolster and say 1-2 vanguards and 1-2 auto stim.   
---
Note out of about 1k in legendary modules I have seen a 5th prefix on rolls only 5 or 6 times when rolling 10 at once seems mostly set to 4 . Oh and for my superstitious ass self I know super duper does noting but I always have it on when doing it.
---
In my experience it gets contested every 15 seconds and I am forced to battle for my life and renewable energy
---
Wait when did they say that?
---
I found it funny to rip all off Codsworth's parts of to basically make him a floating lunchbox or judt leave him normal but give him one Explosive Minigun arm. Let me do the same thing with Daguerre Bethesda you cowards.
---
Go to Whitesprings and get someone to kill you, players will appear again.
---
Ok thanks
---
Anyone crouched will not show up on the map. Otherwise it's just lag.
---
I thoughtbI didn't understand the bullion reset right, didn't know it was a bug. But glad I bought the extra 300 on all my alts lol.
---
My concern with going stealth is does that work in a group? I got the impression that once someone on your team is discovered, you are as well. Do I have that wrong?
---
&gt;	we can confirm we are committed to offer free upgrades for current generation console owners of existing Bethesda titles we bring forward into the next generation of consoles.
---
We don’t know yet but I wouldn’t read too much into anything.
---
Thanks!  And thanks to the many of you who chatted me the solution.  I appreciate it.
---
I hear that. That's why I'm trying to make a cheaper suggestion for the general consumer. An ideal world would be that all the extras are free and In base game. But I understand the private servers will cost to keep running. One can dream.
---
Classic Bethesda strategy. Offer a thing, charge for it, never give the thing, you all keep giving them money anyway. I don't see what reason Bethesda has to improve themselves.
---
When you are wanted, other players do not show up on the map
---
It'll be backwards compatible anyway, it's never going to look stellar, it's only 16x the detail remember... .
---
Dude.
---
You don't have to do this and you sure as hell *don't* need to do this. Go do something you enjoy, or play something you actually want to play.
---
Really? This is so baffling, I cannot image what could have broken this. What fix or change could have affected a way to enter a mine? As a developer myself I understand spaghetti code, but no change in the code seemed even vaguely related...
---
If they take the Private servers out of the picture and give half the atoms, it could work. 2nd users wouldn't generate costs because they don't get private servers.
---
false alarm guys, I’m just wanted. I’m getting a friend on to kill me
---
As a FO1st member since launch, and a proponent of the Survival Tent before it was announced as an upcoming feature, Thisnis what I would like to see:
---
Make the Tent available as a quest reward item like Backpacks (make it the Squirrel Rank Reward), but without the Scrapbox.  FO1st members keep their Scrapbox in the Tent while their membership is active. 
---
The Scrapbox should be a Vault-Tec/Overseer reward tied to a new questline, and placable in CAMPs only.  FO1st members can still place them in Workshops.
---
Private worlds should be free, but with FO1st members getting mod support for their paid private worlds.  This can only affect the aesthetics of the world state, not added content, unless there is a safeguard to prevent modded items from transferring from private to public. 
---
I know some of these are unrealistic, both from an economic and technical aspect. But I don’t like certain features being locked behind paywalls.
---
How about change your build to accommodate everyone else? Why must everyone else have to accommodate you?
---
For me, I built my build based on a particular weapon. I was a bloodied melee build / heavy weapon build until I was fortunate enough to get a bloodied explosive +25% handmade which then made me change into bloodied commando. As I got my hands on a bloodued fixer, im now a stealth commando build.
---
I'd seriously urge you to watch videos by Ratty Star, Captain Noob or Angry turtle on YouTube about bloodied stealth commsndo build. You're not to far away from that. You'll be a glass cannon but hit like a truck, Angry turtles videos also show you don't need 3 star legendary weapons for the stealth commando build to work.
---
P.s. Ditch the grenades! 😂
---
Pffft yeah right. Glory to The Repbublic of Dave, the one true faction.
---
Tent gives you a second free fast travel location. Helps to cut fast travel costs when you're going to the north or south of the map.
---
You don't need to restart. Legendary run progress, and challenges, are shared across all characters. The only rewards that are character-specific are physical items like the scrap/repair kits, lunchboxes, and scraps.
---
Skins and plans should all be shared, but to be safe, you can switch to your main character before claiming anything.
---
So I should avoid a whole game mechanic just because higher levels "have to" take all of the workshops for themselves? The issue is not the PVP or me defending it, it's that super high levels with super powerful weapons and power armor can just roll through a lvl 20s workshop, claim it, then go claim 5 more. It would also be a different story if they level locked servers so that you k youow the characters you interact with are near your level. However here I am on a new playthrough for wastlanders and so far only one high level has come into my workshop and joined my team instead of just taking it to add to their list of workshops.
---
I like that idea as well, as long as they can continue to regularly and consistently add new features to FO1st.
---
Yeah but most of the games on the game pass are garbage, any multiplayer game on there is better than the 1500 cookie cutter indie games on it
---
“Just announced”?  It was a couple hours ago actually and several posts have already been made on the topic.  
---
If you read the article it states they don’t have any announcements for other titles at the moment but are still working on their next gen game plan to put it simply. 
---
So yes it wasn’t mentioned today but more than likely it will be available on next gen consoles at some point if not right away.
---
So you are recommending people say "Cancel your membership (if not on XBOX, in that case the terminology "cancel" may not sit right, in which case turn off auto-renew from the XBOX store, even though Bethesda uses the term Cancel, as an XBOX player you may not be as familiar with the term they use on the Fallout 1st membership website and it is important to clarify that.)" every time someone uses the term? The term "canceling" a monthly / yearly membership is ubiquitous for turning off auto-renew. People shouldn't avoid using ubiquitous terms because there are a few people who do not understand what they mean. No, the people who are ignorant on the terminology should learn what the terms imply to everyone else. We shouldn't have to all put on training wheels because you don't know how to ride a bike.
---
okay, this seals it.  i want an empty wasteland again.
---
&gt; You mansplaining every thing to me
---
Where did gender even come up?  By you saying this - I assume you are a woman, and assume he's a man.  But why do you assume that?
---
Ive said it once and I'll say it again...the best game out there right now with the Fallout name on it is Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.
---
If simps don't hand them the keycards first
---
 I worries. They’ll make sure you can’t log in everyday. Usually via CTD
---
Yeah and I am surprised you cant report someone for toxic gameplay behavior, like constant griefing or hoarding workshops.
---
What system do you play on?
---
If your stealth is high enough and you keep your distance from them you'll be fine.
---
I few things, I would increase your adrenaline perk buy 2 and drop a couple off gun fu.
---
All weapon perk cards work the same, +10 for level 1, so having 3 level one cards does 30%. You have a level 3 equipped so you are missing 10% damage there. 
---
Do you have a weight reduction on your back pack yet, if not make that a priority, it only frees up a couple of points but will help massively. They can be acquired from various trading sites/sub's for under 10k now, the value is only going to go up so I would hurry and grab one.
---
It has a handful of cobult as well
---
Yea it would have had to be a pretty big shift. I don’t know how the general public would like it, but everyone would get more at the end of the day.
---
I hit max, went to mama got 5 new melee weapons then went and put them up in my "Wall of Shame" - no joke - 1 pipe wrench, 1 pick, 1 pitchfork, 2 shovels.
---
Just....really? What does it take to get a deathclaw gauntlet or powerfist...I've bought tons of 3\* melee weapons and am now at 9 shovels dozens of lead pipes, pool cues, wrenches etc.
---
I do it all the time. It’s not that difficult.
---
"It just works"
---
Would make sense.
---
Ahh PVP, I don't get much of that, being over lvl 400 does that.  I'm do enjoy the fight all the same even though I normally loose.
---
Ur not gonna get banned unless it says so in the terms of service. I don’t think they even say anything about it. Unless it’s a threat to real world people or things I don’t think they care
---
This was one of the reasons why I stopped playing. They don't value our time.
---
A little Hitlery there
---
Caps are never an issue. If I can’t scrip a legendary (which I often can’t) I sell it for 3-5 caps per scrip point. It sells immediately. If that doesn’t, you get caps for doing almost anything, and your teammates will give caps when a quest is completed too. I’ve bought everything I need on my character already so they just sit and accumulate
---
He is over explaining basic knowledge to me, and am I wrong?
---
Oh hell yes.
---
Need more roof types too. Like a tin roof to match the metal building set, an asphalt roof to match the brick building set, etc.
---
Heh, yeah, depending on the distance you're talking about, that's my no-go. I'm usually playing with my wife, and I certainly don't want to tell her "uh... hun... don't get too close to me"  :-)
---
Haha.
---
i put my tent near ATLAS and grabbed a bunch of steel from my scrap box. hopefully the tent is useful for other folks to access their scrap or stash.
---
there aren't many plans in the game i don't know yet, so i put them in my vending machine at default prices and i see lower level players pick them up. it's nice to help!
---
Those are some dope ideas man. Implementing quest lines for the unlocks is a great idea.
---
Bethesda reps did say that they were internally hashing out how to implement Double wallpaper walls, so it should be coming here
---
Private worlds can't be free because they're sublet from Amazon.
---
I mean it's cool you like grenades and all but you're asking for advice and all the grenade perks have to go. 
---
You're missing 3 rifleman perks because of a few dropped into grenade radius. Thats already 20% damage. 
---
You have way too many demolition points that can be used to apply to stealth, which starts you off as a 2x damage. 
---
You have critical savvy, which is not great on your build as you have sacrificed another 15% damage by not having bloody mess. 
---
So even if you are opposed to stealth, by moving your perks, you get another 35% damage. If you are running proper bloodied, you usually won't be farming mobs with team mates, and at SBQ, everyone gets detected eventually.
---
In stealth, that goes to 235% at base. With sandman and covert operative, you are closer to making 3.75x the damage you currently do. That's a good trade off for putting your nuka grenades on another character, imo.
---
Edit: i see the wife comment. Get her on stealth build, solved.
---
How can you have a Free States flair but shill for the Enclave. Make up your mind they're literally the least compatible factions in the game.
---
If you read above you will see that I do in fact say.
---
The camp things will probably happen this winter with instanced camps
---
Both Fallout 76 and Skyrim SE should run on the XSX and PS5 with backwards compatibility. Perhaps the games will be improved somewhat with higher frame rate/resolution/settings, but that is not really a "remaster". If a more substantial next gen upgrade (like Skyrim's special edition) is planned, that will probably not come before Starfield, Skyrim SE was also released a year after Fallout 4.
---
Yeah, right now I feel like I'm a little more on the glass side of the glass cannon. I'll find some time to look at those videos.
---
Could you expand on the grenades? Are they not as powerful as I thought? Have I been making a fool of myself this whole time?
---
It seems like this is hitting some people and not others.  So it'll be even harder for them to track down... and they can't even track down challenges auto-completing.
---
Probably before most stuff mutated.  Only people went Wendigo.
---
Too many idiots doing that lately. Must be people who are bored with legendary run trying to spoil other people's fun. Me, I always switch to a weaker weapon just to tag enemies, specially with my melee build.
---
Don’t worry we’ll get light wood laminate
---
Cool, thanks for that info man, I appreciate it
---
Whether or not he's foolish for doing so doesn't change his actual points in the slightest, though.
---
And the amount of variety! I miss being able to have a skull decorated lazer tank flying around on a Mr. Gutsy body.
---
Yup nows the time for new players to carefully search all the suitcases at train stations to find the stash of plans that people will be dropping
---
Heh heh. Stealth social distancing is about 30'
---
Not at all dude. Personally, I like several of the camp items. Probably never gonna use the skins.
---
I like getting the extra card packs since scrapping cards is how we will level up legendary perks (unless they decide to change that). So that’s nice. 
---
But the biggest thing for me are the camp items. But if camp building Judy isn’t your thing, well I can’t blame you for not believing no interested. 
---
I am curious, what do you do when you log in?
---
Can confirm, Blokeh did it.
---

---
fixed for you
---
It's still doing well regardless. It's not a smash hit by any means, but it has a solid and loyal player base.
---
Not enough cork out west. 
---
 Its also too bad that the "High S.C.O.R.E. Double Daily Challenges" is the reward. 
---
*"Deliver 200,000,000 Cork"*  May the God of Cork have mercy on our ~~soul~~ cork.
---
Ya, having something like you said would have at least given us choice.
---
They also needed to add some new loot for rewards.
---
Reskinned outfits you already find in game would at least given collectors something to go for.  There are a lot of BOS outfits they could have used just by swapping colors.
---
So fricken lazy reusing all the same crap rewards.
---
My recommendation for attempting events with high levels is to find something like a shotgun or a gun that shoots multiple rounds quickly and just try to tag every thing really fast. Once you get used to the areas that they spawn it gets better. Also use VATS. It's dirty in a way but honestly it's going to be the only way you counter that if you don't play on a private server. You are going to run into glitches sadly. This patch has given me several issues.
---
So do Bethesda considering the backlash. 😂
---
Look up to the skies and see
---
I would agree with you if the score needed was like 70% . There are casual players and Bethesda shouldn't leave them behind. This is supposed to be fun, not a grind.
---
It would be kind of cool if they had a pre wastelander server. I never experienced what it was like before the NPCs and I’m kind of curious.
---
If the company advertised items and failed to provide them, file a fraud grievance with the Better Business Bureau.   I guarantee you'll get a response, although it may be just "we're working on it".
---
Same here
---
&gt; the fact that buying a years worth of that shit from bethesda was just a flat out stupid idea
---
... has no bearing on the actual topic.  So no, they're not "right", they just want to feel like they are better than OP.
---
I noticed that too. Never go at zero except if i release the trigger first.
---
No lie, EVERYBODY shits on the vault dwellers in convos. Cmon bruh, they talking shit with total recall dna.  Yeah I’d of killed leader of foundation in that first conversation for his tone. Stupid invulnerable npcs.
---
you only keep the cosmetic stuff you redeemed during your subscription. any outfits, emotes, icons, etc. all stay even after it ends.
---
the tent, scrapbox, and access to private worlds all end when your subscription does. you also get 1600 atoms for every month you're subscribed, issued a few days after you're billed.
---
You will be.  It's only available for 3 days...
---
ok great, can i get a large order of fries   
---

---
A lot, I’m rank 363, 246 is amateur lol
---
But before I get judged for not having a life, I’ve been playing since the beta and up until the roni virus hit I was working 40-46 hours a week. With 2-3 (more on the weekend) hours a day dedicated to my gaming.
---
It’s more about what you spend your time doing while you’re playing. I kill shit, I kill A LOT of shit, especially during double or quadruple xp weekends. 
---
I think my rank or lower are normal for people who don’t play 24/7. It’s the people who are upwards of 600 that need to get some fresh air once in a while.
---
lol, you have Nickelback on your phone.
---
Yeah just remembered thanks
---
Theres a character planner at https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks that can help you plan your build. 
---
But as a relatively new player myself, the level up system is awful.  I saved 20+ up levels of points because i didnt want to do a bad build and hadnt planned one yet. my build is probably terrible anyway because i dont have interest in bloodied or junkies and havent picked a primary weapon type yet.
---
I really hate how much I use that heart by accident. Mean to wave, instead say I love you to stranger. Fk
---
Way I see it Wastelanders more than made up for the initial release and while the reputation grind is absolutely awful the gold bullion system is a solid foundation for an endgame progression system alongside public events.
---
Right now what I think needs to happen is a big balance patch that's coming with One Appalachia that allows builds to mean something, an overhaul of the crappier public events and more repeatable content that provides actual rewards and is fun to do.
---
All of the things I think need changing are in the roadmap in one way or another so I'm happy overall.
---
Pipe weapons have cork except for the pipe revolver.
---
Ya it sucks
---
An army the Zetans should fear.
---
It's not that bad... the challenges are easy enough to complete within an hour... The WEEKLY challenges can be completed in about 2-3 hours.
---
I think we need to bring back ATOM points though.
---
stealth is fine, with or without party. use a suppressor and you'll never be found.
---
if any of your camp is floating, they may be spawning in the underworld, next to Wooby. 
---
Could try building them an in ground floor, then their thing directly on it.
---
Wow and I bought a new drive on the slim as I had that problem and couldn’t fix it, but it was like 5 years old.  2 years sucks
---
I only just started messing with Adrenaline since I saw it was fixed. My thinking was that the most bang is that first card (6%), while additional cards only add 1% each. But you think having 8% in Adrenaline is better than the 30% in gun fu?
---
I see what you're saying on the gun cards, I totally missed that. I think I'm only missing 5% damage (the level 3 goes from 15%-20%, so I would lose that 5% going to a level 2, but then gain 10% from adding the level 1). Still a good tip, I will definitely fix that.
---
I have both a grocer's backpack and a chem backpack, and I switch between them depending on whichever one works better at the time. Is that what you're referring to? I definitely have a problem of carrying too many stim packs, too much food. I think if I had the FO1st storage box maybe I wouldn't worry as much about it, but I'm not gonna pay for that.
---
If you photomode glitch through the door will it enter the loading zone? I doubt it but perhaps it’s worth a shot?
---
Fallout 76 is rated M+ for mature which covers things of a sexual nature. Given that it's an online multiplayer game it also accounts for the fact that users may interact with players and experience things not specifically programmed into the game. You aren't likely to be banned unless you violate rules specific to your platform (xbox/ps4) or really go overboard (people have been banned for things like harassment/homophobia, etc) by Bethesda themselves.
---
The good thing is, there is no right or wrong way to go about how you play. I personally find grenades a bit inaccurate and with bodies flying everywhere from explosions, it can be difficult to find the loot. You also are not very discrete with the loud noise giving you away.
---
I would definitely recommend bloodied and unyielding armor. If you don't like low health, then Junkies and vanguard armor will be better. 
---
Once you watch those videos, trust me, you won't look back. I suspect the majority of top players who use bloodied builds are stealth commando builds.
---
Keep an eye out for me online (GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR) I run either my 537 or 122 character, depending on mood, but always down to help lower level players.
---
Ada being the only supportive companion when hoarding junk. &lt;3
---
Its very hard to feel bad when you were paying this much in the first place EVEN if you got all the stuff advertised. Sucks but would have sucked either way
---
I'm really starting to believe that it's a power armor glitch/exploit. It's consistent and it awards like clockwork. I hate to admit it, but I've been using this in conjunction with the Foundation rare junk glitch to gain Score and Foundation reputation all day today. The quarantine works in mysterious ways. ;)
---
Seen many nukes there when the event started. I thought it was people trying to send Beth a big NAY.
---
I prefer the 1-3 wendigo spans on the road just south of Abbie's bunker. They're right where the truck and trailer are pulled up into the trees.
---
Went back to paperbag but how do I get my Raider bones drop pile back.. anyone know?
---
My point was not the buying it at all, but waiting until near the end. Normal play will net a few levels for free, even if you ignore the challanges.  If I am a few levels away I will certainly spend some of my accumulated atoms.
---
Oh the challenge was to kill the three star creature, wasn't it? Robot is not a creature 😅
---
Fallout 2nd Class Citizens. I guess that might be a step up.
---
Stealth social distancing - nice. That "feels" far when inside a building, but I'll look into this.
---
OK, I'll start messing with this.
---
Having the same issue! They really need to fix this lol
---
This.
---
3 day availability.  Get 'em while supplies last or something.
---
I don’t want to help the BoS, so I’m glad that is not the case.
---
I dont know how this works. Dm me a little clue? (I think i comprehend the power armor lol in n out)
---
My problem is kind of embarrassing.
---
I get the quest to talk to Ward, but I also get the quest to return immediately too.
---
So I talk to him to grab the Q, end convo, then talk to him again immediately and turn it in. I get treasury notes and everything too.
---
Tagging /u/ladydevann to make them aware if they aren't already.
---
You and about 50,000 other people :p
---
Prove me wrong.
---
Honestly the scrapbox is the only thing that Interests me in 1ST even tho I’m not a subscriber. If Bethesda ever considered selling it separately for atoms or even directly for real money, I will 100% buy it
---
Again, funny and sad at the same time.
---
Exactly. Its basically free money for them with no effort. Goes to show people like op will buy anything despite how garbage of a value it is
---
Check the link that has been posted twice in this thread.
---
Oh god no, not this weekend please! Next weekend? I’ve got no power for 5-7 days, it’s bad enough I’m going to have to play SCORE catch up I’d be so pissed if I missed a 3x weekend!
---
I sincerely hope everybody who is displeased with the direction of Fallout 1st, and were unfortunately locked into paying a 1-year subscription ahead of time don't do it again.  Buying it was already a big mistake if you trusted Bethesda to deliver quality content within a reasonable time-frame, and if your displeasure with how they're handling things in recent times isn't enough to dissuade you from giving them any more money, I would say there also isn't any hope for you either.
---
my junk belongs to the Enclave!
---
Correct.
---
Honestly, I started my extended break again due to all these low caps.
---
I didn't mind it TOO much when I was paying for FO1st since I could always just dump stuff on an alt, but I can't bring myself to pay that anymore and I got tired of just dropping stuff when I couldn't even get people to take it when I was literally giving stuff away.
---
For me it’s harder with two people instead of one because more robots spawn.
---
Stupid hurricanes.  As long as they announce one I’d be happy.
---
r/unexpectedsimpsons
---
Yes!  That is also super annoying
---
just had same prob really sucks
---
But that doesn't say anything about 76 in particular. Just that they are comited to bringing other titles then ESO and Eternal to next gen
---
Added to my bookmarks!  Awesome way to check up on my daily challenges while away from my home computer.
---
Get on a diet plan bro, just dropping the alcohol won’t be enough
---
The lower levels (up until about the mid 30’s) are definitely tough.
---
Trying to figure out what’s going one, what to (and not to) do, feeling underpowered, etc.
---
Join a building team.  This will help with overall XP.
---
Stay in the forest (green area, west side of map) until you are at least L15.  Follow the overseers questline.
---
Start the Mysteries questline (Riverside Manor).  Do recruitment Blues (camp McClintock).  Join the Firebreathers and Responders.
---
Do the events in the area.  Loot, scrap, bulk, and sell.
---
Lots of aid items at Morgantown airport.
---
Try melee weapons to conserve ammo.
---
At nearing L20, move N to the toxic valley (the alligator icon). Join the pioneer scouts
---
At30, go S to the ash heap (black area to the east west of the 3 leg towers.  Work on Miner Miracles
---
at 40, the Divide (center strip) at 45+, head to the east side of the map. (Mire and bog)
---
Roses quests will quickly frustrate you.  If you have it, back burner it until you are in the 30’s or higher.
---
yeah I've had random scavengers popping up in my camp using my shit too ever since the wastelanders update. 
---
I deal with them in what I feel is an authentic appalachian style; I shoot them in the head with my shotgun.
---
my ass victoriam
---
If I had to guess I'd say it has something to do with interior instancing and them somehow putting the correct flag on the wrong cell or something. 
---
Baffling? Yes. Surprising? lol, no
---
:)
---
Awesome. Thanks so much!
---
Definitely. Experience helps, so your first one will likely be the most difficult. My first silo run took something like an hour, and these days I can do it in about 15 minutes.
---
There's a lot of advice in this thread about how to do a super-good silo run (e.g. have tonnes of particular legendary gear), but the single best piece of advice is to have level 3 hacking so you can shut down the turrets. Hack every terminal you see. Also, there's a way to bypass the reactor repair stage if you have level 3 lockpicking.
---
Should be in the atom shop, in the same tab as weapon and PA skins. You can equip it from there.
---
MVP
---
Thx for this! I am pleasantly surprised by the total steel so far as well. I wonder if Bethesda will have stretch goals if it goes over, or if there will be a notification letting people know that any further donations are simply being flushed?
---
I can do it in less than 10 minutes solo vanilla and full health (I’m a Bloodied build, not a Junkies or Vampire build), and it took me 13 minutes 27 seconds with non legendary weapons and armor.
---
&gt;  be sure to pencil event dates into your schedule so that you don’t miss any of the action. 
---
yes, definitely use pencil because you will have to erase and change events a lot in your calender then...
---
I ran into this issue yesterday. Exiting the world and loading into another one fixed it for me.
---
ha! not a chance in hell that we will see all of that content on patch 22.
---
No one knows the exact number mate. Though in the beginning of the game, iirc 100k+ rounds of ultracite ammo will do it ;)
---
Np!
---
Me too. Binding went away
---
forgot to mention psychotats, ballistic bock, and bobblehead: small guns gives you a huge damage boost when used. they all stack.
---
It's also a solid hit box, if you're standing against a wall and drop one, you can't walk through the bag!
---
I accidentally trapped myself in Nuclear Winter as it pushed me through a wall!
---
Oh, so then I guess you were wrong when you said this:
---
"Yea it'll be playable on Series X/PS5."
---
Since they haven't said anything about 76 in particular.
---
I'm all for tossing the grenades (HAH!) if they aren't the right way to go. That also might help some of my weight issues.
---
I appreciate the advice. I'm going to start getting the cards I need for this and see what I can achieve.
---
Would you ditch Critical Savvy entirely? Or lower it for room for Bloody Mess?
---
I tend to play around reset so I can get two days done in a few hours and don’t have to worry for about two days.  Obviously most don’t have my schedule.  Would probably work best if they did it 12 hours later
---
So you cheated and are afraid of getting punished.....hope you get banned🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Not sure why it doesn't work now ps4
---
I don't know what a quarter is, but thank you!
---
Why would the ban you when they can let you be over encumbered for the next three months?
---
On top of that, they're setting up shop on the neighboring mountain connected by railroad, if I see any brotherhood patrols I'm opening fire, and they can expect 24/7 artillery fire. 😤
---
That's very dodgy. Becareful
---
Nope you misread, but as I said... That’s at the lowest possible figure.
---
Having started a month ago... there's so much that I "missed" which is a misnomer, obviously.
---
this game is my second job.
---
FYI about that handy tip you posted for the crafting supplies challenge:
---
Scrapping bulk wood doesn't work towards the challenge. The challenge also *appears* to be bugged. Instead of asking that you gather 100 pieces of wood from the environment, it actually wants you to gather wood from 100 sources (e.g. tree trunks, log piles, etc).
---
Could you imagine though 🤣
---
I thought those were Overseer Tickets... ?
---
Believe me when I say; the only way to help Bethesda now is to vote with your wallet. They need to know that their player base are not the kind of folks that can afford to be rung dry. I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that game is not in danger of financially collapsing without a subscription service. It’s a $50 game by a AAA company...they have what they need to give everyone the best experience possible at a reasonable price, but they also have unfettered GREED.
---
I enter into a public team and went to a level 500 guy's camp, and he had only the camp with one vending machine and that is all, in the middle of the forest with ultracite 100k for 0 caps, retardo, if I would cheat then I would not probably ask here, dumbass
---
Yeah not this weekend ACL worlds has been lit I don't want to miss them because fo76 stole my life again for a weekend
---
I've gotten into the habit of Confirming with the Enter key instead of the mouse.  It's rare, but there *is* something wrong with this menu where confirming sometimes shifts the position, like the game clicks "through" the prompt while also confirming it.
---
That’s my issue as well. I gotta circle the damn thing fifty times to get my loot back.
---
It was actually 100k plus of different ammo types *each* accumulated in less than 30 days. That's why 900 hours guy was banned.
---
I server hopped a couple times at Blackwater before I just said @#% it and crafted some low level raider.
---
Off the top of my head, Grafton dam, wade airport (2 sets), morgantown (2 sets), Gorge Bridge, Camden park, an overlook just to the E of Crater....
---
Theres another in a garage/shed near the hunting lodge in toxic valley (don’t recall the specific location)
---
One at WV lumber....
---
Yeah it’d be cool of them and make catching up easier. I mean, there’s millions with no power (idk the number but that sounds good) it could be a kind guesture. Good PR?
---
"Sometimes it just doesn't work" - Hodd Toward
---
Why u always wanna lock me out? What are u hiding? I have  no creativity whatsoever, my block camp is entirely functional and ugly as sin. When there is very little to do in the game right now, touring camps is where I'm enjoying myself the most. Yesterday I found a 3 story "open" dolls house camp with every room a different theme. Then a paddle boat/pirate ship with broadsides as cannons and a SBQ figure head. I was so impressed. Let me see ur hard work and bethesda for the love of fuck give these people what they need to make these camps!
---
It's fake or dupers did put millions of steel since they have billions on their stash boxes.
---
Despite playing since the stress tests, I only found this out a few days ago haha so much better than going backwards and forwards checking score challenges (and atom before).
---
Glad to hear you have it covered
---
Edit: Are you prerecorded pre-patch?
---
There's a perk loadout mod that let's you save up to 12 loadouts per character and swap between them with one key-press in the perk screen.  So for my chars i have a group &amp; solo setup, a lockpick/hack/scrap setup, and then a camp/crafting loadout.
---
If you're worried about being banned it seems Bethesda's stance is to ignore them so they don't have to 'officially support' troubleshooting issues with them.
---
I can't join a nuclear winter match w/o disabling them so they're definitely able to tell when I'm using modified files, but they don't mind in adventure mode.
---
Ooof, that's quite the change. I'll take a look at this and see what my next step forward should be.
---
If you don’t mind me asking, how long is “ASAP”? Hotfix or Patch 22?
---
Pretty sure every Xbox One game will be on Series X, I just don't think all of them will be optimized for it. Pretty sure playstation 5 players are the ones that gotta worry in this situation, hopefully they get an upgrade or a PS5 port.
---
Golf balls from whitespring: like easter egg hunting with zombies chasing you
---
You mean sleeping 24/7.
---
Bethesda:  “But if you don’t log in every day, you can’t buy something from the Atomic Shop every day.”
---
What?
---
Wow some one is pissy....when your story has “bought” it’s easy to assume just saying....🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
Melee builds can be extremely overpowered with the right perks and weapon. There's a video of someone four hitting the SQB with a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Patch 21 broke it, Bethesda is investigating, expect a patch anytime between next week and next month.
---
Came down to the beach to ride out the storm, all my friends up in PA no power, I’m sitting pretty down here in MD with power internet Xbox and the beach 
---
Hope they get the power back on for you!
---
Oh thats not good thanks for the help
---
Yeah, I don't manage those very well - I feel like I'm already keeping track of how hungry and thirsty I am, how much ammo I have, have I taken rad-x diluted since I'm getting radiated, etc. I need to find a good way to start incorporating those items as well without overwhelming myself.
---
No I was referring to backwards compatibility which for Series X has been confrimed to include every Xbox One game. PS5 on the other hand has confirmed that only some PS4 games will be backwards compatible. I would be very surprised if 76 wouldn't be on that list as it is a money maker and Bethesda Softworks seems to be in good terms with Sony. But I guess I could be wrong about that.
---
We haven't heard anything about an upgraded version of 76 that will take full advantage of the power of next gen.
---
Yeah, it’s just hard when you got like 20-30 enemies with automatic guns shooting ya lol. That’s pretty badass tho!
---
Take sneak perks first. Sneak then Covert operative and finally Escape artist. Big damage boost with the safety of being unseen.
---
In BGS’s eyes the double wall camp thing is in violation of TOS and makes those that use it cheaters. Wall dupers lol. Think I’m gonna ride this out and see what happens. Legacy camp.✔️Legacy weapons✔️Fixers✔️Millions of scrap that I won’t donate to BOS✔️ Being prepared to watch the world burn...priceless👍
---
Brotherhood of Steal?
---
Fall out 1st is a convenience purchase.
---
No different than buying a dishwasher machine.  I could easily wash dishes by hand but I choose not to because I bought a convenient machine that does it for me.
---
 So with your logic a dishwasher is an objectively bad purchase. 
---
 Fall out 1st is very very convenient for me having a scrap Box.
---
You seem like a fool without money.
---
Our savior is here 👍😍
---
Oddly enough, the icon for it is gone but I can still use it.
---
Melee makes this game a breeze, I don't know if we're playing the same game lol. Even with an unoptimized build my melee alt wrecks.
---
i know it sucks
---
but i just craft the pieces.
---
And why 2 for Crater, 1 for Foundation*?
---
*Photo Op I guess can be counted for Foundation if you choose Crater, but it doesn't start there.
---
You guys already get atom shop discounts... I say this every time one of these posts pops up but if you REALLY cared about the stuff, you would’ve known about it already. The fact that you didn’t notice shows that you don’t care, you just want a reason to beg bethesda for shit
---
Well the guy might as well cheated, I also remember his psn, it is on Playstation, he had only one vending machine without power and the basic camp device in the middle of the forest and I thought well what the hell, 0 caps
---
I know that they're making an official one too, but I just want to swap one card.
---
it doesn't matter what you use, the game functions based on first person, all the things that are weird and janky and broken in third person are the way they are because at best they are band aid fixed to function better, but more often than not are just not realistically meant to be used in third person.
---
As an example, aiming melee in third person is horrific, as the melee attack is centered on where your character is aiming from the first person point of view, and if you want to hit a small target, especially one above or below you (like a downed player in NW) you have to awkwardly aim super high and to the side in third person because you need to point the first person camera at them to hit them and aiming your actual crosshair will miss because the melee hitbox has nothing to do with it.
---
0 squared is still 0....
---
Thanks man, loving back in now to find it ✌️
---
People have their astronaut run around in underwear all the time without being banned.  Adding a stripper pole is not going to make it any racier.
---
There's a car-henge just northeast of the Winding Path (south of the forest icons on the map) that sounds exactly like what you might be looking for. It has a throne, busted up cars, and a lot of junkyard character.
---
Yeah I’m up on Seneca rocks and I tried both the concrete foundation and the wooden one on the small strip of soil and Beckett wouldn’t spawn on either floor. Now, each time I scrap his bar, or any other ally’s items, it tells me I failed a quest that I didn’t even start! Ugh before the patch he was fine.
---
MORE SCORE NO CHORE
---
Is it possible to go back to the paper bag? Sorry, I'm new.
---
I love melee in this game, It’s just annoying probably cuz of a Zerg rush of enemies lol.
---
Edit: could be cuz of my special stats, which I need to edit.
---
They mean Atlas and the mysterious interest in vast amounts of cork
---
Too late m8 :(
---
I just saw my first one at the WS train station, someone had left it there. It's kind of hard to access the contents, I Had to really move around to get a look inside. Kind of like trying to loot those ghouls that just stand there and you one shot them then you can barely loot them
---
Which shows how annoyed I am at the BOS assuming they can come in and take over. I’m against the BOS threatening an invasion, the Enclave aren’t the ones trying to take what we’ve built away this time and they haven’t been a threat to the free states since the Great War.
---
The only thing funnier then your childish name calling, is you now attempting to sell that ammo on fo76 marketplace. Stay classy.
---
Seems like jealousy
---
Lmao they won't ban you for Aid items 
---
Hence why they diddnt ban people who duped Ammo
---
Edit: some people don't like the truth lol
---
This was the first thing I tried. After being put in another world, the game just made me put the Type-T fuse back in and still refused to let me progress.
---
Quarter is a US monitary unit = 25 US cents.
---
I hated that daily. I would rather kill 10 legendaries than try to find 1 3* that counts and isn't bugged or broken.
---
Thusly, the only real solution.
---
Neat! I'll definitely try it out tonight. Thanks :D
---
*edit*
---
It worked!
---
I did it with two whole walls though. Didn't have to use half walls. :D
---
I tried to be cheeky and blueprint it, but it kept saying it was floating when trying to place it xD
---
Well, is that the same for the bowling bag and gravestone? Because I never had a problem getting the contents out of THOSE
---
My simple solution is this: every 50 levels you get 1 additional point to put into a special stat of your choice. It would allow a lot of flexibility for keeping situational perks like green thumb equipped, or you could dump them all into STR to run a heavy gun / melee build without having to swap perks all the time, or you child finally start pumping up your CHA to share higher level cards without sacrificing damage perks from the other skill trees.
---
Its a battle pass. All battle pass include daily as well as weekly rewards. This incentivizes and rewards those who play every day. They arent gonna change that. And IMO its better to just not get the final rewards but still enjoy the game, so if it feels to much like a chore to you dont do the next pass.
---
🤣😂🤣 this is the internet, I don't have to prove a damn thing.
---
Thanks for the tips, got it working!
---
Its slower, at least for me, since my approach is mostly stealth as much as possible and ambush, or once things are flying try to pull badguys 1 at a time at yourself.
---
Honestly, they're only really needed against tough bosses eg: Scorchbeast Queen and The Imposter Sheepsquatch.
---
If your weapon is powerful enough carrying a bunch of grenades is just dead weight.  Every time I go tot he train station to turn in lengendaries I drop all mine on the deck for someone else.
---
I change my shit up constantly to help other people. Nice try though.
---
Well, since the update people seem to be more against the BoS than ever before. Mainly because as Penguinistics said, the odd amount of cork we need ect.
---
Nope, but it is just a few clicks away on Pandora though. Lol
---
Nope, according to Bethesda Austin, all expanded mags are 25% of base clip size and drum mags are 50% and it is so for 'consistency' not balance.
---
Build looks good 👍👍👍 very similar to mine. I run it slightly different. I've swapped out, Luck Break (Luck) (chance Armor repair) to White Knight (Agility)(Armor breaks 60% slower). That way it's a guarantee rather than chance.
---
Exactly, thankyou :)
---
Same here. I have food, ice, water and lanterns. And two days off to listlessly rake up fallen branches and listen to chainsaws. Yey. Someone kill a scorchbeast in my name, will ya?
---
Oh I didn't meant it to be funny, sorry for confusing you pal
---
I’n 99% sure they said it was the Beelzebilly outfit that we’d get, will the actual outfit become available too?
---
I always gun bash it a few times and do the emote, but as soon as somebody one shots it I start being on the lookout. If I see that person coming for it the next time a legendary spawns I finish it off. Sorry people but I’d rather have you and the asshole get nothing then just the asshole get something
---
may have to move your camp to get them to respawn :(
---
This isn't about the physics engine. The game engine itself - Creation Engine, is a dated fork of an even more dated Gamebryo engine. Game's running on 20+ year old plate of spaghetti code where fixing one thing will break 20 others, some not even remotely related. Doesn't help that the original madmen that made it mostly aren't there to explain it.
---
They don't even have to go to the stations. Every time I've gone to Atlas I've seen bags full of plans and booze littered around the donation boxes.
---
It's great... Can't progress the story to where we are able to farm Gold Bullion, gonna take us even longer now considering the time gate they got on it.
---
Sounds like a good idea. Really liking the frame + cover idea.
---
I don't get why so many older games with base building mechanics (like halo 3's forge mode) is easier and more versatile than fallout 76's...
---
There is so much potential for this game and past examples they could have taken inspiration from and yet this is what we get -_-
---
Can someone help me put this in perspective? I just started playing 76, so I only have about 10 hours of experience with the game. 
---
I am enjoying it so far, and am also interested in a lot of the items in the atom shop. For me, seeing the amount of caps they give you monthly for fallout 1st, compared to the prices of just outright buying caps; seems very good? 12.99/month for 1650 atoms/month seems like it fits right in with the other price points for atoms. When you consider that, if the price point breaks even on the atoms, then the rest of the perks in FO 1st seem like added bonuses to an “atom-based” subscription, even if they are half-assed.
---
I guess what I’m trying to say is, from an atoms perspective, if you were already interested in buying atoms (which I know isn’t the most popular opinion) this seems like a great deal with many added bonuses?
---
Am I misunderstanding the breakdown? I’m genuinely curious...
---
Edit: a word
---
It literally is broken though. On certain mutations it doesn’t work properly, idk why people are complaining now though it’s been that way since launch
---
What a novel idea.
---
ah yea, had similar with the brotherhood rifle (long ago), wouldn't fire the .50 unless i had atleast 1 .308 in the inventory
---
Cool little freebie.
---
There is a way to re-spec special: after level 50 each time you level up you can either pick a perk card as usual or instead re-allocate one special point. This can take a long time and is wasteful (e.g. if you had 1 strength and 15 perception and decided to swap them around, it would take you 14 levels), so is only really useful for making minor tweaks.
---
If you get *really* into the game and find you want to try a radically different build, it's not that difficult to level up a new character. Particularly good opportunities are double XP weekends - we had one in late July, so I'd expect the next one to be in September or October.
---
16k here. The goal will be reached. But I only have 1k cork sooo🤷‍♂️
---
How do you “make mules”? I’m hitting level 60 and have been having troubles storing everything.
---
Technically, 76ers made guns that dropped orbital strikes.  There's no way we could be friends with BOS.
---
He always goes on about some detonator to me. Like, what detonator?
---
This makes total sense. I'm popping off my gun WAY more than I am throwing grenades. Plus, with how long it takes to even throw a grenade, and the fact that sometimes I melee instead of throwing a grenade... what was I thinking??
---
It hasn't changed as of patch 21, as many people thought, though.
---
"Will continue to evolve"
---
Meaning implemented at an unspecified time; they're not "10 months overdue" because they never said it would happen right away.
---
the only thing that'll open that mine, is if Todd would do the carlton dance (fresh prince) but keep his emotionless todd face while doing it...
---
... probably not even then, but still
---
[edit: Todd face]
---
Split it up between characters
---
No way, I’m not even playing after being a long time supporter, the disappointments just keep on rolling and I can’t even find motivation to log on for this “event” (recycled garbage with worse rewards than previous events)
---
That’s what I’m doing. Semi grinding until I reach the chicken coop and then I’ll passively play until the run is almost over before buying any levels I’m missing by then.
---
I had same issue an hour ago, i just dropped all existing cores i had on the floor, then picked them back up, then it worked.
---
Anyways, it's been fun. All the defensiveness and butthurt most of y'all got was great.
---
At one point, they evolve so much that the underlying architecture becomes a mess. With improving hardware, game engines are constantly getting reworked, not just patched. Look at Unreal Engine. Constant stream of serious work going on there with new versions with deep improvements being released. Creation Engine has been bandaged and duct taped for years and is now a Frankenstein monster with net code slapped on top of it.
---
Like you said, if there's work being done, it gets better and stays with the times. This isn't the case here.
---
That's been around for awhile and doesn't have anything to do with changing receivers. At log in you just need to switch to a different weapon and back again.
---
PSA: theres a nuka cola vendor in the 2nd floor of the whitesprings. Just throwimg that out there cause not a lot of people know.
---
I haven’t made a pilgrimage to atlas yet, good to know.
---
Idk if they changed anything with patch 21 but I know that speed demon as always been broken with class freak, it thinks the +50% hunger/thirst is positive and it doesn’t negate anything. Or they just messed up the code somehow
---
She turned a blind eye to Vault-Tec.  I'd trust a Raider over her.
---
There are a lot of tricks that relied on switch wall types in place. Wires through walls, flags/posters/paintings over windows, easier double walls... the list goes on and on. It’s not “just... delete the wall and rebuild a new one”.
---
I said scrapping steel. But not required to donate. 
---
Wait why I’m I exposing myself to someone like you?
---
forget about bloody or junkie for the start. yes, they shred everything but you need to know the game mechanics and need the matching equip/aid. id suggest a full health build for start, you can swap later.
---
Always has been once a day. You just lvl up slower now.
---
I didnt like giving up that much steel when I'm constantly out of ammo of all types anyways.
---
People have Fallout 1st?
---
Here I am with 100+ hours for my initial £6 payout 😎
---
Pretty sure it’s always been one a day. That’s why he started 30 or so spaces ahead of us. So he’d reach the end at exactly 10 weeks.
---
Ah.  People have been complaining that it has completely stopped working with everything, which isn't true.  That's what I meant.
---
Same, reloading and closing/logging out doesn’t fix it. (PC)
---
I’m a big fan of melee with my super casual build and unoptimized armor, but I hate turrets. That, and waiting for the SBQ to land so I can hit it...
---
I don't see why they shouldn't, since all the wallpapers are bought in the Atomic shop and adding those type of walls could encourage people to get more wallpapers, I see no downside for Bethesda if they add this.  Also on a side note, I wished some of the other windows had a version like the wood windows.
---
Right, well a few things.
---
Don't bother wearing ANY armor unless it is not Unyielding, honestly Secret Service is nice and all, but you are going to suffer when not having a full set of Unyeilding on everything, Combat, Raider, Marine etc, whatever you can find wear it. Then focus on your Secret Service set later on.
---
Drop Traveling Pharmacy, you can get a Backpack mod from the Raiders that does the exact same thing as the Level 3 perk.
---
I personally rather use Barbarian in Strength than Evasive in Agility, as you get a lot of Strength from the Unyielding set, but this is just me.
---
You are focusing on both Explosives, VATS and Rifleman, choose just Rifles, that will give you more points to fill out the more important perks like Tank Killer. Some VATS crit perks would be a bonus if you can make room for them, as you get quite a bit of AP with the build, I build a full 100% crit in three shots in VATS and I don't even have any VATS perks.
---
Charisma, Inteligence and Endurance are not as important, I only have one point in Endurance for Radicool, but even then I do not need it, it is just nice. And with Charisma swap all of those Level 1 perks for a Level 3 Tenderizer, and with Inteligence just keep Nerd Rage.
---
Keep in mind there are deminishing returns on +300 Defence, I have 400 just from my armor and Nerd Rage, do not worry as much about the defence, Serendipity and Dodgy will be doing work for you, but again you ARE supposed to be very weak, it comes with the build, but the 20+ stats from a full Unyielding set makes up for it a lot.
---
Glow Sight is another great perk as the only enemies that give bother in the end game are glowing ones in my opinion.
---
Now comes your mutations, you are having weight issues because of Egg Head and Bird Bones, dont really worry about mutations that add Special points, your build is designed to make you have more than enough.
---
Lastly you are missing some perks that are vital for damage such as Tormentor and Bloody Mess, and your Adrenaline is lacking quite a bit. Cut down your E, and I down significantly.
---
And with your weapon I personally would try and seek out a Lever Action as a weapon to use down the line, using both rifle and pistol perks may sound nice but you need a mix of damage and survivability.
---
I am not an expert in the build as I am rather new to it myself but I have had a lot of advice in what I am doing wrong, it just comes down to ditching your comfort perks mostly.
---
i will try ty for the tip.  i hope it works.
---
it's already 2 times in 2 days, it's a little bit too much.
---
You can look into specifics through Bethesda’s transfer system, but yah. Your steam and a Bethesda accounts can be linked.
---
Great strategy but luck doesn't affect the outcome. It may seem like it does but that's a placebo.
---
Literally Apple's business model too 🤣 think Airpods and the death of the headphone jack...
---
Yes, you just deselect it in the atomic shop
---
&gt;"So, you're not a flake, I'm impressed"
---
Bitch what? We have done this every day for like 2 months. What the hell do you think Im doing?
---
Craft PA peices and scrap them.
---
Mind sharing your math?
---
Those moments can be fun. Speed demon and marsupial makes it feel like a parkour course jumping from enemy to enemy while trying to avoid fire.
---
Blink twice, Todd.
---
Bethesda bans people that move too many items.
---
I don't know if it's fixed. The event already gives a boat load of xp. When that event is bugged my console has a stroke. All the bodies and flies in the middle brick the frames.
---
I carry about 100k rounds all the time and have done for ages. 
---
With Bandolier and an AWR armour piece my Ultracite and regular .45 rounds weigh next to nothing. However if I stash it then my stash weight goes through the roof.
---
I
---
You need smarter friends.
---
r/woosh
---
Its the full outfit. Tested and confirmed. The preview when at the cracting table is also different from the advertised suit. But once you craft it, its what was advertised.
---
I'm confused so does that mean I currently have to be at rank 66 to finish the pass on time?
---
I don't even know honestly, should i trust them or should i not? I can't blame them during the outbreak, but the people giving orders to the devs are to blame. They have already shown that they barely care about what the customer has to say regarding future changes. 
---
When they introduce hotfixes in the form of full patches, they introduce and re-introduce bugs and exploits, but that happens on every game, the problem comes when they try to hotfix it within the first weeks. Last patch the hotfix for the autocomplete of SCORE bugged the lifetime atoms challenges, if that says anything.
---
On the other hand, i paid for the game while it was on sale, of the 500+ hours i've played, at least half of those have been really fun and worth more than what i paid... the rest was/is just endless grinding. It is a lot of content,  can't deny that, but it still has a lack of it.
---
Nah. 10/10 with Shine. There’s a board that says “Free Fast Travel” floating over the bowel.
---
Yes I have received them. Honestly I never got any prior to patch 20. I have received several since.
---
i just want the carlton dance as an emote
---
Can confirm on PS4 as well.
---
I mean, I know it's a joke, I'm just stating why they ban people.
---
If your on ps4 hit me up if I still have one it’s yours wicked cheap
---
Yes to what?
---
If they put the scripts back in like the presents had I might donate
---
I’m a melee build With a rifle secondary (13 PER), so I have a few non melee weapons for things that fly.
---
  Although I will say when the opportunity presents itself, there is nothing quite like taking out an SB with a switchblade :)
---
If they were spawning as intended I don’t believe I’d call that a fix. Either way the tent thing still works you just have to put it in the right spot. I’ve done 5 runs today of it for a total of about 10k steel
---
Please see edited post.
---
I think you can pick your ammo type? Dunno haven’t got it yet. Another week or so till I have max rep
---
However some games have done this and it makes the world feel more immersive due to the failure. Warframe had an event years ago that basically came down to protecting satellite space stations. Everyone stated it won't fail and will auto complete because they can't really destroy them. Few years later and there are still debris fields floating in space where the community failed to protect them. 
---
This makes for great in game story telling for the players. 
---
Why is this space station debris? 
---
Well let me tell you about that...
---
Aim at the zip
---
I'm a heavy gunner but I never leave the house without my super sledge. Just wish there were bigger two handed hammers. Super sledges look so small in PA.
---
I just want to be able to put a door on my done again my camp feels incomplete :(
---
In their recent forum response, they stated they’d be looking into creating double wall textures to make up for removing the bug. Not guaranteed, as they didn’t say they would add it, but I have a feeling they’ll release it with the winter patch and instanced interiors. They would’ve kept this bug if there wasn’t  a major exploit linked to it
---
Very well said.
---
i have notice a lot of people complaining about the rewards but like you said its a community event, NOT INDIVIDUAL. so yes collecting scrap like that can be tedious but the end event results are what matter.
---
i still remember when they did a similar event where the community had to kill, what was it, 100,000 scorthbeasts (i honestly cant remember the exact number) but everyone went crazy with it, myself included and that was before legendary scortchbeasts were a normal thing. so seeing everyone loose their minds on this just doesn't make any sense. i have contributed a small amount (300) but i don't have fallout 1st so its not like i have 20K steel scraps laying around.
---
I love fallout and 76 have been one of the most unique experiences I have ever had with an online game, It will be a lie if I told you that I will completely quit 76, It's just the adventure mode that I'll be quitting mostly because the game it's not fun anymore, there's a lot of grinding and stuff that you MUST do and in my opinion ruins the game.  
---
So I'll only play Nuclear Winter, I love that game mode and is the only reason I won't uninstall the game.
---
I donated 2k Steel, after getting an inventory full of Floater Grenades and Vodka I thought fuck it. Getting the Collectron and the Purveyor discount is the only thing I am too bothered about, feel like they missed the mark with the rewards.
---
Some Brotherhood clothes, scrip or gold would be nice or fuck even something completely new but no, it isn't worth doing, you are not selfish.
---
Plus the dupers will probally complete each tier regardless.
---
From day one, I wanted to create a tank build. Being a fan of Marvel's Luke Cage since the 1970s. Learned from other's on YouTube. Min/max  hybrid  tank build with mutations. It became a O.P. unarmed mix with bloody. With unyielding set/armored backpack. Can kill with 1-4 power attacks any living creature on the ground. (Except new boss,) Makes the game boring. I went on to create 3 other builds for variety. Gunslinger, heavy weapon, and a ghoul.
---
I wish private servers were truly private servers. I see no reason a private server can’t be a dedicated server run just on your system, sorta like single player except it requires an internet connection
---
I doubt it. I went to Fort Independence to gather some junk for the weekly challenge and found like 50 weapons, ammo and other misc items all lying around the generator, which is a weird bug that was introduced in Wastelanders where dead bodies disappear and drop all the loot they were carrying.
---
Now, this all depends. If it is Elder Lyons-esque, like Fallout 3, that is a different story.
---
The plan B is the donation goals will be automatically met regardless of how much people actually donate. Community wide challenges and events of this sort are rarely genuine, and more often than not developers will put their fingers on the scales to ensure the outcome they want, assuming the numbers reported are real to begin with. It's nothing new; Team Fortress 2 for example has had rigged community events as far back as 2010.
---
Idk if you played the past Fallouts but the Enclave love taking shit that doesn't belong to them by force
---
i wonder what bulk cork would sell for that week
---
[edit: (sigh)]
---
More lengthy answer. I use the perk loadout manager to hyper specialize my sets, but here they are:

While my bloodied switchblade works well enough unaided, when I really want to sneak in and slit throats I go to this setup to max out melee. Commando perks are used in case things go south and I need to shoot a way out.

This is the load out most similar to yours. I only use it at line in the sand to mow down the fishbowled scorched.
---
My other loadouts are all weight reduction perks for hauling, all crafting perks for crafting and scrapping, a load out specific for the queen fight and a load out specfic to radiation rumble.
---
I've got 2 since the patch and it was my first 2 I've ever gotten from the event
---
Before the game came out people saw the space station in trailers and Greenbriar footage (Famous reporters got to play the game early) and they thought it was the bomb that nuked Appalachia or something
---
It has been inconsistent for me the last few days, even with tents seemingly placed properly.
---
Yeah. Never had it before.
---
it's a community event, so yes. everybody, regardless of if they donated or not, will get the rewards if the goals are met.
---
So true!! Ugh I really like the duffle bag but I had to switch back to the paper bag for now.
---
That's lucky. Hasn't worked for me unfortunately :(
---
...and then suddenly, a giant spider appears...
---
I don't even know what it all means. What is the atlas thing?
---
I’m not quitting but I’m taking a break when I finish the legendary run. Love the game, but I’m burnt out on it, need a break.
---
With the state of your craft I'd expect to see a Matt Damon potato farm in the background.  😁
---
Yeah, I sell 1c for everything regular, and 2c for ultracite ammo
---
Not gonna work pal.
---
Why do enemies scale to thier highest level in an area thats been nuked?
---
Id rather fight a lvl 68 scorched conqueror vs a lvl 6 scorched wanderer.
---
Reason, more XP snd more XP for the repeatable weekly SCORE challenge.
---
i think you'll keep your characters and anything purchased from the atom store, but saved photos, your 1st membership, and any PURCHASED atoms are tied to the platform.
---
I wish. But no
---
Did you do the "glitch thru walls" Power Armour glitch?
---
Because that happens in silos
---
Class freak is bugged rn.
---
Unequip it and reequip it.
---
Forgot the part with the lever, put the round in, push the lever down, load the next round and repeat. Thats why I have 3 lol, use them and switch to the easier to load 30 and 40 rounders.
---
It’s straight math coming from PlayerCounter and Steam charts. game is at its peak number in the past 24hrs. at 9k and the predicted current player count being between 25-35k. Rounded it up to a 3k avg based on a minimum player count.
---
Maybe the Responders were returning but they were wiped out by radroaches.
---
Fair enough. it wasn't meant to be a personal attack, and apologies if it came off that way.
---
I don't disagree that the dailies themselves are not hard or time consuming to do. My point, specifically relevant to the OP's post, is that the value proposition of daily tasks is in favor of the game company, not the player, and that we shouldn't be comfortable with accepting a status quo simply because it is the status quo.
---
Right, but why would the donation reward be better because Atlas has been nuked? That was my question.
---
It's okay guys, they'll just put in some handy dandy tools to prevent this next time by outright disabling the build menu for 2-3 weeks at a time
---
Yes, in my case it took a long ass time but it was fun. I did it for the quest and used a chinese stealth suit with a silenced shotgun just hoping nothing could notice me when i shot them. Didn't really use many stims or radaway, but that damn stealth suit saved my life countless of times
---
Last I checked the count was up to 108,000,000 steel scrap, so people are clearly donating.
---
Dude, have you seen Modus??! Tell me he does not look like a Nazi scientist 😂
---
Even with the bad directions 76 has gone recently I prefer post Wastelanders because the content we got for it was really great.
---
We should complain. Then, in six months they can reskin this item in green, and state that the new loot bag is made out of canvas.
---
Same here, only missing the T-60 Right Arm and Left Leg.
---
This is for sure what I was missing. Thank you!
---
I believe there are gonna be legendary tenderizers, just try to get the plan for it this meat week
---
I've played since the Beta and I've never received a single Possum badge from these repeatable quests.
---
first SBQ i took part in killing dropped an anti-armor faster swing speed mole miner gauntlet. that day, i committed to making an unarmed melee build.
---
Your wish is the hivemind’s command
---
This makes me wanna throw on my BoS gear and go to people’s camps asking if they’ve contributed to the cause
---
This isn’t new content, though. It’s not even one or two pieces of new content. *All* the loot is recycled!
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I love building! I've built what I consider a very nice base that gets compliments from other players all the time. Some of the things I've gotten from the run have been cool, but nothing I'm all that exited about though. The perk cards are a big bonus, I neglected to mention the obvious importance of them. To answer your question, when I log in I simply play the game, similar to most other players I expect? To be clear, I'm not ripping on people that love the legendary run, it just never excited me much and I'm trying to understand other people's perspectives.
---
Thanks for confirming
---
i mean to be honest im not too upse- i mean, YES I AM VERY ANGRY. GIVE US 3X XP!
---
Yes but youll still need to claim it from the atom shop for free once they put them there
---
Oh look, a beret. Just what I always wanted.
---
Maybe, it depends on the rewards. I don't have FO1st and I don't pay for DLC, but I love building. I really want the Fireplace Door and Firefly Jar, but nothing else that I haven't already unlocked is tempting. If next season is like that, I probably won't play.
---
My tent hasn't shifted for a few days, it's worked everytime without fail. HOWEVER the moment someone goes near the tent or in it. The spawns go back to normal. So someone may be fucking with your spawn on purpose. I noticed it today. It deffo hasn't been fixed tho. I did the event 3 times today(thank you extra 9 levels) but the 4th time some bizarre reason someone wanted to use the tent stove and it ruined the spawns mid-event.
---
no, Todd. you cannot gaslight me. fix the damn game already.
---
Clear each new area of turrets before getting to work on a task. Except when fixing the reactor, you're not on a timer in there so take your time
---
What's really going to suck is stuff like cork and glass. Who keeps that shit on hand in abundance? 
---
/tinfoilhat: I think they legitimately made the hardest one (cork) the BOS collectron item, so that we could fail the one they'd least want to give for free. Then, they'll "graciously" sell it as an Atomic Shop item so people don't miss out.
---
As myself and others have said a million times, they still need to discount bundles for items you already own, it’s pretty sinister to and one or two items to a bundle and charge full price again even though you’d get 1 item
---
I gave up on melee, only real challenge was trying to tap an enemy before a ranged character wiped an area. It was great in single player games, but the mix of perks and legendary effects doesn't help a build that requires to physical contact. It's sad when i see melee builds swing at a dead enemy i killed from meters away.
---
I'm with you on the Unyielding - everything is unyielding right now, just not all SS. So I'm working on swapping those out as I get good SS Unyeilding rolls.
---
I do have the grocer and chem backpacks, I switch between them for whichever one is better at the time.
---
I've been told multiple times to ditch the grenades. I'll totally do that. The one thing I thought maybe I got wrong was I thought the explosive perk also worked with weapons that had the exploding bullets on them. Is that wrong?
---
Getting rid of Egg Head is going to suck, so that may be a while. I got Bird Bones because I was getting some serious damage when landing with Marsupial. I've also been thinking about the SS Jetpack, which would make that problem even worse. But honestly, I think my weight issues are from carrying around too many grenades, too much food, weapons I'm not using, etc. I really need to get a handle on that.
---
Thank you so much for the writeup - I appreciate the advice.
---
Just platonic. I'm married as well.
---
Nice. I never got the Chinese stealth suit. So until we move into our new house I can only play Monday and Tuesday, our current house is small and the bedroom shares a wall with the living room.
---
I was pretty annoyed by this
---
Yes, I have done it twice. Going through about 4000+ rounds of 5mm and 1000 rounds of .308 through a suppressors light machine gun.
---
Yay!!
---
I gave a little over 3k if scrap to them.  FYI, there is a stash box on the loading dock down behind the tents that were set up.
---
Ive noticed that After i fire a mag empty the ammo Counter jumps from 0 to a random Single digit number often, making it seem you havent fully emtpied your mag... are you actally Not able to ?
---
It means if you are at rank 66 and keep up gathering the same amount of score (from dailies, weeklies and the XP-repeatable), you'll finish the race on the last day. Approximately 3100 score per day on average.
---
Can anyone tell me where to find it in the build menu? Maybe I'm stupid, but I can NOT find it.
---
But... but.. but... metrics!?!?!!
---
You can still do the double wallpaper by using a flamer on the wall and then you can place the other wall turned the other way, then just fixed the brunt up one.
---
Regular mags should be 30, it feels odd to have 25 with stinging. :(
---
I love this. Thank you.
---
Imagine relying on vats on a close range weapon
---
That happened to me in the middle of a road in Charleston. I was in the same situation - overencumbered, trying to exit to be able to fast travel to Scorched Earth, and no matter what I did, I could NOT exit. I had to close out my game completely and reopen it. I play on Xbox too, so I don't know if it is an Xbox thing, or just a general game issue. It's freaking maddening, though, that I do know!
---
Hope so. It’s froze my PS4 a few times.
---
I'd be cool with having a weekly limit :D
---
I read once somewhere that daily limits are used to force players to log in every day and show shareholders or w/e that people are active every day. I have no idea if that is true and it sounds like some lame mobile gaming tactic.
---
I don't expect many on reddit people to be consistent with their opinion on the Enclave, the literal wasteland fascists
---
Oh, so like a loft? I look forward to playing Fallout with you next Monday then.  My PSN is Saraphiene1
---
The assaultrons get me. So I look for them with my Stalkers mini gun first.
---
I'm not sure if you've realized it yet, but Pete Hines is a pretty terrible EP, and Bethesda is a pretty terrible company as a whole.
---
I'm bummed this is the case, but given the endless slew of fuckups under Hines' watch, are you surprised?
---
The cork will be fun to see play out, it's a bitch to farm.
---
in the german version they replaced Colossal problem with Meat Week...which isn't starting yet and Colossal Problem has been put to Patch 22!
---
You have to have finished all the Possum Badges for them to start dropping from the repeatable quests.
---
I was hoping for Free States or Responders something from base game.
---
That concept I can agree with. Frankly I hate dailies. But I used to play WoW so the dailies on this game are like a fresh spring breeze by comparison.
---
A lot of the experience in this game is very anti-player for the sake of being so with no good reason.
---
Try triple clicking VATs. Annoying, but it works.
---
It’s a dashed square on console, not like a computer cursor
---
Bringing the BoS into 76 isn’t new content?  Huh??
---
Thanks for clarifying!
---
Ha... Get your perception up a bit and use Skeet Shooter if you don't already. It'll still be wonky, but once you adjust to the weirdness of it it's quite literally the best (non rifle) gun in the game imo.
---
What limit is there on reputation?
---
Dust cover for auto receivers. Bugs the shit out of me. I mean aside from being a left handed AK with 25 in the mag why are the auto receivers the only ones with dust covers.
---
I wouldn't mind a price guide on the uniforms
---
&gt; a run-through of the new “A Colossal Problem” event with folks from the dev team.  
---
Ok...let's see how the devs will handle it when being 'forced' to actually play the game this time!
---
Yeah i dont get all youtubers who are praising this.
---
I haven't been playing long- Completed all of the main quests except launching a nuke. I might come back to it, but I have Morrowind, Witcher 3, and New Vegas staring at me uncompleted. 
---
What got to me about this patch was how it managed to make ammo conversion more tedious. Couldn't the converter highlight possible conversions?
---
Just a general criticism while I'm bitching- Perk cards for hacking, lockpicking, and crafting add a meaningless element of tedium to otherwise enjoyable activities. In general, the card system provides a visceral feel for the tactical tradeoffs of combat and survival perks. But for perks that only apply to specific non-combat activities, the only tradeoff is the time you have to spend activating and deactivating them.
---
Yeah, with brick walls. But this impacted way more than just double walls.
---
Wow, that's a lot to chew on. Unfortunately, I'm on PS4, so I have to wait for Bethesda's perk loadout implementation (And we can all guess how well that's going to work). I think I would end up having to go with your commando build, which sounds the most approachable. I'll take a look at all of them though - thank you!
---
Same problem...
---
Is it because of the new update?
---
Not gonna happen outerwise ever never would have bothered to implement it
---
(Todd face)
---
Once you hit 50 it will really open up idk what platform your on but I could give you water stims ammo and some early armor and it will make it easier for awhile
---
Kinda, its just a small house, under 700sq ft iirc.
---
I dont remember my pin, I have so many username across the void, but ill reply it to you when I get the chance.
---
Seriously? ALL of the Possum World Challenges have to be completed first? I didn't know that. Where is this explained?
---
LOL, now that's gonna be a great youtube video for someone to do. Especially with peoples reaction on the mic!
---
Bos robot vendors, safes, or the donors boxes.
---
Thank you so much for take on this and taking the time to talk to us. Really appreciate it and keep up the good work. SS mods pls ;)
---
Without glitches the max reputation you can earn for each faction is Limited by the daily faction quests. There are other ways to increase the reputation but they are very rare and unrewarding
---
He 100% duped that ammo.
---
Considering they were in radio communication with Maxon? I really doubt it
---
I live on the Seneca Rocks mountain and I do this every now and then if I have neighbors, haven't killed anyone yet lol
---
I did this yesterday on a new alt. It worked fine. has there been another small patch or hotfix deployed?
---
Yes...as of today you should be around 66-67 to be on pace.  This does not factor in any future double SCORE events, which can help in making up  a chunk of missed ground
---
Ok :)
---
Tea bag the bag to get your loot   
---
The hitbox is so small that trying to put your nuts on it is the best way I've found to loot

My stealth commando build.  Just posting as a frame of reference.  This build has worked very will for me.  I use a 2 star bloodied CR with 10% Ap cost reduction and a powerful automatic reciever.  4 pieces of random unyielding (but ss with jetpack on body though) and one chameleon piece.  
---
When she lands and I can get real close I'm hitting sbq for 110 to 200 a round.  Always in vats and spamming that crit button as they proc quick.  I dont really pay attention to food or chem buffs cuz I'm lazy so that's "unbuffed". Almost everything not a level 68+ or boss is a one shot to the head.  
---
I'm not saying it's the best most awesomest but it works for me, and maybe give you some food for thought.

My favourite at the moment! *Magic* Vampires, oooft!
---
Same Im trying to finish cheating death
---
are you investigating why we cant get into carleton mines for the main story? not even being a smart ass, im just stuck there on my very first character.
---
10k steel. Three out of a dozen plans learnable for shit I don't use. A shitload of alcohol and 2k in caps. Think I'll stick to making ammo.
---
That's very cool. I'm glad I had a chance to explore Appalachia before Wastelanders so I could see the before and after for myself rather than videos.
---
The worst enemies I find these days when I use my melee character are the supermutants with miniguns, and colonel gutsies with those gatling guns. The do so much damage so fast when trying to get up to them to hit them.
---
Those and Yao guai then they start that stun-hit cycle over and over.
---
Next up: Steel Dawn delayed. Because the BOS wasn't able to acquire enough cork.
---
I disagree. We've gotten way more score than needed to finish the season, so I'm glad it's high score dailies and not a unique piece of clothing or camp item.
---
We're so gonna fail.
---
Thanks! It's so strange that you have to select these cosmetic changes from the shop as opposed to being a place to just buy stuff.

What happens if nickelback is your favourite band in the whole wide world? 🥺

It's crazy how small minded Bethesda really is. The net is full of great ideas. They could spend ten minutes on the net and get enough ideas to plan out half a dozen patches with content people actually want. Instead we get this crap.
---
my stash is always full of 2-3 star ive had to stop collecting 1 star
---
I run a vats build... when u kill something it moves to the next and increases damage... It's a very popular build for shottys.
---
Exactly! They are super sledges...where is the SUPER?!?! I actually don’t use super sledges due to the look. I prefer the look of my war drum :)
---
I can't imagine it could be much higher TBH.
---
Absolutely
---
I used to be a melee build when the game first came out, switched to heavy guns cuz I love the Gatling gun
---
Don't you just HATE that song?!
---
Then no one has to share a perk in a public team.
---
Lol, then I'm fucked.
---
Yeah I guess but should we have to.
---
Your AA Shotgun has a *magic* effect,  so did your Armor. So once you removed the armor your V Shotgun no longer benefits from the *magic* effect.
---
Check out Angry Turtle on YouTube for more info.
---
The lvl of player building is a fraction of ESO’s system. It was never meant to be large, but ESO has also had 5 years of growth to change almost all its lvling mechanics.
---
Not really a social aspect outside the subreddits, most players get by with social cues created from the in-game emotes or rarely voice chat. 
---
However, survival is a very short-term concern. Once you’re about 30 you’ll start finding rss to reduce the strain on survival aspects. At lvl 100* they’re just a nuisance and offer no challenge, which makes me question why they exist personally. If you look up player builds online and start building towards one you think looks good you’ll have a much easier go early on. You’ll get the benefit of skipping the learning curve to find good perk cards and still be able to make a build your way. You can also use nukes and dragons character builder, which will help you plan out your lvling and give you stats on what certain perks, mutations, etc will do for you. 
---
If survival is your biggest concern then don’t let that get you down! It’ll pass. However, this game is very much F4 with real ppl turned NPC’s sprinkled in. Most players are incredibly nice, but up to 300hrs I only have about 3-4 friends, who I met in-game, that I chat with often.
---
I'll donate nuke cards to the cause (of nuking the BoS)
---
That's a useful site!
---
I saw that community event donation number is not correct (at least is  preceded by  **\~** ). Looking into the site, the correct value is inside a json file that you can get from a GET request to [https://fallout.bethesda.net/api/v1/pages?route=/events&amp;lang=en](https://fallout.bethesda.net/api/v1/pages?route=/events&amp;lang=en) (**sections &gt; 1 &gt; data &gt; progress)**.
---
Edit: a dot.
---
Does not matter of math is right or not but the thing is that login daily and doing the same thing over and over not enjoying the game but only to endless grind is not that fun. With other limits it would be way better
---
Yeah me too
---
cant pick up ores in the sky brah
---
This is true in my case, blast away sir! Might even send you a request for my favourite 
---
I do always share inspirational tho
---
Damage can go up when equipped, to account for effects/ mutations
---
Nope! But if you have a *magic* Shotgun, it will melt anything in VATs!
---
It's hard to say for sure but it doesn't seem to empty no. Like if I purposefully stop before 9 I can drain it to 0. But if I hard press it from full it stops at 9. If I cancel the reload animation with run it still fires on the few occasions I've tried. So yeah it seems to legitimately just stop and reload without actually emptying.
---
Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered. I'm going to finish this season since I'm around 80ish with all 4 accounts. I definitely won't bother next season without a serious change in how it's completed.
---
I don’t think this is correct. I get them from time to time from the repeatable and I have possum challenges that are not completed yet.
---
3xp and 3 rep. The doc said that would make me feel better
---
Yep it depends on what mutations you have etc
---
If you have a junkies weapon you can see the effect with each addiction you add
---
Then they can get followed around and listen to Nickelback. Works both ways. Anyways, I'm done commenting. You keep on if you want. 👍
---
Im on leggo run L60 something (im lazy and cba to grind), when my new heavy gunner got out of his PA yesterday, my score started counting up from level one.
---
1st bar filled. 2nd bar filled, 3rd bar filled, etc. I let it go for a bit and it looks like it was just going to keep going all the way up.
---
But i was very definitely still earning score while wearing the armor. Earned two levels yesterday evening.
---
\#justBethesdaThings
---
IIRC, the damage display number is dependent upon your perks, armor, etc - thus it can change depending on how you are viewing it.
---
It's a pain in the ass. Mine deployed 8' above the ground, stuck to the shelf I was near when I died in mid leap, and was a bitch to get into. Looks cool though. 😂
---
For this first one, I’m dropping 250 a day out of boredom. After this? I’m not going out of my way to grind cork and concrete, and I’m not spending my plastic either.
---
Annoying bug that has been in game since beginning
---
you're previous piece of chest armor had the reduce damage 15% while blocking effect, which combined with shotguns (as well as guns with a fire rate exceeding 200) created a magic effect in VATS where the shotgun would kill even top level enemies in 1 or 2 shots at most.
---
Switching your armor has removed the 'magic' effect (which is a bug/glitch in the game, the magic effect isn't supposed to exist).
---
Angry Turtle has a youtube video covering this 'magic effect' as he calls it. Odd that it only seems to be affecting one of the shotguns though.
---
I can't get into it; deleted it.   It's probably more me than the game.
---
Old remnant of Van Buren for Black Isle’s Fallout 3 ( which New Vegas took a few concepts from )
---
I knew some salty people mad at the new patch and the game in general would come downvote me, but this is about the demonic and halloween content not the update or gameplay so grow up and downvote yourselves if you hate my post.
---
If Bethesda makes a quest to take over the Whitespring Bunker without letting me chose to fight for the Enclave and stop those clowns I will lose my shit.
---
Never launch on a windy day! The technology is waaay too primitive for a precise strike. Consider this: it goes sub-orbital, stages, flips around, probably staging again after a short while, then after reentry ejects the payload (warhead), and pretty much free falls the rest of the way, with little to no aerodynamic steering corrections. 
---
(joking btw)
---
Curious why it would go down though when equipped?
---
They’re referring to the provisions.
---
Honestly. It’s gotten to the point where I finish the dailies and I’m done. Now they “fixed” a lot of the building. Aka no wall to wall with wall paper on both sides
---
No other PA gets 4x Ore when mining.
---
But... Headlamp Mods... That would be nice!
---
It’s meant to be really heavy on the survival aspect for the first 20 or so levels, your character is learning how to survive in the wasteland. After awhile you’ll figure out how to maintain supplies and can focus less on obtaining food/water, ammo, etc and focus on doing quests and getting legendary weapons. 
---
If you need water, make sure to set up some purifiers. If you need food, just go hunting really anywhere in the Forest. If you need ammo, scavenge around in established areas like Flatwoods, Morgantown, Charleston, etc. Make sure you’re grabbing basically every junk item you find, gunpowder and lead are required to make ammo. 
---
Just keep going, once you get the hang of the survival aspects they really just become a background thing.
---
Sharing is caring   ;)
---
I tried to use the converter today, I had 300 rounds of .38 I wanted to convert, failed when I wanted to sell 100 rounds saying I didn’t have enough.
---
Mine is bloodied limb damage so it is magic so it 1 shots nearly everything but it's annoying to miss first shot, re do vats to sometimes miss again at 95% chance to hit.
---
NUKE ALL THE REMAINING THINGS.
---
I am not quitting I just suspended my Fallout 1st for a while. And no Atom **Purchasing** either! I will not pay Bethesda to play a shitty game.
---
What’s the joke, I’ve been here since beta and I don’t get the joke about light wood laminate
---
🤣😂🤣  request. Ya know, I figured most people on here would have got a laugh out of the post but just got butthurt and defensive instead. Thank you for not being one of them.
---
I sell cores too, how much do yours sell for?
---
Yeah but a excavator retrofit jetpack would be a cool addition for those who use the armor for hauling a lot of weight
---
Grind xp
---
Yes, you’ll have access till then since you already paid for the annual membership.
---
You don’t get a pro-rated portion of the sub back, so yes, you’ll have access until the date states.  
---
You’ll still have access to the scrap box after the expiration too
---
Same here. On PC. It's a slideshow picking up meat piles after Rad Rumble since patch. Terrible timing, since this makes gathering resources super painful. Bethesda needs to prioritize and hot-fix this ASAP.
---
Seconding this.  Bloodied and Junkie builds are entirely dependent on specific legendary drops and are not necessary at all.  (Also, you'll probably die a lot if this is your first character).
---
Good to see someone enjoying the game on here! Definitely lots that needs to be fixed, but we need to recognize what was done right just as much as what is wrong.
---
go to atlas observitory. a Brothethood of Steel fanboy is gathering supplies. if the entire community donates enough stuff, we get free shit.
---
and as a message to Bethesda, THIS COMMENT is why you should have put something a bit more obvious in-game to let people know this event is happening. not just a blurb on the news page upon bootup, but something like a new quest to investigate the observitory. not everyone reads the inside the vault articles or browses reddit.
---
I’ve sent them a much more in depth email. Sat down and wrote it after my first interaction with their “customer support”. I did actually get a real human response but it was one sentence suggesting I submit a ticket 🤷‍♀️.
---
no i agree im being a smart ass
---
motion assist servos or reactive plate isnt tier 1 imo.
---
“Well hidden”
---
It is a single page of items and they have a green FREE tag in them. what are yo going on about “well hidden”
---
use atoms
---
Yeah I know that after 11/25 I can still pull stuff out, I just wasn't sure if I can keep putting stuff in until then. Thanks!
---
If you’re not using unyielding gear with a maxed intelligence build you’re missing out on lots of xp. Try to stack as much bonus xp items as you can to grind for the repeatable xp challenge
---
[This tool](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/) helped me a lot with setting up a build though you gotta get to higher levels to equip some of the higher tier perk cards. The earlier levels I'd suggest getting a feel for your favorite weapon types/play styles and try to focus something around that.
---
Edit: I forgot to mention, I made the mistake of putting points into completely useless perk cards (i.e. pipe weapons taking longer to break, bow cards, etc). This made it more difficult for me to get to where I wanted to be endgame as I had to go back and undo poorly spent perk points.
---
Which main quests are currently active/available  in your pipboy?
---
I had a problem with Recruitment Blues ages ago but Belly of the Beast was there as well and I could continue as normal.
---
Edit: 
---
&gt; If prompted to complete Recruitment Blues again after one has already completed it, one may need to take the soldier's certificate received as a reward for completing Back to Basic and put it into the stash box and take it back out again. 
---
This worked for me back then.
---
Please don’t leave out glitching wires through walls using windows and changing it back to a full wall. 🙏🏻
---
Appreciate the response! Good to know 😊👍🏻
---
You’ll most likely be fine. There are people running around with 5 million presents. Unless you got the final warning suspension...
---
Wasn’t aware of that one. Thanks!
---
Why go for the lower star ones? Genuinely curious. I keep hoping for an absolutely nuts 3 star weapon.
---
Recently got a 2 shot laser gatling gun, does +50% bonus limb damage, and you gain +50 resistances while reloading. My gosh I was (am) in heaven haha
---
So in the last 4 months i spent 150+ hours looking for the uniforms and i've sold a lot of what i've found (kept one of each colour) in game and also seen what they sell for on a trade forum. These prices are based on my observations.
---
Brown - 800-1000 
---
Green - 3.5-4.5k
---
Blue 4-5k
---
Pink 10K-12k+
---
Yellow 15k+
---
Forest 20k-25k
---
Red- Cannot buy with caps. Trade only. Even though they were apparently duped recently i didn't notice any increase in availability on the trade forum. You could easily get 150k+ in trade for something like this. You could also get real lucky and get one for a "bargain" price.
---
Donated 10k yesterday. Will donate more over the weekend.
---
You: “this game isn’t time-consuming”
---
also You: “I only put in eighteen hours a week”
---
But to the rest of what you wrote; I’m not justifying anything. I don’t have to.
---
When people pre ordered the game and got the shitty nylon bag Bethesda gave everyone who ordered it 500 atoms which was only enough to buy light wood laminate at the time.
---
if you mean the event at Fort Defiance that's not Distant thunder, that's Line in the sand. Distant thunder is the one where you mark enemies with your recon scope for Defiant's artillery to strike.
---
After a point Unyielding can become guilding the lily. I have a Left Leg Unyielding piece, but the cloaking piece I run gives me the acrobat effect and action point boost which is worth it - my right leg has the acrobat effect for full immunity from falling damage which I highly recommend with a jetpack.
---
I'm not because I use railway rifles and that steel is all ammunition. The Brotherhood can loot their own steel, it fits their MO.
---
Bethesda will likely just autocomplete it for us. It would look bad for them if the objectives aren't completed.
---
By the looks of it they won't have to, assuming they haven't touched the numbers.
---
Levels below 30 can be tough.  Hang in there - it gets better :)
---
General guides - Green area (Forest, west side of map) until about L15-20. Recruitment Blues, Mysteries, firebreathers, responders
---
Toxic Valley (North, alligator On the map) until about 30.  Join the pioneer scouts
---
Ash heap (S, west of the 3 leg towers) 30-40ish.  Miner Miracles
---
Divide (center strip) - L40-50.  Rose., free states, enclave
---
Bog and Mire (east side of the map), L50+
---
Oh. Thanks
---
addictions, diseases, hunger, thirst, todd,
---
B.O.M.B. was a space station in the cancelled Fallout game, Van Buren.
---
You can get 500 from the gold machine and from smiley at the wayward once a week. Getting rep is such a pain I would have given them all the gold for a big rep boost lol
---
I feel quite embarrassed about my 2 seedy sheds now :(
---
Yeah, man. You've got this! A good exercise routine a few days a week wouldn't hurt either.
---
Are you on PS4, I would really like to have a closer look.
---
Check Bethesda's website. It has been less than 2 days and there is only 3 million to go... it's getting finished
---
You sure you werent comparing 40% stat with a 20%+nerd rage/adrenal reaction stat? 40% is not getting the most out of your perks, your mutations, your armor, or your bloodied weapon.
---
Those pesky insects shouldn't be underestimated.
---
They survived the end of the world after all
---
It did make me laugh 🤣 even at the concerts they take the piss out of themselves, always down for a nickelback joke 🤣 
---
In all seriousness though I probably would throw a request 🤣🤣🤣
---
Great picture! The crashed space station is my favorite location in fallout 76 and I used to visit it often when the game released. I took a break around a year ago and came back a couple weeks ago and I’m honestly upset that it got changed to the crater or whatever it’s called now, I haven’t started wastelanders yet but I hope it’s worth it
---
I wish the player had the option to help restart the Responders.
---
all of the targets are doable. 
---
Except cork. if we manage to get cork i'm calling shenanigans!!!
---
You can have a good bag or you can have a nylon bag you can't have both
---
Let me guess that just happened to you?
---
Thank you for the information, only just started my search on Tuesday and found a few brown and green uniforms (didn't pick up), found a blue on Tuesday and found a yellow today but aiming for that forest and red of course.
---
Damn, any chance you could post a video?
---
I never got a single one to drop until after Wastelanders came out and I was able to finish the last bugged badge I had. Until then the only was I could get extras was thru Campfire Tales RNG.
---
Excavator allows you to mine 4x more Ore. No other PA has this.
---
you can only get 200 from the machine every day
---
I have a cool photo from then, in a space suit. It’s me posing in front of it, and I’m using a filter which leaves most of the photo looking like the original, but the ground looks green, like I’ve crashed on an alien planet
---
Yeah I'm curious how cork is gonna go.
---
Melee in general is very strong but certain things are harder.
---
SBQ not landing makes soloing that event really tedious. when/if she lands she gets wrecked so the fight depends alot on rng.
---
Also for imposter sheepsquatch I cannot stay stealthed after the first hit, forcing me to go toe-to-toe with him...which is kinda rough.
---
By comparison my stealth commando char is op imho, crazy damage and can just stay hidden all the time wrecking anything/everything in sight.
---
Oh wow OK.
---
Devs are probably playing the game to finish this nonsense.
---
I’ve never checked to see if I earned any extras.  Is it obvious from the event reward list or does it just end up being one of the “...” items ? (Which recently was a Forest Camo Jumpsuit that I had no idea I had gotten)
---
Doubt they will touch on much, as Bethesda’s MO has been to use the lack of communication as a reason other commonwealths don’t know much about each other. 
---
I don’t know the exact history, but my guess is the BoS will have a lot to do with the super mutants in Appalachia. This BoS chapter left 10 years ago, so they probably know little about the war that will soon begin against the master, if anything. However, it would be interesting to see their reaction to finding out the experiment they thought they ended was actually all over the US. 
---
More likely than not, the Master will not be mentioned. At best, they may mention Maxson foreseeing a threat and decided the BoS needed to find other WestTek locations that could have key info to helping contain FEV.
---
Aye, I just do it automatically now haha.
---
Feelin’ this one. I think once I complete Season 1 I’m going to scale way back and move onto some other games. I WANT to return to the Wasteland but not every single day and not for FOMO reasons.
---
It fits the lore as the Excavator PA was built for mining purposes.
---
If I could make a feature request that, to my knowledge of FO4 snap points would be relatively easy:  
---
Add the ability to let foundations snap/stack for building on grounds with steep slopes.
---
Also, let standard floor pieces snap to the bottom of foundation pieces, as well as tops.  This would allow for the construction of "basement" levels when working on said extreme terrain.
---
You need to submit a ticket to Bethesda and they can reset the quest for you, I had this exact same problem when wastelanders came out since it’s a required quest.
---
I personally don't take everything, I just look for screws and aluminum and leave the rest
---
Huh that's fucked up
---
That’s only players playing at any given time, not the total number of players who log on each day. The steam number is how many are online right now.
---
Wouldn’t the number of people who log in each day be a more meaningful number?
---
My bad, I missed the “don’t donate part”.
---
I would definitely want more repeatable challenges, in fact people did got angry when it turned out that Bethesda messed up in one of their blog posts about the season pass, claiming that completing events would also be a repeatable source of SCORE and later saying that it was a mistake on part of the person who wrote it.
---
Plus I really dislike the daily “level up once” challenge: I can’t afford (and by this point, don’t want) to go grind EXP every single day to get that.
---
And let’s not get started with NW challenges.
---
My point being, I would much prefer what you propose, specially if unrelated to Fortifying Atlas.
---
Sleep to get xp boost; do mama dolce event to get the xp meat stew; use cranberry relish, nuka cranberry. And just make sure to do the dailies. I have missed 7 or so daily challenges but otherwise have done every challenge and I am SCORE lvl 74. Join an event public team and go around taking/defending workshops. Do events like uranium fever or clear out West tek. Both can get you high amount of xp.
---
Indeed this game still need a lot of work done, but I always love to give credit where its due and this new pack and outfit actually appealed to me and it was really nice just to have content I really love.
---
As a newer player, I need my steel more than I needed a super stim , a floater grenade, some plan that I probably won't use and whatever else it was I got in that crate.
---
Radiation rumble is a public event.  You don’t drop loot bags upon death while a public event is active.
---
Aye it can be a pain. I've gotten use to the triple click so it's not so bad!
---
Wow. Now that’s a nice drop. I’ve been doing forest dailies for two years hoping to get one of those jumpsuits.
---
I guess, but a reputation system should take some time to build up and I don't see how they could take daily quests and turn it into weekly "limit". I guess you could change them all into weekly quests with 7x the rewards, but that seems a little weird you'd have to wait a week before you can gain reputation apart from the random encounters.
---
Also, I don't know if the random rep encounters are that rare.
---
Where do I submit a ticket?
---
whilst we are on the subject.
---
I dont use any other power armor lol.
---
too lazy to give up the 4x yield on ores.
---
They don't need to make even more effects obsolete. Quad handmades are genuinely useful weapons right now due to the massive capacity boost. Getting 80 bullets with 2 ranks of armor penetration is still viable compared to 30 without any extra penetration and a different primary effect. That will lose its purpose when drum mags get back to the ridiculous value they had before. The value which, I might add, wasn't ever really intended here; the formula for all drum mags in this game was +50% of default capacity, they just forgot to edit the handmade when copy-pasting it from fallout 4 and left the same bullet count in
---
Don't die and drop loot
---
Sure I will do one. I will reply you with the link after I upload it
---
You can get 200 from machine + 300 once a week from smiley
---
Better than ‘rasslin polar bears. ;)
---
I always go for 3* items. I had a faster swing speed 90% reduced weight assassins pipe wrench. Every one of those items I picked was a 3* from the purveyor. Want a 3* jukies shovel? I have a fine selection of Instigating shovels to choose from.
---
I was not in heaven.
---
Remember to grab you're free beezle Billy outfit and backpack from the atomshop, limited time to unlock.
---
Yeah that is so true. I wish it would be some kind of quest thing like just to let you know what's happening. Like the Fasnacht parades.
---
I’m curious to see if Bethesda starts reacting quickly to the cancelled memberships. They aren’t experiencing any of the side effects yet since they already got everyone’s money, but now they have a countdown timer to win back paying players.
---
That's literally the only risk you take when you die.
---
are you on xbone?
---
I'm apt to believe you...I've had the same prefix drop on 4 in a row before...That doesn't say RNG to me...
---
at the very least, maybe RNG but on a limited pool
---
Yeah I checked it right before I saw the question and had immediate doubts we were actually that far.
---
PS4
---
Once you drop a loot bag on the ground it is no longer yours.
---
Welcome to Appalachia.
---
Yeh i solo'd it at like level 40, just need good equipment and load-out.
---
Give the masonry robot a roofing update.  Everything would be fine, they said.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat. There's not really anything I want. The community awards are OK, but not high on my priority. I have sooo many atom shop items already that I feel bad for not using when I build my camp (since you know, I spent money on them). And I'm 99% certain they're going to release BoS related stuff in the ATX shop (they'd be insane not too, lots of money there). 
---
It's one of the major reasons things like the legendary run or this donation thing aren't really impacting me. I already have enough ATX items to keep me happy + don't want to waste the money I spent on them by not using them.
---
The Settler Wanderer has a line that is very Masteresque
---
Do events to level. Worry about quest line later
---
I genuinely didn't notice this
---
XP and more XP, eat cranberry relish or cranberry robbler, use Leader bobbleheads, sleep, use your lunchboxes if you have any and run places with super mutants and ghouls (WS, WestTek, Burrows, Charleston Capitol Building, etc). and maybe do events. You could also use atoms if you are willing to spend them on the run
---
Nice, thank you.
---
"How can we make the atlas event even less popular with the players?"
---
"I dunno, make it a pvp zone? The vast majority of them seem to hate any and everything even remotely like pvp."
---
yeah. once a week. not every day.
---
what you said implied people could get 500 every day. which is not the case.
---
Don’t do that. Your account will be banned from Sony services if you issue a charge back. They don’t like charge backs. You’ll have to reach out to support. The auto payments should be in your account settings and you can just turn off auto renew.
---
I definitely have had days where I get x prefix drops. Like a bloodied day or a junkies day or an anti armor day.  Its weird
---
Oh I misunderstood sorry haha
---
Just imagine a game that literally purposefully delays updates if players don't do enough to make the sudden changes lore-friendly, like not helping fortify Atlas Observatory.
---
That's awesome. If you did hit me with a request I would have gladly played it. 🤣😂🤣
---
Don't mean to butt in... But finding 76, fun but frustrating.  I just made level 9 and everything has been a grind. I'm used to playing Solo - but I just joined a team, because I keep dying. Now I'm trying to figure out where they are most of the time. Hate to whine... just can't wait to get far enough in the game to get enough perks and some good equipment.
---
Whaa? 2 free drops in one week?
---
When was the last time you went in to a store to buy a game? Kids don't need to leave the house to get games, so who's going to id them?
---
Get a PC.
---
(Only a joke hehe)
---
Lol, wut?  Devs don't play this game.
---
Well, my mistake 😁 i have rus game client, so i cant remember all events in english
---
"Do you know anything about polar bears?"
---
not really...
---
"polar bears are the most feared predator in the animal kingdom"...
---
It’s insane to me just how much bitching is happened about small things like this bag.
---
I gotta say running bloodied is a pain in the ass. I rarely ever run across these drops but when I do I stay on that server as long as I can to get about 5 or 6 bloodied drops over the course of a few hours.
---
Does not work for for ultracite ore.  Everything else is fair game though.
---
https://youtu.be/8yMJI918ub4
---
100% not. The amount of times I get the exact same item one after the other at the purveyor is sickening. Got 2 troubleshooters black powders earlier today...
---
I'd drop crit savvy entirely. Crit savvy grants you iirc 1.5x damage every 3-5 shots, versus plus 15% for all shots without the worry that you lose dps every time you don't trigger critical as soon as it fills up.
---
That, and the fact that bloody mess applies both in and out of vats. 
---
If you want to keep critical savvy, you can always up your luck and trade in some of your other perks, like evasion, which gives only dr.
---
As another user said, once you get around 250 to 300 Dr, additional points are not noticeable.
---
You don’t drop loot at public events....
---
Even if you did... it is the *only* consequence to dying in this game.
---
I donated the same amount and the best thing I got was a mature nuka shine and the caps. There's nothing new but, seeing how easy it is to get 250 steel, the rewards ain't that bad ... if only the daily cap limit was higher so we could just sell those stuff instead of throwing most of it away. :/
---
Not really since it was retro fitted to mine this didn't stop it from being able to attach a jet pack to it. My x-01 can only carry 275(have all armours haven't chacjed the cary weights available but) that's pathetic. A military grade suit would be able to the same of not more than a commercially available suit since the military are alway leagues ahead of everything available to the public.
---
You must be more specific when asking Bethesda to do something! They will just give us a 1,400 vender limit and 200 Gold Bouillion for the entire week! The same with all the other things you asked for. When asking Bethesda for things we have to speak as if we are talking to very young children they don't seem to understand simple requests?
---
I mean I like this event if other people are there but don’t feel bad OP, the game should prevent you from doing this lol. Not your fault.
---
Yea, I just unequipped it. If I have to hit that tight or a spot to grab loot from a bag, I’ll gladly go back to the bag that was easier and quicker to work with. Looks cool, not nearly as functional as the other drop bags.
---
search "rebuild ps4 cache"... if your ps4 is over 3 years old, this helps. Also, check how much storage space is available (may have to clear some old game files out)
---
if none of this works, (todd face)
---
No. You can cancel. You get benefits for the month you paid for
---
Good point!  Thanks for the input!!
---
Hit line in the sand as many times as u can. and max your int. mister mash is a good source of x2 as well.
---
When they actually arrive I’ll consider it to be so, yes. What we have right now is a placeholder collectathon with one new NPC and recycled loot.
---
Once again, it’s a minimum to give the op an idea of how few rss were necessary to complete the event. Not the exact number.
---
it's a trick... get an axe
---
Given the rewards, not much.
---
I'm confused about what your saying here... You don't think servers have a limited pool of items but you got 2 exact same items today?
---
it took 130+ hours for me to find a yellow and a forest. then i found 2 of each in 10 hours.
---
Berserkers will show the base damage and then when equipped adjust for your armor stats.
---
What a joke.
---
Really Bethesda once again shows that it's only by luck that they are still some how in business. Really I can't wait to see how badly the streams for Quakecon will be, and I know people are going to be trolling the shit out of them.
---
At this point? I really hope this is the start of Bethesda finally going under. People on here have been right for the longest time, 76 is a dumpster fire. ESO has gambling boxes. They still some how think running everything on a shit engine is fine. I swear if Bethesda, EA and Microsoft shut down tomorrow gaming would start to get so much better.
---
A better option for power would be a nuclear reactor for our C.A.M.P. that acts as one big power radiator encompassing the entire build space. Wouldn't have to worry about conduits.
---
For perks :  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)   (and google for energy weapons builds)  
---
Second, being under powered happens, just be more careful, I'd stay in the Forest and Toxic Valley for a while.Do quests and events and dailies in those areas.
---
Death is only annoying as you drop your junk, so run back and pick it up. 
---
Build a CAMP and learn to junk everything you pickup, store everything (to have less junk on you when you die).  
---
No need to hoard weapons or armor "just in case"
---
I mean tbh it doesn't matter too much. Still kills stuff just fine. Just a little weird.
---
You see the legendary effects of that weapon when it is equipped. It shows the damage including the effects on your currently equipped weapon.
---
That's okay - it IS kind of hard to believe I have that many 3* farming and construction implements.
---
At first I dumped them all back in, but I was still getting my daily scrip so now I have built a 'Wall of Shame' in my camp to show them off. 
---
I think I'm going to seriously try to wait for the half price sale or one of the random pick weekends before I try again...too depressing otherwise.
---
This is my build for Bloodied pipe revolver modified a bit for explosives.  The extra End perks can replace Adamantium Skeleton if you don't use that.  Still not sure if Squad Manuvers works in a solo group, if it doesn't then grab the other rank of Tenderizer.  I don't bother with VATS perks since most things die in one shot and I prefer my scope.  For boss enemies you could probably replace the stealth stuff with those.
---

---
I have the backpack mod that replaces Traveling Pharmacy.  I don't have carry weight issues and I don't use Unyielding but that will definitely help you from what you are saying.
---
Stealth will give you a lot of good damage with Bloodied for general use.
---
The game states it's the arms that give you extra, but it's actually just the Excavator Torso. Handy as fuck if you craft your own Ammo!
---
You mean like THEY ALREADY DO IN ELDER SCROLLS ONLINE? Playing both games has been driving me crazy because ESO is what FO76 should be.
---
Thanks - I forgot to even note what my actual dr is at right now. I'll look at making these changes.
---
I didn’t mean to make it sound like it’s every day, my point is that taking all the gold at the vault raid is silly because you can get 500 gold one day a week, and 200 on a normal day, so that extra gold isn’t worth having to do more do even more of those repetitive dailies.
---
Does it say 'Can not exit power armor here' (or something like that) in the top left? I carry two sets of PA and have found a way to fix this every time is to place the other PA down. Absolutely no idea why it works but it does every time.
---
So, if you like to use riffles then:
---
1: dont use a pipe rifle, use a fixer or handmade
---
2: stelth is your best option as a riffleman but you can live without it
---
3: put most of your points in perception agility and luck
---
Thanks. And I apologize for my snide comment.
---
I wish level up wasn’t every day either. Don’t mind it as a weekly.
---
there's so much steel out there though. Myself and 2 pals added 10k each and another did 5k. Someone on here said they added 90k.
---
Ive tried. 😂 and i wasnt going to anyway. I figured id worry about it after seasons
---
I shall start my list with the consecutive Junkies Rolling Pins, or the consecutive Zealots Ski Sword, or the consecutive Junkies Plasma Gatlings, or consecutive Black Powder Pistols, or...
---
Or maybe I'll go back to 1000 scrips swaps and see if I can get those 8/10 heavies, or 8/10 pistols, or 8/10 rifles...damn, now I don't know where to start....
---
It's a special promo freebie, Its for some kind of gaming convention I think.
---
It’s not the minimum though. Unless you really think that the players playing right now are really the only players who play the game. That’s just not realistic.
---
If ~40k players are playing right now, how could you say that is a proxy for how many people play in a given day? That’s just way too conservative an estimate.
---
Sometimes the npc's drop paperbags.
---
What I'm saying is that they definitely are not random. No chance! If it were, the amount of times I got the exact same item (consecutively) I probably would have won the lottery 1000 times over haha.
---
Holy fucking shit balls it's signed me in!! Thank you all for the suggestions but I thibk it was just Bethesda being Bethesda. Praise Todd Howard, it works, it just works.
---
The jet pack holdings on the suit were removed to fit the engine to drive the mining part of the suit. Happy now?
---
That's... not how rng works.
---
Honestly I think it’s the best way to help the devs. We can complain in large enough numbers and maybe the problem gets solved but when getting upset is the solution it rings on deaf ears. Same time, ppl like to just throw out “great ideas” that just aren’t feasible. Letting the devs know when they make a right step let’s them know the direction we want them to head. The praise we gave for wastelanders leading into more npc led storylines is a good example of that.
---
Removing daily limits would end a lot of the duping. If I wasn't being told how to play a video game at every step of the way, and being held back from truly playing how I want I would have nothing to bitch about. Games have bugs, content sometimes takes a while to develop, but while I wait for these things to occur let me play how I want.
---
Exactly the same, brother. Exactly the same.
---
It shows up on screen similar to how caps, scrip, and xp do.
---
It is, till you realise that its just a way to make you see the other things and want to buy them.
---
I feel like I didn't fly through the game, I could be underestimating from when I played through but it felt like I beat it in 5-6 sit downs.  I definitely enjoyed it and will start a fresh run with the DLC so I'd heartily recommend it regardless.
---
50 caps.
---
Most folks who run silos have caps to burn, so I don’t feel up to 100 is too much, but sometimes I knock the price down below 50 if they aren’t moving or remove them altogether if keycards (100 caps) stop selling for a bit.
---
So I got very lucky then, can't wait to spend 150+ hours to get a Forrest or Red now hahaha
---
Right! If they did shit would get fixed.
---
At least brahim will be happy. Whoever he is.
---
Muh boot licker argument. Muh damn boot licker lmao
---
Minimum’s aren’t the realistic or likely answer. It’s the lowest possible. So yes, that’s exactly what a minimum is...
---
Line in the sand as suggested in here. Max out int with food boosts and mutations.
---
Crack open some lunchboxes.  
---
Find a mob route in-between events and grind it.  
---
Join a building team.
---
Optional: save the free 10x 150 atoms to coast the last 10 levels.
---
Start with a full shutdown, let the system sit for a few minutes, unplug it and let it rest for 10 minutes. Plug it back in and boot it in safe mode. Select option rebuild database. After the rebuild is complete, the system will restart itself and reload all of the game thumbnails. Let the system complete doing this and you should then be good to go. Clearing all notifications afterwards seems to help also. All of these processes clear cached data in different parts of your system, especially if you play multiple games. If you do this procedure it should help your ps4 run a little better.
---
One more thing you could try, if these steps don't really help, is to delete the saved game file for fo76 and let the game create a new file. This will however delete all of your photomode album and you won't be able to access those photos in game any longer; they should be backed up in your capture gallery though. You could pair this fix with a full re download as a last resort. You won't lose game progress, as long as you can freely access your psn profile.
---
It usually works that way. I have even had friends get the exact same roll on the same server. Swithching characters will often change it though.
---
I don't take the time to distinguish if someone dropped the bag from dying or because they didn't want the items. If it's on the ground I am picking it up and I would expect no less from my own loot bags. Just don't die outside of public events.
---
It does. People refuse to believe it. I get downvoted for not having to spend over 100 modules for full Unyielding ap/ps ss armor and trying to explain them how to roll it
---
ALL UNYIELDING OR NOTHING!
---
I've been thinking about this as well - that maybe not every single piece needs to be unyielding. I may start mixing in some other types at some point, but like I said, I'm still figuring this all out.
---
Alright, I gotta lower my prices to 50. Thank you!
---
Is that the skin from the Legendary Run? Because I've been looking forward to that but this gives me pause.
---
Ah makes sense
---
They should be somewhat in the realm of reality.
---
Perception: 2
---
OHHH I gotcha
---
I solo'ed it at about level 125.  Robotics Expert max helps.  I died a few times, but completed the mission.
---
All my characters are melee. Started the game on the first play thru as a rifle build but got tired of trying to find or make enough ammo, and they nerfed all my guns, but have really enjoy melee since I switched👍👍
---
But I also sell things like 1 star bloodied shotguns and unyielding armor pieces for 300-500 caps, and red asylum uniforms for 15 caps when I find them so I’m a poor choice of reference for price setting. For me, selling is about getting things into the hands of those who want/need it and so I try to price based on effort and material cost, not relative value. Any bulked material I sell is 2 caps per unit, so a bulk of 20 scrap is 40 caps, regardless of material type.
---
hmmm i trade useless steel for a lootbox with guaranteed reward plus a chance to get something good. I fail to see how that is bad for me. Got lots of new plans and up till now two Utracite gatling laser plans :).
---
BTW i have two chars, created a new one for wastelanders its 126lvl now ;p
---
Really? I looked into the story of the master the other day and must have missed that date. I had a hunch that one of the expeditions would take you to places that would hint towards the master (like where he resides in Fo1). Would be cool if he was a boss (obviously not dying due to lore). Would like to see something along those lines.
---
Also reckon one of the first expeditions will take us to DC
---
Supposedly it’s a display issue and you can still do them and get credit, as the info here from the last 2 days says.
---
Bethesda.net I believe. You could also just google fallout 76 Bethesda submit ticket. You might have to make an account to connect your game profile but it’s all legit. It also helps for Skyrim mods lol
---
Yes, people who are downvoting my post don't understand that I have created custom content for IMVU, Sims 3 and 4, and did GFX for mobile games so I was appreciating the outfits because I used to make stuff like this for games as well and just appreciate what they did with these items.
---
Definitely food for thought - thanks!
---
Two rules I play by.
---
 1. If it's on the ground, look what I found.
---
 2. If you're red, you're dead.
---
Mine reappeared after a few hours
---
Mine were reset to zero recently.
---
Ok, so we know that its not fixed. Thank you. And sorry for your loss
---
You're thinking of the blood eagle skin. It's actually one of the nicest looking skins so rest easy. The screaming eagle came out recently in the atom shop
---
Are you positive? Can you try completing one of the challenges?
---
I just crouch and am able to loot it, still kind of annoying
---
When you ask so nicely I'll make sure to share a nice Lone Wanderer card with you. 
---
Or sun kissed if you're bloodied ...
---
But yeah, would not expect anything less from a member of the Free States.
---
More potential back then too, at least for me. Was expecting there to be some cool buried section instead of nothing/raider trash. An entire crashed space station and the most interesting thing they could come up with for it was some space suits behind a code door.
---
It's not just the head, it's the full costume
---
400lb stash
---
CHOCOLATE!!!!!!!!
---
I remember during one of the first really short Beta tests, my friends and I decided to run like hell from one end of the map to the other just to see what was there. We were absolutely astonished at the sheer size of the map.
---
i never actually found a red. I ended up trading for one. I set a date i had to find one and if i didn't i decided i'd trade for one. So that date came and i did. 
---
There's 4 ballistic fibre spawns in those rooms as well. And on the 4th there's plenty of plastic. A magazine and bobblehead spawn (pool room and room past grid). And in the room with the PA a plan can spawn on the yellow cart and sometimes they're worth a bit. The BoS plans and marine plans can go for about 700-1000
---
The struggle back then was real
---
400 pound stash.
---
I was so excited about having a loot bag that would actually be visible. I guess being able to loot it was an after thought.
---
They should just bring over the big duffel bag from NW
---
That's why the minigun is much better.
---
I always envisioned the perpetual workshop thing much like settlements in FO4. With Wastelanders and  the return of human NPC I morphed this though to what if I could now build and attract settlers to my these workshops, really start to create my own private server and ongoing world. Would be nice. Maybe even decide what faction gets said workshop.
---
But alas, not sure it will ever get that far due to obvious constraints BGS can’t seem to get around.
---
Would have been nice though.
---
You can't always get what you want :D
---
If I'm in a situation where I know I won't have a fatal fall I'll switch in the Unyielding piece I have. But honestly, the extra 15% melee damage and carry weight doesn't matter enough compared to that fall immunity.
---
I said i was feeling nostalgic not PTSD.
---
Just when I thought the sheepsqautch mascot outfit couldnt get any uglier
---
I got a 2-star bloodied multi purpose ax with 40% faster swing rate drop to me after some event and I was initially pretty bummed as I always tend to choose a stealth rifleman type of build. But I'll tell you what, that ax has gotten me out of some pretty tight jams.  I'm starting to gain more respect for the melee build.
---
I remember the first time I went into the red rocket near the giant tea pot and found the stash box. I thought it was just another loot container and wondered why there was so much more scrap inside than all the others. After I collected half a of it I began to realise that the contents of this container were oddly familiar, and it dawned on me why this box was called "my stash". I felt rather stupid while I had to put everything back.
---
(Materials not donated, BoS renukes appalachia, we become feral ghoul things, existing in a nuclear stone age.)
---
No camps, no armor, stones and bones as weapons... 
---
nah, nothing will happen.
---
And that number is possible. There is no exact number or average of people throughout the day, so working from a known minimum is the best option.
---
I bought the game on sale both times for 50% off. So, they only got one copies worth of funds out of me. As for the business model, why piss off the people who are buying your shit. It may take a while, but at the end of the day it's a failing business model. Unless, I'm giving humans more credit than I should, and I probably am. Maybe the vast majority of people do like get fucked by every business they come across
---
It's steel.  I don't even keep any because it's so common and I still put in like 6k or something just from leftovers.
---
Some of the other materials on the other hand...
---
Orrrr you can just equip your fireworks and reload faster than the 15% faster reload legendary effect 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Ah, gotcha. Appreciate the clarification.
---
Was lucky to get a T-60 leg plan recently from a player vendor for 600 caps but so far have gotten no PA plan at all from the maps but gotten each other PA plan from player vendors except T-60.
---
Tbh it's fallout first customers fault to expect they'd actually be getting what they'd paid for. I mean I don't have fo1st but I bought the game from a AAA studio but what I'm playing is CCC at best lol.
---
Can anyone tell me what exploits they are referencing? I just came back about 3 months ago and I'm not up to date on all the "exploits" people are doing. This concern just seems a little off to me and I'm just looking for clarification to what they mean. Also I'm not a huge reddit person so if theres already a thread about this, my bad.
---
So remove daily challenges, add an extra 2500 SCORE worth of weekly challenges, and suddenly the attitude will change? Or will people start complaining that the dailies are gone?
---
Apparently it was a steam only issue
---
My math may be off but, kinda?
---
It’s 150 atoms to rank up on the board. 
---
There are 100 ranks. 
---
So it would take 15000 atoms to buy all 100 ranks. 
---
Let’s say 100 per dollar (I know it gets cheaper when you buy in bulk)
---
So, the flat rate would be $150 (actually 120-150) It’s be less than that since you’ll probably buy your atoms in larger sets. 
---
If that’s your plan, I’d suggest eating until the end of the season. Maybe by regular play you gain a few ranks and not have to buy as many.
---
It wasn't retro fitted.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator\_power\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Excavator_power_armor)
---
It’s not possible. I’m not logged in right now so at a minimum it is off by 1 lol. Do you think it’s possible I am the only player not logged on? Tens of thousands are also not playing right now but will log on after work.
---
You don’t need average throughout the day. You need total who log on over the course of 24 hours.
---
They are freebies for Quake-Con
---
🤣😂🤣🤷
---
I want to shit on OP for the "no dropped loot in a public event" thing, but just a few days ago I was in Scorched Earth - in the middle, the SBQ was nowhere near death - and I died and dropped my loot. 
---
I realize it's not supposed to happen, but it's not out of the realm of possibility.
---
I love them both, I prefer the original but the black one is a nice change
---
Sometime in the 2020s, yes.
---
RP?
---
Yeah but only because of how restrictive the camp budget is. Id prefer to have to think a little about how to set up power
---
Looks really nice. I am waiting for my legendary run grind to finish so I can move my main's camp. My second alt is living in a couple of Red Rocket garages and I have no plans of changing that lol.
---
We all get charged $9.99.
---
Time and time again a post like this makes the rounds of the Reddit, gets up votes to oblivion, and ignored by bethesda. You're wasting your time.
---
Don’t worry.
---
I’m also okay with leveling 3 times week.
---
I personally think it’s easier to do it solo, too many free radicals when other people are added to the mix.
---
Because its way more fun for these man children to make an angry reddit post and throw around the equivalent of buzzwords like 'bootlicker' and 'fanboys'. I dont really get it, if you dislike the game enough to call people names just go play something else like the rest of us adults? Lmao??
---
I did the same thing at the overseers camp. I thought it was her stash box. So I'd pull my stuff out of her box and then run it up to my camps stash box. Took me a couple minutes longer than it should have to realize what was happening.
---
The rush of players coming straight out of the vault during the beta completely clueless about the game was fun.
---
It just got fixed
---
You are giving them ideas...
---
I like the perk that raises defence while you're sprinting. Going back and forth between enemies is fun
---
Even if it was 100x that amount "we" would have completed it. Bethesda would lie and said we finished it ahead of time one way or another.
---
haha
---
We will have a double score weekend soon. Prepare to bust wholesale ass during that time. 
---
There should be another chance for bonus points during the final week too.
---
Exactly. And the rewards for that were reskins and bonus event weeks and what not. Now granted killing stuff can be more entertaining or more tedious depending on your playstyle.
---
Ive thrown in some steel myself, actually hunted down weapons for the steel. And since the min deposit is 250 only 500,000 people have to donate once. It's not like everyone who plays has to put in an extraordinary amount.
---
I remember being at level 30 and then got hit with the game breaking power armor bug where my character looked like a damn wendigo. Had to completely start from scratch and i was pissed. Good times. I do love this game though and am glad its in a much better spot nowadays.
---
And I purchased a bottle of coke for £1.60, but the guy behind me got one free which his sandwiche, so Tesco, if you're listening, pay up.
---
I wish this game would grow that much but I doubt it, unfortunately.
---
Not necessarily launch week, but I remember when everyone realized nuking white springs was the move, so many legendaries
---
Still waiting for the Ranger Helmets...
---
You're a good man, OP. Thank you.
---
Guess thats too baaaad, they decided to give it free to first players but you bought it when it was available in the shop. Thats not really their fault, I have bought a lot of content on here, if I see it free later on im not gonna complain about it being free. Feel like everyone just wants to complain about the game now and feel entitled. Your the one that bought it, so thats on you. Bethesda didn't hold you at gunpoint and say buy it or die!
---
This post is textbook forum slide. The pattern of astroturfing that takes place on this forum after every update is insulting.
---
While BoS is my favorite from fallout,  I'd love the Free States option. They're easily a close second.
---
Sorry to say but you are so far behind that I think you will have to spend a lot of atoms to get there.
---
Hes escaped ..AGain!
---
I'll take a look at this - definitely getting a lot of suggestions to go to stealth, so I'm going to try it out.
---
I do have the chemist backpack (and the grocer one) - I think it might be the grenades, the extra food, the extra weapons - just stuff I haven't been managing well.
---
Yes the constant stream of people coming out was cool looking back now. Happened on a smaller scale after wastelanders.
---
Found him. I server hopped a couple of times without any luck and he showed up after I did a few dailies
---
Scrap weapons to learn mods.
---
Scrap your junk before you dump it into your stash box.
---
Under "Notes" in your PipBoy, sort your notes and unlearned plans and recipes will appear at the top so they don't get lost in the shuffle.
---
Stick with one or two weapons so you don't spread yourself thin with ammo/gathering ammo.
---
Use the option to eat or drink consumables rather than picking them up.
---
Build a camp centrally located so it doesn't cost you much to fast travel.
---
Check out a map online somewhere that shows you the difficulty of the different areas so you'll know where to avoid.
---
Cook, cook, cook. This gives you lots of xp.
---
I spent most of my special points on intelligence and luck, and I believe that helped me the most out of anything.
---
Claim a workshop so you have another fast travel point.
---
Do I have to cancel anything if I bought a month of 1st on Steam?
---
Ugh i miss tesco (live in the US now)
---
confetti ! and  meat piles !
---
v
---
idk why you’re arguing how to use a known minimum, but here’s a problem:
---
100 people ran a marathon
---
You’re asked for an avg time, based on the bottom 10% of them
---
Do you make up a number for the top 90% or do you make an average based on the bottom 10% and specify it’s a minimum. 
---
A minimum is not based on how many people you think will be on later. It’s based on how many people you can prove are playing. So yes, that number is the minimum.
---
Just did and they are both really cool. Better than what we usually get for freebies in the Atomic Shop.
---
There's a good chance you actually were not part of the event. SBQ has a habit of not making you a part of the event unless you specifically click the [!]
---
On top of that..change up the daily objectives.  I don't want to have to buy or sell to a player every day. Or level up
---
 confetti ! and  meat piles !
---
Did the same in beta lol still have my urban scout mask from beta too, much cheaper times 😂
---
"Every person you see will be a real person." Didnt last long
---
While 3xp weekend would be cool and all it still doesn't address the main issues, patched bugs reappearing, beta bugs still existing, the new bugs and the time-gating mechanics that discourage ong term play sessions and the overall lack of communication. If everyone always asks for double/triple XP when Beth messes up, Beth will use that to placate the players instead of being pressured on fixing those mistakes, and eventually it won't mean anything as everyone will have all the XP they could ever need and the core problems will still be there
---
I'd love to see an event or something where we get a message from someone in a bunker saying they can't get out for some reason. We find out where the signals coming from only to find that somethings collapsed and covered the entrance and without that signal we'd never know there was a bunker there. Then we have to work to clear it out free some free states member in there who starts up the faction again.
---
So you're telling me if I want to rent a server from a third party it doesn't cost between 10-15 bucks?
---
From personal experience I have not found this to be true.
---
I do loads of events with my team that have done the vault and they get the T notes from them while I don't from the same events. I'm the only one who hasn't done the vault yet.
---
Well, think of it this way; we finally got the proper vault tec bag they promised us only after a year later (betas know what im talking about 😂👍)
---
If you think Beth is going to devote any time at all to this OPTIONAL, FREE item you're sorely mistaken.
---
Member when it was 400? Ah the good old days...
---
More people in low level areas. Actually wanting to pick locks. People wearing t45 power armor because it was either the standard variants or excavator. 
---
The first time I saw a lv 100 and his gorgeous camp in the MIRE of all places! It had brick walls, lights, industrial purifiers!
---
I don't believe it. Inflated numbers from Bethesda to make it appear as though people are participating.
---
It's an online game dude. You don't have unlimited storage. Also tracking a lot of data affects performance.
---
They just hot fixed it, just got in after loading a new server
---
Yeah, been seeing a lot of talk about both weapons, keeping an eye out for a good one. I'm definitely going to look at stealth after all the advice in this thread. I think I'm already pretty heavy in P A and L, but I'll look and see what else I can trim from. Thanks!
---
I’d be terrible with it, but depending on your build it can be fun. That’s the one thing I appreciate about this compared to most MMO’s. There’s not really a punishment atm for taking an unconventional fun build.
---
Yeah my current total cork is at 650ish but I donated 15k steel without worry.
---
Awe did I hurt someones feeling for saying what others don't wanna say and tell the hard truth. I tell it how it is, you are not entitled to a refund for purchasing something that later became free. You made the conscious choice to buy it. Here is a solution: don't buy it if your gonna complain later about it.
---
confetti ! is problem and meat piles in small area
---
Server stability. You should have been here in the days of 400lb when 10 Bobby pins weighed 1lb!
---
Just scrap your junk, don’t store weapons and armor you don’t need, don’t store mini nukes, keep power armor on their chassis
---
Be happy you weren't here at launch: 400 lb capacity.
---
Are there any good locations for Nuka Cranberry?  Is there a way to make it?
---
As someone who just spent 3 weeks working on an unyielding ss body, please explain your method.
---
Good old (insert your country here) (insert your currency name here).
---
Don't worry. Everybody will even if nobody donates anything.
---
I'm role-playing the role of someone who isn't going to do a bunch of bullshit.
---
Currently running a Melee build with 8 INT at the moment.  I am however running full unyielding and adrenaline rush.  The repeatable XP challenge I was hoping would be my saving grace.
---
Its not explained because its not true. You can get them without completing all of the World Challenges. They are randomly rewarded from doing Stings and Things and the one where you clean up Kiddie Corner and maybe the Camp Adams event. I've gotten them without completing all of the challenges.
---
Edit: I do think that maybe you have to have completed Order of the Tadpole to start getting them, but I am not sure about that.
---
*gasp* I haven't realized my melee was not broke it was my aim...thanks
---
Did someone steal your pacifier after you died?
---
My inbox is open. Explain please
---
You can make new characters and leave them items through a private server (Fallout 1st) or Public server (no FO1st). You do this by leaving items in a suitcase or other storage container with preferably infinite storage with one character and then quickly logging back in with your other character. This, if done within 10-15 minutes or something like that, I’ve seen a few different times, will bring you back to the same server.
---
There are plenty of posts on here with more details if you want more info. Otherwise feel free to PM me and I can explain better.
---
What is the benefit of a building team?  Is it just for the +Int to get bonus XP?
---
Good point. Perhaps then the option for offline play. The character has to start fresh from level 1, and it cannot be transferred over into public play.
---
Give the wastelander a prize. Exactly that.
---
I don’t think the vendor sells it anymore
---
 I tend to only check the store on a ~~Wednesday~~  Tuesday when the updates come in. This stuff was added today so it’s easy to miss 🤷‍♂️
---
Tasty squirrel stew or cranberry relish along with broiled scorchbeast brain helps as well as Berry Mentats if you can get some
---
I appreciate the offer but no thanks. I run my BDCG5090 and it gets done what I need to get done lol. One of these days I will get my 40+1.
---
Nah, you aren't being a jerk. I don't think anyone should feel obligated to do something in a game.  You spend your free time doing what you want to do.
---
I'm not going crazy on this one either.  Donated 1k steel.  Might give a bit more because steel is so common.  But I really don't care about a beret for my character.
---
I do want that BoS Camp banner. The rest of it is fine and could take or leave it.
---
It's not really unconventional. Melee has to close the gap. Better to be quick and tanky about it
---
It’s pretty cool.  Tbh, I’m 99% sure I got it from the Uranium event but I can’t say with certainty.  I was dropping all the mole miner gauntlets so I could fast travel and noticed it there.  I’m meticulous about maintaining my inventory so Idk.  This would go against that it only drops in the actual Forest.
---
Over repair mechanic bug for armor and melee weapons. It gave me more to do daily and reason to hoard resources like ballistic fibers. My goal was to fix my armor or backup weapon by the end of each session so I could be good to go the next time I played. These days, I just wait until my shit breaks and slap a repair kit on it. Completely unimmersive but quick and easy for field work.
---
That’s nearly 200 years in the future, it’s currently 2103 and California is another country on the other side of the continent. At the moment it looks like we may have a common foe.
---
I don't get the message(PS4), but I often times get denied when I attempt to travel.  Things that help me are crouching when trying to travel, running some distance between attempts, and killing any foes in the area.  This happens much more on the character that I have the healing factor mutation on.   
---
It really sucks.
---
I like your moxy bud
---
Because it’s a super random drop from Savage Divide events only.
---
Of course, I have 16 of them...but I grounded hard for them.
---
I love the gauss mini but damn does it eat ammo. I can play for a week with a  thousand 2mm with the shotty. That's like 10 min on the mini gun.
---
Hope that things can be changed for the better? In general, yes. If with Bethesda? Nope.
---
Like others said they've clearly shown 76 isn't their focus at the moment and only a filler game until Starfield from the main studios releases. Any other studio that actually has a connection to 'their' work could probably fix it but not this studio with the funding they get from HQ.
---
Happened to me. The solution is to move the power armor station. Away from a wall or object. That should do the trick.
---
Yea so these sorta are the forward scouts
---
In the PIP Boy collections tab there is a known visual bug where it shows 0 for the badges and bullion and other items. If you go to the vending machine that takes them, you should still have them.
---
I know that I wouldnt have known about it if I didn't keep up with this sub. Not an alert in the game or anything.
---
I’m not the one that needs to learn to deal.   You’re bitching about a completely optional, FREE system. If you don’t like it, DONT participate. 
---
It’s simple really.
---
But to sit here and say this is a grind is silliness. It’s hardly a grind at all. Nothing is requires. It’s all cosmetic crap. Most of it you won’t even use. Just simple take a week off. You’ll survive.
---
Could I put a bullet in his head?
---
3: For a new player it might be worth it as you don't have the stuff it gives out, these other repliers are likely end game guys who don't need them so they are junk to them. On the other hand, you don't have much materials yourself so you may want to hold on to what you have. Lots of player vendors sell early game plans for cheap so it might be easier for you to get them that way.
---
4: top of the map near Grafton has a workshop that has 3 acid deposits, take over workshop, setup the machines to collect them for a while. I did it for a couple hours and got loads of acid.
---
How
---
Not sure what that means. I am obsessed with in-game photography and love sharing my images. I don't care if an update was released recently or not. In fact if you visit my profile you'll see that another recent post I made was to complain about the fixing of things I viewed as unnecessary.
---
Indeed.  More int more XP.  Also weapon condition on items picked up is better, and many other wonderful things
---
Is line in the sand primarily just good for the sheer amount of scorched?
---
Ok. wow thank you.
---
Oh ok thanks.  So, you wouldn’t miss it unless you just didn’t look at the screen - it’s the same animation as earning the possum badge
---
You can advance levels by going to the Legendary Run and clicking "Rank Up" or "Advance" or whatever and paying 150 Atoms.
---
along the way, you actually EARN atoms, so you can use those atoms to finish ranking up before the event ends. There are some cool outfits and camp items near the end, so if you haven't made it the whole way, you can spend some of the Atoms you've earned along the way to finish (or, just buy Atoms with real money of course).
---
That's not the greatest idea, but ok.
---
So you're saying he only needs a little "entry-level" gear then...
---
Yes. Can get 300 score if u get them all. Solo isn’t hard
---
This was my all time favorite video on YouTube. I laughed the whole way through.
---
i have just under 2k and have had 1st for 2 months. I hacven't bene looking for it. So i imagine there's people out there with 10-20k easily. BUT i don't think we're hitting that target
---
Lol this needs more up votes
---
If he's on xbox, he probably cleared his reserved space. Doing that deletes all of your photos. There's been a rumor going around that it improves NW performance.
---
I've definitely been here. Amazing work!
---
You can scrap them back to individuals manually
---
Yes. Just scrap them at a workstation.
---
Sorry, nope. Your in the wrong here. There’s always time to stash anything too valuable.
---
No, really? Wow.
---
Devs...history tellers...someone  at beth...
---
Do you know about a AI called Modus?
---
Why Modus is so silent on the BOS move?
---
Why the bot stop patrols are far far far away of the Atlas? 
---
Modus have a *Friend* in Orbit...the friend is blind? Cant *welcome* the Atlas area?
---
Another history wasted...
---
Where do these rumors that PvP is going to end come from?
---
Personally, ever since the workshop glitch where they had normal icons, I figured the removal of PvP workshops was imminent and that they were just giving up on the whole "contested territory" thing.
---
Yep. Another f*ck up with this patch.
---
Pretty much. It's quite noticeable so you shouldn't miss it. But it is kind of quick so I usually end up checking my collections tab anyway.
---
Oh my god I didn’t think of that. I’m dumb lmao, thanks!
---
She’s fickle like that!!
---
LMAO!!! Bring this dweller a medal lol!
---
Like Fallout 1 and 2 tribals? I would play that game
---
Well, I sell Fasnacht masks at 200 caps, so I don't think anyone has a normal price range.
---
Same.
---
Has anyone else had a problem getting into any other mines lately? I had to go to third person view to get into Gauley mine yesterday. Wouldn’t let me in while in first person view. Tried multiple times, even fast traveled twice and tried each time. Backed away, switched to third person view and it let me right in the first time. Weird.
---
Why are you taking damage if nothing is around? Watch your health bar. Are you in pacifist? And 100% sure no one is hidden nearby fucking with you? 
---
Your clearly taking damage which I think is causing that.
---
so true, lol
---
we are getting free extra content in a game, not paying for it as it is apart of the base game and yet because its not what "they" wanted, "they" loose their minds. i'm very happy with any little free things i can get out of the game, i have never bought any atoms or paid for Fallout 1st, i have just stuck to the base game. no complaints here.
---
Music , way more people used to band and play the instruments in my camp. These days not so much anymore...
---
While it’s a helpful skill, melee has a lot that are extremely helpful. Unconventional being an uncommon perk for most as many melee players find other perk cards they’d prefer more, especially if your focus is less about protection and more on closing that gap quickly.
---
Yeah I also recall him sounding kind of annoyed, I also did it not too long ago but yeah. though not gonna lie he would've probably been more responsible with them than they were, seeing how we ended up.
---
Grindy is good for a mmo
---
You mean Tuesday right?
---
Rolled up on Project Purity like it was fucking Iraq
---
The only redemption now is for when the bos do show up, Russell  is just berated and degraded for screwing things up
---
Good thing your comments don’t really bother me lol. It’s comedy for me most of the time. 
---
Your response still doesn’t take away from the fact that if you don’t wanna log in to do the seasonal stuff you don’t have to
---
You're right but I doubt they track junk individually like you may think. Look at the scrap box and how its unlimited (which it should be for everyone). They can assign junk to a BOOL and make the first bit in that BOOL be 1 type of junk the next a new bit etc. All you do then is take the amount you have in there and assign it to that bit and as long as its assigned to that BOOL (the Scrapbox) it is weightless regardless of what the value is. Even if everyone, FO1st or not, had the Scrapbox the servers would not suffer any more performance wise. Its literally just a BOOL or a coding "word" that is read/write and all materials are lumped into it.
---
I didn't know that, great tidbit, thanks! It really does make even more sense now
---
Such a great live show. Kick started his spoken word events and eventual podcast.
---
lots to get.  Got red dress and western outfit :)
---
Do you mind sharing a screenshot with the right spot? I've seen so many spots work and when I put my tent in those very same places it won't work.
---
baby why you still talking if it doesn't bother you? something clearly struck a nerve...
---
Thanks bro I would’ve never noticed it 🤣
---
I have an axe, just got a Bloodied Grognak's axe yesterday.
---
They stopped selling it at the vendor ages ago. Sorry, man. It's an event drop only.
---
Are they available all day?
---
Indeed. Typo
---
no point.
---
I only transfer stuff i'm not bothered about losing. So nothing rare or worth like 30K+
---
I think it was fine until wastelanders. When it only was caps and scrip to log in for. But now to do all these dailies every single Day is just beyond me. Sad thing is that its probably only gonna get worse as long as we do it
---
Becoming overencumbered by picking up a box of Bobby pins
---
If you think NV was less buggy than 76 then you clearly didn't play it at launch. 
---
Feel free to google "New Vegas Launch reviews"
---
You don't even need to click links. Just read the page blurbs. Almost every single one says something like "Can a game still be great if it breaks every ten minutes" or "· So much remains of what made Fallout 3 special, from the ridiculous cast to the joy of exploration, that there will be many willing to overlook all the bugs and glitches"
---
This game suffered save file demolishing bugs. Forever removing your companion bugs, and just very literally, game breaking, not able to finish the main game bugs. 
---
Your rosy coloured glasses of Nostalgia boners doesn't change that.  NV was the only FO/ES game I traded back in withing 3 days and waited for it to be fixed. 
---
Buggier than all the other combined. If you played all those games we'll post launch, sure. 
---
If you played them all at launch and for a good while after? Not even close.
---
"
---
I'm at full capacity *with* a scrap box
---
Melee is a pain for me when mobs are moving. I miss way too much.
---
https://youtu.be/riL4VLWG3bU
---
uhm ... sheepsquatch mascot costume ?
---
I am saying you are using the wrong metric altogether... averages are irrelevant. 
---
So you can’t prove other people play the game beyond who is currently logged in so you assume that number is zero? That makes zero sense lol. You said it is possible nobody else plays the game other than the people currently logged in.... how?
---
You can reasonably estimate and still build in conservatism into your estimate to account for margin of error. 
---
A better analogy is you want to know how many people ran in a marathon. You decide to stand at a marker and count for about 2 minutes as people run by. You then decide to stop counting even though you know more people are running and can see them approaching. You then report out that only 20 people ran in the marathon because that’s all you counted. Lol
---
Thanks for the reminder!  Just got mine.  Cheers!
---
I have never been able to log back into the same public server without a friend as anchor. In this case I would just use a friend, or a courier. This works fine doing it solo on private, but it is a risk.
---
The logic is there is a paid option to get unlimited scrap storage. It's a big incentive for fo1st.
---
Funny thing is I honestly didn't downvote you.
---
Companies pay to have undesirable opinions buried on forums dedicated to their products. In many modern cases fluff content from actual users gets spotlighted in an unnatural way. 
---
Look at the comment to vote ratio. Your picture is great, but not front page worthy while the game this forum is dedicated to is burning down. Hence artificial.
---
Edit: missing letter "r".
---
For the first 12 months playing I had a strip club ("Bada Bing") on the lake by seneca rocks. I have two accounts so I would leave my female alt there on stage doing the mothman dance in her underwear. It even had a pole (basketball hoop). No ban
---
Thanks. I ended up scraping trash PA pieces but I'll do this if the bug percists
---
Or go stealth/bloodied and do the whole thing only using about 50 rounds of 5.56 Ultracite and 5-10 rounds of 2mm EC. BOOM.
---
I just lost 9K because I was at max cap and turned off my vending machines and locked the door to them. Somehow, another player transported inside and bought my most valuable item. I know I should even be more careful but there is no reason for the limit, or at least, prevent any purchase that can cause over limit.
---
Sorry, prob not not getting your stuff back.  I lost the item I was transferring to trade for a BE Gat plasma a couple weeks ago. RIP.
---
As a bonus, this counts towards some of the weekly "Collect X" challenges. Scrapping down my bulk steel completed the Collect Steel portion of this weeks weekly.
---
Whitesprings clubhouse, going there and finding a bunch of legendary items in the ice machine or on the ground in loot bags.
---
Stop forcing yourself to swallow a bunch of shit you're clearly not enjoying.  If you're in the mood to do it, great.  Do it and have fun.  If you're not, then log off for the day.
---
The day you learn how to dismiss these shallow attempts at manipulating your play time will be the day a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  Log on when you want.  Log off when you want.  You don't get the seasonal doo-dad or login reward?  So what?
---
I think until Monday maybe?
---
That's the conclusion I came to as well, all lumped down at one end.
---
Honestly I'd've been happier with the paper bag being colored blue and gold.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers...
---
Oh okay, thanks dude!
---
And save your cork for a donation!!!
---
The philosophy is to go ahead an invest in a ton of Legendary modules. I'd say run with 50+.
---
Once you've done this, go farm legendaries on servers. When you get a drop from a legendary that's your preferred primary effect, stay on that server and begin crafting with your modules.
---
In my opinion, this will greatly increase your chances of rolling the primary effect you want, but at the end of the day it still has some rng involved.
---
A lot of individuals will argue against this, though after 800+ hours in the game, my personal experience and opinion is that this does work.
---
How do you manage your inventory then ? Aren't you full of stuff ? 
---
I lost heavy tonight : 
---
I/E/WR LMG
---
J/E fixer
---
Q/E combat shotgun... And many other BLoodied weapons.
---
I'm about to leave this game seriously, how can you not have a shared stash and no way to transfer items from characters of an account ? That is totally stupid
---
Idk your lvl but try to get a grenade launcher and find a line in the sand. You will lvl up really fast.
---
The last thing I care about atm are the rewards from the junk donations, tbh. Even if there were no rewards besides the final community ones, people would still donate. The supply boxes are just bonuses. 
---
The thing that irritates me is the lack of effort in the story. Your idea is 100x better than some military fan-boy who thinks the brotherhood *might* be coming, and is going to make his own power armor in the **hopes** that he can get in to the training.. Recon team makes wayyyyyyy more sense!
---
Are they even trying anymore?
---
Thing is NV was not developped by Bethesda. And yes, I said they had bugs but they eventually got fixed. It didn't took two years for NV to be playable. FO76 is two years old and it's still broken. Also NV didn't ask you to pay a membership to play it.
---
&gt; Your rosy coloured glasses of Nostalgia boners
---
Why you angry? The only games from bethesda I didn't play at launch were morrowind (and those before), oblivion (never played it) aaaaand FO76.
---
By all accounts, I was taking part. The event title and timer were active on my screen, the SBQ icon was activated and roaming about the map, and I died due to her literally clawing my face off. Other than the fact that this is a Bethesda game, there were no indicators the event wasn't working properly.
---
i've had this happen to me twice before, each time i have to delete my entire game and re-download.
---
We're bigger fans to the game then the company is at being fans to us. Some bugs didn't need to be fixed and the weight restrictions make it not a fallout game but more like me and my weight. It's ridiculous and to have a private server only to still get server disconnections it's disgraceful.
---
Second comment is directed to whoever downvoted me for speaking the truth.
---
Sofia gives you a quest every day when you complete all her quest line, a chance at the ‘weapon crate’ mission which to my knowledge is a 3* weapon
---
Don't even go that route go play outer worlds or anything else other than Bethesda
---
&gt; On a side note, anyone know if it's worth contacting customer service for this kind of stuff ?
---
I would guess no because I don't think they would be able to verify what items were lost.  I also don't think they would want to commit to providing customer support for this, since it likely happens all the time, but seldom gets brought up since every player I know either has a friend anchor a private server to prevent this or realizes the risk and therefore assumes the responsibility.  
---
&gt; So please, Bethesda, for the love of god, give us a shared stash. I don't see any reason not to, as long as the space for the shared stash is taken from the main stash, the way display items or vending machines work. It won't break the 800 lbs limit that way.
---
Are you suggesting just 800 lbs across all our toons?  I am vehemently against this as I don't want to lose 3200 lbs of storage.   If they give us a shared space of 4000 lbs, then I would be fine with this.  But I have heard others talk about how increasing inventories would strain servers.
---
If you're on PS4 and ever need someone to anchor a private server while you pass stuff, just let me know.
---
yup, 2/3 of the drops I got yesterday were bloodied.  Now, it was a bloodied cryolator, bowie knife and some other garbage, but still.
---
Ask a friend or market courier to help with transfers. At the very least you have a chance of getting your stuff back if you get scammed but if the server eats it RIP
---
Its alot easyer solo, takes about 15 min
---
Sucks im on vacation and cant get it.
---
Not gunna lie when there is a decent sale on the game im buying a second account. Make a guy to just hold stuff. It hurts me to throw away/destroy stuff. And I just started lol. Hell I'd love a small like 50lb or even less box just for shared items. Add it to fallout 1st. Doesn't matter would be awesome.
---
Nowhere near as challenging as explosive builds. Try optimizing your weight distribution to hold mini nukes and 40mm grenades, and then look at how many you go through on any of the end game bosses. Now that is hardcore mode.
---
I picked up a bloodied sword the other day and it was like switching to ezpz tranquility. Hardly any repair costs, one hit kills, power armor or not, it didn't matter, block or not, it didn't matter, just a little more armor repairs and stim pack usage.
---
That’s because it does not exist there... it is a rare event reward
---
Is that for nuclear winter? That happened to me a couple weeks ago when I had the game in Spanish. Changed it to English since then.
---
You poor thing.
---
Hours? The masks only drop from 4 events with a 0.02% drop chance. I spent over 6 months grinding those events daily until I got it finally from "one violent night".
---
Bool? It'd be 2 fields - item id &amp; amount.
---
I don't get why you're explaining how the scrapbox operates. You can't generalise it across all items. Even then you overlook the fiscal side.
---
Come on dude, who are you kidding. Good player features are like the lowest rung on the ladder of consideration, below corporate or even dev ease of implementation. Bethesda made that very clear.
---
It's caused by a glitch based around having a tent near the black car at the back.
---
The problem being is that I already bought it I wish they would have told me this game was going to game pass SMH
---
It counts even if you bulk it yourself too.  As long as it can be bulked pull from your reserves, bulk it, scrap it and put it back.  You can complete the gather supplies weeklies in a few minutes.
---
You know there is a whole questline coming for the BOS right? This is just a teaser ahead of the larger BOS DLC later this year.
---
Scorched with 5 ft stretched neck
---
Is there a survival tent nearby one of the spawn points? If so, its an exploit to have them spawn in front of the sonic generator to mow them down easier.
---
I actually enjoy that game too especially just being by myself
---
Can you use the door frame as an interior wall?
---
Thanks for the tip, I was wondering about this, thinking why would Bethesda only give us the BeezleBilly head.
---
I didn't play the first week because I was sick, and I feel like I'll never catch up.  I'm 5 or 6 behind and it feels impossible.   I spend hours and hours playing and still can't get more than 2.5 levels unlocked
---
The first time I took down a Scorchbeast. I was ~50-60ish, in full unmodded T-51b power armor, and needed one of the anti-aircraft installations to help do it. 
---
I was using some non-legendary Combat Rifle on semi-auto and I wasn't optimized for VATs, so my ability to seriously hurt that thing was non-existent. I basically plinked at it while keeping the AA gun repaired so it could distract and damage the thing. The sonic screams ripped into my health, so I had to duck and cover whenever it when on a strafing run.
---
I still have the "trophy" photo I took from the kill. It's the 2nd photo in my library, after my first character's ID card.
---
Nowadays, my current character in her geared-out stealth commando build can drop that same critter within ~15 seconds. I just facetank the screams, because they don't hurt me. 
---
-----
---
It's funny, because that power scaling actually affects how I feel my character perceives the world around her. 
---
When she first started out, she was a scared loner fresh out of the vault. Very weak and very human. Stuff mattered, because the world was dangerous.
---
But 200+ levels later, she's a nigh-unkillable mutated freak who can super-jump, fall from any height without power armor, headshot an entire room of enemies in seconds, and absorb unholy amounts of damage without stopping. All of her SPECIAL stats (apart from END) are well beyond the 15 cap. 
---
When Wastelanders dropped, I found that I considered all of these new humans beneath me, and that doing quests for them was akin to bringing a talking ant a sugar cube. "Oh, I need to do this for you or I'll be in trouble? Haha - okay little bug. Why not? I'm bored, and you're an amusing distraction."
---
Shhhh. It's an amazing bug for xp in that event. We don't want it patched :)
---
That explains it. I’ve never seen this happen before, so thank you!
---
That happens all the time on here we have to follow the herd that's what reddit seems to be all about
---
I am going to assume good intentions here, because to do otherwise is too frustrating, so in that spirit here is a short list of things that I think need to come from this in order to fix this mess: 
---
i) If you are going to make a major change to the CAMP system, put it on the public test servers. I would describe myself as a mid level CAMP builder, I don't have all that many tricks at my finger tips, I just spent ages fiddling to get stuff to work, but even I knew "Oh wow, that's going to cause issues" as soon as I read the patch notes. I didn't even need to log in. 
---
It doesn't matter if the thing you are fixing isn't a CAMP exploit, if you are changing CAMPs, let us test it first as a "quick fix" in dev terms is often a really bad approach. 
---
ii) Don't just revert a few bits of it with other restrictions to work around your current fix. Fix it properly. Did I find double walls useful? Yes. Did I find the ability to hang walls off other walls to get them to stand free of the floor, so I could then build off them useful? Yes. Did I enjoy spending double budget to put my walls in? No.  Did I enjoy building everything in either brick or barn to make my walls work, then going through a dozen clicks to "glitch" things in to the way I want them a good use of build time? Also no. Please, address this properly. 
---
iii) We know instanced  CAMPs are coming but please, don't have that totally remove the publicly visible aspect of CAMPs entirely and kick this down the road till then. And put instance CAMPs on the test servers. Heck, you could even have a separate test server where there are no enemies and you have a "Stash box" with 999,999,999 junk in it so we can test your CAMP system. Many builders will happily spend hours testing the new system for free, provided feedback is listened to. 
---
iv) The following is really needed urgently: 
---
1. Double sided walls.
---
2. A legitimate way to stack foundations. 
---
3. A way to pass a wire through walls that doesn't eat so much budget, or have a massive clunky conduit attached to it. 
---
4. Vertical conduit circles, to put them onto walls, not just roofs/floors.
---
5. Look at the FO4 mod "Vertical (Wall Mounted) Power Conduits" mod by Daedragon, this fixes issues 3 and 4 above. Then give them a big sack of cash, and copy it. This does what your conduits should do. 
---
6. Remove as many restrictions as possible on what can be deleted within CAMPs. Keep them at workshops if you must, but in CAMPs, free it up. Players don't all raid my CAMP to try and capture my resource generator and start PVP, so the chances of me exploiting players at my CAMP are minimal. If you want to keep things fair at publicly capturable places, fine. 
---
7. Stop the random camp attacks. They aren't a challenge, they are an annoyance. Those 3 feral ghouls wasted maybe 5 rounds of .45 ammo, or around 12 shots of Gatling Plasma after the full auto overspray, but it wasn't a "fun diversion", it just meant I had to drop out of build mode, run around outside, and go back into it. And the follow up quest, "go find 2 blackberries and a gourd to fix those crops they damaged" will also take maybe 5 mins and also not be fun. Yes, the attacks are only every 30 mins or so in a camp, but a full on CAMP edit can take hours. Also, one of the reasons people build up, and have one foundation piece with a set of stairs surrounded by missile turrets is to minimise this irritation. Get rid of this nonsense, and you will have a lot less floaty camps. 
---
There are dozens of little camp fixes, but that is my "immediate" list to restore things to where they should have been before this, and address the actual cause of "weird floaty CAMPs"
---
JEEEEESSSSSUUUUUUUUSSSS. Makes 0 sense.
---
No, I suggest the exact same way as display case works :
---
You tag an item as shared, it still courts in the inventory limit of the character storaging it, until you log on your other toon who retires it.
---
It's been going on for awhile. Someone places a tent at the spawn point.
---
That would have been the best thing man!
---
So was that some sort of mini update they pushed, and if so, what was the updated?
---
Don't forget Starfield as well and I'm getting the feeling that it's going to be a massive pile of shit when it comes out.
---
Really it's sad to see the greats like BioWare, Bethesda, Blizzard turn into what they have turned into. At one time they came out with some of the best games anyone could play. Now they are a bunch of greedy pricks who look for the most lazy ways to retain players while hocking gambling boxes and microtransactions at them.
---
*Yeah but only because of how restrictive the camp budget is.*
---
This was my reasoning. Conduits add up, and I think the wires are ugly.
---
If that's too simplified, they could also do it similar to the Vault-Tec workshop in Fallout 4.
---
I feel you. It's also quite tiring hearing everyone repeat that at release it was 400 pounds like i get it, the problems comes now. Even as an online game, unlimited storage isn't going to be possible without some sort of monetization behind it (Fo1st), but other games do it right by letting you get a small boost to your space for a set amount of in-game currency.
---
The logic i'm guessing is just for the monetization aspect, and also to prioritize the management of your own storage space.
---
This is just a Community Event. It's not even Steel Dawn as far as we know. Steel Dawn will have a minor questline coming with U22. Then a major expansion: Fractured Steel, is coming later in the year.
---
I'm not saying OP is this way, but I honestly think there are players who think this Atlas crap is the whole BOS event.
---
if you are on xbox id totally join lol
---
We have found out that you can just, you know, buy psychological validation, so...
---
Ouch...i hope not. I use that method all the time.
---
Well, when you're better off doing the Feed the People event instead of the BOS turn in, someone at Bethesda messed up.
---
I enjoy the game in a purely sadomasochistic way. I have fun but it's high peaks and incredibly low valleys. Mostly low valleys.
---
I scream and yell the entire time at dumb shit that constantly happens, shit that makes no sense. My most oft said word during play is "WHY??"
---
Definitely agree, having a friend or courier if you do not have FO1st is much safer. I was able to do it successfully on a public server twice before I got FO1st but I’ve seen some people posting about not being able to get back to the same server.
---
You can’t switch the doorframe into a wall or window. Ever since the update they did a few days ago. If that’s what you meant.
---
My images seem to get in the 'hot' posts quite regularly so I can't tell the difference to be honest.
---
Hate to assume this, but are you sure you aren't getting confused by the checkmarks?
---
I’d put the odds of fractured steel releasing any time in 2020 at about 0%.
---
Stand on dirt. No really, it usually works. The image shows you on a roof
---
Cheeky Bethesda bastards. It’s a smart move I’ll give them that.
---
Unfortunatly dont have any friend in this game...
---
Thanks i'll take a look!
---
I definitely need to sort out my inventory, I'm always over encumbered!
---
People don't notice because it doesn't flag it as a fallout 1st discount, it just shows the discount. So unless you also have an account without fallout 1st to compare it to you generally don't know why you are getting the discount.
---
I also take offence to being called 'fluff'. xD
---
No just the regular game and it's in English
---
Well, probably. But this is just the known timetable so far.
---
Thanks for the great tips! That's really helpful!
---
You have zero chance with CS.  Misery loves company is all i can tell you.  I’ve gotten to where the really good stuff I get a friend to anchor for me on a private due to losses.
---
I’m guessing server reset.
---
Role-Playing :)
---
Yeah, the removal from the Bunker's vendor was not intended.
---
Valseek and Lady Devann both promised to look into it and (iirc) to get at least the dropchance upped. Another empty promise...
---
i am doing it right now and it's working fine for me
---
triple clicking?
---
Fuck the BoS!
---
We just released a hotfix that fixed this that required no downtime. You should be able to progress now! [Info here.](https://bethesda.net/community/post/2907763)
---
I don't disagree with you but from corporate's pov, management are probably doing exactly as expected. Maybe could do with fewer fuck ups &amp; controversies but do long as they're hitting their revenue targets, they don't seem to give a shit how the rest of it goes. 
---
I'm more inclined to think the player base needs the intervention more than management does. Management is irredeemable. You just have to accept that this is how Bethesda is as a company.
---
Sad news. =(
---
Dunno how a video about changing SSD on a PS4 would help me install one on my Xbox One X mate, but I get what you're saying. :)
---
We just released a no-downtime hotfix for this event. You should be able to progress now. [Info here.](https://bethesda.net/community/post/2907763)
---
scrolling their forums just for that shutdown and didnt find anything, they prob added those items like SS pocket mod when they actually forgot add it during patch 21. Didnt test it, went right offline after that
---
Glad to hear this. Looks like I’m filing a support ticket.
---
Considering that we are at 122.41M right now, I highly doubt it will fail.
---

Actually, they \*realy\* were super fast to solve this one apparently
---
No disrespect, but Kevduit did it with only fists.
---
I mean that's how random works. Getting two of the same thing in a row doesn't mean it's not random. That's not how it works. Getting 2 in a row IS random.
---
Just so happens that I am on xbox
---
Based on some of the feedback  I have seen on here I would agree.
---
It’s like thinking the clean up Appalachia community event was wastelanders. 
---
It’s supposed to be a fun community activity, not DLC.
---
Legendary Gifts. Going to any vendor, but especially around whitesprings or watoga, and finding some legendary items that you might make use of. Same with vendors having spare legendaries. Bought a Junkies Explosive gatling plasma for 300ish caps from a vendor back before they removed explosive from the energy weapon pools.
---
As I said before according to lore it's said that they are using the "radioactive energy" instead of a system where steam is heated, the most plausable thing I can see is that they are using the Photo effect ("german:fotoeffekt", can't be sure if it's translated right) in order to induce a current in metal by catching radiation with it, though as that effect only works with electromagnetic-waves only the gamma-radiation would be useable for it and in general the power out-put would be tiny, but it's the closest thing we probably got.
---
As to your statement that the plasma needs to be heated, that is true for reality in most prototype fusion reactors they heat it manually but also apply pressure, as that increases energy density as well and prevents the heated material from touching the hull, as we have no material which could withstand direct contact with a plasma heated enough for fusion for any length of time. 
---
I always thought that the fallout universe was utilising a kind of "cold fusion", as it is stated on some material, meaning they either found some kind of physical quirk of a material which can be used as fuel, or it's just one sci-fi device which could explain every difference in their technology but they don't go into specifics whether or not it's actually an entirely different kind of thing just named after fusion or literal cold-fusion.
---
Thanks! I'll do some events, I haven't tried any of them yet
---
Fallout 76 hoarder problems
---
that's the point, they add it anyway, so dont do it
---
Ps4?  I was there man, I was there.
---
NUKE IT
---
You got me interested... I've never purchased modules. Can you explain what they do and what's all the rage?
---
Lawl.
---
Yep, and its ridiculous. You should be able to get the contents from the bag after touching any part of it, Not just a pin hole you have to search for. Why Bethesda makes these dumb decisions I'll never know.
---
Yes, it is definitely the tesla rifle's fault.  I'm unsure why though.  I was in Uranium Fever last night and some dude was killing the mole miners with his tesla.  Everywhere an ash pile formed, the graphics would get super pixellated, kind of like the lighting or shadows were messing up in that area.  When standing in this same area my framerate would drop to single digits.
---
I've grenaded his trailer so many times
---
I’m having the same trouble, instead of bringing me back to my private server it opens a new one immediately.
---
Bro! I would have never known. Thank you!
---
☹🤢🤮
---
Happens to a lot of businesses. People start out doing something they love and because of that they make money doing it. Then they grow and grow until money men come in and optimize all the love out in the name of squeezing every tiny drop of profit they can out of the product. Hell, look at poor Famous Amos, doesn't even own the cookies with his name on them anymore. Money (greed) spoils everything.
---
It is not your fault, many people obviously cannot tell the difference either.
---
Cranberry Bog events 0.1% with Event: Census Violence 0.52% chance.
---
4 in a row IS random. You can have the same number repeat and it still be random. That's how random works. It doesn't mean every time is different, just random.
---
Yup, just watch out for the assaultrons
---
well i moved most of the good stuff before i had a crash. Every time i send stuff over i'm left with roughly 500/800 in my stash. I sell and trade stuff a lot. I like a nice quick sale so i ask for less than something is worth so it's not in my stash for long.
---
it only does the music and pop up, but doesn't actually work.
---
I'll take the grind over the bugs. Back when I got the game around the black Friday after it came out it was a complete pile of trash. 
---
Nothing more demoralizing than doing something like powering up Poseidon and getting immediately booted after powering on the fusion core generator. Even worse if you had no friends in the server and can't get back, say good bye to an hour of your life. Made me uninstall this game three times now I think.
---
I’m on track then. Right now I want the Captain Cosmos PA, anything after will be a bonus
---
Yeah, it was kinda posted in jest. I'd just rather the steel went towards my ammo grind than some freeloaders that are turning up, without lifting a finger!
---
Yes yes yes.
---
Damn that sucks. Well thanks for answering!
---
I did the Battle that Never Was.  I wonder why it was shelved.  Was a solo thing for me in beta, and it didn’t seem any buggier than anything else in the game.
---
Also sold or scraped a tattered field jacket because I thought it was junk...
---
RNG by design uses a seed. Of course this is the case.
---
This may be a stupid question but how do you check to see how much the community has donated?
---
to a point
---
Or better idea make the seasons continue so that people who didn't complete it will go through season one before moving onto season two. Just add to the board game rather than replace it.
---
Happened on xbox too.
---
6th through 10th on Beths site.
---
It’s fixed Carlton Mine as far as I can tell since I’ve seen posts saying people can’t enter but I can enter fine after that mini update.
---
I still think it's funny that people are upset about glitches in an MMO being patched out. You have no idea what a full server of camps with those exploits being used does to the server, and honestly I'd hazard a guess that it doesn't do any wonders for server stability, given the Gamebryo physics engine.
---
If you are on PC there is easy solution,  buy another copy (the game is so cheap these days), run two copies of the game, add friend of your other copy account name, then join their server and trade or drop items between characters.
---
If you're on console I don't think that will work unless you have another console.
---
I did this like a year ago and have 0 regrets
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Literally the definition of "out of the frying pan...".
---
F, my friend. 😢
---
5 studios worked on this but none of em was the fucking MMO dev XD
---
FYI, There is a second dlc coming in 2021. It’s called Murder on Eridanos. Really enjoyed the game so some new content is something I’m looking forward to [Source](https://www.windowscentral.com/second-dlc-pack-outer-worlds-murder-eridanos-xbox-series-x-optimized)
---
&gt;... has no bearing on the actual topic.
---
It's interesting that you say that considering this post was made to have a vent about how Bethesda never delivers, almost like thats the entire topic of conversation, actually. They ARE right. 
---
You buy a years worth of subscription for a essentially broken game that has been failing to deliver since launch, dont be surprised when they continue not to deliver, considering OP's post, it's not unreasonable to consider buying a years worth of subscription a mistake. If y'all want things like this to stop happening, you cant continue giving them  money, thats precisely why this continues to happen. Bethesda continuously fails time after time after time, and people still buy thier subscriptions, which is why they keep doing it, you're giving them a free pass, essentially saying youll still pay them if they dont actually do anything. It has nothing to do with "feeling better than others" dude, it's just about this game.
---
Golf balls also at fairgrounds.
---
I'm on PS4. I don't have any plan.
---
I agree if I do spin I'll only do 3 max, and if there isn't anything good I'll just wait until the next day. When I find something I like I'll spend all my scripts spinning
---
If only FO1ST was said to include this feature.. oh wait.
---
Thats the OP point, that it ISN'T pure RNG
---
Can't share one at the moment but it's the 3rd opening down from the gate house. Make sure the tent stairs are clipping through the pertrifed corspe thing on its knees.
---
I use a private server, and the Flarwood's Overseer Cache box in the church to transfer item and it works very consistently. However, I was at the end of a play session on a nuked public server and simply forgot to exit and then join a private server before trying to transfer the stuff.
---
flair checks out.
---
Some dumb cosmetic does not equal content.
---
Basically what do you consider lucky or good? I might right a full health build so Bloodied would be unlucky for me. I might not be a junkie so junkies would be unlucky. 
---
Basically due to different builds one man treasure could be trash for someone else so luck doesn't play a part as all gear in the games eyes is equal.
---
It does work if you’re crafting ammo, chems, armor, weapons...Basically anything that doesn’t require a legendary module
---
Is this today?
---
Modules are for the weapons and armor you buy with gold bullion. You use modules from the purveyor to craft the weapons at your camp.
---
If you're just looking for weapons/armor that aren't made with modules, the same concept applies.
---
Save up 1000 scrip, then find a server that drops your desired primary legendary effect.
---
Head to the purveyor on that server and roll for whatever you're looking for. Definitely will be more beneficial on discounted weekends
---
Yes I know that, was just wondering if it worked for legendary crafting too.
---
You can By Vault 94 mask 4 gold bullion with Riggs
---
Oof I cant even imagine 400.  But thanks for the input everyone
---
The game has a weird spawn mechanic that is being... manipulated (exploit is such a dirty word) 
---
You don't even need a tent. Someone can stand in a certain spot and force them to spawn at the very end hole in the wall
---
Really I think it's most of them showing their true colors. Really the last few months have been a massive wake up call for me. Gaming really has turned into a shit show and I'm not going to defend this shit anymore.
---
Agree
---
I am gonna try that. Thanks a lot!
---
along the creek between the workshop east of 76 and the wayside.
---
I miss the infinite weight glitch.
---
LOL, I read your first sentence as I’m not sure what super Duper...Carry-on, my bad
---
Activate VATs, turn it off, turn it back on again, fire!
---
they were a fascist shadow government before the war
---
I have gold bullion. Where do I use those?
---
Ta!
---
Running an online server constantly used a lot of power. Since most users dont use their server all day it makes sense to shut them down for the remaining time
---
I just want the mods that were promised at first too 😔
---
Imagine being able to watch a power struggle between factions on your own server. Intercede where you felt obliged too even.
---
No worries dude.
---
yeah lol, if u confirming it with mouse, it sometimes bug out and it ll land like 1km away .Learnt my lesson , now im using only E during launch . That time everyone near that prime site put up the angry face
---
Also I may add. Its has to be their before the event even pops up on the map if you place it as the event comes up it won't work. So you have to leave your tent their forever if you plan on doing the event bugged
---
How is this game breaking? It's a visual effect and goes away eventually, right?
---
No, that nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal is just as likely as nocturnal, bloodied, furious, ghoul slayers.
---
It's because the AA also has a *magic* effect!
---
I’ll 2nd this.  If I find I’m getting certain drops on a server I’ll try my luck with purveyor.  Works out sometimes.   Majority of the time I’ll get the effect I’m looking for but wrong weapon or armor.
---
Well I guess I'll take a break form this game.... When a game is only frustration, it's not worth playing.
---
dont worry, last day of it, it ll just autocomplete itself . Bethesda is shining in this kind of bug
---
It does and you'll be able to use it however you want, not like FO76's "private server" which vanishes if you stay offline more than 5 minutes after leaving it.
---
If you take Ark as an exemple, they made the game buyable once (with paid dlc's but also some free ones), offered free official servers for people to play on or you could just play it offline in solo.
---
How are they making money? They work with companies that rent servers for their game and they get some royalities each time someone rent a server for their game specifically. You can use those servers however you want ... you're not limited to Bethesda's rules. You want XP x10000? You can do it. You want to add mods on your servers? You can do it. Obviously you can't sell cosmetics to people who can just mod their servers and get those cosmetics for free anyway. (winkwink creation club though most people donate to mod makers)
---
Bethesda decided to go down the cash shop + monthly fee road ... it's not necessarily a bad business model as long as the quality of what you offer is worth the monthly fee but it's just not the case, here.
---
I do it on a regular basis 4-5 times a day. You use private servers exclusively? Survival tent located in the same area on both characters? After you drop from one character you switch load in the next in the same spot as the last grab it your items? If so you shouldn't be disconnected from a server within 5sec. You will always be loaded into the same private world.  After you get it and the server happens to disconnect. You're good.
---
Vault 79 is the primary place that you can purchase items. Crater and Foundation also have vendors specified for gold bullion where you can purchase items such as farmable dirt tiles, weapons, etc.
---
Some of the items at Crater and Foundation are not accessible until your reputation is high enough with them.
---
Also jump in the air before locking your vats.
---
Triple click works most of the time 
---
Don’t be totally discouraged. Sometimes the vats are snappy and work ok
---
Fuck it's not just me then. I've tried it a few times with bottles of water and dropping items on floor to see if it's the same sever. Your right it's loading us onto a different sever. It's the only way I can manage my scrip limits through the week. Stock up on weekends and scrip throughout the week. I'm going be screwed.
---
Shottys are currently shit without vats
---
We’ll get the community rewards no matter what.
---
Go back to choking on that long fallout 1st dick
---
\*laughs in fireproof 3\*\*
---
They made a post about this. They are going to add them.
---
Has anyone managed to craft the backpack . I’ve claimed it but can’t seem to find it
---
Edit .. 
---
Nvm .. it’s a mod lol
---
I got lucky and found one up for sale. :)
---
So in your seemingly esteemed opinion nothing is wrong, this is fine and everyones opinion does not matter, because you deem it.
---
Again people are different, bothered by different things, why is only your viewpoint valid? 
---
Spoiler, it is not.
---
Gotcha, because all three of my characters luckily have a piece of magic armor (not planned, but a very happy accident) I've not paid enough attention to the effects on weapons.
---
I'll enjoy this bug 'til it's patched (if it ever is), only one of my characters actually has a shotgun build, so it's not like all my builds will have to be redone.
---
The explosive perks do work on explosive weapons, but bonus only applies to the explosive damage, not the full damage. So, explosive adds 20% damage and your perks add 60% of that 20%, so its not really that good of a bonus and the points are better spent elsewhere. It did indeed work better before they nerfed explosive back in the day.
---
Oh, ok
---
Having the same issue also with the Wayward in addition to the mine - I'm unable to enter either instance.
---
It's not just the main legendary effect, some servers are better than others for the number of stars too. I had a server recently that when I was crafting secret service armor, I think it was 8 out of 10 pieces were 3 star. I've had other servers where most of the pieces were 1 star, and no 3 star.
---
Thanks for proving my point. Have fun at the bottom of the chain.
---
Yeah I use that, private server, survival tent exactly as the same place, where the character spawn... etc...  ANd I never take more than 10 scds to relog
---
It's the first time I had this error, it's like if the server reseted when I left it (message was something like : unable to connect to this world)
---
Yeah gotta love getting Bloodied Bashing Damage Broadsiders
---
Digital art is often about access to it, which is often about context (when/where), and ends up being what you pay for. Most novelty is subsidised by early adopters. I'm sorry you feel bummed mang.
---
Please please listen, because I’ve explained half of this before and I’m tired of responding with the same info. So this is going to be it.
---
outside of a single metric on steam, we know nothing about the player count. Zero. In a marathon, runners come in waves. when those waves break off many slow down and many speed up which forms even smaller running packs. guessing an average on 2minutes of a marathon, your number would be wildly inaccurate. Which is why I’m not trying to using your logic, it’s a pen and paper guessing game. Maybe it will be close, but you also could be way off. There’s no way to confirm that. Dozens of companies use that logic and their algorithms end up tens of thousands of players off the actual number, which is why there is only one well-used algorithm for this math, and it can still be up to 40% off. Which is why i chose a line of logic that I can actually back.
---
I’m not establishing how many players exist in the game, I was establishing the most amount of rss one player would need to get. In order to do that I’m using actual numbers and establishing that as a base rather than throwing out a much more complicated number based on simplified multiplication.
---
What you’re trying to suggest has been tried by every company. There’s a reason the only one with analytics is steam and that’s because they have the actual data. There’s a reason when companies say “millions play everyday” ppl know that number is bs, despite them having metrics that show millions playing daily. 
---
My numbers are not representing the entire playerbase, they are representing a known minimum. Which we can use to establish a known conclusion, which is what I was doing. Your math has no way of telling us how much steel everyone needs to earn, but we can at least know the maximum. That is why I’m confused. You’ve continually argued my logic with no way of solving the original problem. and instead of finding a way to make better math you’re just arguing mine without any actual numbers of your own. And instead of acknowledging that the point you’re trying to make isn’t even related to my math, you’ve just continued tell me my math is wildly inaccurate, while you make up ways your math could work. It’s honestly just rude and a waste of time.
---
People leave their games running often, play with multiple accounts, companies have accounts running to stress-test bugs, the list goes on. You’re welcome to tell people whatever math you want, but the second you start making a best guess that’s all it is. A guess. So please stop looking to argue every chance you get when you’re not even using the same logic. It doesn’t do any good and it’s a waste of everyone’s time from a post that was meant to be helpful.
---
Literally every mmos end game is either spamming pvp or grinding raids or other end game content. MMO are all about the grind.
---
8 + 6 + 4 doesn’t equal 20.
---
I don’t think we should be trusting someone with complicated stuff if they can’t even do simple math

I played for 2 months before I was told about these sites
---
The mag size for all of the automatic rifles is kind of a joke. 21 shots in a full auto laser rifle? Come on! I don't wanna have to reload every 2 seconds. That's why I use the Thompson cuz atleast that has 62 rounds even if it does pretty mediocre damage
---
Ah, of course, makes sense. Thanks.
---
Black Sheepsquatch lives matter too
---
I can face tank it in power armour with out losing much hp but makes you jump and blinds you to where the corpse has gone flying off too.
---
20 was my random number I threw out there. Nice catch. I edited it.
---
Pretty sure I'm not alone in this but the higher I get in level the less I really care about caps.  I literally only use them at this point to fast travel, buy GB once a week, and occasionally to buy chems/ammo from low level players camps when I get close to cap limit.  I cant buy weapons or armor upgrades with caps cause the few items that would be an upgrade aren't sold for caps because of their rarity and value or they are made with modules and cannot be traded. Stop trying to horde caps and you will be happier my friend. =)
---
Now scrip I would like to see the cap raised on but I want that for everyone not just level brackets.  Especially with everyone burning modules like crazy trying to get their perfect rolls ;)
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random\_number\_generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation)
---
That's because it's not really random. Some sort of system is used to get as kinda random number, but if it has a specific source or trigger and includes a measurement of time or some other stable number, you could very well be accidentally triggering the repetition. If a server seed or identification number is used, then yes, it might indirectly lead to repetition.
---
Personally, I avoid spamming the buy button and just wait a small, random interval before making another purchase or crafting another SS piece, and for the most part I don't see any more duplicate effects than could be assigned by normal probability. Also, just in case, I click my way through the menu instead of spamming the enter key.
---
Please note that this is my opinion and entirely hypothetical. I have no more evidence for this than OP does.
---
Your stealth is mostly not affected by your team. I play stealth in a team and I can maintain my stealth generally just by hanging back a little. With high enough agility (I have 15 pts plus full unyielding and mutations so I'm usually around 36 or more) you can sneak through most anything as long as you stay out of artificial lights and keep your light on the PIP Boy off.
---
STOP. GIVING. THEM. MONEY.
---
Watch out for the ban hammer.
---
Nah. All the crying amuses me. Instead of doing the reasonable thing and NOT playing, you’d rather just play something you don’t like. Typical addictive personality. 
---
Comical.
---
Same thing for the bolt action pipe.
---
Well even if you just threw it out there it doesn’t take a genius to realize they don’t add up, you should’ve caught that because, once again, this is complicated game code shit that you’re dealing with
---

---
junk pile on the water. Flat beach. plenty of place for crops. Nice tranquil area. 
---
Or at charleston station. I had 3 of my mules there and as long as you don't build too close to the ruined building it doesn't stop the random encounter happening there. Easy to test. Slap down your module. Place a water purifier in the water. run across bridge and back if nothing happens then it effects the random spawn.
---
As a Responder I'm all for seeing them restarting and helping out in the forest region like they did in the past; I feel like all the BoS will do is start up a future war with Enclave as soon as they sniff out all that sweet tech. 76ers can literally handle any threat at this point in time so I see zero reasons why the wastelands needs BoS around when lack of enemies will just end with them making new ones.
---
Happened to me the other night. lost some good stuff. good luck with your ticket.
---
Good shits thanks for that info
---
Trout is right if you’re looking for the forest, but the savage divide also has some beautiful smaller rivers and great views/buildsites to make cool camps. 
---
Only suggest that area because the fast travel location is nicer than the forest. Both are beautiful locations though!
---
Holy fuck. Triggered boi.
---
didn't say i didn't like the game. never cried. are you projecting? 🤔
---
I never said my viewpoint was valid. You’re just sitting here with the viewpoint of “the system sucks” yet you continue to play said system.
---
I have to say, this was hilarious to watch and be a part of. It made for a very silly event that gave me a crazy amount of XP and an ability to pick up 1,000+ pounds of items. I ended up with 2500 steel, which I certainly can't keep (no FO1st for me) so I did the unspeakable and donated it for BoS.
---
I suspected it had to do with a tent based near the event, and other posts here seem to have confirmed that.
---
I was having real problems for a bit (PS4) so I deleted the game and reinstalled.  I hate to admit it, but it helped so much.  Ran smoother, less glitchy.  It's buggy again after this last update, so I may do it again.
---
Not saying that is the easiest or best fix.....
---
Yes. I have. How is this hard to believe? It's a multiplayer game.
---
I have a fix that worked for me. I left then rejoined analyzed the blood THEN put the T fuse in and I  was good.
---
Guess I’m going through a cruise ship’s worth of steel, making 5mm rounds for my mini-gun, because I’m not...competent enough to do otherwise? Depending on your main weapon, steel can be a valuable resource.
---
It could just be bad RNG luck. I had trouble getting them and my friends I play with were always getting more, but I do still get them without having completed the World Challenges. I also hate Stings and Things so I don't do it as often so that's probably part of it too.
---
You should receive an “overseer ticket” I believe is what it’s called. You can redeem those for perks you don’t own yet
---
When they shut down the servers I tried it again on one of the new servers and it worked
---
I get it. But in the end, who's the decision maker?
---
Put in a report with as much detail as possible and follow up on the other suggestion that it may be a limited visual glitch
---
Just tried to make a recording to submit a ticket... it works normally now.  IT JUST WORKS!
---
When you’re looking at your perk cards in the lobby, lower right hand corner of the screen should have what looks like raffle tickets and how many you have.
---
Oh yeah savage divide is a possibility, forgot about it somehow. Hmm
---
I know that, I’m rank 41 fully kitted out except frog legs, but when I got the duplicate perk I didn’t get another ticket
---
Hi there, I’ve been wanting to get this game and was convinced otherwise after reading OP’s post, but now that I’ve read yours... I don’t know what to do! Curse you and your sensible counterpoint.
---
I don’t think it’s the whole thing but as a story starter or primer it’s insane.
---
Go outside, start telling everyone to bring you junk because you are setting up a military base for &lt;insert whatever country you live in&gt;
---
I mean you bitch non stop about the game.  Look at your comment history. Complaint after complaint after complaint. Why play something that you appear to be not enjoying?
---
Same old 7 which I was excited for more since it would be one step closer to frog legs
---
I've been considering doing this, but out of curiosity will I have to rename all my stuff again?
---
What?  Whad I miss?
---
I got a ticket last night, so it’s working on Xbox. Actually if they messed with anything today it may be bugged
---
Never had a CAMP in the Forest, but if you just want water and a nice place, I've had for more than 500 hours my CAMP in the Savage divide, on the pond near Silo Alpha, overlooking the Yao Guai. It's a cool spot imo, I recently moved in a waterless area near the Whitespring and I'm really starting to miss the place.
---
[The last picture I took of the place before nuking it goodbye](https://i.imgur.com/UUNceSB.png). It also has a gorgeous view of the Mire and Bog, but I never took a good picture of it, I altered the colors of the only one I have.
---
Fuckin buzzkill dude. FFS.
---
That counter is manually updated by Bethesda.
---
The long shot you may have had may have been the still one. If you got a gold version then it will have been replaced with the animated one which you don’t get tickets for.
---
Oh, and so you know, OP, someone did do a spreadsheet, better part of a year ago. But they basically ignored what the sheet said and pushed on with the same assertion you have, despite their own collective evidence saying otherwise and their inability to reproduce what they claimed was a static effect. So... good luck.
---
Or a roll of toilet paper.
---
I'll have to give it a shot then, I'll let you know.
---
Edit: Still not working for me. Tried it on multiple worlds and fully restarted my game.
---
makers? Here I am after 6 months at level 53 not caring about s.c.o.r.e. and still having fun a couple hours a week. Strange hownthat works.
---
No ones forcing you to do anything. It's a game, not an obligation.
---
Oooooh, ok, thank you
---
Maybe for bullion?
---
Fractured steel will turn out to be a legendary colossal problem ;)
---
Yeah I just started using he triple click thing, I didn't know about it till today from this post. It will work for now but, it seems like this has been a problem for a long time. If it gets too annoying I'll go back to heavy but damn that shotty is fun to play with.
---
Seems to be almost completed despite so many here talking about how they won't participate.
---
quad ffr automatic gamma gun and drown them in rads you can do it in like 3 seconds for a full health guy
---
You win all the upvotes..... giggle.....
---
I didn’t know there were different variants to cards, I though the gold ones were just always the higher level ones (like frog legs, or goat legs) And I thought the red were lower level, like pharma pharma
---
Use Lake Reynolds/Lewisburg Station. There is a tent by the truck. Kill the Mirelurks, drop a random loot bag with something, place something you don't care to lose in the tent and switch characters. Do it a couple times in a row. 
---
If you load back in the loot bag will be there, you'll have dead Mirelurks and your stuff. If not it got changed within probably the last 45mins or bad luck with you isp.
---
So you are looking at me only when I am playing Junkie...  I've got my eye on you, no offense.
---
For me I just can’t seem to craft any furious, anti armor weapons. Get literally a metric fuck ton of exterminators, hunters, and instigating. For armor it’s troubleshooter, mutants, and chameleon I get...never a vanguard yet in about 50 tries. Not even a 1 Star.
---
How do you get that flag!
---
Yah, location there matters a lot. It’s packed with much more content and there’s a very fine line between its biome and the other uglier ones. You definitely have to be picky about where you set up shop. Those cliffs can make some crazy cool builds though!
---
Them responding and them actually taking action are two entirely different things. Will probably take them months for some sort of solution.
---
Agree, VATS and shotgun
---
I got mine on the 1st, (no pun intended), Maybe there is a delay in processing the order?
---
You are probably right.  
---
I asked the same question a few weeks ago, and repeated the answer I seemed to recall being given.  
---
As it turned out, I ended up raiding the vault the day after I asked, so was not able to verify the answer.
---
Considering they were the second most well armed faction I highly doubt it; only reason they lost their fight was due to them being the very last ones in the way. By the time the plague reached them the Scorched had converted pretty much every faction and every enemy in their path so the Responders were even more outnumbered than the BoS ever were.
---
being mutated with: egghead, empath, herd mentality, herbivore - will optimize your use of an building team with a fellow mutant while eating cranberry relish. If you are the team leader you can change the team to an event team right as you complete events to double the event xp, and then click it right back. Make sure you have the 3 different mutant perks and inspirational active. A full set of either unyeilding or vanguards will also provide INT therefore XP boost.
---
Like it doesn’t already happen?? Seriously who cares if they wear ghillie armor, I don’t
---
I've been in this camp. Don't know why this is so hard for you to believe. Kinda weird how much effort you're putting into something you're wrong about. 
---
Accept it. I've been in this exact camp and there's nothing you can do about it!
---
Chortle.....
---
Killing all the Nuked Glowing ones at the White Springs after someone ran a lap through the building. Everyone standing on the wall outside to mow them all down. Then someone leaves and rejoins to make everything respawn and do it again. Over and over and over. Tons of legendaries. Nothing to do with 93% of them.
---
Same. I'll go one further and state that I dropped loot during Radiation Rumble (got cornered by some ghouls because while everyone else was herp a derping at them I was healing the NPC's with friendly fire). Watched a rat fink scoop it up while I was running back.
---
That said, it rarely happens and is probably a bug, because usually I have no problem with loot dropping during events. Less than 1 in 10. To be safe, I generally check any bags I find for nondrop loot (like a weapon, because I scrap them post-event) before even considering taking a baggie.
---
I remember going to check the trash can next to the flatwoods stash box every time I'd log in to check and see what stuff people had dropped there. I'd take some shotgun ammo and drop some 5.56 or 45 because I had no use for them yet.
---
I also remember server hopping the watoga vendor bot for handmade plans before the vendor inventory patch, and farming patrol duty for them, not getting them for 3 months anyway because of bad luck.
---
Except that's are actually storing data, stackables don't take up any more space if it's one or a million. That's why players able to produce millions of ammo, colas, flux, ect with no hit to performance.
---
flattered that you care so much that you looked at my history 🥰 
---
a.) this isn't even the sub i comment on the most...but you looked at my history so you already knew that.
---
b.) you do understand that an upvote isn't a comment, right? 
---
c.) i'm free to like, up/downvote, complain, block as much as i'd like and i couldn't care less about your approval, as you didn't birth me, marry me, or pay my bills. run along, mary. i've got my life to live without this gnat flying around my head.
---
That doesn't make it a good thing
---
Turrets will sometimes be there and sometimes not. Sometimes only some will be there. It's always nice when the turrets don't spawn in.
---
Where can we see how far along the community is? And im guessing by saying community you mean collectively across all platforms? Or is tbis for each platform?
---
Yeah, Steel I have no problem giving up but... I've been playing for 3-4 months now and only have 500 concrete in my Stash... and I'm not giving it up. The banner sucks so no loss for me if it fails.
---
Sorry if it sounds greedy but concrete is just a pain to farm in this game :/
---
That's what I said, the costume and the head
---
Also remember selling several bloodied guns because low health seemed too hard. Lol
---
Agreeded
---
I felt the same way about the Captain Cosmos costume, thankfully I had already refunded that one long ago.
---
Talk about dramatic. YIKES.  Keep your emotional baggage to yourself. Lawd.
---
If Bethesda is not going to up the daily limit on legendary script they should at least have one day a month or even one a week that is either unlimited script or bump it up to twice as much. Preferably they do a random day of the week that’s twice the script.
---
I feel like making it available with bullion would be a little too easy, say you want a 10mm smg plan, you can just go grab one from Regs and bam you're done, the random aspect of it would balance the overpowered-ness of being able to craft 30 1-3* legendary handmades as soon as you get enough bullion, where as it being a random plan you can get a specific plan quickly or dump 10'000 scrip trying to get that same plan.
---
Have you tried joining the responders?
---
Aye, I've been having a lot of fun trying different weapons out! At the moment the favourite is my Vampire Gauss Shotgun. Invincible, Oooft! Double-Barrels are absolutely ridiculous too. HaHa!
---
No. Why would the send forward 1 person, through a wasteland they don’t know much about, and risk them dying for no new information learned? Plus, I doubt they want to be wandering across America for long, they’re probably trying to get here as quick as possible. And for all they know, there’s no communication equipment at atlas, so they would have no way of contacting the scout
---
yeah, the fire breathers
---
I remember thinking that too, and when I finally completed a silo for the first time by myself I said I’m never doing that again fuck that why would anyone want to do that? Lmao jokes on me because I do it like twice a day now. Basically what I’m saying is you’ll get the hang of it, it’s really not hard it’s just new to you right now but soon you’ll be laughing at those robots. Stealth with any weapon is the best and easiest way to do it. Most times I don’t even get detected. If you’re not going stealth, use power armor and loads of pulse and plasma grenades and you’ll get em bro good luck to you
---
Dang. I wish I could help you out
---
Repeating it in capitals doesnt make it true.  They are NOT right.  But carry on feeling superior.
---
Yeah I fucking hate the raider aesthetic...fucking ruined something that could have been awesome.
---
This sounds more on you
---
Guess you all wouldn't have killed any scorched during last years Operation Clean Appalachia.
---
oh yeah. absolute legit. 100%
---
Hah, I didn't even think about the PIP Boy light. That may be another challenge. I play on a projector that is unfortunately a little dark - so I am always turning that light on. I'm hoping to upgrade the projector soon, but until then, I'll have to figure something out.
---
I am on the same page with you on caps except I am still saving for the serum plans. On the scrip side I understand and wish it were like that but I find it unlikely. Thats why I say this proposal is a compromize. But if that were to happen we can agree that everyone would be happy.
---
... By your claim. it's 1/40 chance of being on the same server. If you're like me and wander to people's camps for fun, odds are being on the same server means you'll see it. I've literally read one of these posts, logged on, and landed on the same server I had just read about to see the camp. Even had a chat with them about it.
---
All that aside, that also assumed a 10% player activity. Depending on the time of day both people are live, numbers may be much lower. Also, assuming they don't have any kind of division based on region. I know that at 2am local time during the week, I tend to cycle between 3-5 servers if I server hop.
---
Long odds, sure, but hardly in the realm of impossibility.
---
Maybe try the hessian bag near the door at Whitesprings train station, I will give a go today. This transfer system is the only reason I got FO1st.
---
Not even i didnt realize they messed with the building mechanics why cant they just leave it alone im not the only one mad they changed how it works....
---
Try entering and exiting Photomode before your next attempt to exit Power Armor when stuck inside of it. 
---
Don’t ask, but do tell.
---
Kinda empty and spooky. Way different vibe. Very lonely but peaceful.
---
If I were to consider buying anything from them, I'd first make sure that they aren't selling multiples of the same item.  If they are, it is probably duped.
---
What were they thinking?
---
I love the Arthurian style story here. Hope you feel the same
---
If you're on PC don't bother. No matter how good your gear is and how experienced and skilled you are, you're going to get rekt by some hacked weapons.
---
We've almost met the steel goal, and I don't know how. I've noticed a huge drop in the amount of players over the last 3 days. Pretty sure it would complete whether we donate or not.
---
Any updates about the broken Inoculation quest? Players can't continue the base main questline and the Vault 79 questline without it.
---
Yay, so glad it worked out! I'm going to test some stuff in a workshop first before I dismantle me 'legacy' camp 😄
---
It’s the quakecon free thing along with the outfit
---
Just did it. You just had bad luck my friend.
---
What gun is that? Looks very cool
---
Been looking for months. but, you cannot buy it from the bunker after patch a million ago. Both variants (not the vault 94 variant) and the traveling leather coat have a 0.02% chance to drop from events in the savage divide. GL!
---
I had a friend place one down for me. I didn’t know that the factory was a exploit and I haven’t used it yet. Will I get my account banned and how do I get rid of it to avoid any trouble?
---
They'll be back. So many dupers raged quit after the ban wave only to be back a few days later on new accounts.
---
sure jan. i know i welcome unsolicited life advice from a guy who misspells tough and apparently is as "tuff" as tonka.
---
That's not the same mask.
---
Where are they?
---
I mean talking the #&amp;(8 storm that got kicked off in your stride
---
Thanks! I missed it before. Btw, I’m “nondenominational” sooooo yeah....
---
Public Teams has also made this possible. If you join a team, drop your stuff somewhere, alt-ctrl-del out of the game, restart, you’ll still be in your team to rejoin as a different character. Definitely riskier than having a dedicated friend as a tether or a private server, but just another means of reconnecting to the same instance. 
---
I did this as I wanted to buy some bear arms plans but my main didn’t have enough caps but my mule did, so force quit, rejoined the same team (or I was kept in the same team) with my mule to buy it.
---
That is complete and utter bullshit :D I love it when idiots spread this hearsay :D I have over 2000 hours on this game i have NEVER witnessed anything even close to servers prefering to roll certain prefixes. It is pure RNG.
---
EDIT: There was even this one poster early on in the game that recorded every single drop. Where he got it, what were the type etc etc.. His record had thousands of item drops. While doing it for other reasons he also made it absolutely clear it was total RNG. As far as computer generated random number generators go (not perfect).
---
Mary. Jan. You crack me up lol. Keep em coming. 
---
YIKES.
---
Once I unlocked public events I just do those till 20-30s. Then do some story stuff.
---
Atomic shop is down for me. Anyone else?
---
August 6-10
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5oAkzAstTzqx0O5AMVVNNs/atomic-shop-weekly-update-august-4-august-11
---
I definitely think the chance to get certain effects isnt the same for all of the effects
---
Any events I should look out for?
---
There's sometimes a delay. I'd wait 48 hours. If you don't get them, submit a ticket to Bethesda.
---
I haven't received mine, either
---
The backpack and outfit are actually pretty nice. The shiny eyes on the backpack need to be applied to the baby mothman pack too.
---
My favorite things about 76 are the parts that aren't a typical MMO.
---
Maybe talk to Grafton mayor. My level 39 character haven't met the overseer yet
---
I wish I knew about scrip limitations. I maxed out my personal balance of scrip only to burn thru it all for 10x 3 star legendaries. Now, I have no where else store these until the vendor resets its balance to refund all these items I don't want. 
---
It's like a bank that doesn't have enough cash on hand to cover its customer's withdrawals. Like I just gave the guy 1000 scrip so it's got the money supply for me to recover my 400 scrip.
---
I heard the pqckage drops were the same as the Xmas gifts. "Cool," I thought, "Maybe I can get some of the Primes I'm missing."
---
9.5k steel later...
---
No. I recieved 0 Prime recievers, 1 T-45 plan, and a few hundred pounds stimpacks and booze. I'll probably drop some resources on my alts if my stash gets too full, but sure as hell not going out of my way.
---
He is just trolling for the sake of it.  You can cancel and it will end after that month is up, even with yearly.  OP also apparently doesn't realize it or is looking for sympathy.
---
Just happen to me. It was working fine yesterday.
---
I just tried this before reading this no problem at all. Hope it doesnt start becoming an issue
---
I understand what you are trying to do. 
---
All I am telling you is your assumptions are wildly flawed. To say only the people currently logged in represent the entire daily player count is just about as inaccurate as you can get. 
---
I’m sorry if you take that feedback personally. It’s not meant to be.
---
You can find NukaCran in some specific places (google it, someone did a photo guide), but really, it's a big time burner for a small XP boost. Best thing you can do is make some Cranberry Relish (or cobbler if you dont have the relish recipie), eat some Brain Fungus soup to boost Int (which boosts XP gain), have a nap, open a lunchbox if you got one, and then go out there and murder stuff.
---
I tend to kill Sentries and Assaultrons at Whitesprings, super mutants and floaters outside westtek and other high level locations (always outside, entering can be problematic for me as I am a sniper), and ghouls anywhere high level. The bots and muties are good XP, and ghouls are modest XP but easy and plentiful. I am nearly level 500 and can get most of a repeatable per run without the lunchbox. I was getting two per cycle during the double XP weekend, got more than 50 levels during that event.
---
Just be sure to go to the higher level areas. Lower level mobs, and lower level events, give much less XP.
---
There was a valid reason for it. That said they still need to introduce new walls that allow us to legally make our camps 
---
In fact it would be great if there was a big camp update.
---
Spam the button that switches from 1st to 3rd person view. Just spam back and forth a bunch of times then try to exit. It just works
---
Hold on... We have another 2000 hour expert here!?
---
Wish there was aliens on that
---
It's not that simple, especially in a game where you can't communicate
---
What about if its duped ?
---
Scroll down to FO76 Rules, open #9 (No witch Hunting), use link.
---
&gt;Guess you all wouldn't have killed any scorched during last years Operation Clean Appalachia.
---
Well playing murder hobo was fun, giving loot away isn't.
---
some people got smarts, but i got the other thing
---
uh, what's it called... oh, yeah!
---
PUNCHING.
---
We need interior walls bad.
---
Yep, the Beelzebilly suit is also live.
---
Ash!
---
Awesome! Thank you for this :)
---
I doubt that will be fixed. Bethesda is invested in not having flying bases. The build mechanic rules as they are supposed to work require every floor section to be connected to a foundation. Floating walls bypasses this.
---
It was this day that space zombie rose from their undead crater to bring wratch upon the living and dead alike. All hail one puuuuuuuuuuuuunch
---
Every rifle that has moddable mags (and pistols for that matter) has the same mag schem- drum/extended mags are +50% capacity, hybrid are +25% capacity and +25% of their other effect. 
---
Stop trying to make the handmade even more OP. It was brought in to line with the other guns for a reason.
---
I'm newish to game also but line in the sand, manhunt, the food processing one,  scorch queen. I basically log in, join an intelligence or event team, then just hop from event to event till i do all of the available ones. Then swap servers and do it again. Some are way to hard to solo or for low levels . So make sure others are near the event before joining.
---
Almost all weapons on eBay are duped lmao.
---
Yeah, I feel the same. It went from something interesting with great potential to I don't want to be there more than I have to.
---
A mystery it used to have was the upside down section of the space station with the closed door, I assume that's the buried section you refereed to.
---
It would be nice if we could evolve as a player base and try and be more constructive instead of publicly humiliating the devs at Bethesda. Be more positive in your approach and thank them for the good things. I understand the player frustrations and have experienced them since day one, but nothing good will come from hurling insults. We do appreciate the game and all of the hard work the team has put in. And players quit bitching about little stuff please. They’re doing the best they can with the resources they have.
---
I wanna play that game.
---
Blueprints are simply copies of a preset building arrangement. You can’t really store an existing building in a specific configuration to be moved/placed elsewhere. You would have to move your entire camp to do that.
---
Hey all, thanks for the reports and sorry your emote went AWOL! We have a fix for this that we're aiming to release with Patch 22.
---
As much as I dislike the frothing fury this sub becomes every time there is a problem, I gotta say, this is a bit much, mate. Don't get me wrong, glad you're enjoying the cosmetic, but still, it's a bit much.
---
Yeah i know i went on a bit of a tangent there.
---
Clearly it's just me but the space suit looks surprisingly sexy on the girl on the left...
---
Maybe a huge atomic shop sale also
---
It's genuinely pathetic like.
---
This is definitely something to try,  would you say it has to be the first drop you get or a certain amount of times a prefix drops?
---
It is clear that the devs don't. It is also clear that the dev don't listen to the community managers that do play.
---
I think a lot of the criticism for this event stems from the lackluster update, rather than the event itself. We were supposed to have a Wendigo boss to fight this update, supposed to be a tougher fight than the overgrown bat we currently have as the only boss in game. furthermore, some stuff that made people's lives easier were removed, like double sided walls and silo shortcuts while the only thing that was added was this event (which IS slightly disappointing in its own right) and adrenaline being fixed (which doesn't count since they broke it. Basically, if people are disappointed and the only thing they see that was added was this event? they are gonna complain about it, justified or not.
---
As for this event, there is some valid criticism for it. Every community event like this one relies on individual rewards as well as community rewards. Why should someone be motivated to donate 50k steel as opposed to 250 steel if they are not gonna get any new event rewards but still get community rewards regardless? Individual rewards are important even in community events. They also dropped the ball on rule 1 of themed events: give themed loot (not counting the community rewards). And the thing is, there is already plenty of stuff that could've been added: T-60 armor and mod plans (bec the BoS use T-60, so it would fit the event), BoS initiate paint (which got retired when the other BoS paintjobs were added to forgotten knowledge quest, which would've made perfect sense such an event, given the rank), there's other unreleased paints they could've added too, like BoS sentinel or militarized PA paints. They were not lacking for things that could've been added as individual rewards, so why weren't they? They obviously modified the loot pool since mounted plans aren't there either, so why was noting themed added?
---
This event certainly doesn't deserve the amount of criticism it has gotten, but there is validity in some of the complaints. Also this isn't gonna be only steel for the whole event, next up is concrete and cork, both of which even long term players do not have that big a stash of.
---
I couldn't agree more, I've never liked the raiders' style.
---
I would be interested to see your farming route.  I don't really have a lot of problems with anything as my build can normally one-shot most enemies that aren't extremely high HP like Fog Crawlers and Behemoths.

 &gt; Hey all, thanks for the reports and sorry your emote went AWOL! We have a fix for this that we're aiming to release with Patch 22.
---
You know, I have no idea.  I only very recently started renaming things.  Sorry.
---
The limits just stop me from playing long bursts its kinda annoying, i dont mind lugging 462 treasury notes 24/7 but id like to be able to cash more in at once
---
I went to Atlas to see what's happening. Don' plan on donating my precious scrap.
---
you get prompted for the dest language in that options window when starting the tool after first install. have a look at the screenshots here:[https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5)
---
aaand YES; i got it working =)
---
You still had to craft ammo at a time when Fallout 1st didn't exist. So you still gave away loot indirectly for no individual rewards.
---
This is why I eventually broke down and bought a 2nd account for cheap. Makes transferring and mulling 100x easier and less risky.
---
its handmade rifle  [Scabber paint](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scabber_paint) , it was in raider bundle or scabber bundle something like that, 1200atoms
---
Regardless it is a scout mask
---
sorry no :-/
---
Hey /u/KATheHuman, yes we're investigating the issue with Ounce of Prevention. It seems it isn't consistently blocking progress for everyone who tries, but we are tracking towards resolving this one. It's another we want to address as soon as we can once a fix is ready to go. 
---
Will let you know if I hear any updates on that.
---
Yeah...I ran into this on Xbox a couple hours ago.  Luckily I just lost some spare plans on an alt, but definitely was spawning a new server each time I logged out.
---
Agreed. There are plenty of games in my backlog to play. Put FO76 down and unsubscribed after SCORE came out as it started feeling like a CHORE. I'm glad people are still having fun with it, but it isn't for me anymore.
---
Well if you’re on PS4 and willing to trust someone I’d be willing to help you out by farming on your server to keep it active while you transfer equipment, I’d even promise not to go near where you’re dropping items to transfer. I know trusting a stranger is a risky process but I honestly don’t care enough about this game to fuck someone over for gear I can find myself.
---
Hi all, 
---
Wanted to thank you for your reports and let you know that we resolved this one in a [hotfix earlier today](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422529/). You should be able to continue with Cheating Death now!
---
Not worth paying real money for the possibility of getting banned imo. Not sure how strict they are being but I know people have been banned for having duped items.
---
The atoms usually take 1-2 days after renewal to show in your account.

---
76? It used to give 20.
---
Same here pal, took a few months off the game and the game ran fine before the recent patch. I come back on the game the last few days and the game runs like utter shite. Constant fps drops. All the time. No matter where I am. This game is a joke, so poorly optimised.
---
Put different colored marbles on a pouch. Put you hand in and take a handful. Sometimes you get more blue ones, sometimes you get more red ones. It's RNG.
---
Yes - full set of Troubleshooters armor so you're very hard to kill, and a couple of Troubleshooters weapons so they are easier to kill. Easy!
---
Oh and remember you don't have to repair the reactor!
---
Feed the people is a good one. Rewards nice XP but also canned stew, which when consumed gives you a 5% xp bonus for an hour. Combine that with always being well rested (sleep until it says you are well rested) and thats an additional 10% xp to help you levelling.
---
Rewards are random.  You're probably gonna have to grind for a while.

Yeah, I did a fair few of her radiant quests before bringing in another ally
---
Alright
---
I don't think 7,600 would be a just reward but at least it would make sense
---
So far, the BOS rewards I've received are practically the same as the ones from doing the tadpole athletics mission at sunnyski slopes down the hill. I might as well do those because I can at least get paid in caps for the time spent.
---
Well, that’s marginally better, but still just a sliver compared to 7600 hours of gametime
---
Received what?
---
Legit I've had nothing for an entire week. Zero plans for anything.
---
I get what your saying, should have made it more apparent in my post that I used to make a lot of custom content for games and I really appreciate some of the items they sell in the atom shop and the design of cryptids.
---
If it wasn't for Bad RNG Luck, I'd have no RNG luck at all ;)
---
I don't buy it...
---
I've gotten 10 items from mumbles and it was either mutants / Instigating...
---
Couple legendaries at Whitesprings - mutants / Instigating.
---
I call bullshit on there not being certain prefixes available on certain servers / times /etc
---
Thanks for the heads up! Didn’t realise they were live.
---
It doesn’t even have to be 760, or 7600. It could just be an amount such as 1500, 2000 etc.
---
https://youtu.be/aiysKaxVYEs
---
I'd say give it 3-5 legendary enemies drops and if you're not seeing the prefix you want, or stuff like multiple "zealots, etc" keeps popping up, then hop servers.
---
Of course.
---
Unfortunatly I'm on PC, where i think that strangers can even less be trusted.... But seriously, the problem comes from the fact that we have to do that... Especially in a game where loots are total RNG, you have to have the possibility to safely transfer your stuff from a character to another...
---
Just compare to a game like diablo, where the loots are class specific, you still have a shared stash... I mean, most other MMO got one... I just don't understand, especially when the technology is allready allmost completly coded with the display cases.
---
Don't say that, they will turn the daily limits into the weekly ones and we'll be stuck with 150 scrip per week!
---
only 6500 hours to go...
---
That's where I left mine.
---
That’s a lot of commitment for little reward. Should’ve done a limited edition camp item or outfit plus some atoms. 760 can be spent on 1 atomic shop item.
---
I was very pissed about the magazine nerf when wastelanders dropped. Here’s hopping they correct their mistake by reverting it.
---
Well, guess I'll find out! Thanks anyway
---
Oh sweet!  Thanks for sharing, good to hear there's even more coming!
---
Keep the maximum limits to the currencies, but remove the daily limits all together. The RNG in this game is so terrible that it wouldn't make a difference. I have played a sickening amount of this game, and I am still trying to get a good legendary - it's maddening. It may actually stop people from duping so much. I, personally would enjoy the game a lot more if I wasn't at the daily limit on all my characters within the first 10 mins of logging. A couple hours later and none of my stash boxes have room for the scrip fodder I've gained. It's not even worth selling to other players. I want to play more but I can't, unless I wan't to be over-encumbered for the rest of my session.
---
Woah now Bethesda isn't EA... they'll just make you buy $9.99 worth of ATOMS for Scrap Kits.
---
You on PC?
---
Lmao no worries, it was insightful. Ty.
---
There’s other visual glitches. Party Boy (double/triple alcohol effectiveness) doesn’t change the “effects” screen when you drink, but your actual SPECIAL stats will update properly.
---
⚾️
---
I've said this before: Your point being? They also said that the ss armor limbs now have deep pocketed mods, yet they don't.
---
Personally, I really wish we had something like a collection book but we could store one of each item in it separate from our stash. If we have a rifle build we wanna try we don’t have to go trade for a good one we can take the black powder rifle we had stored in our collection book. At the very least a mat for it when we’re at our camp, so a 20lb minigun we want to mount isn’t taking up stash space and is just an item we have collected.
---
Thank goodness I haven’t reached my 7600 hours yet. I assume this is an account wide challenge?
---
Log back with the character who left them . Are they still gone ?
---
Lock up my camp because aholes come in and take ammo water and resources.
---
I'll just be dumping the 1000s of glass I have accumulated over the past week or two, collecting beer bottles like a methed-up hobo. But after dumping some steel and getting tons of shite, no more.
---
And if we're good and sacrifice enough junk, we'll get a fancy hat that I won't even wear. Yay...
---
This "event" generated less excitement than a dog with the runs.
---
Ah the silence of the devs.
---
Deafening.
---
Nah xbox why?
---
This is interesting.  Its odd though, in my experience it isnt server  specific but every once in a while I'll be hopping west tek and get bloodied after bloodied after bloodied that particular day
---
I play with a group. Of about 6 or 7 different people,  I am constantly competing for last to spawn in. I have been up to 20sec after the guy in our group who loads in first. This makes the game so unfair.
---
The biggest, nastiest challenge to a proper melee build?
---
Server lag. 
---
So many “hit so that don’t actually hurt the enemy... it’s painful!
---
I donated the minimum (250) because I wanted to see what it was like.   I dropped my rewards on the ground.   If they can't even include one new plan for experienced players, that's all I'm up for doing.   I'm fine with nearly all of it being geared for new players, but not 100 percent.    I'll donate the minimum of each material, but that's it.  The community rewards aren't worth the materials being donated.
---
Got a 'Leave the server in 5 minutes, new worlds will be created' message after playing on my private for about 30 minutes a few hours ago, which is quite uncommon - maybe they fixed an issue with private worlds. Been stable since and I could rejoin the world several times.
---
There is no such thing as "random" in computer terms... something is coming up with the numbers, and there may be a quirk in the method/math that favours some servers over others, and I'm pretty sure at least one variable is time-based.
---
Things I know for sure:
---
\- When crafting items with Legendary Modules, if you do it too quickly, you will roll numerous of the item with the same top-level prefix. 
---
\- Some servers (likely fresh ones) have a lot of legendaries, other servers (likely after having been online for a while) have considerably less. If legendaries aren't completely randomly assigned, then it's likely that the drops aren't either.
---
I doubt there is a single sequential "drop list", but there might be a formula that creates a "random" drop list upon server launch, and/or a list that is accessed "randomly" based on time of drop/craft/purchase, and there may be some bias on rarity of specific weapons/stats, even flagging items already dropped so they never drop more than once on the same server.
---
Odd that they name it "Beelzebilly Head"
---
Interns getting lazy again!
---
Piercing mag drops ammo capacity to 10. 
---
Justify that you apologetic fool.
---
I’ve felt that the game needs a small combined stash too, almost a year ago I suggested that there should be ‘safety deposit boxes’ available at the whitespring that can hold up to 20lbs that can be accessed by all your characters. I think 20lbs would be a good limit so people don’t just use it as extra storage. Boarderlands 2 had that bank that you could access which was pretty sweet.
---
Some of us like our projects bungled, thankyouveddymuch
---
That one is a known bug.
---
I'm also on PS4 
---
I see Sutton may be the spot people want. Or around Vault 76. 
---
My spot over by the Whitespring pond is pretty clutch with its flat ground and manicured lawns, but I'll move. 
---
Being right next to the Enclave would be a problem, but honestly, if any other faction aligns with Vault Tec it's totally them 
---
I have an impossible to do now round walls camp, but I have another design I have been pitching to try. No problem
---
Bethesda had a stroke.
---
It’s been mentioned on many threads here today. Hopefully they’ll get a hot fix for it.
---
I sell for 10% of default, moved fairly quickly until the Xmas Gift dupery.
---
Yes it is
---
Walking to watoga for the handmade plans as lvl 7 or something
---
I'm not sure why they would tie the RNG system to server seeds. What would they gain by this? Or why would this be more functional from a technical viewpoint? I just don't see it.
---
Secondly, RNG is just random. And random means that every item in its range has the same chance to spawn every time. Every time. You could get a thousand bloodied items in a row. Or non at all for a week. And not getting bloodied items for a week doesn't increase its chance to spawn. The chance always stays the same.
---
But...who knows. If you like making a spreadsheet, then why not? There's nothing to lose, only to benefit.
---
It literally is. One of the worst games I’ve played when it comes to optimisation.
---
I've not been able to get through the second door in photomode the last few times I tried. I assumed it had been patched. Good to know it's just me sucking at it. No issues with the first door.
---
Yup they fucked up putting those mods in. 
---
I’ve been waiting for them too. Oh well, waiting a little longer isn’t going to make the game unplayable for me.
---
I’m just sorry that I’m able to call out their mistakes and fuck ups without getting buttsore and angry.
---
I dunno just weird that way. I mean it’s a game and entertainment so I should be madder shouldn’t I?
---
What’s your point? I mean is all your *whatever* doing any good for you? Is it making things happen faster?
---
Oh dear young boy, sit and let ol' pappy tell you a story lol
---
Seriously though, there was a point where if you had a punch bowl in your camp and someone activated it , they would consume, not take, **consume** a random item from your stash, which included Legendary items.  Also, because they consumed, they weren't just gone from your stash, but gone from existence lol
---
Well I haven’t found a single piece of data in a month ever since I dropped it off and haven’t found any since then. Every time I post about it ppl act like I’m dumb and don’t know where to find it. But I use to have loads of it and just sell it to vendors because I would already do the daily for that day
---
That is just the game. My life bar just drops for no reason occasionally. It has been doing that for years. I just assumed it was Bethesda's way of trying to get Bloody Builds from running with really low health?
---
This is the key piece of information. Thanks.
---
They patched the double sided wallpaper glitch so i guess it's time i delete the game
---
Works, thank you
---
Are you getting the random constant fps drops too? Me and all my buddies who play this game since launch have never seen it this bad since launch. I have had to drop all my settings so the game is playable and I have a relatively good pc. It’s a joke!
---
Every time I log back in it tells me to put the fuse in. And every time the option to analyse isn't there.
---
As cool as that would be I don't see Raiders taking the time to restore a space station, The Brotherhood or Enclave probably but not Raiders.
---
Just shove your face in the corner. I use the left side, but I have never tried the right side so I don't know.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
T60 could have damage reduction against ghouls/mutants
---
I love FO76 for the most part but I played the heck out of it this spring during Covid lock down.
---
Once they get some new stuff to do I'll be back. I'm just not interested in the run or donating my scrap.
---
I've been waiting forever for a new boss battle and legendary perks. 
---
Just time to crush some psychos in BL3
---
I don't think its anything to gain for the servers per say  but I feel maybe there was a few selected primary legendary prefix rolls PER server... Wither this was intended for people to jump online with certain friends that announce "hey guys hop online and play with me! I just had 5 bloodied weapons drop during my session!"... Although that would be a different investigation. I dunno if the rolls are the same for everyone PER server or based on the player.
---
I play beth games since 2003 and I even had played tes online before open beta so i kinda know this game studio and how they care about players and they actually do. As i see the main feature of this reddit community must be "lets complain about everything they do no matter what they do". Still i ve never seen so many bugs within one project and half of them are pure fun so I blame them for not being able to release a well tested content but I will play it as long as I want. I hope they will add some new playable stuff as new events and some hardcore stuff for survival mode.
---
I've got a full bloody sniper build and gear set, with bloodied gauss and hunting snipers, and I can't one shot Crawlers or Behemoths either. Takes me three to kill a behemoth or mirelurk queen, two for crawlers, double those numbers if I lose stealth. Scorchbeasts still piss me off. My route also takes advantage of my SS Jetpack. It could still be done without, but whitesprings would be a much bigger pain in the ass.
---
Anyhow, here is my route:
---
* Whitesprings main entrance. I hop on top of the building and run around popping any sentry or assaultron I can see. I also pop the ghouls near the back entrance, often hopping down to the adjoining laundry building roof to check the spawn point to see if there is something juicy like a deathclaw.
---
* West Tek exterior (if no other dots nearby): Kill the floaters under the big satellite dish too.
---
* General's Steakhouse: Muties, Floaters, and whatever happens to be out back when I arrive. I tend to hop onto the room, drop into the big ceiling hole to pop muties, go back up, and snipe the back garden and floaters.
---
* Run over to RobCo Research, for the Sentry and robots up front.
---
* Mac's Farm for the Queen hiding in the bog, gotta drop into the water to trigger her.
---
* Pylon V-13 to kill whatever spawns there, usually something worthwhile, check Bog Town and cap the workshop if it's available and not too much trouble (I have caps to spare just now, I'll skip this if I am poorer)
---
* *I used to go into Bog Town proper and kill the muties there, but it became hassle enough as a sniper that I give it a skip now.*
---
* Flooded Trainyard for the almost inevitable Snallygasters. With the jetpack, you can run forward and hop onto that street sign crossbeam above the truck trailer, then snipe most of the yard from there.
---
* Home to empty bags and swap servers.
---
* When doing this, whenever I check the map for the next location, I also check for Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand, and approach if anyone else is there to do it.
---
When I do a full route, I often can get most of a level/trigger the repeatable at least once, if not twice, so long as I have the XP boosts going. Sometimes I skip some steps when I am lazy, or will just log off where I am for a server hop rather than returning home.
---
I did have a camera on me... I even said so in the post 🤔
---
Yeah, but it started at Whitespring's main building and I walked over to the train station and tried to fast travel several times before I took the video.
---
Keep hoping the brotherhood update will bring some for of pvp back.  My Quad ffr fr gamma needs to play a bit.
---
Doesn't seem like rng when one day I get 50 bloodieds and the next day I get none. That is statistically improbable
---
Originally this game was a survival-lite game. Limits are a big part of that type of game. 
---
They’re moving away from it, but now  free scrap storage is part of FO1st so we won’t see that change, and for armor and weapons, yeah, server stability.
---
The reload animation is great, especially with quad.
---
That'd be great, especially if they added weapons that don't otherwise have legendary (or randomized legendary) variants.
---
I could see a pa bonus that would make them better for certain situations like the excavator offers with mining, but I think PA need to stay where the are as far as combat goes. I’m not always a fan if it, but this is what Bethesda signed up for when they proposed a hybrid mmo-style game. If you can’t keep getting more powerful gear then the game slowly dies. And armor that’s easy to acquire/craft would fly in the face of that need. 
---
This would be good for future PA though. The game just needs constant progression to stay afloat.
---
Oh wow thanks! Didn’t check my 1st tab since it wasn’t in yesterday’s post
---
It doesn't seem pure RNG to me either.   Either the same prefix showing up much more often that you'd expect statistically or type of weapon:   "Here, have five revolvers."
---
I have a Bloodied war drum to trade for a rifle for all you melees out there.
---
See I had that message just before I tried transferring. On a different private world obviously. I've been playing on a public sever since so I might try again in a bit. I'll report back
---
I too was talking about the daily limits, not the maximum. And yes, the experience you are describing is pretty much what many of us go through a lot of the time.
---
I had to leave the server to get it to stop. It sucks when you are playing on a team.
---
You earn 1 atom every 10 hours. Worth it.
---
I feel about them, the same that I feel about those who *buy* weapons on eBay..
---
😂😂
---
I don’t understand
---
Literally I've not found any where people say it spawns. I have to literally go searching every building for some and even then, it still doesn't matter
---
Yep, especially the fancy vaient
---
You can catch a disease in PA, but not score points!
---
You are clearly either lying or heavily exaggerating.
---
The post says they hope to release a solution in the next couple weeks, if I recall, but to be honest, even if I am not frothing angry whenever they screw up a time-frame, they do miss it them a lot.
---
I feel like everything comes in threes. Three exterminators rolls, 3 junkies rolls, etc
---
Definitely something to it in my 1300 hours played.
---
(Not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens)
---
Not unreasonable, again, not bagging on your enjoyment.
---
We were making ammo anyway. We were killing things anyway, the challenge gave us all a target.
---
I walked into a supermarket in rural France and met a guy I used to know from school.
---
I was walking around the in field at a race track in the Uk and met a guy who’s life I’d saved in Germany when I was in the army.
---
Don’t underestimate the odds of behind real life RNG
---
&gt;Works out sometimes
---
yea, as it's RNG
---
They are looking into and if we’re lucky they won’t be lazy and will make a double int wall element. That won’t be anytime soon most likely. 
---
They did have a good reason for removing the i double wall glitch though. It was being used to make infinite camp budgets, which was force crashing servers.
---
I’m very out of the loop, can someone explain what’s doing on with the camp in detail and not saying something vague about exploits players were doing?
---
Do contributions in private servers count toward the total ?
---
Thanks for your reports. It seems SCORE progress and rewards you earn while wearing Power Armor are getting queued up until you exit your PA. We have a fix for this in the works, and we're aiming to release it with our next patch.
---

 &gt;Thanks for your reports. It seems SCORE progress and rewards you earn while wearing Power Armor are getting queued up until you exit your PA....
---
No as far as i know its safe as long as you don't get disconnected. But even then, I believe there is a 5 minute grace period to get back in.
---
So we downvoting ppl for admitting there was a major exploit that was removed? 
---
Not like you were defending them even. Just that the exploit was causing problems for ppl.
---
They said way back when wastelanders dropped, that they were going to add more ways to get faction rep. Haven’t heard anything about it since.
---
I know this is old but just skimming through, limb damage definitley makes a bloody shotgun magic i can confirm this. My friend has a BE shotty i have a B/Limb and mine does exponentially more damage in vats and he has all perks on i have 1.
---
Cant wait to buy the double sided wallpaper walls in the atom shop for 500 atoms, thanks xoxoxo
---
The worst is when you go to hack the terminal and they aren't there then you walk in to the room and get demolished because they suddenly are. But as long as you use vats they are easy to take out as long as you're quick.
---
Don't worry, just don't look behind the curtain....
---
Cork.
---
I just keep dropping them around lowbies. Even the 3 stars. If they dont want it, they can turn it into scrip. Since I cant even scrap the damn things.
---
Also, I daily cap max in usually 1 hour. It's annoying.
---
I think that was just in relation to colossal problem but I may be wrong. Last thing I read sounded like they were saying they would just look into the possibility of adding a double int wall object like ppl suggested.
---
Don't listen to this person, this is a community dedicated to a game and as long as what your posting fits community guidelines you should feel no shame in posting it. I have seen more post from the last few days complaining about the update then what this user is calling "fluff" content so I'm not sure what they are on about. I'm not saying we shouldn't use this space to complain about changes we don't like to the game, we all love this game and want to see it reach it's true potential. But at the same time many enjoy sharing they're fun experiences in the game and just as many enjoy seeing how other experience and enjoy the game, So know one should be shamed for that here.
---
This exactly.
---
If it existed as a glitch why don’t you make that glitch a feature if everyone likes it
---
Its also glitchy on PC (can only access it if crosshairs/dot exactly on zipper, and not entire bag) which is making it hard for noobs to accept my liquid gifts.  Switched back to the paper bag :/
---
Know what, Now I'm made our bags wasn't the same colour.
---
THANK YOU!
---
lol. why u didnt remove it from sale? I support ur concern but if u know how it works u  r just a victim if ur own actions.
---
*cries in 7 months turning in all my tech data and not learning any after knight*
---
I am on PC. I dropped aluminium and legendary gear for scrip in Private server. It has worked for me.
---
Yes, it is still risky.
---
Really? whole 22 Patch just to fix Grognak emote icon? It's impossible to do with small hotfix?
---
That would be more work than just having it be random. You really think they put in more work than what was needed?
---
The problem is most people's definition of random is wrong. Most seem to think that every number in the string should be different and that's random. But it's not. True randomness means there will be patterns that form. You will see the same number consecutively.  That's how random works.
---
They eat shit. That's what I think of them.
---
appreciate it man. I feel bad for what I did earlier but I found someone who was selling serums for 200 each, I might have bought all I could to vendor them..
---
Yup! But when you say that there a lot of toxic people in the Reddit you get told that’s bullshit.
---
I’m fact I think it was a mistake to do this without a solution to offer. It was short sighted.
---
Shame and disappointment.  But seriously, I’m thinking armor...
---
Same.  The box is right on the zipper and its fucking tiny
---
imagine putting in two foundations next to each other, then a wall on each foundation along the seam between them.On each foundation you see the inside of wallband never see the outside of the other. Now, delete thens3c9ns foundation. The resulting "wall" is what a double-sided wall.
---
Walls inherit their orientations vertically, not horizontally. Hence, in order to create one, the player can work from either above or below. Since it's quite common for a floor or foundation to trigger as an item that can't be used, I prefer to work from the top. This requires placing a wall in either orientation), hanging a flat roof on it, adding a flat roof, and using the timing of flat roofs and the fact that a wall hanging down from a roof will fade inward by default, it was possible to hang two doorways so that the exteriors met and the interiors showed. Because doorways can float for some reason, the roof could be removed, and the walls could then be changed from doorways into any other option.
---
The floor method was similar, and worked the same way, but there are so many ways to accidentally bug out your floors and find yourself not being able to remove them, and so few times I've been told that I've been told that a roof can't be removed, that I prefer the roof method.
---
It's great, but I wish it had mods that made it amazing.
---
At least 80% of the decent weapons and armour sets in circulation are duped lol. Nobody has been banned for just possessing a duped weapon, almost sure I have some that I traded for....
---
Thank you kind sir! :)
---
1. What is a Legendary module?
---
Beat me to it...
---
Light combat armor perhaps?
---
My favorite place to live is the mire.
---
Just tried it again and now seems to be working. I only lost 150 random scrip trash. Sorry for your loss
---
They are not exclusive to Fo1st though which is the point non paying customers get those discounts.
---
worthless note you get from the Prize-Bot.
---
All along the river to the west has great spots.
---
Thanks I'll have a look
---
Totally--just last night I was dumping more plans from workshop events thinking why would I donate my stockpiles of scrap to a jerk poser in camo's for the same plans when I get PAID to get the same rewards from workshops.
---
I can see why it's alcohol rewards as Beth wants us drunk to take advantage. It's basically a scrap date rape.
---
It's all bad luck. I just got the T60 CPT plan today.
---
I assume those selling are very poor people, even sweatshop laborers, and those buying them are about 75-90% entitled d-bags. 99.5-99.999999% of all those weapons are duped.
---
It's frustrating how you can't even turn in the shit already in your inventory like. I swear if they don't give us the option to trade left over tech data for plans when the Brotherhood comes back I ain't gonna be happy
---
Exactly. So I use to find it on ghouls and everything. Every time I ran through whitesprings I would find 10 to 20 everyday. And I dropped last 15 off I finished quest and then had another 15 and it wouldn’t let me so I figured it was bugged. So I sold it and have not found any since. It’s so annoying
---
And like I said, I’m not defending them, but this was an ambitious project using an engine that wasn’t built for mmo-style gaming. I really don’t like Zenimax very much, but when the game first started, despite all the bugs on launch, Bethesda reallly did respond quickly and throw hotfixes out their ass to make sure the major issues were solved.
---
While the bugs are 100% their fault, I think redditors need to start noticing how the more we complain the less BGS communicates with us outside of official website posts.
---
Ok cool. Thanks for the response.
---
Join the Possum scouts and become REAL children.
---
18 hours in a week is time consuming to you? Good lord. There’s probably a reason why people on FO76 avoid you. Just plain stupidity.
---
Never know someone could be a comi spy😂
---
Ya but you can still make it a feature easily by adding double sided walls
---
Nope, I have the same problem and tried that but didn’t work, such bs
---
Well then it would be just as useful as the other special veriants
---
Sorry about the size of your nuts....
---
ahh crap, ones for pc. ehh either way it will help once I start getting legendaries, I more or less need to know chem prices, how much I should be selling plans for, stuff like that.
---
Yep, I did it solo just a few days ago for the first time ever. I did not know what to expect and thought I just had to punch in some codes I got from those ghoul officers. So I wasn't completely prepared and was glad I came across that tinker's table to craft some ammo. And I kept shooting the mainframe and thought, wow this is going to take a loooong time shooting it until its dead. But then I luckily found the prompt to destroy it by hand :) I died three times I think, all times by assaultron dominators. Man, they are something else. But it was worth it.
---
TL;DR: I'm not really good at the game, but I came through. I use modded leather and combat armor and a handmade and lever action rifle.
---
Fallout 76 is not for hoarders
---
What are you? New?
---
It doesn't matter what you call the patch. Those who are screaming boycotting and the likes will do so for any reason. Mind you the feedback is legitimate and important but this place doesn't know how to tone down the foot stomping. You can call it "a wee little patch" and people will say something like "mOrE lIkE a wEe LiTtLe PiSs eFf YoU bEtHeSdA!"
---
The correct way to fight duping is to get someone in who can rewrite most of their code around character saving, add unique IDs to high value items like legendaries, get them onto a more transactional data model, etc.
---
See had no issues for 100s of times before. Today no grace period
---
I can’t say how important it was as the exploit did sound serious and the game has crashed a lot recently. So it could be this was apart of it. I agree though that this was probably on their radar for awhile and a temp fix should have been made rather than hole in the gameplay.
---
There is a machine in glass cavern that if you put one in will reward you with a legendary item, up to 3 stars
---
Ah, yes Mojave express
---
I'm guessing using this service would also cost caps according to packages
---
J3325 in my opinion best roll for the magic effect
---
The more Animal Crossing like features the better. 
---
And killing.
---
even if you don't put down tents, you can stand in one spot and force all the spawns somewhere else, and mow them all down.  It's just a matter of being in line of sight or not of all the spawns except one, then popping out when they do spawn in the 1 available spot and killing them all.
---
Sorry mate went to bed Aussie time.
---
With super duper and getting lucky on mats dropping in the right order like a dozen or more? With a 2hr time limit you'd get more if you kept at it I only did one big lap. Upside of Morgantown was the Unstable flux is *everywhere* and of pretty much every type. One was rare there (cobalt? Can't remember now...) but thats the one that's easier to get in the bog during SBQ anyways.
---
Plus, the Responder event at the airport kicks off in the blast zone giving you waves of Max level scorched who also drop mats.
---
Since patch this has happened to me several times, private, locked server, no other NPCs battling each other.
---
I don’t really use Vats does that matter with this roll?
---
Never had an issue with Fast Travel till Patch 21, now I have to hit Fast Travel multiple times before I get the load screen.  (PS4)
---
It’s a major award!
---
the tears of communists
---
OK cool - I will try that. I have been trying the middle.
---
Uhh just make it a variation of the wall so you can keep the regular one you don’t have to change anything in the game just make the wall and added to the game
---
Thats definitively the best roll because it can't roll with explosive (It's innately explosive) and doesn't benefit from FFR.
---
The third star *might* be better for faster reload.
---
He isn't talking about being misled currently, from what you pulled up to reference.  He is talking about the cheaper yearly option and what was promised, which still hasn't happened.   Except Discounts as you stated,  but you only learn that if you delve deep with multiple accounts or Reddit.
---
Im on ps4 so there's not alot if not no hacked weapons but alot of legacies and a few nuka paddleballs
---
If I'm not mistaken the snowball barrel is silenced but I'm not sure on it
---
Defs- I don't use anything but the plain Collectron. He's also the least infuriating.
---
This. It's likely a bug based on their RNG method and server lag. You'll sometimes find 'golden' servers where you get great drops or vice versa and usually these servers are near their end of life and have been nuked multiple times. If they are using an RNG method that can get stuck because of a lagging server it would make sense that legendaries would start to repeat.
---
This is wonderful.  I'm a melee build with an instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet, so close quarters isn't something I normally worry about.  I'll probably pop in to West Tek for the sheer amount of Super Mutants in there, and hit the other satellite dish just north of it as well.
---
Thank you very much for taking to time to write and format that reply.  You've been an absolutely wonderful help, and a refreshing change of pace than I normally find asking for help on the internet.
---
They said it was needed to fix further performance issues or problems. They will probably just let us apply wallpaper to both sides of a wall, it's so simple as that, I am tired from having to see exageratted whines like this everyday on every damn gaming sub goddamn
---
I would definitely buy these items if they were available:  
---
\- Account shared stash  
---
\- Retalent kit
---
Until then I use a second account (PC).
---
Random be random
---
Simple fix guys.
---
Add a "Plan: Double-Sided Wallpaper Walls" to one of the Vendors in Whitesprings for like 100 Caps.
---
And do it sooner than 6 Weeks from now.
---
No magic effects w/o vats.  Gauss guns suck in vats anyways. You'd probably want ffr or dwa then.
---
I forgive you
---
Hasn't happened to me yet. That would Suck, I start my mornings, organizing, scrip ammo ect. in my private server.
---
For me it’s this. They love showing off players CAMPs as a way to brag how creative their players. So not very smart to do this without a way to let players continue making awesome camps.
---
They should mail you a check for $60.00 for playing that long.
---
# But what about... 6 floater grenades?
---
my nuts are so large that they do occasionally get in the way, I've learned to deal with it
---
Step into my camper van.
---

---
The Great Appalachian Sweepstakes!!!
---
OK it just worked for me but that was a sweaty few seconds. I'm worried going forward.
---
It's a CAMP emote from the Atomic shop.
---
I started loading mine in Beta and am still waiting
---
They aren't wrong. The problem is your understanding of random and looking at waaay to small a sample size.
---
I hate having to switch between characters to transfer. I make sure that it's been stable for a while and only transfer what I have to, private worlds only. I definitely plan before I do it because if the server crashes you lose your stuff. In the future, Beth could make this a feature of not having to exit and re-exit to exchange or just have one stash between your characters or some variant of that.
---
Fo1st is far from what was promised but when we think about it isn't this entire game just one train wreck after another? I'm sure they will end support for this game ASAP in 5 years Fo76 will not exist so we should just milk what fun we can and fuck the rest cause there is no way Bethesda gives two fucks about this game or its community period. They will jump ship as soon as they have a new major title most likely.
---
You sound like a funny dude , send pm if ya need to borrow caps . I got 5 characters maxed out
---
Nevermind saw you play on xbox
---
So, what you are saying is that I should set it for loot that I drop when I die so that it will make it more difficult for other people to taken them.
---
Someone will sell you one for 10k or less I imagine, heavily duped item :-)
---
I use my commie collectron as a bartender
---
Well a bartender who only gives water, soups, radaways, propaganda and hammers.

---
Unyielding is overrated for Rifleman unless you are having serious weight issues.  My max carry weight is 235 without a single piece of Unyielding.  I carry about 20# of explosives, about 21# in weapons, about 48# of armour, including 1 set of PA which I rarely use, an assortment of chems and whatever stimpacks and diluted radaway/rad-x I feel I need for about an hour of gameplay.  The rest of what I carry is because I am lazy and don't want to have to return to camp often and I stay around 175-180#.
---
I can also afford it. That's not the point. The point is their business model is promise a lot, get paid, give a little, and promise they'll get to everything they forgot. If you had a spouse who acted like this you'd be calling every divorce attorney in the phone book.
---
They vast majority of people that complain don't properly understand what random means.
---
Pretty sure I just bought a few. Furious FFR vats build gamma gun for 1200.
---
I had a bunch in my inventory and I use 1-2 per session but this isn’t a must just an option. There are a few other foods that boost XP gain
---
Legacies are manageable with the right gear and build  but a beam splitter 50 cal, handmade or orbital strike minigun aren't.
---
I wish they would add more emotes with 1st like the Mothman one
---
Oh yeah. Its hitbox is way too small aswell.
---
It's next to impossible to stealth with energy weapons other than Gauss weapons. Gauss weapons however can be silenced and now come in a variety of weapon classes. If you want to do sneaky sniping your best bet is a Gauss rifle primary. If you want to go in guns a blazing a Gauss rifle can still be useful but lacks the fire rate if a plasma. So your options are sneaky or tanky. If your on PC hit me up. My clan WOD be more than happy to guide you through your build as well as have you come along to level up.
---
I dont understand how you guys dont see it without Fo1st my wife doesnt have first and she has the same sales I have and has this entire time. So weird.(She had first for about 2-3 months but when we saw it was just another broken promise we figured if they ever fixed it we would get it again for her and of course they havent a year in.)
---
Was it Aten_Ra? I remember he went back/forth for awhile about seeding.

Edit: this was the only link I still had bookmarked, though I know he flipped position a couple of times.

---
Hello. We need to know when this will be fixed.
---
No, if you don't have time to play you shouldn't expect to be able to finish the run with just few weekly challenges done. With that thinking they should just give you all rewards at the beginning of Season 2. Because you don't have time to play...
---
We know. We predicted it. JUST STOP FUCKING PAYING THEM.
---
I think anything that's explosive, or doesn't have a silencer does.

(flashbacks of Team AMERICA Bar scene with the hammer *YOU GAVE UP ON LIFE DIDNT YOU*)
---
I believe, since this new(wonderful) patch, other people on the server are not getting the notification. I started one last night, trying to "herd the cats", get my whole group together. Usually when I put the card in everyone perks right up, drops what they are doing and ft to the pylon shack. I waited like 2min and No one showed up. I asked if anyone was coming and they all say they did not get the announcement....
---
I've done this two copies of the game mine and my sons Xbox, loads of mules never lose a thing.
---
yes yes, i totally agree.
---
Oh ok
---
Yah, and I don’t disagree they should have. It’s just hard to know how big a problem this was and how much time they had to solve it. If they’ve known about it for months, 100% that was stupid. If they only found this problem a couple weeks ago there was probably a big time crunch just to figure out where the problem was and remove it while releasing all the other patches. Seems like the devs are pretty behind if colossal problem still needs work.
---
Sorry I'm used to a different language where it can be done with Bools, at least its what I would do in my field. 
---
My point was that the material amounts wont affect server performance much at all if everyone had the Scrapbox. Having that makes the 800 lbs not as much of a hindrance. Despite whatever has been made clear I still believe the Scrapbox should just be a thing for everyone now. They can do other things with 1st. 
---
You were right on the first statement though, the limit is because of it being online. I wasnt trying to dig on you, just expanding the thought.
---
The worst part about the daily limits is that the timer starts when you sell something instead of resetting at the same time every day. 
---
Not only does this make it harder to track when the reset is, but if you don’t log in and start the timer again as soon as it is up then you are just pushing the timer further and further away. 
---
If you can play Saturday night and Sunday morning then too bad you only get to hit the cap once even though you played on two separate days.
---
As long as they leave me alone im ok with those jerks coming. I love living my own life minding my own business up north
---
I did one an hour ago and the tent trick was working
---
No one said you have to get all rewards. If you don't have time to play, don't play. It's already too easy
---
Confirms my teammates' theory. They are all already buying one lol!
---
Shhhhh.
---
It's VATS that triggers the magic damage, VATS is awesome anyway, shottys are shit out of VATS....
---
That actually applies to all doors, use the door jam and your face for a much easier experience.
---
That doesn't make any sense. Why would they go to all that effort to do that?
---
Fair points. Players also have to accept they aren’t going to really go into much details about what and why.
---
To be fair the original post was giving you shit.  Guy replied, and kinda went overboard.  Whether the original poster spent time making 100+ pro Bethesda posts or not, LOOKING into their history and counting 100 posts and making sure they were within a day is kinda...  yeah.   But to be fair, that guy was defending you.  
---
Goddamn this got complicated.   Everyone kiss and move on.
---
I member
---
Guess if I find a magic roll I will use vats
---
Haven't flat out quit  but I no longer log on every day.  I just needed a bit of a break from the grind
---
Weird worked for me last night, and this morning before work.  
---
If anything I was going to comment its easier now.  Before the last update I had to place transfer items in a suitcase or other container.  Now I just need to drop and all my characters can see/access the loot bag.
---
I am really intrigued by this...
---
But the Flamer doesn't, somehow.
---
Dont even need that if you have armour that triggers it...
---
Really good that they good a story quest up
---
There was no scrap box the first year of the game while a portion of that time we had a 400 limit.
---
I'm glad to see a camp that is concise, has a free flow and doesn't give me PTSD thinking about stabbing my toes with a ton of clutter... in some other building post.
---
The original poster was agreeing with me too, it was really just a mistaken argument, nobody disagreed with the sentiment really, but I was a little defensive too because I post a lot :(
---
What armor triggers it?
---
I never thought my camp would become legacy lol.
---
Yes, it's totally possible. I've done it a bunch of times. Frankly, it's easier and faster when I do it alone. Go stealthy and have your mainframe cores w/ you and already fixed.
---
There will be another double score weekend, so you can catch up then.  Might have to buy a level or two, but wait till the last day.
---
If you go into the depths of emmet mountain you can exchange it for a weapon of your choice with the effects you want + 30k caps and todd howard will come to your house
---
Which is where I think the fault is partly on us, they will never get into specifics but they used to talk to the community daily with non-generic responses. I doubt the employees are just not doing their job, which probably means they were told the community isn’t worth engaging with anymore. Criticism is good, but not if that’s all we can offer.
---
I’m just really hoping the instanced interiors update is a total overhaul of the camp system and not just a new element for design. I wouldn’t mind waiting if it means we get a lot of new toys at once.
---
35k and i wish i could more.
---
Like sitting on your porch after a long grind. 
---
Tbh it's better than the grind anyway
---
If your friend was there you coulda just got him to hold your loot for a hot second.
---
Or is that Sneaky Steve who's been known to not be there when you log back in?
---
In related news you can buy plans for x01 calibrated shocks and jetpack now in the bunker production wing and don't need to hop servers a billion times checking the military wing looking for a wooden box mod.
---
Better than a pocket watch I guess lol then you can drop them during fascnat and watch everyone scramble to it he he though I do prefer you've been insulted!
---
People just like to complain and nothing the game can do to stop it. They fix a bug then people who abused it get mad. Add an event the event is stupid. U can’t win
---
Random question, was the raider bones drop pile part of a bundle or did they sell that separately? I've been waiting for it to circle around to the atom shop and was wondering if I just missed it.
---
It’s insane like the game can be enjoyable if people quit making it seem so bad
---
The great canvas shortage strikes again.
---
The friends thing could be something. Developers employ all kinds of tactics to lure players in and earn more money. But a lot of times Bethesda seems real clueless about all of this. So that's why I just can't see them doing this. Not on purpose anyway. But like I said, who knows? A spreadsheet could tell us something.
---
Its a game you describe as " shallow attempts at manipulating your play time."  I assume you dont play anymore, and just lurk on Reddit boards for fun.  Else - who's fooling who?
---
I been playing for the first time for 3 weeks. I discovered my camp has a max budget now im thinking "wtf do I even bother? Unlocking new stuff I can't even build without deleting other stuff"
---
I haven’t seen any posts on this but is the Hearts bed and thatch rug free for everyone else too?
---
Shhhhh, don't remind them
---
Bethesda could very easily fix the christmas presents duping issue by making the presents not able to be opened till christmas. 
---
Have a "No opening presents early!" pop up each time someone tries to open a present u/ladydevann
---
I was actually thinking more like WoW, but hey I can dig it
---
Reduced damage while blocking...
---
I've been buying the atom levels since it's basically breaking even.  I rarely use the atoms.
---
Fallout 4 and 76 are typically just wasted locations anyway 😔 why uncover a cool mystery when you can just...shoot something...grab an item...and leave.
---
&gt; That's a long time to not have something fixed that appears relatively simple.
---
Oh, you sweet summer child...
---
Bethesda has such a screwed up sense of priorities and resource allocation, it makes one's head spin.
---
Insanity
---
This is sound advice for your first few runs until you get familiar with everything. After that, I find it just slows you down if you're stealthy.
---
This
---
First, this game is a marathon, not a sprint.  Take your time.
---
It will lt you go places you have little chance of surviving.  It will frustrate you.
---
THe map is segmented into areas.
---
Forest : Green are in the west.  You should stay in the forest until about L15 Or 20.  Lots of quests and missions here to gain experience.  Do Recruitment blues (camp McClintock) start the mysteries questline (Riverside Manor).  Join the responders and the firebreathers.
---
At about 20, go N towards the alligator (Toxic Valley).  Join the pioneer scouts
---
At about 30, go all the way S to the Ash Heap (west of the 3 leg towers).  Start Miner Miracles.
---
At 40, the center strip (Savage Divide).  Start Roses questline. Free states, remainder of BoS, and the Enclave.
---
at 50, go east to the Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
Following the overseers questline will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
Yeah, how hard can it be to fix the challenge for killing the SBQ?   That one has to be going on a year for being ignored!
---
Cork
---
I tend to believe this also. Too often I get matching primary or prefixes. Wouldn't dataminers be able to find something in the files regarding all of this? Either proving or disproving?
---
Fallout.com. steel is almost done now
---
What content do u want?
---
melee doesn't really have range other then "here"
---
Whenever you log in, before you click PLAY, look at the ATOMIC SHOP option.  Usually if there are FREE items available, you'll see a green "FREE" icon right next to it.  The FREE disappears once you redeem all available offers.
---
Hi, thanks for the reports about the Vault-Tec Duffel! We have a fix in progress for this, currently planned for release in Patch 22.

 &gt; Hi, thanks for the reports about the Vault-Tec Duffel! We have a fix in progress for this, currently planned for release in Patch 22.
---
I have a Heavy Weapons PA build and can run it handily with the Final Word from Beckett's quest line. Only thing that gave issues I've had have been legendary robots and their explosions because I lost where their body went
---
YES! I am starting to get resentful about having to do the dailies or losing S.C.O.R.E. I really want the camp items from the legendary run, so I do it...
---
Most are people with 790 hours played that day there isn’t anything to do when they have played all of it
---
Just have an event where no Ash or Goo piles were present and there was no lag, considering I had lag with Ash piles in the past, this is definitely on Ash piles rather then Meat Piles?
---
I agree... but until we got some way to safely transfer items between characters don't use bags on the ground that is the least safe way.
---
Use a world container like luggage at a train station its a little more stable.
---
And if you have a friend you trust use a friend.
---
bags on ground can often vanish for no reason.
---
Hopefully wont be needed when load out are implemented, but would totally love this!
---
For adfitional price of premium AAA game yeah. No.
---
I d love too! But i dont see it will be available that easy...
---

I felt the communities need to have it's hand held and talked to every day was asking to much. I work in a creative field, I've worked in arcade video games. No matter what people think, there's just not stuff worth reporting every single day. 
---
No matter what you've spent on a game. It just doesn't give you any right to be abusive. And this reddit is very abusive. It also drives away good posters, because if you say things nice, at least one or more will come and grind their axe in it. 
---
I'm interested in the instanced interiors. I'm guessing that it'll be something like a hatch that leads underground. I certainly don't want to give up my visible out in the world camp. I haven't used glitches, but I've got a great camp I really like. People will stop and hang out sometimes. 
---
I also recently went through and took pics of lots of ingame objects that would make great additions to camps, and should be put in the game as plans, and definitely not as atomic shop.

There’s a mask for it? I’ve been wearing the uniform forever
---
Exactly
---
Hi, thanks for the bug report! We are working on a fix for this and aiming to release it in patch 22.
---
Do you have FO1st? I only ask because my max carry weight is around 330 or so, and I'm still having problems. This is the part that I absolutely need to work on - I know I'm carrying more than I need, and I need to find some way to trim that down. And my stash is usually fairly full, so I can't do much dumping there.
---
I have seen some of the nice mods on PC that makes it much easier to understand how much of different items you are carrying. I wish we had some of those options on console. Even just knowing per tab would be something.
---
Okay you’ve missed the point.
---
My point was that Bethesda have to take the age restriction (some what) seriously. You give your kid an 18 game, nothing will happen. Bethesda replaces the SBQ. with Peppa Pig and puts the image in the advertising to attract the 6 year old market they have a serious problem.
---
As for buying games, you have to enter a credit/debit card in order to buy the game on Xbox etc, these are in themselves age restricted to 18. Therefore Microsoft can claim that they assumed the buyer was age appropriate.
---
Edit to add - the original point I was replying to was someone saying an M rating just meant you couldn’t buy it in a store, hence the reference to store purchase.
---
I have a high end PC and never had any issues but after the update I've noticed major frame drops at Radiation Rumble and certain parts of whitesprings.
---
Mmm
---
why not use plants?

 &gt; Hi, thanks for the bug report! We are working on a fix for this and aiming to release it in patch 22.
---
Are they on ps4, doenst lorespade have a beam splitters 50 cal, they can 1 shot everyone and have huge spread, I hope not. Also what gear should I use
---
I don’t understand why ESO has been able to balance all these issues and FO76 struggles so much. Maybe there were ESO growing pains (I didn’t start playing until Summerset) but damn, the differences are like night and day now.
---
They almost certainly are gone. When 76 was announced they made it pretty clear that the core team that worked on fo4 would be moving on to starfield as soon as 76 launched.
---
How come i can carry 300 shotguns and 10000 shells?
---
The chainsaw and drill. I don't care if they stay at level 20 they're a lot of fun to use.
---
nm
---
Since the update I’ve been getting frame issues worse than ever. Before the patch my game ran fine. No problems whatsoever but now I get constant fps drops so bad to the point I’ve had to lower most settings which I didn’t have to do before
---
Glad it's getting worked on.   Thanks for the reply!
---
Because I don’t want plants. I want the outside to be clean and empty. Also how are you literally EVERYWHERE on this sub all the time?
---
I use my gauss shotgun more out of vats than in and i murder most things with it.
---
Awesomeness
---
make sure you whack a rank of gun fu on
---
I think railways, Tesla's and gamma guns. Bloodied, junkies or vanguard /bolstering or sentinel. I don't pvp but that what the people I play with use.
---
Not at the distances I do :-)
---
And the off-angle glare of fancy wood floors is atrocious.
---
Yeah, I figured, I just think being able to easily switch one card would be nice too.  Also nice to stop accidental scrapping once we can scrap perk cards
---
I don’t play much anymore but if you ever need someone trust worthy you got me, I don’t have a lot of karma but I don’t play anymore so I have nothing to gain
---
The “cash” grabs are people just whining lol
---
All loot (weapons, armor, junk, ammo) is in the game. Nothing is in a loot box or cash shop. 
---
You can buy certain cosmetic outfits and skins if you want with atoms but you don’t need them. 
---
There are 24 other people on the map. You generally only see them at events. It’s a massive open world. 
---
If you like 4 you should like this game.
---
Oh, thanks for the info! I would've probably just wasted my caps if it wasn't for you.
---
1. Mostly atoms are the cash grab (more on them next)
---
2. Atoms are the premium currency (used to earn them from daily and weeklies, but only way now is through the season pass, which doesn’t give much as before) used to buy skins/camp items.
---
3. Yes, all loot can be found in the world, except for most skins of course, though there’s some interesting ones from missions/events
---
4. Unless you get fallout 1st (a monthly subscription), every world will be public. Generally though, even with players on a public team, the most interaction you’ll have with other players is them visiting your shop or events
---
5. Generally, the game is really fun to play in as a group imo, but other than than, I personally have fun with the player market side of things and trying to get good loot to sell/trade.
---
Wastelanders added a lot to the game, but after that, there’s not much end game. It’s like any fallout where it’s a solid 6-8/10 when there’s stories and missions to do, but endgame dips to just a grind
---
Give us the option to turn snap points on and off
---
It seems to me like it's been at least partially patched.
---
It's amazing to the rest of us that Bethesda releases such broken garbage (most people are bitching about this in game loot bag having a wonky hit box because they sent cheap nylon bags of the exact same item to people that preordered the game when it was supposed to be heavier weight canvas which is false advertisement).
---
Bethesda is so bad at quality control that they've made two major blunders with the SAME ITEM; both virtual and the physical one.
---
I mean the upside to this bag being hard to access, is giving someone more time to retrieve their scrap when they die. It will be great seeing someone get frustrated dancing around my bag and panicking when I get close and pick it all up.
---
They should just get rid of death loot bags being lootable by other players, since the whole point of that was to attack the person who stole it to begin with. You can still do that, if the other person shoots back of course. Seems like they overlooked that when they made a fix to PvP engagement.
---
I personally don't like the PvP unless it's in NW.
---
Do the daily’s........
---
The weeklys are worth 1000-1500 each, which at your point, should be enough to bump you almost 1 square per weekly item completed.
---
The dailys at 250 per add up to another 2k if you do them all except the NW one.   
---
Joint a building team for additional XP.  Your char is 188, so a run around the WS cottage loop will get you the repeatable.
---
Depending on the day, doesnt take much time.  For example, today, if you hit Blackwater, you can knock out 6 of todays dailies in one location, (kill glowing creature, kill mole miner, craft/scrap power armor, and complete and event (if Uranium fever pops while you are there)). Drink 3x nuka cola is #6 - if you dont have it on hand or loot it, you can buy some in WS.  Then do the cottage loop for 10k XP and 100 more score..
---
Give that Bethesda quality department all a raise.
---
I also REALLY want to apply the floor coverings to half and quarter floor pieces. It makes no sense to only have the full floor pieces get the design. I make unusual shapes and end up with plain floors or the edges don’t match.
---
Not Junkies or Bloodied and I can one shot the Behemouth at 1%hit chance/barely visible, uncharged shot :-)
---
&gt;their are way more powerful weapons
---
There are*
---

---
ESO was pretty messed up at launch. It honestly wasn't until the One Tamirel update that it started turning around. Which was one and a half expansions before Summerset. ESO is several years old and built for the online experince. I would argue that 76 has come as far as ESO had in the same amount of time and 76 has very different challenges to overcome than ESO did.
---
I feel you. I've resorted to using the Fasnacht confetti pile to clear a path.
---
Huge fan of FO3 and FO4. For me personally, FO76 has been a worthy successor. Currently sitting on about 1020 hours spent playing.
---
There are things you can buy towards the game. None of them are required to enjoy the game, and none of them are game changing. I haven't spent a cent on the game beyond originally buying it.
---
Atoms are the "premium" currency of the game. You earn some through gameplay, and can purchase more. You use them to buy the items I mentioned.
---
All the "loot" you need is found in the game.
---
The interactions can be as much or as little as you want.
---
They always come back
---
What about when the BoS attacked the NCR town of Redding because they were using the town gold mine to establish a gold standard for the NRC Dollar?
---
Which the BoS give the logic Gold leads to advanced tech which the NCR shouldn't get to make and a gold standard currancy is too much like the old world government.
---
I honestly hope the BoS are coming to take away our Advanced Guns, Gold, and Nukes and we'll actually have to prove we can handle the responsibilities.
---
Hey, the intern running this game is working as hard as he can. Its unpaid though, so while he's picking up extra shifts at Starbucks things will understandably suffer a bit.
---
Yeah, most of the time these updates bring back many issues, stability gets worse and game has also crashed to desktop numerous times since for me
---
I've seen  and sold them for 250-500 caps and they go pretty quick. I've seen them on other venders for more, not sure how well they sell at higher price points.
---
So is getting assassin armor not worth it, I usually use full bolstering combat in PvP and still get melted and I don't go bloodied as I can hit 2000 with a bloodied dc gauntlet but with ss you can shred them or with a jffr handmade
---
I love clutching with randoms.. it makes me feel like there are people who can play NW after all. We were like 2 v 5. The other team wiped out two guys who were pinning us down so I used a stealth boy ran up and tried to shoot one with a crossbow. It hit an invisible wall by the tree so I ducked back and my random ran up and got shot down. I pulled out the trusty rusty radium rifle and took out the last three. I should start recording it.... It felt AMAZING.
---
And I don’t want to see your Harris’s cookie cutter box house mucking up the beautiful landscape. 
---
Let’s compromise by not changing anything.
---
Yeah that bit. Could've been some cool shit in there if they'd have put some thought into it
---
A lot of games actually do this, and frankly it kind of works.
---
there was no grinding because there was no content to grind for
---
For sure. More game crashes as well.
---
The Leg Lamp will arrive from Fragile in 4 to 6 weeks
---
I agree but disagree. I honestly don't get people who complain about free shit. I mean it's free, just take it and forget if you don't like it, no need to be pissed about it. I do get why people complain about bugs that were promised to be fixed but they're still present in the game. Not even talking about cosmetic bugs which are also sometimes very annoying, but those who actually have an impact on the game itself. It's not like the entire community is unreasonable. The game is great and many people enjoy it, but after some time it's really hard to ignore certain things that hardly change. Besides addressing a problem (or complain if you wish) is the first step to fix it. Unfortunately that step is often the last..
---
You bought the licence to use the cosmetic.  You don't actually own it.
---
JUST STOP PLAYING THIS CROCK OF A GAME ALREADY!
---
it's been 2 years. and this game STILL doesn't have it's shit together.  
---
YES, there are "fun moments" in this game but it's like sticking with an abusive relationship
---
Please wake up. You've been in a coma for 10 years we are trying a new method to reach out to you. Please wake up. Your wife and kids miss you...
---
I hope Bethesda decides to address the issue and try and fix the issue because If not I’m gonna have to call quits on the game due to it being a massive mess and being at times unplayable due to constant frame drops.
---
This has been happening to me. I have screenshots, but I don't know if it's worth submitting a ticket over it.
---
Spam vats. Ghouls and Super mutants spawn very close to there. See the shack by the tent? Its a spawn point for the Whitesprings assault point random encounter. One may have not spawned properly.
---
Idk how they maintain stash size when they sell shit full price that I know no one buys.
---
Two distinct systems, they aren't going to work together. Your best bet is to file for a refund with Microsoft. Good luck.
---
He's the all and powerful. I await his wisdom each and every day. I'm almost convinced he knows the truth of existence. Anyone would be interested in a rammadeus cult? Hmm
---
Im convinced its not pure rng and there is some sort of time stamp to it. Back in the winter when I had more time, I started keeping track and noticed that bloodied would be the majority of drops every 11 days. Coincidence? My rng? Idk I'm no genius.
---
Yeah that would kind of be a cool spin on it
---
I’ve found it happens to me in the Ash Heap and Mire until I put a mask on.
---
The ill informed and idiots....
---
As far as I know it's all about dps and hotkeying certain aid items, like quantum's. I don't think anyone I party with but one uses assassin's. She likes it because it gives her time to open and use the hotkey stuff in combat.
---
Haven’t had any crashes yet funny enough, just more frame drops I wouldn’t be getting before the patch. The game just runs like garbage now and makes it hard to play at some points.
---
Sucks to hear that.. Hopefully they roll out some fixes soon
---
What is it even supposed to look like?
---
&gt; Doing low level events and high levels show up, let me tag the fucking mobs before you nuke them to oblivion with your miniguns 
---
Even as a high level player I find this annoying.  I really wish there was an option to join an "apocalypse" server or something where all the enemies/events are max level on the whole map and the challenge is really turned up.   Doing events/dailies in low level areas is boring because stuff dies in one hit no matter what weapon I use.
---
This mode should have some kind of bonus like extra XP, higher chance of legendary enemies, or faster resource extractor speeds to entice people to play on it.
---
I appreciated when ladydevann just interacted.even if it never reached a devs ears, responding to players Imgur photos or ideas with an original comment at least told us someone was watching this reddit. That’s why ppl on here now feel like they’re addressing Bethesda every time they have an idea on here. It was a good feeling. That’s definitely faded tho. It’s not about BGS listening to every idea, but that it felt like they were. Who wants to listen to the same copy/paste complaints though. 
---
And honestly, my logic has always been this. I can spend $10 to go to a movie, $20 to buy it new. That lasts me what? 3hrs most. I’ve logged 300 HOURS on a game that cost me $60. No matter what anyone says, we got our money’s worth. Even if it was filled with a lot of irritations the fact I can spend such a small amount of cash and still enjoy myself on anything in today’s economy I find absolutely incredible. When I consider how much money I spent going to a real arcade as a kid. It could be close to $60 just to have a few hours there 20 years ago. Can’t imagine what Dave n’ Busters must be charging now for a similar experience.
---
My hope is that you can create a wall-in space and assign it as interior if you wish. So theoretically it could be a hatch or a mega-mansion and still work. I really love the town builds, but I want something better than a collection of bad premade objects. I want the budget to create 2 or 3 interesting structures and have them connected through an awesome interior.
---
Do we even know what it should look like? Datamined image?
---
People seem to forget that they don’t always need to rip the other person off
---
If you don’t like it come back another day. I may lower my prices because I am low on stash space. I may lower my prices because I have too many of a type of item. I may just keep my prices where I feel they should be. I won’t be lowering them because of your post though. If an item is useful and not some random set of effects I will price it as such and if you want it you will pay. Items are as much a way to store caps as they are a way to make caps. Besides, how I price my items hurts no one and the only reason to complain is that I have something you want but you don’t want to pay what I value it at.
---
hmm.  I've not been wearing one but I will try that.  This is happening in the Forest though ....
---
I hope so! I love this game and it’s a real shame this game had to be made with this garbage engine. Thank you for the replies though!
---
And now there’s no way to exit the machine! If you’ve been through many transactions, you have to press the back button however many screens you’ve already been through to get out! This is ridiculous. Just make a slider for ammo in my inventory. This truly can’t be this difficult.
---
Only recently have I been remember to record stuff like this, just hope someone out there enjoys watching it all :)
---
so you'd rather have a rug outside and not a plant. That's absurd, sir! 
---
Well last week i would have said it's because i'm on furlough and had all the time in the world but i'm back at work now so i guess you're just blessed to catch me
---
Keep in mind, every additional content you buy for any game always only works on the platform you bought it from!
---
Steam DLCs only work for games you own on Steam, same goes for season passes, subscriptions and remember that even cross platform multiplayer was an issue in the past?
---
Now I'm not a developer, but I suspect this is one of those problems. 
---
I mean nobody buys a game in the Microsoft shop and expects to get a key for steam. Why should it be any different with fallout 1st.
---
And keep in mind, this is Bethesda. Their stuff is always build around weird workarounds for the most basic stuff. Never expect something simple like a code you can enter somewhere.
---
Now we didn't! We were supposed to get a canvas bag! Nylon was what came instead
---
If your enjoyed FO4, you'll love wastelanders once you get used to the differences. The end. Stop f'ing about and start playing.
---
Which Maxson?
---
Arthur Maxson wasn't born until 2262, whole FO76 takes place 100 years earlier.
---
If we're going off main timeline. We get the ORIGINAL High Elder Roger Maxson, who dies in 2135 of cancer.
---
Find that end-dungeon chest and leave, just like with Skyrim. But with a lot less interesting locations
---
The biggest lie.
---
Yay everyone kissed!
---
There are enough bugs in the game that I sometimes have to log in 3, or 4 times a session. If their goal is to flash the atomic shop in my face; hoping, I'll want something enough to buy atoms, then goal achieved. You didn't need to time gate anything, and I still saw it 4 times. With the camp budgets the way they are I have no incentive to purchase anything I see in the atomic shop. I enjoy the game, have no particular build style I'm after, and want to have fun with it. I thought that's how games were supposed to be played.
---
I played 4 for a day and quit because the field of view made me seasick. I like fo76. It's not perfect but I play it a couple hours every day. I consider it mainly single player except for event coop and other players stores. You can earn atoms ingame though they did nerfed that recently. Because I'm not a doe hard fan, I can live without a lot of the atom shop items without feeling like I'm missing out.
---
P.s. I waste time building up my camp so I've played 680 hours and still haven't finished the main questline
---
More like the tears of community. Get it?
---
dead at 100 metres or dead at 10 metres it's all the same
---
I know, I was there. 
---
OP wasn't there and I think wanted the logic behind the current state of affairs.
---
Much appreciated. Have a bit of a surplus that I could sell, and that gets me in the pricing zone.
---
Yeah that's true. Bethesda would have to work something out. I am sure there are different possibilities to do so. Maybe like adding 7 different quest's or something like that that reset once a week. So it takes some time but I don't have to log in each day to do the same chorus as well as scipt, caps and so on and have no time left for playing the game...
---
Used 10k steel... Got a bunch of alchohol to drown my sadness of wasted steel
---
[did someone put out a YouTube video complaining about this today or something? why are there two posts on this in a matter of minutes?](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i50v2j/mountain_scout_mask_its_been_four_months/)
---
This. It's meant for when you move your camp to make it easier to place but it's incredibly buggy/picky for when or if it works. It's only really useful for making small 1x1 or 1x2 foundations of you move a lot.
---
I don’t have an image but I believe it’s supposed to be a balaclava
---
I would say Fractured Steel will be just that, fractured.
---
I was wondering why Uranium Fever slowed to a slideshow for me after it ended...
---
you are missing the point. they understand that the 9k or whatever is on Steam at peak is not all the players. That's why they used that minimum player count statement with some basic data that is available. they way i understood it is, if you go soley based on steam count it will only take x amount of material. therefore, if the player count is actually higher then it will actually cost less resources.
---
now, to be fair, i dont agree that it's the best way to look at it. i havent played since this update, and even if i do, it is highly likely that I wouldnt be submitting resources. i am still trying to do wastelanders
---
Yeah like I know fed 76 is accurate to an extent, but some stuff really AINT worth it.
---
IT BETTER BE. IVE BEEN WANTING ONE SO BADD.
---
Unfortunately I'm not expecting much. All the good developers work for Zenimaxx on ESO or on Bethesdas Starfield. This game has a small C team that doesn't have much funding based on what I've seen between the two games.
---
- There aren't any of significance.
---
- Microtransaction currency.  You need zero of them to enjoy the game.
---
- Yes.
---
- You will see others wandering around if you don't spring for a private server (worth it IMHO).  Interactions are emotes.  PVP is opt-in.  You can play the entire plot by yourself, and I did.
---
- The world is gorgeous and huge.  There are a wider variety of environments, from NotMirkwood to NotMordor.  The starting area is especially nice.  Runners-up: With rare exceptions, the community is genuinely helpful and nice.  You get just one settlement at a time, and it's small, but it can go almost anywhere!
---
Sorry. I just want to ruski out
---
No because it wasn't working at the Whitespring's main building either where there are no enemies. And another guy just run threw there and killed everything.
---
Selling to low levels who have no ammo but have caps and no clue?
---
That's fair.
---
I'll never understand why some people feel the need to take other's hope away from them. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The little door mats look almost invisible when I place them so I prefer those
---
They are rare plans. The question is, are they rare desirable plans.
---
Supposed to be. It was bugged from the start, and they've yet to fix it.
---
Just now saw that post. Great minds think alike?
---
Too easy. TSE .50 with maxed explosive damage and heavy weapon damage perks. Max power armor perks, rarely drop below 50% HP
---
I haven't seen it recently but I remember seeing it a while back in the shop. I overlooked the fact that you can customize your loot bags to be different from your death bags.
---
I went up there, read the notes, talked to the guy, then left without donating anything.  I'll go back when the BOS returns.  I saw the spreadsheet with the rewards, and it's all useless garbage.  Not a single plan that I don't have already.  Just shite to drop on the ground.  I don't sub or dupe, so I have nothing to give anyway.  Just let the timer run out, as they won't allow it to fail.
---
How many hours would you say the wastelanders dlc will give me before I reach the “grind”
---
And that’s totally reasonable, I don’t expect the market to bend to the buyers will especially in a disconnected market place like camps. But sometimes it seems like there’s no method to the madness. 
---
I saw someone recently jack up prices on steel scrap. I totally understand that with ATLAS
---
I picked up a Quad last night off a trash pack.
---
I plan to drink heavily, accuse peeps of cheating at cards, call out 'varmint' and start indescriminately shooting...
---
Throughout all of the changes and issues I've experienced in my time playing this game the only conclusion I can come to is that the developers themselves don't play this game much. Too many things are just so obtuse that I can't see how people that played this game regularly would not see the huge red flags/issues in a number of their decisions. From how combat functions to ammo conversion, basic, game crippling bugs that have existed since beta, to the loot grind to things like this.
---
What low level have caps
---
That was the active players online when I originally responded.  There are now 7,200. 
---
Again... you are missing the point. Those 7200 people right now are not the same people as the 9000 people earlier. They are different players most likely lol. It’s just a point in time. You need to think how many player play over the course of a day. Assuming no new players log on from the daily peak is a really poor assumption IMO.
---
I’m just arguing for some proper math is all. 
---
Maybe this will resonate, maybe it won’t.... imagine you want to estimate the number of people who visit the park each day. You know that at its peak, there are 2000 people at the park at 8am.  How many people visit the park during the day? You may not know exactly the flow of people to the park, but you do know those 2000 people don’t stay there all day. You know also that new people will come to the park throughout the day. If someone asked you how many people visit the park and you said 2000, you would probably be off by about 800% or more. It’s not exactly a good estimate, in fact it’s a pretty poor one. You can use any myriad of ways to better estimate the total number of people who visit the park on a day, same goes for who play a video game. Looking at a point in time snapshot gives very little information when thinking about what the picture looks like for the whole day.
---
Too true, it’s really refreshing and nice to see people not being greedy
---
I also remembered like a year ago I was always 'Gotta tour it one day' when I pass or heard someone mentioned it, like every single time, no more then, raiders happened
---
Angst.
---
I QUIT!
---
(^(maybe tomorrow))
---
The random day of the week is a terrible idea for anyone with a job or family in my opinion, as they get likely to miss it.
---
We love the game, we hate the company. Because they lie. Because they are incompetent. And most of all because they don't listen, though they pretend to.
---
Thank you.  I worded it to go both directions.  Either is an issue to be sorry far.   Well played
---
that's not at all what they said. by saying minimum player count, they are addressing the fact that they know it is not a total player count. yes, taking the peak does not mean all players, but it is a starting point based on the info we have.
---
No I don't see it like you. It's just a bad implementation. You really want to unstock your vendors everytime you hit almost max cap and then restock again? And sometimes there is this special one that buys almost everything and you hit max caps in a short time, what then? It shouldn't be possible to buy something if the seller has max caps already. And why can I power off the vendor if another one can still use it? That even makes less sense...
---
S.C.O.R.E. should really be weighted more on the weekly side too. The daily challenges should just be a buffer or extra for people with more time. It should be possible to fully complete the season over the 10 weeks by doing all the weekly challenges and maybe 2 or 3 weeks worth of dailies. This would bring it more in line with more traditional MMO weekly-based play styles.
---
One shotting is bad enough, imagine everyone with meta weapons going at it :-)
---
Not really gonna quit since I am still actively farming gold bullion for a full set of decked out T-65 armor (Already have full SS and jetpack/buttressed and gauss weapons and mods). I still have fun logging in and doing random events / murder-hoboing super mutants. Once I finish the T-65 grind, I doubt I would care to login everyday anymore.
---
The bugs are pretty crazy at this point. It hasn't \_actively\_ affected me, but having to take precautions to not lose score everyday does get tiring.
---
Kudos on punching the clock on this campsite, but I am a fan of less is more. From the pics it looks like hoarder camp, I'd have to see more pics to say anything more better or worse. Can't tolerate cluttered camps personally, only thing that matters is if you love it...not what other ppl think.
---
Nope. Just was in NW and figuring out what to wear, and I realized the mask still wasn't fixed.
---
Great now I can get 15 more scrip once I've blown away all 150 in the machines. 10% isnt enough.
---
Hey, thanks for noticing! Good luck fixing it in the next patch!
---
I think the reality is this is Bethesdas C team with a skeleton crew and not a whole lot of funding. Nothing else can explain to me the drastic differences in how development is done between this game and their owner Zenimax's ESO. Sometimes I honestly wonder if they play this game much.
---
Then just dont. I literally gave up playing daily. I wont be "held hostage" by a game.
---
Do we know if it looks good or is it on the same lvl as a hyper pink Brahmin costume? Lol
---
I don’t even remember how I got this scout uniform cause I don’t think I was playing when it was released
---
There appears to be a major bug regarding FPS and ash piles, I'm not using my tesla now as I end up in a slide show.
---
People need 5.56 for all those duped handmades and fixers, also fuel for the BE flamers etc :-)
---
I havnt been able to get that to work on PC
---
I feel that, without the daily limit I would play in way longer sessions on fewer days, while having much more fun and an overall better experience. As if I play for half an hour to turn shit in and do dailys I don't get "into" fallout the way I do when I play 5h in a row where I get to explore the map and lore as well as play events and interact with players every once in a while.
---
Handmade mag size was bugged. It's fixed to be like the rest of the rifles. It's still the most used rifle in the game. This game is already stupid easy, why make it easier?
---
Power armor and a gatling plasma with a crap ton of stimpaks will always do the job
---
This might not be the case but I had something similar happen to me before the update and after. So today I completely rebuilt my camp, while I was messing with power connectors to make the wires look better I accidentally removed/stored (or so I thought) the door that was next to the connector I was messing with. When I tried to put the same door where it was it snapped perfectly and was green yet I couldn't place it because it kept saying the item is floating. I was very disappointed because that door was important and quit the game to mind my own business.When I logged in back the door was there.. Maybe it's not your case but maybe it is. Also you can try to remove surrounding items, place the wall and put them all back.
---
No one knows. We know it's supposed to be a balaclava, but that's it.
---
And you got the Mountain Scout Uniform for having played prior to Wastelanders.
---
No, as that would be silly, and positions are fixed, hence the many clipping issues with apparel...
---
Doesn't even need to be good power armor, I did my first solo run with Excavator
---
interesting that your example is a twitter comment on the sheer comedy of wearing a hat with a beehive hairdo...
---
I’ve read about not looting meat piles is causing the game to drop fps but the frame drops in areas I used to never get them is reoccurring all the time now. Maybe there is something else from the patch that is causing this to happen on top of the ash piles issue?
---
So what you're saying your kill count didn't go up and you didn't craft extra ammo for the event?
---
Not saying I am unreasonable, just had to make the point that some people go looking at vending machines for a cheap deal on a bloodied/junkies/aa weapon and get insulted when it costs 15-20k or is trade only for a decent 2-3*. I have to grind a lot of legendaries to get the ones I am selling and the price reflects that rarity plus the items usefulness.
---
Or you could just collect 5 other resources...
---
My word mate! It just destroys the game on a long term point of view. Bethesda doesn't see this or maybe even doing it on purpose to get more daily login's. Read this already some times and It sadly makes sense although the reason is not in the interest of the player base.
---
For real. It's only bad if you make it bad. Get you a friend, you can literally mess around for HOURS chatting with someone. It's not that hard. Some complain about the score system too. I like busy work. People complain it is a lack of content. The game is open ended because it's the first vault to open up. That is all I have to say.
---
This, unfortunately this. Sad really, they could have done so much more but from the beginning it was all about milking the franchise with minimum effort.
---
If it happens again. Remove your rads and watch your health bar. Assuming you run healing factor mutation. If that's the case you found your problem. I honestly don't know or care to know how bloodied builds are. But there has been more posts on here about specific things in bloodied builds that dont work anymore.
---
Thanks for the great advice! I haven’t done any of the quests you mentioned so that gives me a lot to be going on with!
---
we all understand that it's potentially not the same players. some players login multiple times a day. some login weekly, some monthly, etc. but what you get from steam is a peak player count for the day. though it is not "all players," it is a good number to use as a minimum. Minimum is the key. 
---
if we had unique logins a day then someone could do the real, accurate math, but without that info, we use the data we have.
---
This - but craft each piece of armor to be ultra-light so it weighs nothing when your not using it.
---
Yeah i got the woodchuck for it and was somewhat disappointed, but it was something i wanted to get eventually along with scrapper
---
This def needs to be fixed but there are plenty of other resources you can gather. It's not blocking your progress.
---
Some level 249 person killed me in NW last night with a beehive haircut with a name like beehive Harry.
---
Thanks! I’m leaning more towards a tanky guns blazing energy weapons build. I play on pc, and I’d love to tag along with your clan if that’s okay!
---
It’s down on Xbox one for me
---
Same, different error code each time
---
Yeah mine is too
---
It most certainly has not been.  Probably some dork put their tent in the wrong spot, wont work if it's a few feet off.  If they don't move it nobody else can plop another one down in the right spot because of the build radius.
---
I launched one solo at lvl 45. Its actually easier than I thought, although you need a ton of stims and ammo.
---
It is on Xbox as well. Failed to download configuration from title storage was one of multiple error messages.
---
Imagine how awesome a furious chainsaw would be.
---
I’ve seen it sell for $15 before.
---
Because I want caps and have a viable resource that people are willing to pay for.
---
Aslo down on Xbox with a [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) error.
---
Guess it’s down for everyone then
---
I read your commment in Batmans voice.
---
Fine now though
---
Same and I’m Xbox.  I jumped on reddit to see if I was the only one. Thanks for the post.
---
This method no longer works I’ve tried and it gives me intersection error
---
down on PC as well
---
Kept refreshing this sub waiting for someone to post about it too.
---
Down on PC for me. I keep getting error codes (different every time). The one time I could sign in, it wouldn't bring up my friends list or the Atomic Store and the Legendary Run. I could still get onto a server, though.
---
Not working for me on PC either
---
Or vampires. I want to roleplay doomguy or Ash.
---
Yah I’ve gotten 3 different reasons
---
So far I Have donated 20,000 steel. You're welcome.
---
They will release garden vases with BOS logo and raider pants. Kinda like releasing camo and  ghillie suit stuff during a  space theme update.
---
Down on PC (Bethesda launcher) for me as well. Getting various error codes/launch errors
---
spoke too soon, I restarted the game twice, and it started working. maybe temporary network issues
---
Yah it seems like the game doesn’t even know what’s wrong with itself lol
---
Holy fuck, people were saying that this is what he would do as a major “screw you” to the customers a couple years back, you gotta start actually making things right soon Todd.
---
Now that is a good shout, shame it only works that way in adventure mode.
---
Never understood this.. I know how grindy this game is but nothing can compare with getting just the weapon you wanted after countless hours and a lot of effort or maybe spending a lot of hard earned caps. It just kills the joy.
---
Someone kicked the mole rats, it's loading now.
---
Who even uses it? Lol
---
I just got the same message three times in a row.
---
Edit: I just tried again and it’s working.
---
I'm on but can't access the stash xb1
---
It’s not “potentially not the same players”. It absolutely is not the same players lol  it’s so far off from being a useful measure. Even if you doubled the player count you would still be falling short significantly because there is no way the average playtime is 12 hours.
---
Point is it’s a terrible means of estimating. Simple as that.
---
I’m getting same thing
---
You must speak with mort at the wayward to begin this quest. And then collect 1000 fancy brushes from lvl 3 feral ghouls to finally be in the know.
---
Yup, same here.
---
Anyone else think at first they had somehow been banned ?
---
Never mind, Todd plugged it back in.
---
Was down on Xbox for a few seconds. Got multiple different errors (I think 5), before it let me in. Playing NW right now
---
And about a year later, if you put a claim in, we recieved the previously promised canvas bag.  
---
Which, in my opinion, is still a bit shit. Sure its big, but it feels cheap.
---
Hope that wasn't *recentlyyyy*
---
People just like to complain about things.   They can hate on it all they want, but in the end, the game is still giving them something they wanted.
---
oh, huehuehuebr.
---
Man I had some good screenshot loading screens from then, wiped because Bethesda support told me to reinstall the game over a glitch with their account system, no reinstalling the game wasn't what fixed it!
---
He likely has about 50, another will be in there tomorrow:-)
---
Hopefully not! Maybe we have to post this again and again and be more specific on the desired situation.
---
This games paid items are put together so quickly and it's so blatant .. haven't played in a while and can't remember what it's called, but that one tent structure thing is so crap... You can literally walk thru both side walls and the back wall...
---
you're not wrong, but you are looking for an exact answer. which was not the point.
---
I’d say the DLC is a solid 10 hours at most, but there’s still the main quest and a decent amount of side quests to do along the way.
---
Thankyou!
---
It looked right to me, idk.
---
I seem to remember there being another level of drama. Didn’t HotTopic mysteriously start selling the canvas bags that were supposedly never made or something?
---
I’ve been using it lately. Voice of set build
---
Funny, i thought of this as well but was somehow too lazy to try it after only needing a few more oil and copper. Thanks for the confirmation so now i know i already sorta knew haha
---
My logic has always been that a $60 video game is worth so much more than any other entertainment. Buying a 3hr movie is $20 new, any kind of activity like axe throwing or golfing usually cost $15-50 an hour and you’re usually splitting that time up with multiple ppl. 
---
Meanwhile, I’ve logged 300hrs. Once the game has given me my times worth and I enjoyed it anything else is just icing on the cake. I totally get being upset. It can be irritating spending so much time only to have major bugs ruin hours of gameplay. BUT, you’ve gotten hours of gameplay. I feel like people forget how much time they already got out of the game and only focus on how much more they can get from it when generally speaking a lot of those people aren’t the ones making Bethesda any money. Even fallout 1st probably isn’t making up the deficit, it’s just a padding to convince ppl that wouldn’t normally buy atomic points to throw in some cash to keep the lights on. 
---
Maybe Bethesda is making bank off of us and being greedy. But we’ve got the lions share of content from such a comparatively small amount of money to any other form of entertainment!
---
It just works
---
I really liked the outfit and backpack. If that's the compensation for recent screw ups I humbly accept.
---
They hate the player base too much to do anything cool and enjoyable. I mean they spent time patching a double sided wall... And left game breaking bugs. Its vault tech mentality.
---
Tbh I think if they'd include those cubes from the far harbor dlc that'd be perfect. Just have them appear invisible when not in the building mode.
---
It was.
---
I don’t need exact. Just some sort of meaningful estimate.
---
thanks i was looking around ways to get it and there were no updated guides that i could find
---
I usually have a pretty easy time playing melee and I don't play an optimized build. Primarily using a i/pa gauntlet and it gets the job done on 95% of enemies with one or two hits.
---
Yeah, also Gina, Greg, and Dias should be ally too!
---
This mod solved my meat pile problems... extra bonus is that goo piles don't cover over meat piles anymore
---

---
Ah.  Forgot about that one.  I always do stealth builds so I never used it myself.
---
Fusion cells and hate
---
Bulk 3 each of AL, Cu, Oil, Steel, and springs. Then scrap the bulk. Challenge completed.
---
Lol it's kind of ridiculous how tedious they are to load. Almost makes them not worth it at all. And I mean it's only 75 rounds. I'd figure in a real combat situation you'd burn through 75 like nothing.
---
on a bright side beth has increased the atom reward for playing 7600 hours, it was 20, now it’s 760.
---
I’ve sold the same item for all sorts of prices, depends how quickly I want to move things
---
You can watch the video if you like
---
Interesting. Hopefully it’s unique if Bethesda ever does release it. I’d probably prefer that legendary run skull gas mask still anyways. Just glad I have the scout uniform. It fits so well into the Appalachian landscape. Feels like the closest thing I’ll get to a West Virginian version of the NCR armor.
---
I don't have a sub for that long, but each time it renewed the atoms were delivered after 1-2 days. First time I didn't know and panicked and sent a support ticket. Ofc I didn't get any good reply except an automated email, but the problem resolved itself the next day. So you can wait till next day and if nothing happens send them a ticket.
---
Why does being  a Chernobyl victim or hooked on coke make my shotguns very powerful....
---
No, but Beth made canvas bags (different ones, not the ones that were supposed to be in the CE) and gave them out to influencers. Really hard to sell the concept of a shortage of canvas when famous people were receiving bags made with that material.
---
I don't think these are developers decisions. Something like this is part of game Design and management decisions. Software developers are only for implementation. Maybe they even want to implement something else or want to focus on Bugfixes but I bet it's not their choice to do so.
---
If this is true I need his username
---
Well I do agree with his point that people shouldn't charge more than 1 cap per. If I had my way, all ammo would be 1 per, just make sense since most daily players rack up at least a couple thousand various rounds a day.
---
That’s what he said.
---
Honestly it’s pretty trash as it cannot be modded but it’s still fun to use on robots.
---
Thousands? Your stash must be only containing plans then. The are 'heavy'
---
I always go for the long pull, so, no difference for me.
---
There was a time... Now only certain world elements can be scrapped.
---
Wow, I totally missed the "3" part.  Imma shut up now.
---
Aww man. That's horrible. It's crazy that a reinstall will even wipe your screenshots on consoles. :(
---
Damned robots
---
Yeah I do
---
Why can I stay so irradiated and not die quickly from cancer?
---
What's that? You guys want a mask fixed and available? Well here's some backpack skins.
---
The screenshots are still on the hard drive, but ingame access to use them as loading screens or profile pictures are alas forever lost...
---
I have like 20k of plastic just because i don't have to bulk up materials anymore with fo1st.
---
We concentrated on scorched and ignored super mutants, ghouls and criptids.  
---
Scorched are soft targets, we got more kills for the same ammo cost.
---
Yup. Five minutes and you’re done.
---
I wonder if they do this so as to curb bingers from gaining a huge edge over more casual players. It reminds me of South Korean laws that try to mitigate the harm caused by video game addiction.
---
Yes I could not get past the sign in screen. Closed app a bunch of times and eventually it just worked as normal.
---
That challenge completed without having  the crickets checked off.   You probably had to kill them, but they just didn’t marked as completed. 
---

---
I traded with someone carrying 150 or so...
---
You're all good, my friend!
---
You want this fixed?
---
*breaks that*
---
There you go.
---
It's not like an increased camp budget causes problems, I've visited 600% budget camps that had no lag what so ever!
---
Can just bulk your own scrap and then scrap it, still counts and gets all 5 done in about 2 minutes.
---
Don't think it works for wood but not sure. Pretty much anything that says "scrap junk to produce x" will though.
---
globes give cork too, seem to find them in schools.
---
It seems kinda strange that you would only have bigger build limit and size on private worlds if like me you play on adventure and only go on private worlds for workshop farming ect.
---
Thousands for sure. And it's an alt so between the stash box and his own carry weight he's having trouble moving. Ive had to limit per plan to 20 of each and lately have been giving a bunch away. I used to do this "take a plan leave a plan" thing and players would take one and leave 100. I may start it back up.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

PS4... 3 Months later after massive patch. Still Bugged.
---
Random plan for 2k bullion perhaps?
---
Ah yes, breaking perk cards is their priority
---
“We’re discussing what it would take to implement double sided walls.” XD Man that is pure comedy right here...
---
Bulk resources from your stash and then break them down again.  It still counts if it says "scrap junk to produce x"
---
Happed to me a couple nights ago, had to close the app multiple times and it even gave me the banned code at one point.
---
lol, but there are SO many! It's just so boneheaded to be saying they add things in a patch and then don't add them, or say to have a look at the new calendar and then it turns out being an old calendar. It's hilarious :*D
---
How can I put steel in a box in harpers ferry and use it in sutton?
---
Keith?
---
I guess I should RTFM... uh title?  RTFT?
---
What??
---
The real question is if it’s possible to get any friends who also want to launch a nuke ;-;
---
Yes, only the "Brotherhood Fatigues", which had a static spawn at the Thunder Mountain workshop. It used to be an underarmor that could be modded with the same stats as the 3 craftable BOS underarmors. Now it lost its stats and became an outfit.
---
I saw them when my Fallout 1st was active, but don't now that it lapsed!
---
I probably won't "quit" any game I'm playing (at least not till PS5 is released),  but I will take extended breaks from games like I'm currently doing.
---
I have a very simple cabin with a porch set up in the middle of nowhere, by a small creek. It aint much, but the view is to die for.
---
 yeah, I get them wanting the daily logins. But they could still offer some incentive to continue logging in for dailies to get their login quotas
---
I just use a Bloodied Super Sledge, not the best melee weapon in the game, but goddamn is it good
---
Here we go with this shit again. Somebody not reading the fine print and then expecting more than what they initially signed up for based off things not in the fine print. 
---
As far as value goes, the atoms alone covers that in addition to the private world and scrap box.
---
You there to help? Cause Wren’s got stuff that needs doin
---
It was on sale a week after, that wasn't a permanent price drop!
---
Okay, but if you have game pass then you know that you have a number of games at your finger tips, all you have to do is install them. It's a subscription based service. There are no cc checks; unless you get a new card. There are no age checks, or anything else, because you're already subscribed to the service. Also, Microsoft, Sony, and Steam all save your cc info so you only have to enter it once.  It may not be marketed at children, but there's not a lot stopping them from playing.
---
I had the same thing happen when I didn’t, getting one fixed the problem tho so I don’t know 🤷‍♂️
---
It's a reward from BOS questline
---
I'm using a prime ultracite gat laser for most enemys now and very cheap. I use my empty fusion cores to make ultracite fusion cores. 2 empty become 3 ultracite and takes 1 flux. And i get 40 stable flux every nuke
---
The 400 limit days pushed me to purchase a second game all together on the super cheap. On PC you can run two instances of the game at once. The second acct is literally a storage unit. It holds some amazing stuff. Legacies unicorns rare outfits plans etc. I agree the storage thing does create limitations (it's hard to hold onto a stock of things that help you trade later) but there has been some work arounds.
---
Plus each bethesda acct has five characters. That's 11000 storage space if you add 800 per box plus 1400 per Character (apx).
---
It's hell to manage but has made life easier when I want to get some good or help a friend out.
---
Did you happen to finish the BoS questline? You get full set as a reward from it.
---
Hi, thank you, just checked mine and its not complete (checked), still 6/7. I do see other times I completed it as done.
---
most likely technology
---
T-65 should have one too. The DR/ER/RR barely makes it better than the older sets, since when you’re at that high of resistances it doesn’t really matter if you have 50 more of each one
---
A simple change in leadership would fix the Brotherhood, but unless they get shunned and outcasted like the Washington Brotherhood, they never change.
---
I got in today!
---
Yes! I did it at level 35 (ish). Just bring a ton of meds, a suit of power armor, and ammo if you use it. It'll take a little bit but deffinitly possible
---
I honestly just gave up on it after a week 😅
---
Like you, I was initially very apprehensive about buying the game, especially after hearing so much bad coverage. But then the steam sale rolled around and figured why not. Long story short, although this is very much a flawed game, it's also some of the most fun I've had in a very long time, especially when you team up with some friends while leveling. 
---
* "Cash Grab" is probably in reference to having the atom shop in place, which is something you typically only see in mobile phone games. You are under no obligation to buy anything, and it's all pretty much cosmetic.
---
* "Atoms" are the premium currency you use at the Atom Shop.
---
* Finding loot is a pretty organic process in the game. You'll find most of what you need along the way. At times you'll trade with someone for something that will make your life easier. You'll also run events at a chance of getting some nice legendary drops.
---
* Social Interactions are mainly limited to emotes and voice chat. They are really trying to encourage grouping up, which I don't mind since the benefits are nice.
---
* To me, the "Fallout Universe" has always had huge appeal. Going all the way back to Fallout Tactics, I just loved the post apocalyptic world, sense of survival, quirky situations you will find yourself in and the humorous circumstances that will surprise you. The series has a very well established story line, which is probably the reason why there will soon be a TV show based on it. Same goes for the Witcher series.
---
Yeah ive tried explaining this to people and they couldnt accept that theyve been wasting scrip this whole time so they just downvoted me and told me what ive been doing for months is impossible.
---
It was already a stupid terminal to use, now it's just flat out ridiculous
---
 Nah then he would rule the Mojave.  Or get some sweet Power Armor in the Capital Wasteland
---
Oh, wait, so it was not intended? 
---
I had modded about 4 or 5 into shielded over time, and had them distributed across my characters, as I used to sell them in my vending machines together with the other 3 BOS ones.
---
So I just lost around 20 hard-earned stable violet flux and ballistic fiber because of this.
---
You can add me. I’ll be on soon. JC_Rose
---
Yeah they did an unannounced hotfix. It bugged my score though.
---
Explaining what exactly?
---
Just saying in Ark, which is also an online game with I think up to at least 50 people if you fill your storage containers you can build multiple ones and bigger ones like vaults. I know I cant  expect to apply one games logic to another one but it seems that we should be able to craft multiple stash boxes and they all have their limits. 
---
I also understand with how the system is currently is why it isn't feasible.
---
any problems with other games?
---
This is what happens when you have a crew of mobile game devs working on a real game. They literally don’t know how to design anything but grind. New BoS event? Just more grind in the guise of an event. It’ll never change.
---
I'll be on in about 3 hours and I'll help if you haven't found anyone yet. Let me know.
---
Yea I got a grenade laucher, black powder pistol, gamma gun, ultracite lazer pistol with 25% speed, so 4 my bad but still... also a vamps mini with 10 aim damage
---
I too am playing screenshot simulator when other people use Tesla Rifles in my vicinity... It's really making the game hard to play when I drop down to 1 FPS in the middle of an event with enemy's all around...
---
They just patched that
---
Yea I donated 250 steal and that's it
---
It's made in Mexico too, apparently
---
600K? How? I pick up everything what is see and put it in my scrapbox and i am lvl 267 and have like 20k steel
---
Sorry, a bullet isn’t strong enough, maybe a mini-nuke.
---
Apex is laggy but their servers have been ass for a while, but it works.  GTAV works perfectly. 2k20 works perfectly. 
---
Both adventure and nuclear winter do not work also
---
I'll be on in a bit as well, I can help too. TheBazz3l lowercase L on the end
---
Fix one thing,  break the next. Been a common occurrence since I joined this game. And I've only been here a few months (,well I stopped a few weeks ago cause the game bored me). But if this is what I get for only a few months worth of playing,  no thanks. BYE!
---
Can they fix the patch next?
---
Its the value the game places on it.
---
Going to craft 4 gause minis and see what I can get
---
Thank you for this. If anything, all these comments have eased my worry about the cash options. 
---
I’m more or so still uncertain about the player interactions aspect as I assumed there were more than 24 people on a map at a time, but I’ll most likely take advantage of the steam sale.
---
KEITH?!?
---
Doing it out of pure mind numbing boredom. Like I'm trying to dare it to give me something I don't already have...
---
alrighty i’ll let you know if i haven’t done it by then!
---
This isnt helpful
---
I keep hold of them in case society rebuilds itself. I got at least a couple cars coming my way.
---
Reward for BOS quest
---
You won't get back precious materals. Because otherwise people would take over player workshops and scrap everything. And gears are everywhere. I have 8k of them. Always use contractor perks for 50% 'discount' I always place a fusion generator in every workshop.
---
The problem is that they have a massive DLC already being developed that really hinges on us rebuilding ATLAS. Story wise - they’re locked. They are able to just say that Dorsey made up the rest of the materials, or maybe delay the DLC, but the story will continue like normal. If you meant they will auto complete the challenges like story wise - then yes they most certainly will.
---
However, if we don’t meet the goal, I’m pretty sure Bethesda will not give us the rewards. So if you care about the rewards, go for it! Many players do not fancy the rewards but if you personally wan them then go ahead donate as much as possible and work together
---
Personally I’m not donating anything because ATLAS is so far out of my way and I don’t have the time nor the space to collect that much junk. The donor provisions are terrible and just not worth my time. I can’t speak for everyone, but for me its just not a viable option.

thought this was going to be about multiplayer versions of the tadpole checkpoint races...

I was playing on my low level alt character yesterday and some lvl 500+ dropped me one for free along with a bunch of other plans. Thing is, I had bought one for 9k for my alt the day before 😅😂
---
Start playing game a little bit now, almost year after release, and I also stuck in same moment. I read last patch note and was happy Bethesda fix something in quest I'm already playing right now. But from what I see they fuckd up probably this. I start quest, uncover map slowly, just exploring, have by accident fuze T required to quest. Right now collect blood sample from ghul. Come back to laboratory ( quest was not really started for me, just read data from computer last time ). I pop fuze at first. Load blood sample from ghul. Sit to computer, and when I try analyze getting message like sample was not founded or something like this. I saw on YouTube people need more of them? From wolf, mole rat, and ghoul in one quest step line? I collect only this from ghoul because qame do not ask for anything else.
---
Whatever, pipboy suggest to analyse, but computer says sample it's missing. I leave server and come back again. I have still fuze to pop in on the wall in inventory. Game want me again to analyse sample but this time I can't put it to the machine (looks like it's already there) some kind of checkpoint? And still I can't make any progress.
---
I finished it a long time ago but I think it bugged because it never gave me the achievement for it.
---
Maybe the Reward was stuck somewhere and with the recent patch they fixed it?
---
Well said! Chally has all the milk I need
---
Still. Should be a real fo1st selling point. Make it sort of a savegame. Bethesda only saving what is build and rest resets.
---
fixed
---
Most people don’t want to be wanted
---
if you pick someones lock youre a PVP target
---
could be
---
*weeps internally* I need a month. Please.
---
 It would give them time to adjust things, work on fixing the auto complete bugs, and rethink the rewards. All of the things I was excited for have been a let down (fireflies...). The ATLAS rewards are a joke too.
---
Well, at least 6 floater grenades is better than 4 (it takes less clicks to delete it from your inventory).
---
Wait lol that's what I thought ahaha
---
Glitchy on xbox as well.
---
...which some people like to be
---
If you want to run it legitimately, this takes about 10-12 mins. 
---
* Anti Armor Gatling Laser and Heavy weapons build will chew through all the robots in a silo in under 1 fusion core.
---
* Equip max lock pick and max hacking to bypass the reactor room.
---
* Use an explosive weapon when destroying the mainframe. Takes 1 or 2 shots per console.
---
* Pre-build your mainframe cores before you get into the silo.
---
Glad I’m not the only one haha
---
You may well find people don't often pick door locks but use one of the glitches to pass straight through without gaining a wanted level. 
---
I lock the doors on my house not for security but because anyone who is stupid enough to think 'it's locked so he must be hiding something so I must glitch in' will simply be wasting their time firstly on the main door, and then on the three interior ones.
---
When we get instanced interiors it may put an end to this nonsense if activating the door is a requirement for entry.
---
I’m right there with you, I always try and find a couple legendary‘s before I spend scrip...might be RNG but when you spend 500 scrip and get 3 vamp weapons as I have or my brother spends 300 and gets 2 junkies... I think there’s more than RNG fiddling with the servers but who knows.
---
My character vision sometimes gets weird after using vats he’ll stay in like “vats vision” where everything is fuzzy until I use vats again
---
Im away for work, but i was able to play with my son &amp; was surprised when he pulled out a chainsaw at the sbq fight &amp; then charged in. It's how the game should be played - just enjoy it &amp; do what you like.
---
You could ask for a refund.
---
One POSSIBLE workaround would be to buy a month of Microsoft game pass plus so you get FO76 "free" and try linking your accounts that way.  Once linked I'd be shocked if 1st didn't apply.  But the refund is probably the better call.
---
Eh, I kind of think some armors should generally be better than others. Otherwise whats the point in grinding for them?
---
I do think every set should have some sort of set bonus though... that way some sets could be subjectively better for certain builds even if they weren't objectivity better overall.
---
There's easily 20$ worth of content.
---
If you stay after that, shrug.
---
Game play is about what you get from FO4. The MMO aspect of the game is virtually non-existant and survival mechanics are little more than an annoyance. The building mechanics are janky to say the least (not nearly on the level of FO4). Other mechanics are interesting but underdeveloped such as the claiming workshops and the nuclear winter game mode. Bethesda is adding new content fairly regularly so hopefully they keep improving. You can play in a group or solo very easily the community is fairly good with the occasional exception (I recommend turning pacifist mode at all times) but even if someone kills you, you only lose your junk. Since the Wastelanders DLC the game is much better but be prepared for an absolute crazy amount of bugs and glitches that seem to get worse with each update. That being said servers are alot more stable then a year ago. Be wary of hackers &amp; duppers if you play on PC. Don't worry about the atoms (premium currency) you don't ever need them, been playing since beta and only ever purchased 3-4 items and currently have over 13k atoms. Fallout 1st is the subscription service, I would wait till you have played the game for awhile to get it. The survival tent and stash box are game changers but if you don't play it that often or aren't into building shit they aren't really worth it. I don't really know why everyone gets so butt hurt about the atoms or FO 1st if you don't want the shit don't buy it cuz you don't need it anyway to enjoy the game. People act like Bethesda devs don't have mouths to feed. Let the fools make some extra scratch. My only real complaint about this game is the shear number of glitches/bugs/exploits, I feel for a top tier game studio they are just unexceptable.
---
In closing if you love the FO universe and don't mind a ridiculous amount of bugs this game is a solid buy on sale.
---
I was hoping that with wastelanders we would see settlers at workshops and we could assign them like in FO4.
---
Even better, raising a workshop for a certain faction could initiate faction battles where we would actually see faction faction combat outside of a random event hot zone
---
I feel pretty stupid that it's not what I thought
---
A long time ago, when I first started playing, I was on a team with a buddy, I wanted to use a workbench or something in his camp, picked a lock thinking that I wouldn’t be wanted bc we’re on a team, took less than 15 minutes to get converged on.   Lesson learned.
---
I did rad rumble alone and had hunderds of meat piles. (Made a nice pic there in photomode) but it kept running at 144fps at ultra. It's an inside location so fps is always higher there. So it's not a problem that everyone has.
---
I strongly recommend drinking while playing for now, good strong lager or jack and Coke...
---
Unfortunately no junkies, but did get a bloodied fire rate
---
You can create death lanes but they’re usually ineffective, as players can just teleport. You can create a box players can fall into and make them pick a lock with turrets watching that space. However it all adds up to little and turrets have limited effectiveness. It’s just a lot of wasted time to be a dick and all of these things assume the player isn’t smart enough to think they’re way outside of breaking a door open.
---
Man, this entire time I thought that song was about anal sex.
---
Gave 60k steel - because it's steel, why not.
---
Highly doubt will donate anything else.
---
Unless they made it a score challenge.
---
Probably not
---
LOL
---
They really should’ve done this game more like Minecraft. An open world single player game that you can also play with friends.
---
This would fix the modding issue, the server issue, the live service micro transactions issue, and more!
---
In Minecraft you can run dedicated servers for the game, which is how it should’ve worked from the beginning.
---
Same. Donated 10k, basically got over encumbered with booze and Grenades. 6 plans, none I didn’t know. First and only time I’ve donated so far
---
I ate her liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti ...
---
I honestly laughed out loud at that
---
Yeah fuck that bag. I’m going back to paper
---
Wow, man. That's some real dark romance right there.
---
welcome back
---
Eagle eyes, small guns bobble, overdrive, psychotats, lone wanderer (charisma) , revenant (endurance), food that increases vats dmg, a lifsaving piece, try to optimize for vats (perk cards and ap refresh pieces) if you have ap pieces you can move sneak perks for dmg or vats. Thats everything that i could think of off the top of my head.
---
Good job! Now do it on 3 more characters!
---
Where they using magic guns? Some heavy guns with a high fire rate, rip the queen apart.
---
Fireworks effect reload speed? How
---
lol players have been complaining since RELEASE... Do you really think anything is going to change? People keep playing, people keep paying, that's all that matters. No matter how many people complain, Bethesda is still going to reap the rewards because despite ALL the backlash it still hasn't been enough to stop the  cash from flowing.
---
Sounds like you need an i7 lol. But in all serious, nice build. I’m looking into building my own PC this year. Any tips
---
Good to know you see playing fallout and washing dishes as interchangeable...
---
I feel like doors should auto close and not cost mats to relock. This is one of the reasons I just leave mine open. Also I'm a commie.
---
Bethesda seems to be like a really bad genie that you have to pay a lot of money to in order to get anything out of. You say something like "I wish I had a million dollars!" and suddenly a bag of cash falls out of a speeding truck and the next thing you know, you're being arrested for having a bag of stolen cash.
---
It's ridiculous how Bethesda treats us, and the only redeeming quality of this game (in my mind) is the player base.
---
Do you know if the Beezlebilly is available in NW?
---
Brahim is also gonna be sore from all the milking.  He's got nipples, Greg.
---
She cant be crippled (and therefore forced to land) so you’re a bit reliant on the RNG of her AI, considering you do less damage when she’s flying due to the range dmg drop off.
---
For the last 2 weeks I can’t cook food without it taking forever. It’s the slowest thing for me right now but I have noticed other things too. When I join scorched earth after the queen appears I usually load in, although the map says there’s people there I see nobody for 20 seconds, then I’m dead because I’m surrounded suddenly by enemies.
---
Yeah, dead people.
---
I feel like this would be solved if they upped the cap limit to 100k or like... if your vendor is off it is actually inaccessible to other players.
---
He loved a woman who wasn't clean.
---
Same here, I've tried 4 times with no luck so I just gave up.
---
People wanted a multiplayer Fallout, but this wasn't it - and I dont know anyone who asked for nuclear winter. Like yeah, some people like it and its not as bad as it could be, but no one asked for it.
---
Dude you've helped a lot, I actually forgot about eagle eyes. Thank you!
---
What sort of bugs are we talking about, like game session breaking bugs where you have to reload?
---
I have crafted full SS unyielding gear within 15 legendary modules (albeit a lot were 1\*, and I ran out of modules) after getting 2x unyielding armor drops from legendaries on the server.
---
I don't know if the system works or if I was just lucky, but I know for a fact that I am going to try rolling the remaining 3\* pieces after confirming unyielding drops on a server.
---
I didn't get any plans, much rarer than they were in presents, and yeah I dumped all the grenades, stims and alcohol it gave me ontop of the donation box!
---
The only thing we can do is to cancel this piece of C.R.A.P. I've just canceled: https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/ There's no hope.
---
Np
---
You're at the end of the road.
---
There is no appeal process and if you have been told the decision is final, then it is exactly that. 
---
However, you definitely do not get banned for using VOIP overlays, regardless of which VOIP app you use for communication. Bethesda is very easily able to tell that process is running alongside others on your PC (very basic stuff), even with their lackluster anti-cheat system. 
---
You were not hacked either, or you would have mentioned that in your original statement. Something along the lines of "I came back and my password was changed" etc... However, your password was in place, which is basically unheard of as the password is the first thing to get changed on a stolen account.
---
Now for the worse news: Cheaters trying to have bans reversed have used the "it was a voice overlay" excuse for years now. Not a good look.
---
If you wish to continue playing you will need to buy a new copy of the game and begin from scratch.
---
I nuke a place and don't harvest plants at first. I get the enemys for materials and go back every 20 minutes until the nuke zone is gone. Gives me like 40-70 stable flux every nuke and a guaranteed  Wendigo Colossus each nuke. Don't get why people do the SBQ and 1 circle around and leave. If i join a server and see a 'used' nuke zone it's the first place i go. I have almost 500 stable flux of every kind. Only cobalt is at like 360
---
Generally speaking they'd have assistant gunners with extra drums and to load them when empty, the RPK also has a slightly lower rate of fire then the standard AKM so it doesn't burn through it as quickly. I can load my top loader fairly quickly (still not as quickly as a 30 or 40 rounder), and the Korean type takes even longer but is easier on the hands. I'm not saying they don't deserve their bad rep but as something to screw around with at the range they work perfectly fine but even in semi auto you can still burn through it prrtty quickly if you try hard enough.
---
You wanna talk about a real PITA thoigh I've got a belt fed in 7.62x54r and loading about 1000 rounds (47 on a 50 round belt) takes me about an hour to do by hand if I don't have help and the loading tool for it doesn't seem much faster from what I've seen on YouTube. I bring 1000 rounds at a time and once they are gone I'm done with it for the day.
---
People are so upset about this stupid camp thing, they didn’t even realize we can’t make screws using Assaultron Helmets anymore...
---
(Another prime example of this community being up in arms about the stupidest things rather than the things that really matters... Like Fasnacht. Bethesda removes ways for players to get free atoms from daily and weekly challenges? Nobody bats an eye. Fasnacht delayed for 3 days so they can fix a bug? Everyone cancels their 1st subscriptions, quits the game, and wants to burn Bethesda at the f*cking stake... People on here are ridiculous at times.)
---
I've seen wgat magic weapons can do but I've watched vids of people using the same gear. I just can't seem to nail something
---
Not the craziest. Ever seen a diseased robots? Pretty sure it happens when servers are up for so long it just slowly falls apart.
---
It also doesn't credit when you are in Camp Build Mode. I'm just assuming this is a symptom of the additional fix they put in to stop SCORE challenge autocomplete chaos, so that the rules and checking for completion and crediting are more... refined.
---
Graft on damn is almost a guarantee,  although when I log on later I won’t find any.
---
It created more bugs than it solved. It wasn't even remotely comprehensive. If they let me take a crack at it, I could have addressed about 70% of the bugs they advertised as fixed in under an hour.
---
Which is *technically* a violation of FCC regulations and the Terms of Service with Bethesda.
---
😉
---
Been a few posts about this today. Pretty sure it’s on Bethesda radar!
---
I had a bit of luck with her. She landed almpst instantly, stayed for a while and after she flew off she didn't take too long to land again. Her attention spam is abysmal though
---
Yes, I’m on Xbox too, when I exit the power armor to craft the score points show up and the audio kicks in
---
One of my friends wore it in NW earlier today so I guess it is
---
I wish I could get it but I've been out of power for three days due the hurricane. My power company has stopped by to "fix" the downed power line twice. Literally eyeballed it and left.
---
is that a real ticket though?
---
This is funny
---
This has been a bug since wastelanders was added to the game. I don't know how its triggered but it has happened on one of my toons as well.
---
This is a good idea tbh I might start doing this
---
Saw some mole rat teeth for sale only 2500 caps. what a deal! If you wanna move that crap you're gonna need some Wacky Waving Inflatable Tube Men!
---
They really are very nice
---
Ok cool!!!...cooler looking than BadNewsBilly in my opinion
---
My husband's Xbox S All-digital smokes my Xbox One X. I recently took EVERYTHING off it aside from 76 (including captures) and the first attempt at loading in took almost a minute. I really don't want to have to purchase an SSD just to start on a level playing field, but know that's what's being done.
---
It was funny, at first. But then you ignored rational points that could have helped you understand the situation better, and didn’t even consider situations in which the player *can’t* share anything useful. 
---
That’s where it lost the humor.
---
Bruh wtf so rdr2 and fallout 76 are having disconnecting issues?
---
Oooooh I was wondering why it was so delayed
---
Same. They need to allow us to sell plans to vendors. I guarantee if I eliminate them I’ll drop 200 pounds or more. I’ve eliminated a ton of ammo since the ammo converter “fix” but still around 760. Oh and maybe the 50 Fachnats masks I refuse to scrap for some reason.
---
Every silo I do, I always do solo. Bloodied Stealth commando, I clear a silo in 15 minutes, never go down, never even get hurt.
---
Even if I’m playing with a team of 3 buddies and we all want to launch a nuke, I’ll tell them I’ll do the run myself, just easier for me that way.
---
In the same sense, Glowing Behemoths confuse the hell outta me.
---
It's the real bag we wanted for pre order
---
There are better perks to spend cards or special points in. Can't lose 3 points in Fireproof. Messes up my build
---
Easier to see than the paper bag but still a pain in the ass to select
---
Ive noticed if I'm in my pip-boy, SCORE won't register until I exit.
---
My alt low level character uses it, has several different leveled bloodied and instigating/explosive .44 revolvers, she's a gunslinger build. Handicapped I know but still fun.
---
Not sure about rdr2 but I got kicked out of a server few mins ago. Seems to happen when there's too much firepower going on during line in the sand or scorched earth. But that's the whole point of public events is the number players that can join. What do they expect players to do? Punch the enemies so it doesn't affect the frame rate? 🧐
---
And all these cute little pockets and pouches, even more useful than a handbag !
---
You are able to withdraw scrap but not deposit it
---
Your damage output won't change. It just makes it easier for mixed level characters to adventure together.
---
Ok, so I want to help you guys resolve the situation a bit faster. The right (side that isn't facing you when it loads) of the duffle bag seems to be where you can get the inventory the most. Around about 1/3 of the bag is selectable at all times, around the same size as a paper bag. People say it's an anti theft measure, while that may be true, maybe add a new bag function? Like make it so you have private bags are public bags, private bags obviously wouldn't be accessible by other players while public bags are.
---
Have a PA with jet pack and run through wall then 2 jumps (in case you fail use the door glitch) and you are starting launch prep in 1 minute. YouTube if interested.
---
Yeah the same is happening on rdr2, the max amount I could stay on is like a min or 2
---
Yup. You can keep it and use what's in it, but you cannot add to it after you cancel your first
---
A 'you have been insulted' note
---
I like it because it gives me a reason to go to The Forest and Toxic Valley. Currently there are only a handful of places to farm at higher levels.
---
This opens up more of the map, this way I don't have to grind the same 4 places over and over. This gives a bit more variety. For me, this is a welcome change.
---
Eh? First I've heard of this...link to article? This sounds terrible and very very lazy if it happens.
---
Yes, you keep the box.
---
I've read posts about this and the responses say the scrap box stays with you. You can pull scrap out but can't add new scrap to it once fo1st subscription expires. Don't take my word for it though, haven't canceled mine yet lol. Bethesda probably patch that someday soon and all  your scrap would be back on your character
---
I dont know that it will affect the build at all, my interperetation is it will scale enemys level to the player attacking it. It may affect carrying a low level toon killing high level mobs and getting tons of xp however. My 2 caps
---
my guess is energy ammo or junk like circuits and copper
---
Very nice.  My toon is rocking out as a female Joker.  Bloodied HM and no mercy.
---
You ever just *consume* a minigun when trying to drink some punch. Yeah me too
---
Yeah but you can’t put stuff back in only take stuff out
---
So your essentially suggesting they make it more like eso
---
I'm curious what they "fixed" that caused both this and the Class Freak visual bug. I know the game is old spaghetti code, but I can't think of anything they made changes to that could be connected to these.
---
Let me try to simplify it for you.
---
Convenience is convenience. I don't mind paying a few extra $ for convenience. 
---
Hopefully that helped you understand.
---
Personally wasn't a fan that quest, think it was way too much hassle. Too much going on. 😪
---
I'd figured as much. When I think about it. The whole 2102 thing was probably a nice little red herring to create hype exactly of this nature.
---
[Here's my screen shot of the Space Station, pre-raiders](https://i.imgur.com/dtAkdEy.jpg)
---
What is the line?
---
I think you maybe reading it a little wrong, I think it's more tailored to low levels being able to actually help in certain circumstances instead of being level 25 against level 68.
---
Ofc high levels will feel a little more challenged but I don't think it'll effect us much at all only maybe ammo consumption (I use crap weapons that use 38. Ammo in low level areas to save ammo on other guns)
---
I have the real one irl and the tactical bag
---
I do also. But fantasizing about something that epic is too savory to avoid sometimes.
---
People playing as cowboys
---
This would be awesome! And a huge help to those of us who work odd schedules or have to travel and only get to play every so often during the week! I'm totally behind that!
---
I’ve never used a box to store anything when I do this, I just drop it in front of vault 76, just did this recently to test and still works.
---
I am being educated this evening for sure
---
Also, to add to this, on console at least (might be on pc im not sure) the Legendary run screen is literally playing on about 3 FPS, this is happening to most console players atm, thats right, the Legendary Run screen, even when on the main menu and not in game, is having performance issues
---
Yep. Richard, Harold, and a few others tracked the mutants that were attack caravans back to The Mariposa military base in 2102. No specific date is given. Just the year.
---
I mainly just wish that it did more to make you feel involved, give me a mini-questline or something. Just handing over my steel gets kinda old
---
Also it'll give us end game players almost guaranteed level 45-50 legendaries no matter where we are on the map or who we're fighting.
---
1. 2 star Legendary Power Armor(SPECIAL Boosts &amp; weight reductions)
---
2. Make other builds more competitive(Pistols, Non-Junkies/Bloodied/Unyielding/Stealth)
---
3. Transfer items between characters in a smaller stash that can hold a small amount between characters.
---
I had a similar problem. I kept disconnecting or crashing before the loading screen would end. It fixed itself after I reinstalled the game. Someone told me it was corrupted data but it seems strange that it is happening to both of y'all, unless your using the same copy of the game to both play.
---
Relax chicken little! It just means a Lvl5 on a level 5 gun will do the same damage as a Lvl50 gun from a level 50 player. It won't negate an Instigating, Bloodied, Junkies boost etc nor a correct perk load out.
---
It's like ESO and it doesn't affect high levels poorly.
---
u/Ladydevann 
---
4 months and counting, no updates.
---
Cryos and flamers are both stealth weapons, quite bizarrely. Nothing quite as discreet as lighting people on fire or turning them into ice blocks.
---
Bloodied dont die nearly enough to justify the damage they do so they need to nerfed
---
Lol I mean that good they upped it, but I'll be long gone before I hit that number
---
Yeah, that I like.
---
But it kills immersion for me. I like that as a new character there are places that are off limits till i get stronger. Acquire stronger gear.
---
I mean, does this mean I can walk straight to cranberry bog and start killing scorchbeasts at level 5? Will the scorchbeasts be level 5?
---
That sounds stupid.
---
Same, and it’s for life, not a month ;)
---
So there still living in the 90s lol
---
I get how it sounds, but I think what they’re saying is that enemies lvl with you. So a lvl 10 and lvl 50 w/ mini guns will be on equal footing against a scorchedbeast. That’s outside of the perks system though. 
---
All One Wasteland is supposed to do is normalize enemies to your player lvl so all regions are accessible at all lvl. While idk if I like the idea as much, all that’s happening is the amount of effort that you put into killing a lvl 32 death law at lvl 32 will follow you all the way to lvl 900. 
---
 No explicit bloodied nerfs yet!
---
I sympathize, but I’m not personally upset. Having dealt with corporations for about half a century, I’ve come to expect that unless it’s in writing with a specific date attached, there’s no guarantee of when implementation will occur. And that’s information I use when making my purchase decisions. 
---
I compare the cost of the product/service with what is presented as per of the actual product description or service agreement *at that time*, not possible future additions.
---
If I see value in trading my money for the product/service, as is, then I make the deal. Otherwise, I don’t. 
---
19,800 Atoms at a cost of 0.5 cents per Atom, by itself, was a solid value. I might have even agreed to that, if that’s was all that was offered; pay ahead for a full year and get 1650 Atoms once a month. And while I felt (and still do) that features like the Tent and ScrapBox should be available to all players via a quest reward, that added to the value. 
---
I understand your concerns. And I’m hoping that the promised features are forthcoming. 
---
But I feel I got fair value for my money so far.
---
Agreed, work sucks up all my week and I don’t get those daily logins rewards
---
Yeah that sounds like quite a job but at least you get 1000 rounds of fun!
---
Still works for me
---
Wait. The are people that 'make' normal fusion cores???? Even the 3 ultracite cores only cost 1 flux and 2 (empty) cores.
---
I remember this annoying fast travel bug 😂
---
What you see on sites like steamdb and steamcharts are concurrent players at every hour, not daily players. It's also the average of that.
---
Level 17-20
---
So the way you could look at it is a specialized build will still do more damage than a regular one especially at higher levels because you would still have high level perks and legendary gear that a lower level player wouldn't.
---
Its allowing everyone to chip in instead of sit idly by while the high levels and specialized builds do all the work. In the best circumstances it could mean enemies wouldnt be a waste fighting because they would be at your level giving more experience than we get now. Sounds pretty similar to how Borderlands 3 level scaling is.
---
Haha would be cool if we see some cosmetics with very minor boosts that are earnable in game or something. I want my pouches to me something &gt;:( 
---
But it’d probably get more hate than praise so probably best that it doesn’t happen.
---
Try Scorched Scorched Leaders level 62. Leaders are 47, Champions are 62.
---
Enjoy the Award! I agree 100%
---
The demonic pack also replaces the ss jetpack rendering.
---
Let's be honest they're advertising is terrible. We have a community event going on but on the main page in game it's past the atom shop advert.
---
We have to dig through stuff of hope someone guves us a heads up about it half the time to even know about.
---
I know I've never seen them advertise or mention 1st discount on their weekly atom store updates on the actual fallout 76 page.
---
Edit: After looking again the discount is noted at the bottom of the page next to the power armor paint. It's posted with all the other discounts which, if you skim like I tend to through them, is kind of easily missable.
---
Been here for weeks and only if a survival tent is in the right place will you see that
---
they have made no mention of build/effect nerf's and buffs.
---
**all that is changing is that enemies are now at thier closest spawn level to your level.**
---
  bloodied will still hit everything like a freight train, junkies will still hit stuff like a hummer, and everything else will hit like a prius
---
Oh wow! I don't have enough time in the day to list them all. I play on XBOX so I can only speak for it, so this may be different for STEAM users. Some perks that are broken, VATS is broken, some weapons are broken, frequent game crashes, dialog is broken(some AIs really don't like having their dialog skipped), lag is always an issue with online gaming...the list goes on and on. I'm sure if you looked in this forum you would see a lot more. Most of them are minor annoyances but some are pretty terrible. I know that most Bethesda games have their fair share of bugs but this game sets a new standard. Everytime they fix something it seems to break something else and some things have been broken since launch such at VATS. Still pretty entertaining game though thats why I say it's a good buy ON SALE. IMO

---
I sell them for 50caps. I have so much of them. Just don't lock the stuff in a workshop. I even place letters on it that says FREE. Or i start a private server and have 100 cores in an hour. Making normal cores is 'bugged' so much stable flux!! Even ultracite cores are cheap
---
I strongly agreed with what you are saying! Take the money and run! And with no disrespect to the Fallout fan boys. 
---
I have  spent more money on this game than you, and played this game more than you, so honestly go suck a deathclaw dick. I have the right to speak my mind at this point, if you don't like it than go and cry to God Howard, because I am sure he gives too shits. 
---
Bethesda needs to stop fucking us around, I am at ends wit with how they keep fucking us around. It down right ignorant and disrespectful. One slap in the face to the next. 
---
And to everyone else that has been jerked around by this company and can see through there corporate bullshit, I wish you all the best!
---
Even if they are level 5, which I doubt will be the case, you'll have the perks and SPECIAL of a level 5. Just because they lose HP or damage doesn't mean they will be kittens.
---
I submitted two tickets plus follow up emails a while ago and they never reseted anything
---
Fast travel has been an issue for months.
---
I just don't retake them. I just get the 3 cores and move on.
---
I'd believe they're after something more concrete than that.
---
Last week I had it crash randomly all day. Then it was fine. Today it seems very crashy as well. May be a server issue causing the issues.
---
Same thing is happening to me😕
---
Lol I remember when it was 200
---
Doesn't much matter if an enemy is level 5 or 50, they are all squishy with a bloodied or junkies build. 
---
Maybe OP has a crappy version of one of those builds and level 50 scorched are still giving him problems LMFAO.
---
Right, so if it takes 2 minutes to kill a death claw at level 30 it will still take you 2 minutes at level 500. Right now I can down them in about three shots. This update will no longer allow me to do that and will waste more of my ammo right?
---
I was really pleased with that BP skin
---
Where the hell did that come from?
---
I sea what you did there.
---
I can see a massive graphic upgrade too, plus maybe less of those invincible enemies that can't be killed and less server issues.   But, don't get your hopes up
---
Pretty sure.  The 40% mark is my default because otherwise I'm too squishy.  I don't usually take advantage of Nerd Rage, preferring to rely on  stealth.
---
Upvoting the hell out of this post.  More rugs please!
---
Ya, but did they forget to test it before launch? That's all I'm saying, bare minimum goes into things
---
Ooooh puns! I love puns! 
---
I Wood love to see them more often 😏
---
Need a little more info here.  Unarmed? 1 hand?, 2 hand?  Power armor?  Bloodied? Junkies?
---
Personally I’d suggest bloodied unarmed. If you can get a good bloodied unarmed weapon your on your way.  Then it’s just finding unyielding pieces and making your build.
---
However there’s many different ways to roll melee and you’ll need to decide before we can really impart a ton of wisdom.  They are dependent on armor and weapon...
---
The jetpack shows up for me
---
You aren't reading what is being said
---
One wasteland will probably mean that all enemies will spawn at the max level they can be
---
So the ash heap will be filled with level 40 hlowing mole miners, the forest will have level 68 charred ghouls, etc
---
You don't have to! FFS exercise some self-discipline.
---
That's why, for the most part, I stick to the classics rather than "new" games. Honestly the only reason I play 76 randomly is that I have xbl for other stuff. If not for that, I would have swallowed the 30 bucks I bought it for as a loss, like when you go out for dinner and your 30 dollar dinner sucks.
---
The game or Bethesda?
---
You'd never see a supermutant in underwear run so fast before
---
It may bring up some fun references. Never know! Maybe we’ll find out the Master has some sort of connection to the super mutants in Appalachia. 
---
Idk if they ever stated the limits of the master’s hive mind and he’s supposed to be a genius. Possible he could find a way to send out a signal to Appalachia dishes as Maxson could do it through the satellite array early on. Should be more than one satellite out there and they’re not all gonna shut down at the same time.
---
Thats too bad. Guess I was glitched.
---
Its better now. At first you 'scrapped' ammo at the same volumes you could made them at a tinker bench (without perks) now you have the options of 1x 10x or 100x that. And max points is now at 100k so you can also keep them to save weight
---
Its not even aholery sometimes, ive just started and realised that i robbed some guy of some bullets from their ammo press because i though it was a world location.
---
Sorry who ever you are.
---
Hahahahahahah
---
Almost a year playing. I thought when builders talked about mats it was referring to actual mats for the glitches. Oh fucks am i dumb. "Mats"=materials. I swear im not stupid.
---
I have 7k cloth because i want someone to build for me.
---
Yeah, it's a very odd design, using the store UI to select which skin is used in-game.
---
Truth of the matter is it's the garbage that gets discounted!
---
A lot of people donated at least 3 or 4 times before realising its worthless so yea we've probably nearly finished the steel one already
---
But if I am teamed up with a low level player, all of those high level enemies will suddenly become harder to kill right?
---
Fuckers made me fight a bunch of robots for a toy
---
Pump up your INT! Respect the character some if you need. Use all unyielding armor (especially if it has the bonus +1 to INT).
---
Sleep in beds to add a bonus. 
---
Use leader/INT bobbleheads if you can. Live and Love #8 is another buff to XP (Have Curator perk to extend the time on mags and bobbles). 
---
Use food to boost more! (Carnivore needs meat stew or squirrel stew or Scorchbeast brains and Herbivore needs cranberry relish or brain fungus soup or Brain bombs) 
---
Egghead mutation is a must! Same with herd mentality. (You'll want class freak and stranger in numbers perk cards on too)
---
Lastly, Use public teams! I go building for a flat INT bonus to everything I do.
---
And then they have the gall to make self deprecating tongue in cheek jokes. Or the sarcastic passive aggressive snipes like this one. While still feeling like the're in a position to make these statements to the fans that they are slighting.
---
AND I HAD TO BE NICE TO THAT BRAT!!!!
---
How is this not way over camp budget?
---
I didn’t think about that part. I’ve gotten a few drops that I thought would replace a gun I already had, but when I check it’s just a level 35.
---
Idk, mine feels like it takes forever to fix, I usually go through 1000+ bullets before I need to fix it
---
How quickly you trying to finish the mainstory? I'd recommend 45-60. Because the commendations quest require you to do enclave events, kill Scorchbeasts or legendary enemies. Can you currently handle any of those things fairly easy?
---
The low level player will see ghouls appropriate for their level
---
And you'll see ghouls appropriate for your level
---
Frankly im not sure how it will be implemented and balanced, but im not a game dev
---
What platform are you on?  I keep getting legendary powerfists that I won't use.  You can have them if you're on XBox
---
I don't think I'd ever use any other power armor 'backpack'
---
They’ll just change the prices so we’ll be grinding more for less.
---
Yes a million times. Do not buy ranks until the latter stages. The first 2/3 will fly but that last bit is a real grind
---
I started with game pass, Did the quest for excavator, managed to collect 45, 51 and 60 sets. I have the full plans for Ultracite PA but I'm a few short building it since hitting my 50s. Oh, I am missing a raider left arm..
---
But, honestly tho.. the only set I've used is excavator. The carry weight bonus was godly till I started going full deep pocketed. Now I'm not so sure. Some extra bonuses would maybe sway things, but right now I hardly see the point.
---
If all limits were removed, I would be excited to play a ton over the next few weeks and months. And log in more every day than I do now by a long shot. 
---
Momentum is such a big thing for playing a game like this. Sometimes you want to binge and play a bunch, but these limits preventing that make me stop playing for large periods of time frequently.
---
Whitesprings or morgantown is great too. Sux that it doesn't work on my private server. The best is during the day on a weekend when a lot of players join and leave. It respawns the enemys. I sometimes kill 20 glowing ones and they all respawned next to me
---
Yeah - I did it once, never again.  But I'm happy some people like it - so I can farm flux.
---
You can always find one in the train car next to WSS
---
Your assuming that there isn’t a level cap for mobs....which there is and this won’t change
---
Which doesn't make sense. The newer players need to scrap more so than the older players. They're constantly making new weapons, mods, camps, etc.
---
Ooooh!  Shiny!  
---
Now what were we saying about a bad update?  I've totally forgotten about it!
---
Thanks.  Im finally going to resort to modding.  Held off a long time as worried about Bethesda banning players.  But right now after a few events where the fps went to 2-3.  Enough is enough.
---
Yes, you need to know the plan for the receiver yourself before you can make the ammo for it.
---
Fuck yeah, my armor won’t look like it’s from a PS2 game anymore
---
If someone else ran the silo before you in that server and killed the turrets then they won't be there forever in that server. But only the ones they killed in their silo run.
---
I figured that was the issue but wasn’t sure, thanks so much for the reply
---
Not the one in the reactor room.
---
BOSA The Brotherhood of Steel and Alcohol LOL
---
I feel your pain
---
I'd settle for a blueprint that could rebuild everything once I take it again.
---
the canvas/nylon bag incident is an analogy for the game itself.
---

---
It can only be put on a secret service chest piece (so you need to buy that first). It uses action points for power, so like your run meter. It costs a few stable flux to craft, so get a few.
---
100%， but no over
---
It's not exactly a secret. Bethesda's "main offices" were involved in creating the game initially, but pretty much as soon as it launched they all went to work on what's coming next and left the new team to handle it.
---
I’ll definitely have to steel some puns from other people
---
Very nice camp!
---
Think it depends on the level scaling. If they keep the current max levels on mobs little will change except helping lower levels in higher area game play.
---
If they scale it past the current maxes to the players(100+) then it could be considered a nerf as it would possibly take more then one shot to kill things. At the same time this would also possibly fix the problem of giving people a chance to tag mobs for exp and loot. While additionally adding more challenging game play at higher levels. Also as mentioned loot for higher levels would drop from current lower level areas. A nerf with benefits lol.
---
Only time will tell.
---
The original capacity was not intended(you just had to look at other rifles like the combat rifle for example to notice this) so it wasn't really a nerf.
---
The locks are there for a reason and its down to choice. I keep my ammo machine unlocked on purpose. 5.56 can be hard work at the start, i know it doesnt make loads but it helps people out. As I do with water and junk.
---
If u came to my camp and theres 200 5.56 sitting there, u wouldn't take it? Cos u think that would make u an arsehole?
---
Nope once you craft it you dont need another item to refuel it. But it does use your AP to work. So once thats empty gravity becomes reality real quick.
---
Just tried the Whitespring sack and it worked ok.
---
Well shit, I didn’t know that, how much is the chest piece? Also, can I wear a backpack if I have the jet pack on?
---
*cries in high fallout gravity*
---
i know we kinda gotta speak in code here.  are you talking about the through the door one photo one or the over everything into the final room one?  I saw angry turtle point out that the ceiling hole is now patched.
---
I launched solo...and then only 1 person came to help me fight the queen. Both of us around level 60 at the time. We failed. I've never gone back to launch again. 🥴
---
I suppose, in a sense... I mean the narrative is very vault-centric, so in a wayyy I was thinking it'd be cool to have a different pov of the first vault from the supermutants or ghouls, and make that feel more lived-in. I guess to narrow it down even more, cross out supermutants and make a friendly ghoul faction or smthng. I see these generic NPC ghouls at the Settlers and, from a role-playing point of view, I'm like, I wonder what's up with that guy, lol.
---
To make the game more like ESO or other MMOs I guess would betray some of the core values of the Fallout tradition. Ghouls don't have pipboys, for one. I'm sure there would be many inconsistencies to fill in, but I bet it would be fun anyway to see it somehow make sense.
---
Nice.
---
You just sit there and wait for the next season but yes endgame stuff is important
---
Yes with 16x the detail, surely.
---
Thank you!! I'm glad I'm not alone 😊
---
I’ve leveled up nine characters across two accounts.  Steal is crazy easy to find and I never needed that much.  But hey, if it’s too hard for you, then it’s just too hard.  Leave it at that.
---
I’m so confused how people do this. 
---
I dropped stuff and the paper bag appears. I log out and log in via anew character into the same world and see the paper bag in the ground. I go to it and the first time I see that there’s stuff in it but I can’t get any of it. If I move away and pass over the bag, it’s not empty. 
---
Same thing if I leave stuff in a case. Can’t grab any of it.
---
Are you not sneaking? Idk if anyone doesnt sneak and use a bow. But they usually have to pull all the way back then release in vats
---
Get rid of weapons/plans. I sold all my known plans for 1 cap and I freed up like 50 pounds. No 1st either.
---
At this point I stopped doing falsely accused because of that bug
---
Exactly, your build won’t be any weaker. The enemies are just going to be at an appropriate lvl. So 2 players with 0 perks cards or legendary items equipped will have the same dmg despite their lvl. But if one player has no perk cards and another has a full build there will still be a dramatic difference.
---
How are ya'll doing shit like this lol. I play for at-least 4-6 hours a day, do all the challenges and I'm only level 70 something.
---
No one would dupe that, lol.
---
Use the flamethrower glitch
---
Yes you can.
---
It also has a solid hit box that can trap you against a wall! I dropped some stuff in Nuclear Winter and it trapped me against a wall till I picked it up!
---
Lol wut?
---
Your not wrong it would be interesting to play as a ghoul or supernatant
---
Tried, where u destroy the item next to it and try to place?
---
Calm down....  its just mob scaling, so where ever you are mobs will scale to your level. You dont have to spam WhiteSprings/WestTek for exp anymore thats a good thing, a lvl 500 can grind exp in the forest exclusively if they so choose to....... yeesh jump to conclusions much Karen?
---
Those plans usually drop from scorchbeasts
---
Went over to donate but only had 212 steel , dropped it on the ground and surrounded it with mines . Duck  the bos
---
Ok, thanks for the advice, time to start grinding for treasury notes
---
LoL thankfully perk cards like action boy help it refill quicker. If you have enough room to fall for it to build up that is. But it also helps break your fall if your timings right. Ive lived multiple times jumping off the light house at the mothman event.
---
Really?  I haven't noticed.  That original award was whack.
---
My tiny mobile screen thanks you
---
Yeah. It only works with brick walls and you can still get double sided ones this way. Just replace the solid wall to another solid one
---
I'm glad to see this post not downvoted to oblivion. It's painfully obvious that some stuff is not really true RNG in this game but all the math nerds always shout down anyone who says so because they don't have 90 bazillion examples to prove their "theory".
---
I think the torso is 1250. The jetpack setup is worth every damn gold bar imo. 👍👍
---
I had it pre wastelanders but I think after the update it was gone, this is the first time since Ive seen it again
---
Yeah I sneak. The issue is when they spot me.
---
And 4 times the map size, of Fallout 76 base game.
---
I donated 14000 steel. Got a load of worthless consumables, 2 "rare" plans and 1700 caps.
---
Not worth it, Imo.
---
Maybe if it gave exp or some sort of rep or scrip but it's worthless as is.
---
Anyone else’s game keep freezing/crashing on PS4 ?????
---
Yeah I am truly sorry to hear about your experience!  
---
 what the fuck Bethesda, you can fuck your players over lie cheat and steal from us, and have no repercussions from that. But when a player tells you they didn't do something you through them under the bus without even looking into the matter further? What a fucking joke!
---
I wish you all the best! 
---
I would file a complaint with the consumer rights and protection agency in your county. Make them give you your money back.
---
Alright so its worth noting vats drains fusion cores faster
---
I have the action boy perk so I’ll just get starched genes and do some stuff to get bird bones to help, thanks
---
 I never knew about the magical health regen. Thanks.
---
What? Where did I say it's too hard and not easy to find?
---
You completely missed my point. Resource sinks aren't generally supposed to be for newer players, since newer players are going to need those resources as opposed to older players.
---
If you take a brand new player and give them 1,000 steel, vs a veteran. That newer player is going to do a lot more with that 1,000 steel than the veteran. Resource sinks are for older players to get rid/have a reason to use their resources.
---
Not working with brick
---
The carry weight bug where it would deduct to the negative.  Then you walk around with no limits.
---
Also the camp radio, which worked in beta then never worked for a while.  Not even sure when it was fixed 
---
Everyone going for the melee build and running glass cavern.  Really felt like a dungeon raid.
---
Vendor hopping, as there were different caps pools per faction.  
---
Whitesprings ghouls farm.  Whitesprings in general being active.
---
Squishy Deathclaws have me more concerned. And the fact im more terrified of Yao Guai stun locking me or Mire King yelling and slapping me around at the same time instead. They got me shrugging off those once scariest beasts of the wasteland. Real shame.
---
You're right but sadly in Bethesda's mind spending time on fixes doesn't earn them money, content does.
---
I don't have the quest with rocksy anymore 😕 i guess no more rep for me lol
---
You beached then fam?
---
Same here. Canceled: https://www.flickr.com/photos/189672939@N08/50194346441/in/dateposted-public/
---
No power armor, 1 handed idk what blodied or junkies are.
---
Do you have explosive frame?. I understand what you mean I run a bloodied blow and it gets hectic when I'm fount but I run max sneak potential with perks. Maybe add escape artist with your build ? Has great potential and if you run out of site and sneak almost always you'll lose the danger threat level
---
I never had to full pull in vats previously. You only full pull if it's a long distance
---
This kinda happened on my main account aswell - the quest started but after I logged off it disappeared and re-appeared about a month later.
---
You schould change Power Patcher, Portable Power and Gunsmith they are not so good but need so much points.
---
She does this since Wastelanders maybe even longer, they turned off her limb damage.
---
Yes it has to be actual steel not bulk steel sice you need the exact 250
---
Yeah it wasnt always like this but I think they tweaked it to have the design work better. Bc no one is not fully drawing a bow when they fire it irl
---
I'm bloodied with full thorn armor and explosvies
---
Haven't heard that one yet.
---
Unless I am mistaken there is no scrap box at the donation site. I might go drop 500 or 1000 but I probably would have dropped more of I could have just pulled it out of the scrap box while there.
---
My name is Terminator and I am a Fallout junkie, lol.
---
I can't help it but "I'll be back".
---
Me too.  I am level 69.  I guess they are xp boosting masters.
---
I personally dont want a graphics update , this game barely runs decent on a one x , I would rather the graphics stay the same and the game actually run somewhat smooth on the next consoles
---
Mmm nylon
---
People said that with RDR2, Anthem &amp; The Outer Worlds launches &amp; strangely the game is still chugging along. Cyberpunk will be no different.
---
According to the patch notes and my fights with the queen I don't think so
---
I'm going to assume I am wrong on this one. Still, I suspect we'll see it sooner rather than later.
---
I can’t figure out if it’s possible with the jet pack to land safely after falling off the lighthouse during path to englightenment
---
Yep. Was trying to level my heavy guns character a few months back and decided to give him my fully modded X-01 power armor suit. I don’t have first, so I really on randoms on my friends list, and right as I left with the first character the guy left, and I lost the power armor. A “share box” is a very much needed addition.
---
I understand the sentiment, happy to help. For all that this sub can get incredibly pissy, there's usually at least a few folks about who can offer genuine discussion or help.
---
Nothing. Majority of posts I'm seeing people are just ignoring this dumb event because its not worth it.
---
I mean technically that's a good thing. Keeps assholes from stealing your dropped loot before you can get to it
---
Yeah idk too much about thorn armor bc I never seen the need, but do you also have any mutations that send an aura when you are diseased. I think plague walker can get you in danger threat unintentionally. Other than that I'd just keep trying to sneak, shoot and back off. But the explosive effect on bows is loud even tho the bow is silenced you will still attract attention
---
That's what it is. If you mix everything in the game that boosts XP and have a high intelligence build anyway they can hit that 10k really easy. Add in doing westek Harper's ferry or hell even go into a silo and just farm the crap out of robots can bet so much xp it's crazy.
---
Are you kidding me? Right now there are only 2 viable locations to grind, One wasteland will open the whole map up to higher level players.  You clearly have not thought through this at all.
---
we really wont know anything until patch 22 hits the PTS. people here are saying it will be just like ESO, but bethesda fucks literally everything up so expect it to be a unmitigated disaster to avoid being blindsided.
---
Couldn't they pull up a log of ip addresses associated or logged into the account and provide it to the users? It would appear obvious if say X Ip stopped logging in on this day, but Y Ip from Russia starts logging in and duping away.
---
Perhaps this only happens in Nuclear Winter?
---
Me and my 2 best friends irl we do 3 queens each character in each account everyday. So it's 45 queens everyday. And then when we get bored... Limitless legendary hunting to get good stuff to give away for newbies in our community.
---
Max EXP boost its super important. And also switching public group type when Queen dies and event rewards kicks in
---
Crap i do the same thing! Lol
---
Edit: the worst is building  different things in a workshop haha
---
I would consider one more in Blocker, two Glow Sight or Exterminator, two more in Fireproofe, two in Tenderiser and 5 in Adrenalin.
---
Why not just take a break? Why force yourself to play if you have nothing to do?
---
Amen to that! Fuck the BOS, bunch of self entitled assholes, homme don't play like that! 
---
Where were you 22 months ago? thats what I thought! 
---
Go find your way somewhere else! Your not welcome back  you inconsiderate fucks!
---
The funny thing is the first person to sing the song had "  And he tried a brand new MOVE Which she did not appreciate”   
---
The Andrew Sisters changed it and intentionally tried to make it sound dirty. I guess they were pretty risque for the time, my father saw them often in Vegas. I also had to listen to him ramble for 30 minutes about Patsy Cline than another hour on music theory of the time and how giant steps by Coltrane is the only true masterpiece in the 1900s .That is officially why I do not ask about music anymore though his record collection is something else.
---
Maybe it was the first server I was on or something. It was buggy then all of a sudden disconnected. It kinda seems like its normal now. I was doing project paradise and had to use 2 repair kits but only used like 300ish rounds
---
My Excavator Power armor won't move.   The condition is all over 100% on each piece of it, but the damn thing gets stuck everywhere and won't move.  It'll eventually unstick but the moment I stop moving it is a pain in the butt to get it going again.
---
Some people like to explore and just have fun.

Was it the bug that forced you to restart the quest?

It literally has no effect normally. Thor gives you improved sneak
---
Brilliant play. I wish it was easier to find Nuclear Winter matches in Aus. I find myself waiting upwards of 5 minutes for a game
---
I thought it was just a hat,  is there an outfit also somewhere?
---
We are using a downloaded copy. I might try that just for shits and giggles. Bethesda hasn't gotten back to us
---
Goat legs? Bird bones?
---
That's pretty sad. Atoms were kinda better
---
Well I found a workaround already
---
Build a foundation floor and attach a 2nd foundation to it. Now attach a wall, and attach a flat roof to the 1st foundation. Next add a second flat roof (attached to the first roof) over your 2nd foundation. Finally add a “floating” wall attached to the bottom of that 2nd roof.
---
Now delete the second foundation. Delete the 2nd roof. You should be left with the floating wall still.
---
Hope this helps, i only tried it in a workshop but a camp should be ok too
---
So that and the deep pockets for SS and the other bug fix for clothing are all not actually fixed? WTF!
---
If you're banned it won't let you log into the game at all, so OP wouldn't be able to tell if their password was changed. This exact thing happened to my fiance and they eventually unbanned him but when he got his account back all his stuff was gone and he suddenly had four new characters filled to the brim with legendaries
---
Broken Rippers. BOS recruitment flyers. Frag grenades and hot dogs.
---
Thank you a TON but no I'm actually switching from energy tank shotgun ninja ik at lvl 92 it's hard to switch builds but even before when I was mowing down everything in my path with a vamp L gat and a 2s ex gat pl I could not get ANYTHING good to drop, even if it was a good day and I managed 40 various 3 star kills it just didnt seem to roll anything better than like the occasional 2 star 50 cal nocturnal...
---
I actually like the concept as you can see the damn thing in the rubble/grass etc. for me though it just has a bitch and whinge and doesnt work.
---
I feel yeah, it sucks. But hey at least they released a free mascot outfit and backpack skin to make up for it
---
Yes, I got pasted the assaultron and then was unable to retrieve the power arm to proceed.
---
they need to add a repeatable rank 101 where you can get lunchboxes perk packs gold bullion and scrip.
---
oh look it's the guy who unironically sells .44 for three caps
---
No one
---
Cushioned legs helps, but really it's about keeping your drop speed low during the entire fall time.  The physics are kinda fucked with it.  Even if you slow down to an almost stop at the end, if you were falling fast earlier in the drop you'll take damage.  Short bursts down the lighthouse the whole way, never going fast, is the sweet spot.
---
Ah okay, well idk man that should be putting you in a good spot maybe thorn is bugged, wouldnt be surprised. Your hard work to get the armor and something is wrong with it. I doubt it but if a full set plus sneak perk plus bloodied I'm guessing unyielding 3 pieces at least you should be sneaking well enough to clear whitesprings and west tek no problems unless your in pure light. Light in this game throws your sneak off like crazy
---
Seems like a dick move, but then again, even a new player prolly wouldn't pay 3 caps for .44
---
They said any game that goes to next gen will have free upgrade but haven’t said anything beyond those two games yet
---
Uhm well if they add more rewards (i mean repetable ones, like gold bullion and scrip, not cosmetic stuff) for heavy grinders it's not a bad thing
---
Some sort of bug I've been messing with. Equip your fireworks, dont throw them, just equip them and you'll have ridiculously increased reload speed. If you have a weapon with the 15% faster reload effect you can basically continue firing before the reload animation even finishes
---
Improvements? Knowing Bethesda, if they bring it to next gen at all, all they would do is the absolute bare minimum for the game to work on the new platform.
---
No graphics improvements, no additional features. Just enough to get it running and nothing more.
---
Oh, and they'll sell new bundles exclusive to that platform.
---
Since you played the game normally then, and diverted your ammo component resources to killing scorched for no personal rewards, couldn't you play normally now and divert excess scrap to the community event instead of your scrap box. For example when I run Line in the Sand and Uranium Fever, I net almost 1k in steel and that goes to the community event every time I play.
---
Just wait two months for double-sided walls to be announced and nine months for the patch that brings them. Only for the walls to cause a hidden bug and they need to be put off till the next patch when they can be fixed. And just to bring the hypothetical back full circle, the walls then stop being talked about and they never release.
---
Laugh it up, just note I'm on my 7th junkies weapon after months of not seeing 1
---
I refer you to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/i4n2u8/same_same_same/)
---
Don't forget the cork, ad vinum!
---
I’ve been here since the beginning. It’s better than it was, but it would be nice if it was at least 1000, just for ocd’s sake.
---
Each queen is around 100 points, so it's 4.5k points everyday (well, was) just by doing queens.
---
Just keep a firework in your hand. Reload speeds are basically gone.
---
Thats not totaly right because Bethesta sayed that there still will be high level areas becaus some enemies like Scorchedbeasts dont spawn at low levels.
---
Fuck!!! Ya caught me I’m so jelly🙄🙄🙄🙄 what truth I feel like you are supposed to be making me feel bad or something but I don’t.........so I don’t know where you are going with this🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Same same.
---
This is my theory on legendaries as well. Thing is, you can't reproduce it. So nobody can verify it. And people call you lucky, not observant.
---
No idea what, if anything, causes it. You basically have to play and wait until you find yourself on a lucky server. But it's certainly worked for me. 
---
The trick is to stop after 2 or 3 tries. If it's not working, hop servers and hunt down some more test subjects. Don't let that one half way decent drop fool you. Gotta have patience.
---
Lots of new players don’t know the nuances yet and just let the game set the prices.
---
Lol how long have you been gone for?
---
Sure, I did it. Although it took time. :D
---
Yeah, that's not happening.
---
I'm talking about how things are now, not how you'd like them to be.
---
Why keep playing if there is nothing to do?
---
No, I see level 100s doing it
---
If you get the flea stash box, you could even park it at your base!
---
I went from tossing Ammo, to keeping some, now back to tossing Ammo again
---
I was a builder so im there in the camp a lot and have seen person after person go from one thing to another picking the locks and taking all my stuff. I have grabbed a thing or two myself but lots of people just surf camps instead of building themselves.
---
Any good drop? My buddy got an AAE Fixer as a reward today.
---
The thing I found with the gravestone is it is similar size and shape as a paper bag.  This though doesnt seem that way and the loot inside is on the edge only. You have to guess what edge.
---
Oh man totally, I'm always like: did it say walls or floors, or did it say wall decs and floors decs? I always check like three time and I ALWAYS get it wrong
---
Where do you get that from lmao
---
I'm literally telling you the truth, bethesda won't ban him for having 100k ammo
---
And who tf cares if he has 100k ammo, ITS AMMO!!!
---
Well that sound awesome! Post apocalyptic worlds should be barren. This should be a hardcore server dang it!
---
Fan nerd demands 'immersive as fuck'  Bethesda delivers.
---
I got some scrip armor:/ oooo nice!
---
But you get the idea
---
Outliers don’t change the overall principle
---
I want to fill up newbies in my community on discord. That's what I do, since i have almost anything in the game. (What I miss is Gauss perfect stuff of any kind).
---
But.
---
I wanted something to do for me too.
---
Which is why I said ‘some’. 
---
I just laugh and move on when I see ridiculous prices.
---
Yeah this isn't a bash Bethesda comment but holy fuck its so much worse now.
---
-Convert 1x @(x) please....
---
-YOU DON'T HAVE (X).
---
-Ummm... Okay, next ammo...
---
-Convert 1x @(X) please....
---
-Okay what DO I have you fucking shit heap??
---
Yes thats right 👍
---
But that lava lamp is a precious pre war tech we need for um... protecting humanity...
---
I dunno much about Power armor,but I went too craft some pieces too break down,for said challenge,&amp; couldn’t...
---
Although I know I know plans,but I also didn’t try too hard as I was getting off to cook dinner.
---
But I figured it’d be like crafting anything else,&amp; I was apparently sadly mistaken
---
At least it would be clean coding.
---
Others have covered it but also bloodied (the build package not just the legendary effect) could do with a nerf. It's insanely OP &amp; the downside isn't much of one at all.
---
When your sitting in parking lot at work during shift change and click on random ass link to have this Blair threw car stereo.  At this point I was committed and let it play
---
I have that 'give Ward X' glitch too. Made making friends with Foundation easy. Now to see if the PA works.
---
Ready to drop the illest album in Appalachia! Straight 🔥!
---
Well, someone once posted on here that computers aren't good at generating random numbers, so they need a leaping off point, a seed of some type. Apparently it could be anything, like the characters name, or maybe a server identification number. That could be it. Whats interesting is everyone knows its random, but I'm always wondering if its weighted in some way. Like items are pulled randomly from a list, but somethings have a higher chance of being selected. And whats weird is no one ever provides any information, data mined or otherwise. I'd think by now some people would get together with a 1000 script each , pair up on different servers, and record what they get from the purveyor. But whatever, I'll be over here with my stack of legendary bone clubs.
---
Cuz im a melee build primarily i dont need tons plus mine is locked up and i always have what i need. So no i wouldnt.
---
I’d like to think so, but my guess is they’d release something like this with a larger camp update. I’m betting on it coming with the instanced interiors in winter, but there may be another camp update sooner.
---
Yes. I've done it fully legit (done all the sections) as well as speedrun via the known glitches. You just have to have the right gear to deal with the assaultrons and gutsies, so if you find either troublesome you may have problems completing it solo.
---
Oh, and if you're going to do it without glitches an explosive gun or grenades is recommended, as well as enough circuits. The former is for quickly destroying the mainframe cores in the third segment of the map, the circuits are for quickly manufacturing replacement mainframe cores.
---
No Bethesda sayed there will still be high level areas becaus as an example Scorchedbeasts dont spawn at level 5. I hope i could help.
---
How did you come up with 18000? Full set is 6900 + 1500 for mods (chest + legs).
---
I read it wrong🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ I’m sorry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
sometimes I think about helping Ace burn their camps down
---
Ghouls are just lazy feeders. 😀
---
Already have.
---
Really wish teammates weren't hogging the stimpaks right now.  It should not be taking a dozen matches to complete the challenge.
---
I was just running a new character through to get my level up for the daily and definitely ran into this guy.  Just gave him a heart and logged off as I hit level 3.  Great experience
---
And... yall dont have anything else to do? some dishes maybe? feed your pets ? get some sunlight?
---
I love salty grapes don't you?
---
Now she may see it. She doesn’t get notifications if she’s tagged in the post, only in the comments.
---
I agree. That's why I roll with a .44 and a grenade launcher or a fat man.
