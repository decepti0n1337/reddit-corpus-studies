I kinda like that the grinders can get in on the action too. Even if they aren't with the pvp. When the ronin helmet was new, everyone was wearing it to flex, but now people try and come up with their own look in winter
---
---
---
I really like this new Christmas melody in the ATX, it would be a great addition to the normal radio but that might not happen. the took months to add the NW song, as far as I remember.
---
your best option is probably to read about the new problems and decide wheter those are going to affect/annoy you and then make a decision .
---
Oh... oh my. You weren't kidding. I guess now really is a fantastic time to take a break from this game.
---
Do you enjoy pain?
---
So say I want the metal armor paint. When do I start playing to unlock it?
---

---
With the Halloween event, there was no purpose to start grinding until the 'day' it was made available.
---
Crouch reload. The old 250 fix is now for armour
---
I believe we were. 
---
Now its really important because everyone who used to run Bloodied is trying the zerker route today.
---
They keep doing it.... it keeps getting karma farmed... 
---
Bethesda is really messing up here, even still. They do not want to take this game seriously.  That's fine. Make dem dosh doe!!!!!!1111!!!!
---
Lol. Just tested my quad explosive harpoon gun. 100% to broken like 5 shots. Usually can clean out West Tek and have a little durability left over. Thanks for posting. I would have been trying to figure it out still. Didn't expect this much of a disaster from BGS.
---
Too much effort.
---
Wear pa, go in full health, run vamp gear, grab the pylons and shoot like hell
---
Thanks!
---
Wait. Go enjoy other things in life that aren't on a screen.
---
Mmmm cake. Happy cake day
---
Then they change it to Mac and cheese and trifold flags. 
---
Please no more armor pieces though I would be happier with outfits and plans since everything jams armor into my inventory its all I get
---
Like I said, it depends on if the chance is cumulative or not. If it's simply 1% per minute, then that doesn't mean you have a 60% chance per hour. It just means you have a 1% chance each minute of it happening.
---
They don't love PvP. These people are trash players who have no skill, so they rely on legendary weapons, armor, and exploits as their crutch. They would never show their faces in NW, because it would be humiliating for them. They get a thrill out of the negative attention they get from you when you react poorly. If you want to ruin their day, the best thing you can do is ignore them. Don't message them. Don't interact with them. Block them in-game and through whichever platform you use and then change servers. They won't be able to follow you, and they won't get what they wanted from you.
---
Is this quoting the patch notes? I still hope it's not going to be like this.
---
The winter armor skin with snowflakes looks great! The decor items are also not bad. NW grinding inc for me. Thanks, Sage for the quick work &amp; share :)
---
I think itll be fixed before free days. Or free days will be bumped a bit. Cant have free play days with this going on. 
---
Bethesda has responded several times saying they are working on it at this point, but thats all ive seen.
---
When u reaload any weapon, primary legendary mods of ur armor pieces stop working until u put them off and on again.
---
Non-cumulative how would you calculate that?
---
Ugh, I know, those disgusting Syringer barrel using griefers! There's so many of them though; which one? [Which barrel were they using?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EF6kB9q4vg)
---
That actually sounds awesome. Pics of this by chance? Did you decorate it for Halloween?
---
Perception is fine...take out lockpick and max rifleman.
---
Strength should be 3 with Barbarian maxed....you will pick up carry weight with your unyielding peices
---
Endurance should be 10-12 with adam skeleton, rejuventaed, ironclad (max), and lifegiver as your focus
---
Charisma 1-3..I run 1 on my bloodied build as I mainly run solo...3 if you want to share cards on team..I run Lone Wanderer 1
---
Intelligence i run 3 with Nerd rage maxed
---
Agility 12 or higher... Dodgy, action boy/girl, evasive, covert ops for rifle, adrenaline
---
Luck 10 or higher...Must have starched genes and class freak and all mutations associated for this build, serendipity is a must
---
There are many ways to go with this build, I ran a bloodied rifle build for a long time, carrying only two weapons for regular everyday use....Bloodied lever action and Bloodied AR....for SBQ I used power armor and a TSE Gauss rifle and switched power user in the agility slot because nerd rage does not matter in PA...you can switch out card as you need them....no need to have picklock or any crafting cards equipped at all times.
---
You can move some cards around also...With a rifle build you can run only 2 in serendipity since you will not be up close and maybe put one in 4 leaf clover or luck of the draw....must haves for bloodied, starched genes, class freak, nerd rage, adrenaline, ironclad, barbarian....these all need maxed out for max DMG resist.
---
Yay more Bushwookie simulator for me!
---
completly true my dude. what if this gamemode dies out all of the maps gonne stay small forever then. i mean whenever they add a event and make the game free for a limited time and influx of people happen and then you'd get to play the gamemode but after a few weeks of nothing happng with fo76 the game will just be small all the time on pc all i get was max 25 ppl every damn day. and after an updated 30-40 ppl playing. so we better get use to this stupid map thing or we just stop playing the game entirely i mean what is the point in optimising a build for explosion or shotgun if you'd ever only find 3/4 crates that contain nothing you'd shoot good with. i had a player in my team that had been running around aimless with a knife because the other dude kept hoarding all the loot from player kills and chests.
---
You've got to be patient, they will add it in some months :P Slow progress here. There is a broken toilet &amp; bath in-game already though, not proper but it would work if we're talking in realistic terms.
---
This will require a minimum of 25 average 1st place finishes, equal to 10-11 hours of gameplay.
---
Wait...can yiu explain how to get there again?
---
[I would never do such a thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
But not the pint sized slasher mask or costume... both of which explicitly state mask and costume in the name. Nice.
---
Lol
---
The 10 rolls I did were on the same server yes.
---
Get in and check the first terminal. If it's slow hop server and save your time. If you see multiple nuke zones it's best to move on as well. Server could be having a rough time and every second counts in the raid.
---
Done you one better than a screenshot.
---
https://youtu.be/V0tMArV58GQ
---
You can see the DR in the pipboy drop after reloading then fix itself after removing and then putting back on.
---
Thanks man! Unfortunately, I'm on Xbox, but I appreciate it nonetheless.
---
I logged on and it said it was under maintenance. I assumed that was the update. What i hadn't assumed was that i actually had to start an update as well. Oh me 😆
---
No worries ur welcome
---
Also, are you on XBOX...I can probably set up with a decent set of UY armor for pretty cheap...I hold on to every piece I get...even a one star set of scout or forest is a good start when you put the polymer mods on
---
*Kicks can* Fucking embarrassing!
---
During the busiest time of year. 
---
So ok some bonus points there but they lost it on the follow-through. 
---
Last time the issue was not opening up the gate on all of it from day one and making it so we all had to spend the entire weekend either dying from hackers or sitting in a bush. 
---
Wow great gameplay there. So happy to participate in keeping NW alive while having such a alternatingly boring / frustrating experience when you actually try to play as intended. 
---
This time they repeated those same poor decisions but doubled down so the XP doesn’t aggregate but resets each time and raised the goalpost so it takes even more XP to reach the final and arguably most desired reward.   
---
Seems somehow worse this time around imho because any gains from the time generosity are sucked out of the room by the audacity of the XP gates.
---
Hey u/ Ladydevann can you add this to the list to report as well, tried to have another 1st subscribers join my private world and they can't join cause we aren't in a team even though I am set to all friends, and I see no option to join a team, leave a public world staying on a team to be able to join their private world
---
How do you get started?
---
grow up and stop crying about a video game begging for attention because you lost some junk. Nobody cares that you're not gonna play.
---
I was playing in NW and saw a glowing mongrel on the road. As I pulled the trigger, I legitimately saw him roll around on his back, playfully. I actually shouted, "Noooooooo! He just wanted to be a good boy!" lol so adorable. I felt awful.
---
Im in CA, psn is ilovepuppies
---
No guarantees but I'm down to help you out
---
Really? They dont bother me
---
Crickets on the other hand...
---
It may take more xp, but they give you more time. It evens out. Same out of xp/time available.
---
Have you tried inviting your team while you guys are at the main menu instead of already logged into a world?
---
Well now we know why they took over a year to fix the +250 dr bug. Apparently it wasn't as simple to fix as many people imagined.
---
Since the latest update?
---
explains alot the pc sphere is just broken it's not fun anymore. cheaters all day and people hoarding stuff then if you'd only find a bit of loot i let my teammate die just because he loots but can't aim so i could use his grenade launcher he took and wasn't using. but yeah useally i will find 2/3 grenade launcher now. only 1 if lucky. the only thing this updated encouraged me was to do was to more kill monsters for stimpaks and maybe armor.
---
I am level 101 and still don’t get all the gun stat speak for this game, so I have no idea what this break is. I feel so dumb and underpowered.
---
i thought it was broken too - but rather unintuiative if i press the "team only" button all on my list can join
---
Oh. OH. INKNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
---
My xbox does that to me sometimes too. I have it set to auto update, but sometimes it forgets? Idk. So i usually still check for updates as soon as i turn it on. Nothing worse than looking at 100+ games, finally deciding what to play, and BOOM! update required. Lol.
---
Delete this it’s a spoiler.
---
Also I'm just going to go ahead and not play till they patch this.
---
It’s the worst when you die during a queen or Encryptid event
---
Takes me about 50 minutes to 2 hours to download a update for this game. That time doesnt include installing or preparing to update.
---
[removed]
---
I was gonna make a snide comment about a PRT, but you shouldn't need one for THIS kind if bug. Jesus.
---
As much as I'm interested in that "Winter" armor paint, I've got family obligations, and other games on the go right now. It'll be unlikely I even bother to grind for it. Hiding to win in NW feels cowardly and shouldn't be rewarded.
---
Congratulations. Not everyone has good isp’s available at a reasonable price in there area.
---
I think itll teach us to start being quieter. I see the crossbow making a comeback because apparently everyone is running around naked. Lol. 
---
But yeah so ill change it to "For me, on xbox. These changes in NW seem to work and flow very well."
---
Man these should have been Adventure Mode rewards and those ones be NW.
---
Scrap Kits. Piece of Mind or Pay to Win? Tonight on Channel 7 Nuclear News.
---
Get syringer plan, craft and scrap em to learn mods.
---
Its not the griefers ruining the game its the entitled whiny crybabies, its the wasteland nut up and fight back
---
How do we get the quest o o?
---
thank you for sharing this masterpiece.
---
Do you have any evidence of this?
---
Downloading the update now. As someone who relies on unyielding and bolstering and does not use 250 dr weapons, it doesn’t look like the “fix” is going to benefit me in any way.
---
Confirming. All weapons and armor broken after a couple of hours of weekly challenges.
---
In case you still need, I can help you out.
---
PSN: The_Harmassist
---
Just send me a friend request and write a message in the friend request so I know who you are!
---
The genius is, QA testers are paid employees, whereas we're paying Bethesda for the privilege of testing their game.
---
Test servers should be for balancing and catching little bugs that are hard for QA to catch.
---
Crap like this shouldn't be reaching even a public test server.
---
Grafton Pawn shop, it;s an unmarked. Gotta worked it out for yourselves. Good luck.
---
I’m pretty solitary but feel free to add me, psn is same as here
---
Thanks! I'll try hitting you up when I am on tonight. PSN: anticlockclock
---
There is no quests. Just unmarked clues.
---
Lol. Ruh-ROH!!
---
Reload while crouching doesn't remove the effects but switching weapons still does.
---
Remember that this is the same company that accidentally patched in an old version of the game.
---
Do you mean hardened mass because glowing mass is in the aid menu.
---
My camp is constantly firing missiles at itself, and is in a place where I need them because of enemy attacks. I just started letting my camp be all busted and disconnected the turrets. The only thing that really stinks is when the generator goes down, so my vending isn't visible on the map. Everything else I can live without for now.
---
You were spot on, set it to team only and my friends can join, a little confusing for sure
---
Yup now im spending more time in loading screens than playing. At least before if I was sneaking I could have a good chance of the last 10, now it's just a bloodbath.
---
Your camp goes under Todd Howard's pillow at night.
---
If you're gonna mention Street Hawk...  need I dredge up Manimal?
---
It just works!!
---
It happens when you reload.  I'd switch to melee for now if you can
---
How tragic. Hope you're doing ok
---
Yeah and they'll realize it's pointless because bloodied still works and gets the highest damage increase since the armor thing doesn't affect weapon prefixes.
---
Maybe for you but for the rest of us this ain’t it chief.
---
Glad I found a post below showing the rewards. I now know I don't gaf about these rewards.
---
You can, but then I'm going to mention Werewolf.
---
Happens when you reload weapon.
---
Born in 84. I watched them both and could not tell you which I prefer. They were among my most watched shows growing up.
---
Tell that to someone who uses unyeilding armor in a melee build.
---
My guess: Understaffed, poor communication, and 80% of their development effort is focused on Wastelanders. 
---
We already know that they're patching TO Wastelanders, and need to reverse-patch the same fixes to the actual current live version. 
---
Honestly it sounds like their whole system is a disorganized mess.
---
I’m paraphrasing, but yes, it’s in the patch notes
---
My armor is just fine...UY bloodied
---
If you're grinding NW, you're doing it wrong. It's meant to be fun and a way to bond with friends! Not everyone can win, but there's a lot more to it than grinding and boredom.
---
But the armor is only broken on reload. So if its a melee build, their armor should be fine. Melee is about the only build not affected
---
There's a third-star legendary effect that sometimes rolls on ranged weapons which grants an additional 250 damage reduction while you're reloading. But not only did this effect not work, it had the even worse side effect of negating the first-star effect (Bloodied, Junkie's, Vampire's, etc) when you reloaded that weapon. You could fix it by swapping weapons, but what a pain. This is a bug that had been present for months and months. With this patch, BGS fixed that bug but somehow managed to transfer it onto armor, so that when you reload your ranged weapon, the first-star effect on your legendary armor (Unyielding, Vanguard's, etc.) is disabled. You can "fix" this by unequipping and re-equipping your armor, which is...considerably more of a pain.
---
Thanks, I think I'll live.
---
Oh ok thank you/ sorry for the confusion
---
Why are you surprised? Every single day I hear about some new "feature" in this "game" that ya'll bitch about, which takes anywhere from 6months to never for these problems to be addressed.   
---
Stop. Playing. This. Trash. full fucking stop. Bethesda will never care about this game, it's literally a glory hole for them, ya'll are paying money to get face fucked by these people for no other reason than the brand name.
---
I'd love a complete list as well.
---
heres another scenario.   You are shooting at a SB in the air, because it wont land.  Then you reload losing your unyeilding effect.
---
Then it lands and you switch back to melee to pummel it, run in and do 15 damage because all your STR is now gone. 
---
I wont be running my melee build until they fix this.   Your welcome to continue using yours, but mine needs the specials.
---
It's a bug, or a way to tease it :p
---
You’d think but clearly Bethesda can’t even test for game breaking bugs.  Any time a game has systemic QA issues only a public test server has resulted in better patches.
---
That coat is not worth the hours then. Just gonna get the hunting rifle skin and then leave it
---
Changing weapons, reloading, and just random times while I'm shooting seem to remove it. I'm just fighting then, overencumbered and no ap. How am I supposed to play this? This needs to be fixed yesterday or yall need to revert this patch.
---
Sounds like you need to take a basic statistics course...
---
Didn’t realise how rare it was haha
---
Yeah just checked and I got it. I think the warhead literally hit me head on haha
---
If you're on PS4, my username is the same. Seems like we have similar paradigms.
---
Oh shit, I actually didn't think about how strongly this affected all the melee people are! That's a good point. 
---
Though bloodied does still have the highest damage output. And if you want to use high health because of the armor thing, then junkie's is still the way to do so because you can still get the DR of armor.  
---
In any case, I agree that berserker's should be buffed regardless of the armor glitch.
---
Yeah if u don't plan on ever reloading.
---
Fuck, until last year I couldn't get any speeds higher than 20. I jumped on the new highspeed internet when it finally made its way out here.
---
I played survival from lvl 21 onwards for 90% of the time. Miss it so much.
---
I mean, i see your point. Guess it doesnt really affect me, im always in a team. They do the shooting and i mop up the mess. I do have a shotty for when i do play alone to get the SB to land, but its a quad limb damage combat. Dont really have to reload too often
---
wow i didnt know that and that fucken sucks
---
Not sure what bundle it was in, tbh.  I bought it separate, though.
---
Path to enlightenment: 
---
Uninstall game to free up ssd space
---
Play something else
---
Check reddit every once and a while to see if it's worth another go
---
It's amazing your last post is about your shitty ISP...
---
There is an option for them to change between friends only and team only. The default after the patch is team only so they have to change it.
---
I heard the last update broke armor, like unyielding, upon reloading a weapon.
---
Agility also affect sneak, perception affects vats as does luck so unyielding armor is pretty OP in general if used properly.
---
Yes after game freezes for you enemies and the world is working normally what meant you can be killed.
---
Guess I’ll just log in, trade some legendaries, and go do something else.
---
Unless your name is karen, then its free
---
Yup, all the packages are in the game now as of Patch 16.  Found another at Van Lowe Taxidermy.
---
Until it's a feature available for Fallout First members.
---
Yeah, reloading your weapon now breaks all your legendary armor perks. Fun.
---
very true, but I didnt bring up those because everyone knows about the 5% dmg increase per STR point.   Most dont know the values of the agi and perception impact on sneak/vats/crits.
---
Happened to me last night 2 times on pc
---
its just a big fuckfest, 2-3 loot spots and 32 people in the lobby
---
What? That's crazy talk! /s
---
haven't had my game crash and freeze as many times in the past 2 months as i have had today smh
---
The custom radio mods in FO4 really were great... I remember reading something about modding private worlds in the future, so maybe there's a chance we'll be able to add our own radio station?
---
Reloading in Power Armour fixes the issue with losing legendary effect on standard armour.
---
I’d be satisfied with just a ‘key ring’ that if I *really*, ***really*** wanted to I could access further to see the specific keys.
---
TIL I found inner peace
---
So no lte? (Limited time event)
---
I hear ya. It was amazing. Was sad that each patch slowly brought about its death.
---
Reloading and switching weapons remove primary and tertiary armor effects. Thanks Bugthesda.
---
Bethesda has already said they hear us and they are working on fixing it. 
---
My guess is they spent today locating it in the code. Idk any of that stuff. Probably a hot fix sometime tomorrow or first thing thursday EST.
---
I'm sporting 5 pieces of unyielding armour
---
So that could be it then?
---
Thank you for your response
---
It is much appreciated.
---
I get a couple hundred lead a day picking up tin cans at certain locations, cuts down a little on steel farming as well

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
the Fridge and the Fermentor acutally use up camp budget when you use them, much like display cases. 
---
The stuff you put in your fridge and Fermentor count towards the weight cap of your stash box, and also count against your total camp budget.    
---
Using these items as a secondary storage is actually a detriment.
---
I'm going to say it again and I'm going to get downvoted again for even suggesting it.
---
This is a prime example of why there needs to be separate versions of the game for PC and console.
---
If you release an update for PC first then you can quickly hotfix the problems that pop up and then apply those fixes to the later console release.  But since we have to be nice and fair and release everything simultaneously across PC and console we're likely going to be stuck with this until they can push a cert for the hotfix through both Microsoft and Sony.
---
Sad, but true.
---
Yup. It sucks on the ego but it's fine, happened to me too but whatever, I never carry anything valuable on me so at least I saw something different happening on this game for once. People are just searching for something to do on this long drought we are in...
---
That's not new.
---
This has been around for a while.  Mod 13 or 14 I think it was when this started.
---
No... for everyone. Math doesn’t change.
---
Bashing on miniguns can be fun though
---
Born ride on the savage divide
---
MFW 100% of Fallout 1st players now play the game in a subscription based solo mode.
---
I’m far removed from school. Thanks for the help anyways
---
Yes. Though Dark Craving would be nice too...
---
Cause then I could freak out the Docs out there.
---
Just tested with everything I own. Not one weapon had any changes in damage.
---
Yep. Really incentivizes them to fix the game.
---
That really doesn't sound like much fun at all. I have a full WWR set but since getting rid of my mass of weapons I've realised most of my weight is in ammo. 500+ plasma cores, 300+ Fusion, and they take up most of my capacity, even with WR perks. This game encourages hoarding and then punishes you for it. It's not fun. But once in a while, once I've freed up enough space to sprint and fast travel, I don't know what to do in the game
---
You're not wrong.
---
Buy marsupial it's the best caps I've spent I can now jump 3xs as high  but -4 intelligence I think? Plus it ups your carry weight.
---
Different people have different experiences.  Have your own yo figure out. Good luck!
---
Cut it with some medx and pop a hallucinogen canister!
---
Maybe? I mean who knows. It sounds like settlers and raiders won’t be the only npcs though. Cultists are at least confirmed in a screenshot.
---
I agree, I run a full UNY/WWR for my sneak bloodied VATS crit commando build and it's amazing.  So obviously I'm mad lol.
---
I've also been slowly but surely trading all my quality weapons away so that I can get the armor set to be matching heavy combat armor. So course I'm not happy at all that the armor set that I've worked so hard and given up so much for to get is now broken.  That being said, my bloodied commando weapons still shred through health bars like nothing.
---
Context
---
I'd be fine with incoming Camps overriding my Pay Tent

Yea

Stop giving Bethesda money. Everyone. Please. No more Atomic Shop purchases. No more 1st. Your wallet is the only thing Bethesda cares about. Remove your money from the equation and they will have no choice but to listen. Keep giving them money for a broken game and the game will remain broken.
---
They said there will be several subfactions
---
It’s an unlockable plan in the new Christmas event.
---
MMOG Fails, mentioned it in one of their replies to someone who commented on a blog post
---
They deserve the money through subs because they made an awesome game entitling them to their profits.
---
Ahhaahahahahahahahha! It just works.
---
I’m in the same boat with the greenhouse too, I own all the plants etc I really wanted the big rocket when it came back, but I already owned the red rocket jumpsuit and pipboy paint I couldn’t justify spending the atoms just for it.
---
I’m in hour 5 of 32 to download this new patch 🙄
---
i didnt know zenimax was selling...
---
there will be bugs regardless that have to be worked out whether it’s a year from now or tommorow. Bethesda, release the Wastelanders! That is all...
---
I think as far as sneak is concerned the higher agility the better chance of not being seen....therefore whatever the amount of 'covert ops' one has determins the bonus.  As for vats crits......I wonder what the bonus is too.  All I know is that mine are doing +40% but of what?  Base damage?
---
For the millionth time this has been posted today. 
---
Bethesda knows. They are working on it. 
---
Most likely a patch before or on thursday morning EST. Most likely fixed before free play days.
---
They'll fix it.  Probably in the middle of tonight.
---
Also don't pre order the Cyber truck wait till they have a final concept..
---
Honestly you are more toxic than people that use exploits to kill you if you think they deserve to be dangerously allergic to something for stealing something from you in a virtual fantasy world.
---
Time for me to wear the clown costume again 🤡
---
Have you reported this to the Support Team with a ticket?  They will respond to this much faster than the off chance that one of the Community Managers happens to see this.
---
ZeniMax has a valuation of 2.5 billion dollars (estimated as it isn’t publicly traded). Honestly it’s profitability is probably why the bugs occur- squeezing every last dollar out while spending as little as possible.
---
lol i hope Microsoft buys them fires them all and hands it over to obsidian lol.
---
Devs are literal monkeys, all I have to say
---
This sub is so precious. Everyday i see suggestions and ideas on how to improve the game even though it’s clear as day THEY AREN’T LISTENING AT ALL
---
Radrats refuse to die
---
You're right. Everything else is small game, and only supplemental really. You'd have to find 300 paint cans scattered all over the map to match the Lucky Hole Mine's bounty
---
jesus christ i'm lucky i use power armor 90% of the time
---
You realise new Vegas team have all left. Outer worlds was severely disappointing,
---
thats your problem
---
Just let em vent. Theyre not the one who can't seem to finish a game that has been out for over a year
---
I left mine for an hour and when I came back it had 1 raw fertiliser in it. No joke.
---
Why not just go sneaky? Use Nuka Nut and Quantums to keep taking the pylon damage? I only need a handful of Quantums max to finish the event.
---
I use a furious combat shotgun some psychobuff and ballistic buck, maybe a nuka grape if my rads are high.
---
I always just use my vanguard armour with harder to detect while sneaking.
---
Agi doesnt affect the damage bonus from perks. 
---
Agi affects your total AP, ap gain, and sneak (not to be confused with the sneak perk, which doesnt care what your AGI score is)
---
Luck affects your vats meter and fill rate.  
---
The SPECIALs themselves dont affect your damage, only the perks you choose from the tree.
---
Yeah the concept of fun doesn't sneak in very often when you are playing inventory management simulator. The ammo weight is killer. I specifically avoid energy weapons just because of ammo weight since there are none that go totally weightless. That's the awesome part about ballistic with bandolier, when I have too much steel I just make sure I have enough acid hit lucky hole and turn all that weight into 0 weight .45 ammo. Literally the only things I don't hoard in this game are raw ore and explosive ammo.
---
I've had someone show up and start blasting the house I was in the middle of building. I was a bit naive at the time since this was ages ago so I disabled pacifist mode and tried to fight them off but they pretty much just killed me in one hit with the ridiculous balance of melee weapons and resumed blasting my house. I didn't even had anything to drop. That was fun I guess.
---
Kind of wish pacifist mode would have some kind of defense against PvP damage to player-made structures since it costs a lot more to repair your entire home than to repair a single melee weapon or make a 180% ammo a few times over. Perhaps pacifist mode could use a revamp?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Was also griefed by the game at one point when I loaded into an area, got out of my power armor, I think to change frames but I don't recall. Nothing happened though, it felt like I'd been disconnected until things finally loaded in and I was standing in 3 nukes. My character then caught up and proceeded to exit the power armor and refused to get back in due to the heavy lag and alas I was on the way to sell a lot of stuff in Whitesprings so that's also nice. 
---
Would love to see something dealing with multi-nukes as well since standing in several nukes at once isn't exactly good for performance.
---
Vent where everyone else is venting then. Oh wait, had they done that they would have seen the response from Bethesda.
---
Everyone knows. Bethesda is working on it.
---
"response from Bethesda." * *Doubt* *
---
I'm ootl, what's wrong with strangler pa?
---
I guess what kind of makes me mad is that I know they have the money to pay testers and more people to work on updates for this game, but it feels mostly abandoned and unloved at this point in favor of other projects.
---
I've been playing since beta and cannot answer this question. When I get back on in a couple hours I'll test that out.
---
I mean, why not test this shit out first. I'd much rather have it offline longer if it meant this stuff wouldn't happen.
---
They might actually fix the patch before you finish downloading it.
---
That's a good point. I am usually quick to criticize people complaining too. Definitely jumped the gun posting this.
---
I didnt say it was a great response. I said they responded. 
---
Then i used common sense to get to the next part of my conclusion. I have also never said that BGS said it would be fixed by then. 
---
I strongly agree there is a need for beta testers at this point. I agree with being upset we are still getting content in this state. 
---
Im saying to check to see if this is already being talked about before you post 10 hours after the update. Check to see whats up with it. Had you, youd have seen the responses and all the detailed convos about whats going on that are largely over the general consumers head. 
---
You is a general term here. Not personal.
---
Explains why my chameleon armor no longer works. Any word on when the hotfix for this is coming out?
---
Pretty sure it's 20% from top and bottom of health. Could be a bit more I'm not 100 on that. But mostly yes. Be a mid section of health where you would be with out either.
---
After today, I'll just be happy if they work at all.
---
Yeah, I noticed it with my Chameleon armor. I kept having to unequip &amp; equip it to get it to work.
---
Funny part is the rewards are just trolly attempts to lore people in instead of being items that nw players can use in nw.
---
Thats my only point. Lol. I wasnt tryna jump down your throat individually or anything. I apologize if that was lost in there. 
---
The "for the millionth time"  was just pointing out how many threads all say the exact same thing.
---
Free play days are coming for 76 again. I believe its the 12th to the 16th of dec.
---
For me, the things that brought me back to playing after time away were the lore, the atmosphere, and the chance to build new camps.
---
One provides more protection the lower your health, the other the higher your health. You will never get 100% benefits from both types of armor at the same.
---
The chant went wrong and the candle inside vault boys head has burnt my house down, fallout 1st cancelled
---
Say sike right now.
---
I bet they are watching but are like eh next eh next. This one? Eh next eh next.
---
It also acts as if your getting in and out of the power Armor making you overcumberd every time you reload
---
They've already announced a test server is in progress, I do not get why people keep suggesting this like it's something they haven't been getting told to do since the game released.
---
Ohhhh. The Bush Wookies are upset. Now I get it! 🤪
---
The best equipment you can have is your brain. Again, I can and have taken a Level 0 character with the default build and won the first and only round I played, including solo wiping an entire squad. I took THEIR gear once they were done with it. If the most important aspect of winning was gear, weapons, or build, then I would have lost. I didn't have a build or my preferred gear. I bet at least one person on that squad I wiped had everything they wanted for their build. How did I kill them all with my level 0 account? Put your theory into practice and tell me if it holds up. How did I win if I didn't have my gear or my build?
---
Today specifically? Hell no. The "patch" they just released broke most legendary items and halved durability on most guns.
---
OH! thank god for this warning sir ! I was about to invest millions! your brilliant break down of the situation at hand and the collective screech of this tiny portion of the  player base has saved me!
---
I believe the "defense rating" also reduces the actual FREQUENCY of attacks on your camp. There is a Defense Rating # associated with each type of turret, and those #s add up to your camps total rating.   
---
Higher # = fewer attacks. My main characters camp has a maxed out turret budget, including 3 missile turrets, 6 heavy laser turrets and a heavy machine gun turret covering a tight spot where wiring was hard...   
---
I very rarely get attacked, and when I do, I mostly am just retrieving bodies. (It does cut down on my decorating budget, as turrets chew up a lot of build space budget, and wiring high level turrets is a pain)
---
The other trick I use is to plant a "target" crop in the most frequent mob spawn spot, within line of fire of my turrets (in my case, a tato plant, but anything will work). Mobs often go for the plant first, and it gives the turrets time to warm up and engage before they get in close.
---
Interesting, this is not a 100% reproduction. I tried with 6 different guns, including legacy, 250dr, legacy with 250dr, etc - and I don't have this issue. Check stats &gt; shoot &gt; reload &gt; check stats. Each time there was no change. Did not notice a drastic durability decrease either, and I play with energy weapons exclusively.
---
Whatever they fucked up this time - it's difficult to pinpoint.
---
All prefix effects such as Berserkers, Unyielding, Chameleon are broken. Lucky for you then that the bug isn't triggering, but I have a hard time believing you since sure as heck the whole sub isn't lying. Maybe you're just testing it wrong.
---
We're talking about weapons here...
---
I'd laugh, but I'm at hour 2 of 36.
---
Yup, also challenges, scout badges, item collection... My current personal quest is to get just the right full set of armor. Same type (in this case Marine) with just the right legendary effects. This is not easy. I want my character to look awesome without having to put on an outfit to cover my mish-mash of armor types. All of these are best done solo as you aren't making sacrifices to the wants of the group, but you can still group up for the occasional SBQ or whatnot.
---
I've been playing fairly steadily since beta with the occasion couple weeks off and still find things to do.
---
Damn Bugthesda it's so very sad.🙁
---
Lost 100 carry weight for Excavator Armor. Been riding that razors edge for a year. Now I’m 100 over burdened. Can’t keep a strategy with game. I’m about to give up.
---
And that's why Bethesda will never do anything to fix the problem; they make money off of these people's behavior.
---
Obviously I have read all those posts. That's why I put on my hooded rags and stored all my firearms. I have 1300 hours in, so I have finished the game already, several builds, more than 400 levels combined. 
---
That doesn't make this patch less of a mess. They look like clowns, amateurs trying to make a small indie game work. This latest fix is the worst ever.
---
Severely disappointing? Disappointing that it wasn't longer, yes  but you mean to say it was a bad story or had bad gameplay?
---
What is the sensible thing for a person to do when they're in an abusive relationship?
---
What's your point here? Why did you post at all? And then you made things up out of whole cloth and got angry when people pointed out that you made things up?
---
I’m just hopin this patch makes it playable for me-haven’t been able to play since the last patch-satellite internet and online games are a bad combo
---
Others have said you can submit a ticket to be given the atoms you’re missing due to this
---
Same with weapons. Primary effects are doing less damage. Not sure exactly what is triggering it, as it is inconsistent. Some people reported that reloading while standing is breaking some weapon effects.
---
What is causing this to happen or is it just random? bc i was on for ab 3 hours after the update and had no issue running my legendary guns and unyielding armor
---
Same here. Ps4. Been running fine for months until today. Could just be a thing but who knows.
---
Ahh ok
---
it was in the scabber bundle
---
I didnt make things up. Go look dumbass. Its right there in blue and black and white. Pending on your settings. 
---
All i said was i dont know how to screenshot.
---
You do realize that even reverting to a previous version isn't as easy as flipping a switch right?  They can't just tell our games to go back and undo everything, it would require a hotfix to patch in the old build of the game and while that would be "easy" for PC it would still very likely have to go through a rushed cert with Sony/Microsoft for consoles.  Plus they'd have to go through and divorce the troublesome parts of the update from the holiday stuff or you'd be saying goodbye to Christmas stuff until they released a proper update.
---
Insert quality Livery Prime quote here.
---
One step forward. Two steps back.
---
Bethesda's main team is pretty bad at writing stories, so I don't have a lot of hope in their D team. I mean, they wrote the Pioneer Scouts quest and prokoted it as the best quest they've ever written. So ...
---
Ok.. well I just tried over 20 weapons mostly junkies but bloodied and furious as well. No changes to any of them no matter how many reloads standing or crouched/ prime or not.
---
Yea, its a Labor of Love but they make it hard
---
You didn't make this up?
---
&gt;Most likely a patch before or on thursday morning EST. Most likely fixed before free play days.
---
Then it's not triggering consistently. That makes it worse.
---
What does the Presidential stuff look like and the poly fiber power suit
---
Well they have fixed the Sentry Bot looping sound 3 times now. Go to Whitesprings and see for yourself how fixed it is in reality.
---
Im not sure what youre trying to say. 
---
Are you saying that i said Bethesda said that? Because its clear by the way its written that they did not. 
---
I also separated what bethesda said and the start of that by a huge space. Troll somewhere else.
---
I would be more apt to purchase Atom Shop bundles if Bethesda actually fixed and finished this game first.
---
I think OP means that, upon losing health, the effects of Vanguard will subside and the effects of Bolstering will come into effect at the halfway point or so, and thus provide an even DR between the four pieces mentioned
---
Or perhaps people are unaware that holding a damage number changing weapon will show that effect on all other weapons. Was confused when I first did junkies
---
What’s more risky than a Bethesda patch?  A Bethesda patch rushed out in 24h :(
---
During queen drops bugs fuck me up faster than anything. Stingwings are awful.
---
Reloading any weapon now breaks at least some of the legendary effects on your armor, most notably unyielding. It's also causing guns to break much faster than they should. I saw someone in another thread saying their harpoon gun went from 200% to broken in less than 20 shots, even while running gunsmith 5.
---
How about you wait until... I don't know... we see what the new reward structure actually looks like before we start bitching?
---
Sure you're going to be forced to unlock shit one at a time rather than having the exp accumulate through each successive reward but there's no telling just yet if the new holiday rewards are going to require as much experience as the previous ones did when we could cheat it.
---
I think Wastelanders has the potential for destroying the game completely, erasing files from other games, infecting your PC with viruses and more. Today's patch feels like Bethesda thinks we are all morons who will keep playing whatever they do. 
---
They are right, but still... Unacceptable.
---
I have had the same weapon set for ages. I know by heart how much damage I do to the Queen and today my numbers were lower. Same perks. Same food buffs. No chems as always. No disease.
---
They already have investors.  They're trying to make the company look good so that THEY can sell their shares at a profit.
---
Mostly Provenance Equity, but there are a number of others.
---
I am saying you made it up because it has no basis in fact. Why did you make up fake info in an attempt to diminish people's legitimate complaints?
---
Well given how many times the patches for this game have reopened or created new bugs...
---
I like this game, but it’s heartbreaking being the laughing stock of the gaming industry. Incoming YouTube videos blasting 76 again.
---
Yeah, that doesn’t make sense that a mobile platform would or could intersect with a (semi) permanent campsite. The camp should have first priority over a tent for world placement.
---
I reported this technique as an exploit and the response was ‘we don’t confirm exploits’ excuse 
---
me wtf
---
You dropped your clown nose and clown licence my friend...
---
Ok. So nothing is missing?  I lost armor last patch. Hoping nothing else disappears this time
---
I actually lol when I read your opening sentence.
---
Its not diminishing anything. Several times i have said i understand the frustration. Im not saying the bug doesnt exist. Im not telling them to not be upset. Im saying organize it a bit better. 
---
If you see that there are 800 posts about a subject. You dont need to make another. Add how you feel there. 
---
Nothing that has the words "most likely" in front of it is a fact. Thats how words work. Im not sure if you were aware.
---
Seriously? I don't really enjoy NW as is, and I thought last time was miserable for the 14k. I made the mistake of doing it one day early, and did the 7k plus some before realizing it didn't count for the 14k. Ugh. This is going to be awful. 
---
Hey BGS, not everyone enjoys playing your late to the game battle royale, so stop putting lengthy rewards to bait players into joining. Not only are you screwing your fans that dislike the mode, you're screwing the fans that *do* like the mode by getting half your teammates hiding in bushes for 20+ hours. It's a lose-lose for everyone.
---
"Their parents probably didn't know how to raise them right." Buddy they only pressed some buttons on a controller like it isn't that deep.
---
They nerfed workshops for some reason so I personally dont think munitions is worth it unless you WANT pvp
---
If you read all the shit, why wasnt it said there? Thats literally the only point im making. 
---
When there are 800 posts about one subject, other things get lost in the shuffle. Other good ideas or other complaints get snuffed out bc all anyone can see is this one issue. 
---
Just organize yourself a bit better is all im saying.
---
My MAIN objection is much more basic.   No one asked for the map size to be scaled to the size of the  lobby.   For those of us on consoles, NW was the one aspect of the game that wasn't broken and worked well since launch.  It didn't need fixing.
---
For those on PC, there are more serious problem that Bethesda has ignored, such as hackers and aim bots.
---
Ive seen alot of people complain about the unyielding being broken now. Since thats the only character i have atm i guess I'll just play something else for now. Anyone know if the trapper armor got fixed where it shows when you wear it with an outfit? Ive tested it with many outfits. Looted and crafted. Still shows through my outfits and backpack.
---
Me too. But worse than that.... mirelurk kings. 😱😱😱
---
Only happened to me two times and both were NW related. Submit a ticket and probably get them for free.
---
I understand your point, but the game is dying and this was a move made by the developers to create more interactive gameplay. I run a discord with 150+ and multiple people have said they wanted such a change. Your voice doesn’t equate to 100% of the community.
---
&gt;Im saying organize it a bit better
---
What have you done to encourage this other than whinging? Have you tried applying to be a subreddit mod? Or is the totality of your skills just complaining?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
It was good. Super short but good. I suggest people wait for sales.
---
I loved pillars games.
---
It's ok. You're aloud to curse online. Especially about this shit.
---
I’ve done this with 3 vanguard and 2 bolstering. I liked the idea at first but I’d rather not risk being lower in health. I’d rather stim up if needed to stay high and tank out with full vanguard. It is a fun concept that I liked for a bit but more in theory.
---
So?
---
A MOUNTAIN of bugs have been documented via posts, occasionally even recognized by Bethesda insofar as a "we've let the dev team know" or "we're looking into it". Then MONTHS pass with no resolution nor any visible work even being done on the issue(s) in question.
---
And how do you honestly figure there will be a fix by Thursday? This does NOT follow their track record in the slightest. Bugs, both new and old, tend to linger...
---
I don't think a multi billion dollar company is sweating too much if one of their products is not living up to impossible hype.
---
Make sure to turn in yer pip boy radio. I turned mine on when I was about to walk away. Gave that old FO feel.
---
Yet I have "friends" who would swear on their life that Fallout 76 is the better game.
---
Guess who in the group have not played The Outer Worlds.
---
Who made you the Reddit police? Piss off.
---
Upvoting for visability. If true, we need to investigate what *doesn't* cause the bug.
---
Interesting, last time I tried to do a silo I almost immediately gave up because my All Rise, which normally kills turrets in a single hit, was taking like 20 hits to kill a turret. Probably likely considering I have a DR Lever Action
---
Dang this sounds like a good update keep it up
---
L
---
Well, thats because it is. Its a reskin. Honestly, it does look half bad, though...
---
I didn't know that it counts toward the budget.
---
But that's ok, I got a small farm that I only use half of the budget as is .
---
I like the ease of access for the fermintor ,I hoard stuff so I constantly am switching menus .
---
I would purchase the fridge for that feature alone "not having to switch menus"
---
I agree with your friends. Multiplayer is just too good with replayability. 76 is dirt cheap and frustrating and fun over and over. Outer world's may be good for 3 runs tops.
---
LOL man I am so lucky. with my normal build none of these issues impact me at all lol. 
---
1. I just so happen to use an Vampiric ultracite laser gat so I shoot 999 times between reloads.
---
2. I havent noticed any changes in how fast my weapon breaks because I don't use gunsmith. the perk for gunsmith is whats getting broken in all this I believe. I stopped using gunsmith as a way to burn up the repair kits you get from the queen ages ago. 
---
3. I dropped calibrated shocks for the ones that increase ap regen ages ago and went to an ultra lite combat load, my combat weight is around 70 pounds fully loaded and ready to go.  out of 50 to 100 cores 1 weapon 1 stim etc. I use vampiric so I only carry one regular stim pack for ressing others everything else I sell. I dont have any med weight reduction I dont even use radaway I use nuka grape for clearing rads because it heals removes rads and doesn't weaken your immune system. because I only eat melons to avoid cooking I have been running thru hiker for ages already and that doesn't seem to be affected by these bugs. 
---
4. the only issue I had was it did break my stealth boy x-01 torso. but I only use that when I am gathering fusion cores to avoid being vats locked. and I took the torso off and back on it worked fine after that. I think the auto reload of the laser gat is ok its just when you reload from 0 to full by pressing the reload button. (unconfirmed) 
---
my build has never been min maxed for dps and it sucks for pvp but it is tanky as hell and lets me solo the queen in back to back fights over and over, and now apparently it has just inadvertantly sidestepped a big bug that's pissing everyone else off.. sigh man I love my build. sucks for all the unyielding guys out there hopefully they will fix it with a hot fix ASAP. good luck. in the meantime I will be continuing my normal playstyle being happy.
---
that's quite creative but they don't work like that. you'd still get a decent bonus, though: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a31ayz/bolstering_vs_vanguard/
---
To everyone that's going to start whining that they're going to have to play so much NW to unlock all of this... that's the fucking point.
---
The old VTU and Halloween systems were great for us as players but entirely failed at accomplishing the goal the challenges were designed for.  For the Halloween event no one interested in the rewards had to touch NW for a week while the challenges all unlocked and then rushed through all of them in half the time it should have required.  The new system is designed to incentivize people into playing some NW throughout the weeks the challenges are available.
---
If you bought it via the ps4 store, it'll be under your services in your account settings. Just turn off auto-renew. You cant get a refund or end the service early, you will keep wjat you paid for, for however long you paid for it. But you can keep it from charging you again when it's time.
---
I dont know how to apply to be a mod. Ive only been on reddit like 6 months. I already said i dont even know how to link screenshots here. 
---
What i have done is remind people that these things are already being talked about in other threads. Just like im doing here. I tried to shut it down before it got to here, but your persistence in being a stubborn troll has brought us here. 
---
I tried to shut it down saying bethesda knows and is working on it. Thats the last i heard about it. 
---
Then i used common sense to get to my next thought of "oh, itll probably be fixed by free play days. That makes sense because they arent gonna want this bad of a bug in free play time. Logic. 
---
So i said "most likely fixed by thursday morning." Im not seeing anything other than you being a dickhead honestly.
---
No kidding soft ass kids
---
Yup
---
Stopped playing almost a year ago. I stay subbed to the subreddit in hope this game makes a comeback.
---
Big mad over here. Lol
---
How would one defeat them or is it endless? Curious as I have the best weapons in the game.
---
Why is my Xbox downloading the whole 80.18 GB?
---
Dude. They think Fallout 76 has a better story.
---
That's as big a joke as Todd saying it just works.
---
finally some more responders stuff!
---
Warframe literally does this. PC gets shit earlier but we also have to suffer through bugs and rebalancing on new things. We put things through the wringer (helps that DE patches a lot faster than Bethesda's glacial pace), which are then collected up and sent as a big update for consoles in the cert process. A nice tradeoff for having to wait longer.
---
All they need is test servers like every other game. Half the people in the game would be willing to playtest it.
---
I understand it doesnt follow their track record of fixes. And ive seen and participated in the mountain of bugs you speak of. 
---
My thoughts for thinking it will be fixed by thursday have a few variables.....
---
The damage the bug does..... This is a HUGE bug. No mistake about it. Its damn near game breaking. 
---
Free play days for fallout 76 kick off again dec 12th i think. Thats thursday. I cant see BGS going into free to play days with this gigantic bug still around. 
---
I guess it wasnt a few variables. It was just a couple. Lol
---
If they do that it would just encourage more cheating. I'd much rather die to the fire than die to someone who is shooting the air from all the way across the map and insta killing me
---
Oh, well I guess they would balance out at a certain point. How would you figure the DR? Base it off the base value of DR of both armor pieces?
---
What's your Gt I'll protect you
---
Anyone else having an issue with carry weight adjusting when loading into game. I drop 50lbs carry weight availability as soon as I move.
---
Eh, wouldn't be surprised. Social menu hasn't worked properly for at least 6 months now, probably broke another thing.
---
I agree with you. Gotta adapt and move on. I think of it as a little bit of a blitz but my squad and I have managed to win a fair amount of games with the small start, only difference is we aint walkin through the entire nap twice over just to find people hiding in fuckin bushes
---
No. 76 has a better story then fo4 tho. People forget how bad that game was and it's only good  now cause 76 wasn't the sp game fallout "fans" wanted.
---
I really liked outer world's but repeat play is extremely limited I'm games like that.
---
spaghetti code
---
It may just be because im usually pretty stoned, but i love the audible "oh shit" when i spawn. The panic makes it fun for me.
---
More story based npcs instead of the randmo ones you find wandering around
---
Congrats! I've got over 1000 hours in the game and have turned in countless Technical Documents. I finally got that plan as a reward about 2 weeks ago. I know my real life luck stat is at 1, but damn...
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8vtip/nuclear_winter_unlockschallenges_for_christmas/
---
Not the brightest bulb on the tree
---
Fallout 76 definitely doesn't have a better story than 4. Fallout 4 has plenty of good side quests. Fallout 76 has, like, 5 side quests, which are all fetch quests. The main quest in 76 is also just a long fetch quest.
---
You answered your own question. It's been requested since release and still no fucking test server in sight.
---
BGS Austin is literally a clown fiesta
---
a bunch of developers who never launched a game being asked to deal with gamebryo
---
this patch broke a lot of things it seems. you're not the first one to complain about this either so I'm assuming that yes, it did.
---
Bethesda finally managed to get me to stop playing the game. I didn't quit before but now with the armor thing my characters are virtually useless.
---
Seems to be only chest and right arm pieces on my char that are affected by this. 
---
No issues with durability or weapon prefixes so far. (AA/B)
---
Should run till January 2nd at the minimum imo. Everyone will be with family for the 24th through at least the 28th.
---
It’s a game. Games in my mind are meant to be a challenge. I bet you those complaining about the small circle are a bunch of bush Wookiee’s who have to change hey way they play.
---
Is that why my brand new vamp exp. harpoon breaks so easily
---
It is. The only thing it won't do all year is bring the presents we'll be able to farm starting on the 12th.
---
I got the tree and the lights.. has anyone tried to hang the lights ON the tree yet? I haven't been able to get on ..I'm gonna go crazy trying to delete shit so I can add my new stuff.
---
i hate yongyea as much as the next guy but they deserve it this time
---
this is absolutely pathetic
---
Yeah you will eventually respawn. It takes forever, but if you close the game out you'll loose any rewards from looting.
---
What that means, is that we can expect a fix sometimes between Thursday and colonization of Saturn.
---
Also noticed armor breaks stupid fast too.  and I get constant stagger hits from super mutants with guns and break a limb every two seconds.  Horrible.  Just going to set up a workshop and collect acid until BGS unscrews the game. It's not playable in it's current state.
---
Little sad cannot use the one I pad for as well (normal collectron). But thanks for the reply :)
---
You just need to toggle friends or teammates only...
---
Wait, so is this an actual quest or an unmarked location? I have literally never heard of this, or seen it.
---
spaghetti code 
---
league of legends level
---
&gt;Bethesda has completely lost it .
---
Most accurate comment in the thread. The more I think about it the more pissed and puzzled I am. I mean Nuclear Winter.... Of all elements in the game,  this a mode that is actually ***the hardest to screw up.***  And yet Bethesda somehow found a way to do it.  It's just mind blowing to me. I mean... seriously?
---
They also fixed the 250DR while reloading, finally /s
---
You can change what it scavenges for in the terminal if you have the collectron
---
Yea all me explosive weapons are degrading faster than normal but it seems the harpoon and auto launcher degrade the quickest for me
---
Another glorius update with bountiful bug fixes and tons of content.
---
Man if patches are gonna keep looking like this wastelanders better be like buying a real triple a fallout game.
---
That sucks.  
---
I’ve spent four days now looking for even a 1* bloody handmade for my alt and it’s becominga damn chore.
---
Can't say one weapon is broken if everything else is broken too.
---
I heard they are trying to have a hot fix by Thursday.
---
yea congrats I have done the same with a level 2 character
---
sadly my brain is not enough on its own to kill an entire squad
---
I have had matches where I got no loot I have had matches where I killed people with no loot all today in the small map mode.
---
I had less fun today then other days getting instagibbed 10 matches in a row by aimbotters and other kind of hackers
---
and like said elsewhere I won 2 matches today with no build weapons and very sub optimal gear I just had no fun playing this small map mode and I have no way to queue up for a normal match
---
They've already announced it's something they're working on. Asking for it again isn't going to make it show up any faster.
---
Where did you see an ETA for a patch/hot fix? I’ve see the community managers acknowledging the bugs found in other users post, but haven’t seen an ETA on a fix?
---
truth
---
I can verify that I fixed my harpoon gun after firing it 5 times.
---
Check the terminal lol.
---
Is this “quest” complete? I’m liking so far but feel like I’m missing a lot of direction. Very cool so far though.
---
Hey now, im a bush wookie too. Lol. But thats because my bong aint gonna smoke itself. 
---
I love the community here, dont get me wrong but ive been noticing some really funny shit lately. 
---
Everyone complains that the atom store is too expensive and to stop being greedy, but these same people are selling a 1 star rolling pin for 10k caps. Lol. 
---
These same people have all the hate towards this game mode are prolly the same people that think the scrap box is gamebreaking. Lol. 
---
People actually got upset that fallout first showed up like nobody thought you were gonna have to pay for a private server. Lol. 
---
People cry the fridge isnt cosmetic yet have all the perk cards that do exactly what the fridge does. At reduced weight. Lol. 
---
I suggest getting really stoned and having a good laugh at some of these complaints.
---
Are you aware that your attempts to "shut it down" are both unwanted and counter-productive? 
---
Why do you think it's your responsibility to police other people's discussions? 
---
And then you made shit up; justifying it as common sense, which you've clearly proven you have very little of.
---
Lolololol🤣😂 every patch I lose more hope in wastelanders, we get shit all for bug fixes and the 'fix' always breaks other things, wastelanders is gonna be trash I have no hope left.
---
B-but what about muh bobbypins.. do they still weigh 0 or did they break that again?
---
/s
---
another slap in the face for the people like me that grinded for it
---
If you wear 3 vanguard and 2 bolstering,  there is a dip at 50% health and then you go back up.  Vanguard drops off quickly as you lose health.
---
You can make that a reality already, go to the RobCo Facility in the Mire and find all of them. Just be prepared to build several display cases to hold them.
---
If you say breaking faster, I think you mean instantly it took three shots for my harpoon gun to break.
---
Thanks
---
Wookiee has two e's.
---
I guess I'm just not that observant. All I found was a blacklight. No idea what any of it means lol
---
I work in QA for over a decade, and AAA studios QA is mostly composed of temps or underqualified cheap outsource from Philippines and such.
---
Actually in past 3 months I interviewed 3 or 4 people that worked QA in Ubisoft and EA for an open position. Not one of them for the job.
---
I think all armor effects are messed up right now, not just legendary armor.
---
and in case you didn't know, in *trying* to fix the 250DR bug, they managed to disable all armor effects when you reload.
---
There's a few pre existing structures that you could probably use to fill the gaps for doing this. 
---
Don't forget the artillery and tesla traps.
---
I havent seen an ETA on time to fix. I never claimed i had. I see now that the giant space i typed between those two sentences did not appear when i sent it. Those were two separate thoughts. 
---
The time on the fix is my own estimate based off of this reasoning. 
---
Its a huge damn near game breaking bug. 
---
Last i heard, dec 12th is still scheduled as the start or 76's free to play weekend again. I cant see BGS letting this go while the free play weekend is happening. 
---
Thats why i said what i said. Ill do better to be more clear moving forward.
---
i was in a public server the other day, it was a fiasco. whoever droped the nuke did it “wrong” so you had to fight in the nuke zone, somebody put their  survival tent directly underneath her, causing her to stay dead center above in the air. with 10+ people there her health never went below a 1/4. After about 30 mins everybody just gave up and left.
---
🤡
---
I'd wait until after Thursday. They just introduced two massive bugs which are universally crippling. Game is not currently playable.
---
🤡 🤡 🤡
---
That’s real nifty, once I’m a high enough level or get enough stimpaks I’ll make my way over there. Thanks bro
---
Probably can't install it in time.
---
I wouldn't start over. The game opens up at level 50. The best thing to do is stick to the low level areas and explore and do side quests until you are ready for the higher level stuff. Events are a good way to get xp and this weekend with double XP would be a good time to start up again.
---
you picked the worst possible time. there's a double exp weekend coming so there's that.
---
just don't bother with legendary armor for the time being.
---
Don’t worry they are adding in some features , to make wastelanders look “better” , when they “patch” it all. Lol
---
Does equipment self fix on reload, i.e. are effects just lost for that load?  Or are they permanent?
---
and stairs! ha ha, they've really been kind of skimping on the nuka themed stuff, which seems like it would be one of their most popular themes.
---
I think they start on Thursday.
---
It's too bad this has been largely overshadowed by today's bug, but there is a big, sprawling "quest" here no one is talking about.
---
Curious question. Why the "i" then? I thought that was there to show use of the long "e" sound.
---
Didn't think that would affect excavator but that's bad I rely on that plus 200 to go anywhere in the game
---
I’ve got all the mods but that one. I didn’t think you could scrap to learn that one
---
I recommend to read the patch notes again since you are aware of this event so you can check when actually starts.
---
Yeah reload remove as well the poisoner bonus I was get usually from the vault power armor, sad 😩
---
Because it's fictional, like your common sense.
---
I feel the same.
---
I've noticed that the Liberty Prime skin voice lines for entering power armor will play when you reload your weapon. Maybe it's related.
---
Make sure you didn't unequip the perks that allow you to craft mods like weaponsmith.
---
I had a problem with my weapons workbench not going into craft or repair. After 2 weeks of cursing I figured out it was to close to the armor workbench for the animation to start.
---
Take your workbench outside in the open. Drop it there and see if you regain the ability to use it. If you do, put it back in your camp and allow a little more room between it and the other shit around it.
---
Agree, having Used to play on a custom built laptop &amp; now playing on my XB1 I'd Still rather happen that way^ but no dev-cash-farmer is going to shoot their own cash cow right between the eyes by just saying, " Look it's easier for us by FAR and believe it or not faster &amp; more stable for You if we do sh!t on pc then release to consoles as stable, deal with it" as long as we wernt talking more than 3-Ish days between pc &amp; console releases.
---
Yes, Legendary Effects on Armor will not be applied anymore if you reload your weapon, lowl, what a bunch of Incompetence...
---
But your Armor wont break or will take damage, no need to repair, just reselect to wear your armor and they will be apllied again... until the next reload.
---
I thought this Patch is nice, because of the new Winter vending machine! But that bug turn the game now in a even worser state then before.
---
Best thing to do for xp is find a lvl15 raider PA, any 2-hander and smack ghouls in the clubhouse till your eye start bleeding.
---
Oh thank god. For I minute I thought you may actually know what you were talking about and had been downvoted for no reason. I would hate to see that happen.
---
I'm too scared to even turn it on. Waiting for a single dev to confirm something..anything.
---
I would of held out for 3 lemonades lol
---
Posting their methods is just increasing the number of trolls that will employ it.
---
That said, I can't tell you the last time someone tried to grief me.
---
Beserkers unarmed: Allow us to introduce our selves
---
Yeah. At first I thought it was maybe a location issue but after traveling and restarting the game it is busted.
---
You still say i made stuff up. Its very clear that i did not. Ive said so several times. Explaining what i actually said and even went back up to edit for future clarity. So let that shit go. Its an argument youre making that has no ground to stand on. So stop. It is common sense. Im on drugs and i put that together. 
---
I never said it was my reaponsibility and mine alone. All i said was be a bit more organized. Even went on to clear that up by saying just check to see if stuff is already being talked about. Then used the reasoning of worrying about smaller stuff slipping throigh the cracks because all we see are 800 posts about the same issue. It was already replied to by higher up people. They know and they are working on it. 
---
Its the internet. 80% of it is unwanted. Bad time to make that ploy. 
---
Also. Funny how youre so against me here, but on the other threads where this stuff is being actively talked about, friendly as pie. Constructive as all get out. Lol. Im actually getting a good laugh out of it. 
---
Why the two "e"s? Just curious.
---
nobody plays this game
---
If you go into settings and turn down voices it will shut him up. But you won't be able to hear the robots when you go back to adventure. If you spend a lot of time in NW it's a great option.
---
I am going Cricket: full agility and stealth perks, hooded rags and instigating melee or unarmed.
---
I still dont understand it. I wasnt wrong in anything i said.
---
This bug also seems to affect some people but not all. My account is affected but my sisters account is unaffected (reloading anytime anyway anyhow and her weight of 320 remains w 3 uny 2 bols 4 wwr 1 awr pieces). 
---
Also not sure if you've noticed but since new patch whenever you reload it lags pretty badly like frames skip noticeably (on ps4 slim or ps4 pro) I dont know all that much about coding but its like the game is preforming a check for something when reloading. The first couple and final few frames of the reload animation delays like its loading something (same type of frame rate drop/freeze that occurs when loading a new section of the world map when running around). This might not have anything to do with the bug but it might, certainly is a performance issue that needs to be addressed.
---
Hopefully this is helpful and informative we want fo76 to be good please hear us out 🙏🙏 hotfix this please!!
---
What info have you found there is a note in the top of chareslton herald and it goes on the board, any other info you have would be nice.

Then don't play.

As Elvira Hancock told Tony Montana: "Don't get high on your own supply".

I know for a fact strangler heart isn't working so I'm assuming excavator wouldn't, either.

But it will reinforce we wont accept Not getting one, the plan to oil that squeaky wheel is always top priority untill it stops squeaking on its own....then it falls off your car while you're doing 80mph in the middle of a 8 lane freeway during rush hour...
---
At level 200 I’m now concentrating on 100% completion. Right now I’m in the process of buying all the serum recipes. After that I’ll try to complete all the possum challenges that I have left to go. Taking a break from that I enjoy helping mid level people explore areas that might be a bit high for their level or complete part of the main story line.
---
I should lay off the Jet, I guess.
---
Ok thank you
---
Thanks. I forgot what day today was and got a little ahead of myself. I guess I'm more interested in if anyone read or knows of how the "event" will go down. Is it an event where we track these things down like a horde event, do we just stumble upon them through out the map, or is there going to be some other thing... nothing I've seen has been super descriptive
---
It is playable,just no where NEAR where they intentionally  intended...
---
Unless this was all part of there E Vil plan.
---
But like the others said,so long as yer not depending on yer legendary armor nor weaponry working proper,
---
In a game that is based on achieving legendary armor or weaponry &amp; using it too yer full advantage,
---
you’ll be fine.

Nah, you'll still get charged for First with a burned down house. You need to put that candle in the other end of the vault boy.
---
Grab a shotgun and handle business. Maybe that a bad analogy. Never mind.
---
Also if you go to own of the Morgantown frat houses, I forget which, you can get a whole robot chess set. 
---
Of course you can't display it as a whole set but you the individual pieces. If you have that many display cases.
---
They just can’t get it right can they!
---
I already got a lump of coal
---
Bethesda Game Studios has an in-building QA department, so that's not the issue. They probably rushed a bunch of individual fixes together because this would be the last update for the next 2 months while they went on holiday and they wanted to leave us with something good. We need an immediate hotfix!
---
(Hopefully obvious sarcasm) 
---
Come on you wieners, time for that unarmed naked &amp; afraid playthrough you've always been to chickenshit to start &gt;;D
---
If you could get five level 1 unyielding leather armour pieces to give the lowest DR it might be viable for melee, but that's not easy to get.
---
Can confirm my quad harpoon gun breaks after ~30 shots from 200% 5* gunsmith &gt;:(
---
I can’t believe you’ve stayed at Level 1 for so long with no SPECIAL points
---
There are plenty of devs that do it, just look at a game like Warframe where there's usually weeks between not just PC and console releases but they often even split up the console releases themselves so each ones cert doesn't fuck with the others.
---
&gt;You’re upset because it’s become harder for you to hide from enemy players, thus you’re getting less xp because you’re not winning fights). 
---
Getting XP is the entire point of the mode.  And gaining XP has nothing to do with winning fights. I've had matches where I won several fights and gotten negligible  XP.  I've had matches where I won zero fights and gained enough to go up 1 and 1/2 levels because I lived long enough to finish in the top three. Anyone who has played the mode long enough knows this.
---
Seems like you don’t understand a lot of things, since I thought my last comment was fairly clear in its meaning to be sarcasm. (Sorry I left out the /s)
---
And you are probably getting downvoted because you are trying to cover for the poor response Bethesda has offered in this situation. The CMs haven’t so much as mentioned a hot fix, but you feel the need to estimate when the yet nonexistent fix will be implemented.
---
Don't laugh: lockpick perks, all of them. I recently created a character who is a hacker + locksmith + alcoholic. Whiskey gives me 6 strength and I can't get addicted to it. I can open everything and hack into everything. 
---
Game changer, really.
---
Already have them but I swap them out as needed. Mainly looking to deal more damage.
---
This is comical at this point.
---
I think your reasoning is sound. Thank you for the information.
---
I got it on accident too. I left the game one night when I was farming ultracite by the fissure prime. I logged in a day later, on a server just nuked. It hit like 10 seconds after I loaded in. I then got stuck in an infinite spawn loop of not being able to have time to get into my PA, and immediately dying from rads, then auto respawn at nuke zone. I rage quited after about the 5th-6th attempt.
---
Got that achievement tho.
---
Tell me about it . I am still shocked .I have played 5 minutes today and logged out .So very disappointed with their game breaking changes .The whole mode is completely ruined ! No point whatsoever in strategic manuveours or using half of the perk card's ... i am not even sure you are able to nuke without ending the game instantly.
---
I think the budget thing is a bug. It won't let you put things in them if you don't have any budget, but I don't think it is really using camp budget.
---
Yeah always remember to use power armor for shopping too.
---
Too many holes in floors with floating confetti just another reason for me to hate floating houses.
---
It’s in the patch notes that you cannot transfer with a body
---
It's mentioned in the patch notes now that you can't put items on corpses any more. Probably a sacrifice they made for stability, or maybe there was some weird exploit
---
Definitely happening to my Explosive Harpoon Gun (PC). I need more bullet time to confirm the rate on the rest of my equipment but things appear to be wearing thin very quickly.
---
I think the plan will be in the upcoming presents, that we will get off the scorched.
---
The release notes say they removed the ability to place stuff into a body’s “container”.
---
Yeah, it was in the patch notes.
---
Good idea.
---
The longer hairs cover the headband part if that’s what you want to know- sorry I don’t have an image tho
---
Appreciate you my friend I always went into ps subscription not the service thing thanks
---
They left us with something good alright.
---
No one still playing is playing for the brand. There's a lot of Rust/ARK refugees here.
---
I felt the need to say it yes. Because thats what makes sense to me. 
---
Its like me saying "hey, be mad its broke. It should have never came like this. You have every right. But before we really start blowing up and kicking in doors, give them a day or two to fix it. Heres why...." 
---
Maybe i just took my dose of xanax today unlike a lot of you.
---
There are too many whiny snowflakes in here. I like the changes.
---
I can confirm that Plasma Grenade plans can drop from Breach and Clear
---
My character is &lt;50 but I get bored every time I try to play because everything is too easy.  I blasted through all the main story at launch.  Last time I popped in to take some side quests was maybe four months ago.  Have they made it more challenging since then?  I’d actually love it if they did.
---
I hope they fix it before the end of the year
---
With how attacked ive been, im not really sure if this is sarcasm or not at this point. Updoot anyway. Lol.
---
I think we will just stumble upon them.
---
Oops. Never mind.  I did get that bundle.  My bad.
---
Duper related I'm sure.
---
They're scattered out across the world in various places also, just keep your eyes peeled:) But, I think the Robco facility has the largest concentration of them. Happy Hunting!
---
I had an issue where DR on armor wouldn't register right. I would have to unequip and re-equip for it to work. I also noticed that doing this would not only fix my unyielding effect, but it would also set the +3 in all stats regardless of my actual health level.
---
Also other players Liberty Prime PA will all talk at the same time whenever yours will.
---
Yeah, I keep hearing about explosive harpoons being affected specifically. Unfortunately I got rid of mine just few days ago, so can't check it. Try removing the flechette mod and see if any difference, just curious.
---
Just start working on this already, as payin customer i demand stable service and product in best state that means no broken product for my money Its same like u would be advertising fully functioning driveable car and delivering undrivable one. U need to fix these game breakin stuff asap.  Also u must work on this till its fixed. Also while its unplayable i demend prolongation of fallout 1st for the time its not fixed. So if it take u one week i want one week free premier.
---
Hacking isn't that rampant to give up on features that would drive more interest to the mode.
---
There is a double XP event coming up. Make sure to do as many of these things as you can:
---
- Join a team with someone who can share Inspirational level 3 
---
- Sleep in a bed for the Well Rested bonus
---
- Eat Cranberry Relish
---
- Complete the Feed the People event for Canned Meat Stew
---
- Complete Path to Enlightenment
---
- Take INT boosting aid items
---
- Take Leader Bobbleheads
---
Then go out and kill everything you can and take workshops. 
---
Make sure to sneak, take the workshop, do the defend event that pops up and then move on. Sneaking is important so other players don't gank you. 
---
If you're on PC and looking for a group we will be grinding for XP during that week.
---
I just hit level 100 so i bought myself a single month as a congradulations gift to myself. Made damn sure i turned off auto-renew as soon as I bought it. I just wanted the emotes, outfit, and atoms. Dont care for the rest, so no need to stay subscribed.
---
Wish they would use the PC route like on vault raids. Fuck man many games do this.
---
Thanks, I will try this. Does this mute any other important NW things?
---
Or forever
---
Thank you for the advice I’ll make sure to grind it all out. Wish I could join you but I bought in on Xbox.
---
I thought it might have been for bodies disappearing. I just had an issue this morning (before the patch) where I was spam picking everything from a meat pile and almost transferred items in.
---
This is a serious issue. Bugs of this magnitude mean that NO ONE in the company tested the new version, at least during ten minutes, before to release the new patch. 
---
There is no way to play the game in an average way, not noticing than the new patch broke some of the most basic things in the game.
---
Technically it is stakes, not shares, since it is privately owned.
---
Sorry Reddit doesn't like formatting, so that's a jumble.
---
But also don't worry about T-45. Use T-51b from level 30 to level 50 (don't even upgrade it) and then get a set of level 50 T-51b or T-60.
---
Two? That's generous
---
Endless in their attempts. Limited in attempt soldier volume in an hour
---
And, at least prior to this patch, the voice lines for encountering enemies would overlap constantly. I haven't confirmed if that's still the case as of this patch..
---
Yeah that's why I never bash people. If someone starts that with me it might prompt me to unload the dishwasher or maybe just get up and have a good stretch. Once every hour minimum you should always do some light stretching, I dont care what you're doing!
---
Stick to the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap. Do the quests in those areas in that order. Hit up the dailies and events. Only kill enemies that you feel like you can handle and don't be afraid to die. You won't lose anything except junk if you do die. You'll die a lot but that's okay! Even I die at level 71. Explore, kill things, decorate your camp. Do whatever you want but have fun while doing it. ☺
---
Same goes for weight reduction tiered bonuses.
---
I'm no expert, but a corrupted file makes the most sense since it seems to only be on your end. I play with my friends on Ps4, and we all use Vats just fine. It's gonna suck, but you might have to uninstall and re-download. Again, I'm definitely not an expert, but this is probably what I'd end up doing in your situation. Good luck
---
My camp location gets a single diseased tick spawn very frequently. It ambushes me, bites me once, spreads disease and then dies. Will it eventually stop spawning? Will I get frustrated and move my camp? I'm amused at this battle of wills between us.
---
Yoooo! Good find!
---
I really don’t like that the light bulb letters were moved to lights instead of wall decor. They don’t put off any light at all, and they significantly butcher both CAMP and light budget, just for a simple sign.
---
 https://twitter.com/ZeroFoxFK/status/1204495259474038787?s=20
---
It's really unfortunate this whole thing got overshadowed by today's giant bug, because there's a lot of interesting stuff in this informal quest.  A new interior, a slew of new lore, some of it even connecting to events in Pre-War Las Vegas.
---
Took a lot of location hopping and hunting, but we got there!
---
Just FYI the official response is literally that they have no idea what is wrong and have no ETA on a fix. Just check the official forums. Formatting may be horrendous as I’m on mobile ATM. So before you keep going know this is what you are defending. The aren’t offering a rollback or a solution, just that they recognize that it is broken and someone is investigating. This was 6 hours ago notice.

Official Answer 
---
Hi all, 
---
We're actively looking into reports about armor effects being removed after reloading. I don't have any details on a fix yet as we are still investigating, but as soon as I have any concrete information to share I'll let you know. Thank you also for all the details you're including in your reports.
---
Edit: Missed this the first time I replied, but we are also looking into OP's report that certain daily quests are not showing rewards on completion. Will let you know about that too once we've investigated.
---
So youre bad at your job and dont believe effort towards quality and diversity are valuable. I think if your boss saw this they would probably fire you. Thats a terrible work ethic. Hope you find something worth doing with your time.
---
How?
---
Where is the paen shop by the way? I looked for it in Grafton but couldn't find it.
---
I haven't spent much time in PA today so I can't confirm that either, I stumbled across a couple of players with the Liberty Prime skin's so I got into mine and as soon as the armor did it's 'systems online" dialogue the others were also saying the same thing like a constant echo.
---
Very strange
---
Look for the Church, should be some stores nearby with a tree leaning against it.
---
There are a full set of renamed models in one of the frat houses, too.
---
As many of us have requested expanded CAMP budget, this deals a serious blow to what little wiggle room we have left. Santatron cannot be place, nor can the new rustic sink or vendor signs, without significantly deleting objects.
---
Sadly enough the hunt was over for me quite fast - can't pick up the package at one location. It's there, I get the prompt to pick it up but nothing happens. several server hops and waiting for ages and nada. No way to go on.
---
You were never supposed to get 200 lbs for Excavator.  that's been an old bug/exploit that they said they would eventually address.  The intended weight bonus of Excavator is +100 lbs.  If you craft Calibrated Shocks for the legs, each adds +50 lbs.  But people have reported that the old glitch of logging in while in Excavator and gaining an extra +100 lbs that way is apparently no more.
---
Lol.  Testing if words posted triggered something, u got a seemingly large # of negative feedback to be real
---
If you start along the road that goes by Grafton Station and head toward the school, it's the last building before you reach the school.  There's a "Pawn Shop" sign and a door you can enter.
---
Interesting information you have provided, thank you! 
---
I guess I might have an idea about what happened to your AAE laser gun. 
---
If you craft a level 1 gun (obviously its health bar is very short compared to a lvl 50 gun)  and mod it with something like a recon scooe, suppressor, hardened receiver and perforating magazine, sometimes its health bar after modding would become so outrageously low that the game engine resets it to a full length durability bar, and the gun becomes almost "immortal". 
---
Maybe something similar happened to your AAE laser. Like, after the last patch it should break down in 0.5 shots, and the game engine resets that 0.5 shots to 10000 shots for example.
---
Lol. May the best man win.
---
Thats all i said they were doing. I said they were looking into it. 
---
Anything from there on is my own speculation and i have said so several times now. Even went back to edit the original comment for clarity. 
---
Im okay with where i stand. 
---
Formatting for me is always horrible. Because i dont know how to work reddit. Lol.
---
Say anything against Bethesda's devs and this whole sub/cult will attack you with flaming pitchforks.
---
So what you’re saying is that if my AP fills faster that doesn’t have any affects on my vats crit meter?  Pretty sure hits in vats consume ap. Faster ap regen means more vats hits over time therefore more damage. Higher agility affecting damage. Perception affects your vats how? I’m curious now.  A higher luck score affects chance to refill crit meter ( four lear )...so having the unyielding buff to specials does affect damage over time...especially with a vats build. Am I wrong. It sure doesn’t feel like it when I compare my builds.
---
[](/moondancercurious)My junkies explosive harpoon gun doesn't seem affected, fired it a ton(started out with 300 harpoons ended with 600) today, and didn't see the cnd bar move, like, at all.

Very curious, I also couldn't get any of my armor effects to break with any of my weapons reloads including [fixer, harpoon gun, 50 cal, gatling gun, tesla rifle, single action, lever action, hunting rifle, camera, auto grenade launcher, missile launcher, fat man, pump action, or double barrel].  
---
I'm not saying the bug isn't happening, but I can't for the life of me get it to trigger.
---
Thought it was fo1, the guy who sells iguana on a stick and its humans. Maybe 2 though it's been a few years since I've played either.
---
Thanks to community feedback, we've solved this issue, but now fucked you over with something way more game-breaking. Hot fix right now, Beth.
---
If they failed last time maybe doin the same thing as last time wouldnt be a great idea people are still gna camp in a bush if they want to incentivize playing maybe throw a few different challenges in there as well like killing players or use 1000 bullets or something
---
Again, I’m talking about damage over time vs. Raw damage....especially whereas vats is being used .
---
Ugh same, I had all the mothman stuff before the dang bundle came out and the only thing I don't have is that awesome smoke machine for it.  I'm not getting a bundle of 90% of things I have that's insane....INSANE I tell you!
---
Thanks for the input also ! 
---
I dont have any wear on my handmades, teslas or heavy weapons at the moment also. I tried repair kit on some and it fully restores the health and no wear appears after that. Also no affect if the weapon has 2-3* or 250dr even. Everything works perfectly.
---
I know I'm not supposed to get plus 200, but it was extremely useful with the lack of store space and they have had plenty of time to fix it, but I'm not even getting plus 100
---
Thank you, this is exactly the info I was looking for!
---
there are still bugs that have existed since the launch of FO4.
---
Big mystery. Still haven’t read through all of the evidence, but otherwise, great job on their part for adding this.
---
1300 hours in... I have done tons of things.
---
Along with as much as possible already mentioned, find a high level player willing to take you on a xp run. I've done it dozens of times.
---
Hrmm, that's odd then.  
---
After checking the new bugs subredit, it seems multiple people have reported this issue.  So best bet is to sit tight and wait for a hotfix day after tomorrow.  Wish there was better news.
---
This game is a pos. I come back to this sub, and see the same complaints. Better online games out there guys. Let's just kill this game already.
---
My Harpoon Gun broke while doing the daily for the Watoga robot hunt. It was in full repair when I started and broke about at about the 6th kill. Never had my gun break before so this is super weird. Something is definitely off.
---
HOT FIX for all of these issues please, Bethesda! Fucking hell.
---
At that level, I would try to join events, tag and kill as  much as you can. 
---
Some low level events give tons of exp. Like campfire tales, tea time, feed the people.
---
I’ll keep that in mind thanks for all the help
---
Same here
---
I can still travel slightly, but I'm pretty sure like other people saying that it's possibly because of the broken effects it's probably because that, considering that it wasn't included in the patch notes, which it's a Widely know bug, so it would be included, plus when I'm wearing it, I'm at the same carry weight without the power armor, and I have more then 100 plus carry weight modifiers
---
Haha yup, that's when I go make a sandwich.
---
Same here . Me and my team are not coming back until they fix it . On average we begin a match with 20 other player's per server , now that me and my other 2 team member's would'nt be playing , i wonder if there even be a match since they close down the lobby when there is less than 18 people .
---
I really do believe they are trying to kill off the mode completely .
---
oh well guess i just use the suitcase now. It was freakishly unnatural shoving all that shit up their anyway.
---
Hide and pray not to die. You should have gotten perks like AquaBoy at the start of the mode. It will allow you to breather undwarter Equip it and hide underwater somewhere. The longer you survive, the more XP you'll get ;)
---
The paper bug override is an Atom Shop purchase.  The Giftbox one is 500 Atoms, the Corpse Guts is on sale now for 300 Atoms.
---
Well done as always.
---
It makes the crafting noise, but no mod is applied, and no power armor is made.
---
That's a pretty cool perspective shot!   Love it!
---
Someone did this to me at my own camp, while I was updating my vendors. WTF are people's problems?
---
I've gotten the long since patched workshop disarming glitch.
---
This happens when you go to start the public workshop but happen to also click the pipboy button at the same time before the workshop open loads resulting in workshop opening but showing your character in battle mod with hand in gun hold position but with no gun present. (Ie- how your characters reverts during workshop mode) you can't move character, but you can place item in field of sight. Only resolution is to log out and back in, cannot fix by exiting workshop mode, character still won't move or rearm.
---
You and I are the chosen ones, apparently. We shall conquer the wasteland and enslave the unwashed.
---
Oh haha. I didn't realize
---
I'd like clarification as well. I was doing an event with a Faschnaut mask on in power armor when I levelled up. It ended up counting for the level up while wearing a costume and mask weekly. Did my PA count as a costume? Or is it supposed to say OR instead of AND in the challenge description?
---
Yet this sub is still full of people playing it.
---
it could be 1, i forget.
---
I share your luck on turning in Technical Documents. think I’ve gotten, like, 4-5 bomber jackets. Too many BOS Scribe outfits to count. So purchasing the Shielded Plan when I had the chance (and the caps) seemed like a really good idea.
---
Exactly. This game has turned really soft. I miss the days when every player interaction was an unknown. And having to constantly run back to my Camp to defend it.
---
I've wished much worse upon people for less.
---
Just build the Santatron in your camp. Then check the box next to the terminal to see what it's brought. Give it time to collect 1st.
---
That's completely normal for a software release. You still need to test the final build cumulatively for regressions and not just unit test each individual fix.
---
Or they could just make it so you can get all those in game without any MTX.
---
And before you tell me MTX is how they keep the game going, there's plenty of games out there that have no MTX and still release updates and content.
---
I paid $100 for this game, having to spend more money on MTX  to build shit, or change the colour of my power armour is bullshit.
---
u/Aten_ra , might be worth noting, that armor/reload blocker is not a 100% repro. I didn't manage to reproduce it, and was told by few more that they're unaffected.
---
Resources?
---
This is what the community asked for! Lmao!!!
---
Yoda talk like, you should not.
---
Did both on two different characters a couple hours ago.
---
for me having a role keeps me hooked. the role I adopted changed over time 
---
my initial role was a lone sniper out hunting and helping randoms I met in the wild. 
---
that morphed into being a doctor who made sold and used stimpacks to support myself and others. I rocked the labcoat, power armor was sometimes camo but generaly I kept it a nice clean silver. 
---
I discovered vampiric laser gat, that involved repairing and controlling power plants and the role morphed into a guy that rebuilt infrastructure , I then rocked the proto type yellow and black power armor and laser gat. repaired power plants sold chems and stims etc as well. I shifted from being a doctor to running more of a general store with a wider array of items. I still wore the lab coat when out of the power armor but added a hard hat to appear more like a power technician.
---
that morphed into combat support and the "long fight" of serums and the long term war against the queen and helping fellow wastelanders by selling legendaries and serums and food at decent prices, I still need caps so I dont just give stuff away but I try to sell on the cheaper end of the spectrum. so that's a self driving loop of constant restocking right there.
---
a posting somewhere here showed an airship that looked like the ships in warhamer 40k, that inspired me to make an airship of my own. so that morphed my role into a traveling merchant combat support type deal. 
---
my wife started playing awhile back and loved the quantom power armor for x-01, together she and I started making silo runs with frigging swat like efficiency, I made a joke about being "Quantom Force" and painted my x-01 to match. that shit stuck. slapped quantom force on my airship and jen and I rock the silos and queen fights as a pair. 
---
I discovered nuka grape is better than radaway for maintaining a normal immune system while healing rads. also I use thru hiker but not traveling pharma, that led me to soda fountain at white spring. that morphed my role into nuka cola delivery boy which of course would utilize my air ship. I have to go there fairly often to restock my nuka grape. ( not very often, I rarely have to use them and easily maintain 10 at all times.) 
---
I am level 370 ish. the needs of my mission provide me with guidance, I cannot make serums without stable flux from the queen, I cannot fight the queen without ammo, I cannot get ammo with out taking workshops for fusion cores, I cannot avoid pvp vats ganks without stealth boy mods on my x-01 to allow me invisible insertions and extractions,and last but not least I occasionally go to the nuka vendor to restock on nuka grape.  it is a continual loop of self reenforcing requirements that both bolster my storyline and role. 
---
the actual challenge of any of the things I do ceased to exist 200 levels ago. for me its the role and environment that pulls me back. 
---
I own all the serum recipes next as far as goals is to get all plans. its a very long term goal I may never reach but I will always need caps to get there. being the guy who can literally make every plan and every mod is huge. no Idea how long it will take. I have had all the ones I need for ages, but I want to be the guy who cant make your semi auto gamma gun into a full auto if you wish. all of the mods all of the plans. 
---
well over 1000 hours, I cannot wait to get home and nuke some queens after work. in an effort to tweak efficency I recently swapped my build to use plasma gatling gun and avoid fusion core farming for the laser gatling. the experiment failed. making the plasma cores cut into profits by a goodly amount. fusion cores and laser gats are just more efficent for the long fight. I have to level up 3 times to get my build back to being perfect for me. I am still very functionable. but I shifted a couple points that I want back now that the experiment failed. (note the vampiric plasma gatling performed amazingly well for raw damage output, if I did not have an ultracite laser gatling the vamp plasma gat would be my main weapon, the laser gat edges it out when trying to shoot down nuke card drones and when shooting on the move while inside the silo, shooting the plasma gat while moving widens the cone of impact to ridiculous proportions. I do like me some precision and the plasma gatling isnt as good at that as the laser gatling all that raw damage does no good if you arent on target.) 
---
anyway thats my mojo hope it helps you in some way. 
---
last but not least I like to chat here. lots of inspiration for side projects and experiments as well. here is the imgur that sums up my current role.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)
---
It's 2019 and tour option friends me. Tour going to jail.
---
So can you only hang the lights from under neath a roof? Could you use them between walls outside or in the greenhouse? I’m kind of new and haven’t used string lights before...
---
Thats why i didnt get those mutations.
---
Also lock it, or anyone can take the shit it gathers.
---
I swear to god if you're bullshitting...
---
This is the top post in the sub right now. Every controversy becomes the top post, and it fluctuates between periods when there's not much happening.
---
If they are like the other kinds then only from ceilings i believe
---
I just saw it too and logged on to see if there were others.
---
I haven't experienced the armor bug tonight, but enemy corpses are still disappearing at random upon death. (X-Box)
---
Confirmed on Unyeilding Armor... Doesn't matter if you have a 250 Dr Legendary Weapon... Whenever I reload any gun, my Unyeilding benefits go away.
---
Indeed.
---
Idk about the vault raids but this patch broke a lot of stuff so I wouldn't be surprised.
---
I was debating on building a Christmas base, you saved me a ton of caps! Thank you!
---
I didnt find any evidence in the room, does it respond? Or is it instanced?
---
Ur welcome
---
Destiny 2 does the same thing.
---
They "fixed" it by making it affect every legendary armor, and without using a +250DR while reloading weapon.
---
camp budget doesn't increase when you level up
---
The Mire is Freak and Geeks then
---
Somehow they made running Meltdown even more aggravating than usual.
---
That's simply not true. I just tested mine, before and after stats, with my vanguard and under armor, reloading TSE handmade. Everything worked just fine, no changes to stats or armor values
---
So you have to find the clues yourself. Start by the front door, on the floor. Seem's someone hasn't been checking the mail....
---
Imagine demanding a subscription for basic features and still not having a test server.
---
Yes technically. A first member  could farm endlessly on materials and repair your weapons nonstop while a normal player would be limited by their carry weight and stash size.
---
Confirmed: Bethesda wants us all to becoime bloodied melee players.
---
Yeah I wanna see in patch 17 glowing corpses or a corpse tracker for the ones you can’t find as well
---
Reloading while crouched just makes the effect loss happen when u shoot next instead of immediately.
---
Patch 16 notes state "Enemy corpses no longer sometimes disappear shortly after death." After downloading the patch on X-box One, I can confirm I've had three (3) enemy corpses vanish tonight after play-through -- one was a glowing bloatfly at the flooded train yard near Watoga, one was a normal ghoul at Whitesprings, and one was a Legendary ghoul also at Whitesprings.
---
I think it's just Zax. If you have subtitles on you can still see what he's saying. Maybe just turn it down half way to check. I wish I had thought of it sooner tho, he is so annoying 😂
---
Oh, that's snow? I thought it was the textures not loading or something. Looks so bad.
---
I just leveled up wearing the silver shroud costume and the Pint-sized slasher mask and they didn't count.
---
Getting sick of the asshats who put up vendors and have fake floors just before them that drop you and kill you with poison that you can’t get out of.
---
I agree with you, but in all honesty majority of this sub isn't interested in Fallout lore and narrative stories, mostly just grinding events and running around in oversized bear costumes.
---
One you purchase it from the vendor it automatically starts...well it did for me
---
This is so embarrassing for Bethesda and this game. All of these should have easily and quickly been found if they tested the patch at all or had test servers up.
---
Look at all the hate. Damn! True fan boys. I used to be that way till they put a paywall in. Logged in over 700hrs spent probably around $1000 in atom shop. Then saw what they did and uninstalled it that day.
---
Maybe not expected, but not surprising.
---
All they will do is revert back to an older build of the Beta filled with old bugs/glitches. Smh... #classicbugthesda
---
Eat the rich.
---
Stop fucking doing their job for them
---
The collectron collected scrap normally. You could use the attached terminal to collect scrap. Santatron is supposed to collect coal, toys, candy  (and gifts during the Christmas scorched event only)
---
Ty for info. But now I cant place the collectron if I place the santatron. So I only get coal toys and snacks instead of extra scrap.
---
You'll want to start farming for legendary armors and scrap any sort you get to get all the mods. With the right armor set you can take.and dish out as.much damage as you can in PA. If you want a tanky build Vanguards is great, if you are going low health you want Unyielding. You can hop player vendors to find some decemt buys or roll the dice with the purveyor.
---
Well all of it is kinda broke right now. But that would depend on what your build is. Low health unyealding. I run 2 vanguard's with mix of other 3 for Dr protection at full health.
---
Someone tested and having a mix is better then just all vanguard's. (After 250 return are diminished) if I have auto stim then I can save a point in born survivor perk.
---
Wow, that sucks. It's not uncommon to have glitches like that across platforms after a big update, but not at that magnitude. Haven't played this in a while, but I'll be damned if that's not something similar to what I'd expect.
---
I doubt it's been enough time for the body to decompose so fully
---
Use the terminal to switch the collection mode.
---
Laugh all you want until your arms break and you can't repair them because you weren't supposed to be able to break them after all
---
..........Clearly you didn't read the part about using the pc to turn on the normal settings did you?
---
K
---
It's not bad when you consider this game is just a piggy bank for them. They have no incentive to make a good game cause it's fallout. It'll sell itself even in a broken state.
---
You didn’t read their reply. You can set the SANTATRON to collect junk IF you have purchased the COLLECTRON. If you have NOT purchased the collectron you can only get candy / toys and not junk.
---
It should because you can be like ewww gross get away from that guy he stinky and hurts my body 💀
---
I’m playing my slugger/power armor character for a couple days until it’s hotfixed.  My sniper is seriously screwed with this bug.  It’s good to have more than one arrow in the quiver, so to speak.
---
Even if you don’t have a power armor character, maybe consider it an opportunity to start an alt/mule a little early to anticipate double xp weekend.
---
I have a feeling this will be repaired quickly, what with the seasonal event, free weekend and fact that 99% of players are affected.
---
We did get the santatron though.....
---
Great shot. This is definitely one worth being proud of. :)
---
I've been getting stutters all day. Never runs this bad on PC but suspect it has something to do with reloading and armor mess.
---
I just run em over with my power armor. That's how I normally deal with super mutants to. Run in to them and hammer em.
---
you mean...like every second 76 update?
---
Guys remember patch11 haha so far not the worst one it sucks but there will be a hotfix this week alledgedly and yes this question has been asked at least once per patch
---
armor build is more intricate than your special set up. its almost its own minigame. your armor is built around your playstyle, perks, and weapons speciality, IE a full set of life saver power armor will res you when you get downed 99.9% of the time, combine that with an instigating sniper rifle, combine that with a stealthed vats crit head shot. 
---
thats just one possible scenerio, there are hundreds of weapons armor and combo types to experiment and really only you know what you will like. 
---
My best guess of your not very explained situation situation is that you do not have 3 points in fireproof and you're getting killed by scorch beasts. add in a dense chest mod and you will have nigh immunity for that particular issue.
---
There are multiple options. You can use perk card to increase DR/ER, there are multiple options under different specials so you dont have to use a card under your main stat. Imho perks cards for this purpose are wasteful but it's still an option. One useful but overlooked perk is Blocker under strength which blocks 45% of melee damage.
---
 Any armor is better than none, so use whatever you have for now. Each a armor has it's own set mods some of which increase the DR/ER rating of each piece. Try to get about 300DR and 300ER, increase after this are minimal. I'm not saying useless I had my DR/ER up to 500 but notice really taking much more damage at the 300 point level.
---
Your account was hacked and sold on a website called Plati.Ru for 1.50$. There was a recent explout that allowed somebody to use caps at the purveyor, and many people bought burner accounts to do this. Unfortunately, your account fell victim
---
You're on PC then? I haven't been able to experience the smaller map size on Xbox. Does the initial ring of fire hurt you? Bethesda seemed to make it seem like it was harmless.
---
Be happy you're not a Bloodied build using Unyielding armor.
---
Next time just read the actual notes before having a giant fit.
---
Nope on 2 characters got max caps and scrip.  PC if that matters
---
It’s unclear but the detective feels are great right
---
They fixed this bug just like they fixed the Sentry Bot audio loop glitch, but don't worry because they'll patch it again on the next patch, and the one after the next and so on.
---
Eta Psi House! Grey brick two story + basement house with a blue door; you'll find it on the first floor. Just finished up the Nukashine quest an hour or so ago and took a photo with the chessboard. :')
---
same I havent notice any of this. however I am alwaysin power armor so legendary armor thing doesnt matter, my main weap is gatling laser, I dont use gunsmith at all anyway, i think the gunsmith effect is whats being broken. did 3 queen fights 1 repair per queen as usual.
---
Jesus christ no, nothing in this world worse than christmas music
---
Time to sit back, grab your favorite beverage, and watch this fire burn...
---
It’s insinuated.
---
Greenhouse looks kinda cool.
---
Been playing less than a month
---
I get random pop ups saying you got 40 atoms for doing something.  Have like 1800 
---
Are there quests to get more or a list on what actions gives atoms.
---
Like can I grind farm atoms or is it like achievements where you get it once for doing something
---
Thanks for the comment and Understand, but considering I got more than 50 Discord/Reddit DM's inside 3 hours I'd say it's effecting allot of people.    
---
Question, what armor / power armor are you using?  
---
Wondering if it's linked to specific combos.
---
I listened to the IGN unfiltered interview with Todd Howard and it really did not seem that way. It's more like Bethesda has 1000 things going on right now and are stretched thin. They aren't trying to sabotage the game, if anything F076 is a first of it's kind and have taught them a lot of good lessons. It isn't even being managed by the main studio, instead by a smaller group in Austin and I really doubt that they even have the basic man power to put out constant updates. It is no wonder that things fall through the cracks. This game needs to be made Free to Play now to get more interest in it to keep it alive.
---
I stumbled across this a long time ago. Probably January or February. I launched them off one by one and tried to snipe them while they were in the air.
---
#classicbugthesda
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
Really, so just delays it for the next salvo?
---
No, but it makes me feel better. And isnt that all that matters?
---
I thought that the Chinese power armor that they're going to be releasing at some point looked a lot like one of the robot villains on a comic or poster
---
What system are you on?
---
Yes you can. I have both gravestone and meat pile. It'll give you a option to use it for both dropping a item and upon death or one of the other or nothing so a paper bag is used. You can pick 1 so it's for when you drop a item only and another for when you die.
---
I feel like it might be needed as well because of the need for higher Charisma with the introduction of NPCs
---
Ever seen a dead fly on the floor? That was their test regime before they axed it and said 'Just ship it! It just works!"
---
Please report bugs found in Patch 16.0 here, as there are more than a few.  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 16.0 | December 10, 2019 or "The Grinch that Stole Unyielding Armor"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e90rer/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)
---
Exactly
---
It’s always been there
---
At this point, if someone goes to a camp near The Douchespring, they need to expect the douche... It's their territory and we've no right to tell them how they can or cannot act there.
---
Thanks for the Post and I hope you don't mind but cited you as an example.  
---
That would sort of defeat the purpose of bundles.  They're not to get people who already bought part of the bundle to buy.  They're to get other people to buy.
---
The scrap item option will destroy whatever your cursor is over when you hit the scrap button, no matter what is highlighted. It's been that way forever and I've only seen it mentioned a couple times, so I'm sure they're not even aware of the issue.
---
Thanks for the Post, not a new issue but made 100 times worse due to the Unyielding/Legendary Armor bug introduced in Patch 16.00  
---
Hope you don't mind but cited you as an example.  
---
Confirmed. My quad explosive harpoon gun breaks after 15 shots from 200% durability. That's a massive increase in weapon degradation.
---
She literally left just the morning before us
---
Thanks for the Post and I hope you don't mind but cited you as an example for the bug round up.    
---
Thats fine
---
No I meant how do they know how long it takes a corpse to fully decompose
---
This false - tickets sent to Bethesda have had employees confirm that this is not true
---
Thanks for the Post many people agree with you and dislike the smaller maps.  
---
Hope you don't mind but cited you as an example for the bug round up (As a QoL issue).    
---
Quick google search will tell you all the stages and rate of decomposition
---
Yeah I got those in a thanksgiving display with a chessboard. I assume the ones at robco are the same?
---
This would be awesome.
---
Much like the restroom at every inner city Barnes and Noble.
---
Legendary scorched don't exist as far as I know, and they're the only ones who carry signs, so I don't think it's possible.
---
Has anybody finished meltdown in public on expert
---
It’s insinuated by your complaint. Been playing since closed beta too. What’s your point...?
---
Had you won team fights and stayed alive you would have achieved more XP. FACT. Yes, kills are worth less when compared to time alive (sadly). However, you get over 2k overseer XP for winning a game with 10+ kills. I do this daily and it’s far better XP and far more fun but whatever. Get a group with decent communication and stop being a Bush Wookiee.
---
Just turn voice in the audio settings all the way down.
---
I got coal :(
---
All these complaints about the game being broken but not 1 complaint about the Atomic Shop... Is the Atomic Shop still working flawlessly... 100% on point... as usual... every patch... no mater what...???
---
Happened to me once. Haven't tried to replicate it. But assuming it's the same glitch that existed a while back that came over from fo4 it can be done intentionally by immediately subsequently activating pipboy immediately after clicking A to activate workshop physically at the workshop in the brief moment before workshop build mode activates.
---
k
---
Heaps and heaps and of people.
---
You can, but they don't dispense water like the new sink and water fountain in the Atom Shop.
---
I haven't played much since launch, and I know a lot of great stuff has been added, but it seems like there's plenty of bad to go with the good. As devs, it seems beta testing would be a good idea.
---
Lol sorry im guilty of this but at least i use my paddle ball :D
---
Is it a guided quest or something you gotta do on your own?
---
It’s completely fine
---
Usually the level 50 has higher DR
---
If they can't even fix one problem without breaking something, then imagine the issues that'll follow Wastelanders.
---
If you have a build set up for explosives and smgs, and like fighting mutants it's not bad. I wouldn't pay more than 1k for it.
---
What's your current build and what system? If you're on xbox I probably have something better that I can sell you for less than that.
---
Thank you so much, you're girl had the same color hair as me 🥰
---
Thats pretty evil. Fuckin screwy louie out here.
---
 I sent him a number of informative messages about my shoe size and my favorite foods and he continued to waste ammo. 
---
Well, now he knows how to reset your password...
---
Years?  The game is just now a year old.  As for fo4?  It’s a game that’s past it’s prime, whatever bugs it has is what’s going to stay, just like Skyrim.  All that matters at this point is that the studio behind this game is still trying to fix things and honestly, I’d rather them focus on new content instead of just pushing back wastelanders even more so that a small bug that an even smaller part of the player base won’t experience it.
---
In the end, it boils down to a point where if you hate the game so much, then just stop playing it.   What good is constantly complaining going to do?  You raising your blood pressure over a video game isn’t helping anyone.
---
Its ugly. Does it even have lights?
---
Holy shit man i gotta do that
---
Saw someone in the sticked patch thread say that all of their stimpaks disappeared upon updating.  No idea if it's true or not but wouldn't surprise me with all the other stuff this update messed up.
---
Not my account or character, but glad it helped!
---
You fanboys still defending Bugthesda after 1 year of shit like this...
---
Dirty
---
Awesome, I've only found one over level 21, and after I tamed it it turned level 21 😒 I have a level 10 wolf right now 😊
---
Away with this sane logic! You're gonna scare the Bethesda devs!
---
I thought dirty was regular water.🤔
---
I’ve been making a build that focuses on throwing weapons for a bit now, looks like it’s my time to shine
---
I always found them at spawn locations as well, but more often then not, I could then loot them anyway. I just had to hunt down where they spawned once they disappeared originally. Though that didn’t always work with legendaries.
---
Wonder Years is better than 90% of the shit that came out during or after its run.
---
And youre still here talking shit after a year. Who really cant let it go?
---
Ok. I think if the game freezes it only affects you as this is as always online. They probably killed you and your loot dropped.
---
Same with my Bloodied Prime Railway... Ugh.
---
With the "value" bundle of repair kits being released on the same day, I'm not convinced the lowered weapon durability is a bug.
---
Would you mind explaining the qualifications to get a pet please. I hear different answers all the time. The 1 thing that stays consistent is that you cant be trying it on a static spawn.
---
Bethesda would like to take this opportunity to remind the player base that Repair kits are available in the Atom Store, which might be a useful work-around until this issue is patched next year.
---
It's called Starlet Rifle and hopefully it'll be a skin for the Lever-Action Rifle instead of being standalone like the Alien Probe.
---
You confirmed this? Reloading while crouched will keep the armor effects from bugging out?
---
I'm off for the night or else I'd test myself.
---
Ok well her hp doesn't change based on the number of people. Data miners proved this
---
Starsky and Hutch, w/ Huggy Bear.
---
No dont give them more things for us to buy
---
Thats fine..add it to the collection lol
---
I havent heard about this. Are they putting it in rotation or will you be able to choose the map you want?
---
Its pretty good with 20 people. It sucks when 33 join and get a tiny map. Wish there was 3 setting for it instead of the 2
---
 Hace casi dos meses que desapareció mi chatarra de mi scrapbox en 1st, y hace casi un mes que me prometieron regresar cuatro (4) de estos objetos, llamados "Desechar esto en un Scrapbox" a mi inventario y aún nada.  
---
Será tan difícil para ustedes hacer eso?  
---
Lo siento pero me decepcionan.  
---
Komy
---
Well, that should make Wastelanders easier. Well done!
---
&gt;There’s 20 of us on average in the PC lobbies and this change is a literal godsend. 
---
That's because PC is filled with 90% hackers, aim bots, and other cheats. Anyone with any common sense has abandoned the mode on PC until they fix this shit.
---
It's much larger and has a giant Scorchbeast heart inside hooked up to a bunch of tubes.
---
its a beautiful decoration for your fallout home
---
If I launch my game after a friend has joined a private server, I am unable to join their private server, despite the fact that they have it set as “all friends”.  
---
Additionally, there is no way for a person in a private world to team or invite somebody into their server, which makes this an unnecessarily complicated process. They have to leave their private server, abandoning all claimed workshops, in order to play together.
---
We I apparently can’t solo it then. Got it a rebuff then about half way. Then timed out.
---
Ho boy, did you pick the wrong day to jump back in...
---
Yes. Been doing this for some time with a 250 crossbow. Alternative is to unequip and re  equip. Not too bad with hotkeys for a weapon... But having 5 armors is pretty crazy.
---
both of yall got too much free time tbh
---
Congrats .. I tamed a level 20 at Cranberry Glade the other day. So much server hopping.
---
Lots of stuff was added today as a pre wastelanders taste
---
ALSO?
---
 I have confirmed I'm XB1 friends and in game friends with my friend but we can not play together. It won't let me join her or vice versa. If we team from the main menu and she pulls me in that was I get kicked in about 30 seconds with a message saying "You cannot play in this world since you are not friends with the owner."

One other person in comments so far with same issue

I'm assuming they'll realize it's a joke. And if they don't, they probably shouldn't be allowed online unsupervised.

Fallout?
---
Yes dear,
---
We’re going to.... kill you
---
😆
---
if u are on ps4 i would be happy to give u a shit ton of fusion cores lol
---
I totally agree with this
---
I'll have to try tomorrow. Thanks for this! Good to know just in case we have to get through Double XP weekend before they fix it.
---
Hell yeah dude , its hilarious to see all fanboys that has Todds dick shoved up their asses all time defending this "company" after every screwup
---
It’s a tree used for decoration during the end of year holiday season. A great deal of people call it a Christmas tree but they tend to stay up through New Year too.
---
with a politically correct name...
---
I’m fairly certain you’re not the first to ask it.
---
Wierd thing I found. The detective case on the table in front of the chalk board if you pick it up then go to your junk and select it, it plays music... idk if this is a bug or something else
---
Saying Christmas is verboten.
---
I really want to respec. I’m level 352 and I’ve been changing my build constantly, it’s getting annoying having to wait so long to change my build. So much grinding.
---
(Jealous). 
---
I’m L156 and was not able to tame one of those....
---
politics aside its still one of the funniest pieces of flaming hot shit bethesda has tried to sell in the atom shoo
---
It doesn’t
---
There’s a thread about it if you search pet in the sub! It’s a really good guide
---
You put down pa frames even you solo meltdown in novice?
---
I spent four hours today creating a bathroom out of what we have for bathroom materials. It would have been so much easier and would look a million times nicer if they actually had nice looking bathroom decorations. That sink they added today is a step in the right direction but some more stuff like a toilet paper holder, towel rack, a nicer shower and toilet (like you said), and just generally some more bathroom style decorations would really look nice. 
---
I also want more kitchen decorations like a kitchen sink and counters + cabinets but for now we should focus on one thing (the bathroom).
---
Nice~ I’ve got a Deathclaw right now ovo
---
Any particular reason outside karma farming you couldn't post this in any of the many already existing threads on the subject?
---
A little DR, but with mods, you can compensate for most of it,,,,
---
Its a server thing, sometimes you get a good one, most of the time you get an okay one. I was just playing my unarmed character and felt like freaking Rocky with my new power fist.
---
I'm actually fine with the AGL. Ya it's extremely overpowered but you have to spend a perk card to get it and you have to risk your life on a terminal. Then if you're lucky, you'll have the option to pick a weapon and then you get a 1 in 7 chance of it dropping. 
---
&gt; I know some people say "just get close to them", but the ability to do  that is predicated on them not having the high ground, them not having  having other teammates around, them not having the drop on you and them  not having significant distance on you already. 
---
Also, the exploit people are using makes running toward them the worst possible option now. Your best option is getting as much distance as possible.
---
I was wondering if mods would minimize the differences a bit. Thanks.
---
I've never noticed any significant difference in fall speed or damage... Probably one of the more useless Mutations.
---
i have it and like it . To be honest and would have been very surprised if a pack bramin were included
---
No shit I have about 100 clips from 3 ish hours of game play
---
People that do this suck, but not as much as people that go afk while looking at a vendor machine.  I can be patient, but after a minute if it looks like you aren't actually there, I'm dropping nuka grenades until you die of radiation (which requires more patience, but worth it).
---
No. There is no timers in novice. No plan rewards either tho. Just do it for practice.
---
Well, they're predictable at least.
---
I actually feel sorry for you.
---
Guys drop me a bone, where to start:)
---
The water fountain and sink.... It produces dirty water... Is it faster than the pump??? I want to be able to collect water as fast as I do from the various ponds and lakes.
---
Thank you mr Fanboy ❤
---
While I’d assume some items like the sink would/ will have a functionality, they don’t have to. Some of us spend a lot of time on their camp and would like to have some nice looking items to touch it up even more. I specifically have spent over 50-60 hours on perfecting my camp and my common goal when I play is to work on my camp because it’s so satisfying and fun to me.
---
It's pretty funny to still hear people say " Upvoting for visability" when the bare fact is that this sort of thing is still happening.
---
I meant to protect the geck whilst you do pipes.
---
Good stuff! Where getting closer to the big update even if its little bits and pieces right now.
---
Ok
---
Apparently we will be getting more Christmas camp items in the next few days in the atomic shop and there should be plans for new CAMP items (Christmas related) in those holiday gift boxes you’ll be able to find. So hopefully this won’t be all the stuff we get
---
No... That's a good idea tho. Running back Evey few seconds is a bitch. I use marathoner in vault alot. Helps preserve AP for crit headshots during the first waves that are bigger then the repeat spawns.
---
Blend in with who? Almost everybody is dead, turned into a mutant, or hiding from irradiated monsters. Now that our oppressors have been crushed in the gears of their own capitalist machinations we can finally paint the wasteland red. Socialism today, or blood tomorrow, comrade.
---
This is great advice, thank you
---
Thanks for the ansers, folks!
---
It condradicts itself and i feel like its outdated at this point.
---
Gotcha.
---
Thanks.
---
Idk it works for me. Tamed a deathclaw the other day
---
You poor poor child.
---
I'm finding these clues super duper cryptic, it bothers me thinking maybe I'm terribly unobservant
---
This makes me uncomfortable
---
Thats what i said almost exactly and i got like 30 downvotes. Lol.
---
A) Not true. Although the problem is bad, you obviously don’t play on PC. B) Quicker games make it easier to kill a hacker. Simply put, would you rather face an aim botter with wood armor with a scoped .44 or marine with a handmade. I’m genuinely questioning the sanity of this Sub Reddit right now.  Out of all the things to complain about this patch lol...
---
And finally, C) this games code is extremely exploitable. Bethesda has patched the hacks before. Wanna know what happened? The hack website received a patch the next morning. Hackers back in less than 24 hours. Bethesda needs an anti-cheat but no one wants that because they don’t want people snooping in their porn stash.  Any questions...?
---
Rewire just your vendors and then put a switch to cut the energy to them when needed. That's what I do and it works pretty well
---
They don't give a shit because:
---
1) People still play regardless of this nonsense.
---
2) They'll be moving on to other ventures soon enough, if not already. This game is even a lower priority for them now.
---
You're*
---
So simply! I’m an idiot.
---
Thanks man :)
---
I generally build a separate room or building for the vendors and the entrance is a garage door. When power is cut, door goes down blocking them off. Be careful if you go this route as one of the window styles can be jumped through, so I tend to do solid walls.
---
I usually have my generator and an array of switches in a separate room behind a locked door (or better yet keypad door, can't be lockpicked).
---
Bit convoluted but it's pretty solid. Though if the server is being slow players can load in before the base does &amp; access pretty much wherever they want.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing
---
The difference between level 40 and 50 (non legendary) depends on the material it's made out of and the piece location but generally the level 50 offers 10-20% more protection than the level 40 at the cost of higher repair and construction costs.
---
Regarding the link you're better off diving into the individual armor pages than the generic FO76 armor page, but that's a good jumping off point for all the different armor types.  Pay special attention to the combat armor page since I personally updated a ton of the information there a few months back.  The Fallout 76 wiki does not get as much love as it should and for some reason the armor pages are especially sparse so if you're interested in helping maybe choose one thing on the wiki that needs a little help and do what you can.
---
&gt;Or maybe there is a saboteur trying to bring down the studio.
---
I'd say there is a tug of war going on between the creative heads and the money-making schemers at Bethesda right now. The result is this game being pulled apart by horses.
---
Ok I was thinking it was just me and my server that was bugged. In a bad way it's good to know it's not just me.
---
Hot and steaming anyways.
---
We cover the doors with pa, and cripple the ones on the left corridor with a shotgun to stop them respawning. Still can't imagine running solo. You've brought the challenge to me though so I'll give it a try
---
Oh don't worry, I've been playing my fiddle since day one.
---
Lol #classicbugthesda
---
Thank you for the link, and advice on how to sort through the information on looking for. Much appreciated!
---
🤔🤨
---
Great suggestion!
---
While that certainly is true, goodwill is in fact a finite resource. Once they see it affecting future sales (which it will, even if to a small degree) they'll have to try to win back their fans.
---
I can't speak for them, but I've mostly given up on the game as well. I just meander around the sub still to watch the fire, and in the off chance a miracle happens to save the game.
---
You mean like a BETA before content goes live to catch the bugs and fix it before the content is playable? 
---
I have a sudden case of Deja Vu...
---
Maybe to make up for this they will nerf the junkveyor again and offer us 75% off. Lmao!
---
Ha! So cool.
---
If you go to the map screen and pull up the menu there is a list of tasks that give atoms and a few other things under Challenges.
---
Don't mind at all. Bethesda needs to get the message.
---
A building with a powered door or garage powered door. When I'm full of caps I cut the power to that section of my camp. Door shouts and vendors don't show up on the map.
---
I would agree. With the right perks, a common Bobblehead, and a lucky magazine find, one shot from the M79 can down everything in a 30 foot radius. The real-life M79 with equivalent rounds has a 15-foot kill radius with the most deadly ground burst rounds. Each round also has to travel at least 45 feet before arming to avoid killing the user. No such minimum safe distance or realistic kill radius exist for the in-game M79.
---
Because Bethesda had not limited the blast radius to realistic levels, the M79 is essentially firing nuke grenades. Nuke grenades in NW are rare and extremely deadly, but the M79 uses them as standard rounds by the dozens.
---
Can you collect it quicker than the pump?
---
I server hopped for so long to find a mega sloth to tame... finally found one! was so excited! it even arrived to my camp! then i switched servers and it spawned in dead.. devastated :( :(
---
Another good idea! Thanks for your input!
---
The seed bank area on the other one gets me killed a lot too. No matter how long I wait as soon as I get on terminal 2 crickets spawn in... Those things hit like a truck before I can get off the animation.
---
Did you find all the parts or did you just go to camp McClintock?
---
I run junkies commando. High luck and crit focused. I one to 3 tap most things with extra guns. Time is my problem not waves of mobs.... Mostly
---
yes, they're worse. you'll be relying on dps rather than damage per shot regardless, and the charging barrels severely reduce your dps.
---
You can buy from powered off vendors. Block it off and power it off so it doesnt show on the map.
---
That's what I figured. From the wiki it seems like it severely cuts the rof
---
Thanks, that's awesome.
---
lol no
---
PUBG is doing a double circle in beta so Bethesda is trying it too.
---
Agreed. They are worse for overall damage.
---
Still having the first swing, or multiple swings (to initiate combat) ignored in combat.  Sometimes when in vats I can press the attack button multiple times and nothing happens (PC, melee)
---
The more people the more minions, it seems. Scorched creatures kill me more than the bitch does.
---
In the middle of Grafton is a Pawn Shop you can enter, as soon as you enter, pick the notes off the ground
---
Lol sure bub. I believe you. I'm sure you will go super far and that kind of attitude will never bite you in the ass.
---
Its definitely not why you had to make your own firm.
---
Yeah, I've been in the "junk" category and had items outside that category deleted.
---
Same with me today. Like wtf? Then they bought some ammo and bounced 
---
Cgg
---
Happened to me. After about 4 tries, It started working.
---
AFAIK. If you switch off or cut the power your camp won’t be on the map, but visitors can still buy stuff of they can get to your machines.
---
Sometimes when I open a vendor, I can't make any selections from their store until I fiddle with items in my own inventory.
---
Awesome. Seems like I'll be going for the Alined barrel then
---
stop fusing cards. get one of every single card and just roll rank 1 too your solid on a few. you can get dup's after. I switch my build one week before double XP ( like now) then switch again after but leave 5-10 levels saved up in case I decide to do so again. just run alts after you get 2 characters to 100 with different builds. Wastelanders will open dialogue options that are dependent on special. Don't want to miss out or have to grind before doing new content. I've got a level 30 with only 2 cards on Deck . I'm going to get them to 50 and leave them there till wastelanders. my main is 270 my 2nd is 117.
---
Pipboy still says it is reclamation day.  Kinda like groundhog day....
---
Wheres the silva homestead?
---
I think it looks good, I don't like the hat. But it's 3 times as much as the Thanksgiving display case 😕 600 maybe.
---
I done that earlier mate inclund the light. I searched so for ambush site and meat event place, found nothing.
---
Not to mention, the “Meltdown” raid is almost completely unplayable thanks to the game freezing multiple times for various lengths of time.
---
That’s the main problem I was having. Player couldn’t physically get to them, which was fine. Just must be annoying for them fast traveling and figuring out its blocked.
---
Far east, near the goose drawing on the map
---
Thank you all for your ideas!
---
Tagging u/RedPhantom20 for this one!   
---
*"Al! I'm doing my holiday shopping...  What size pants do you wear?  What do you mean 'Infant'?!"*
---
I run a switchbox to the vendors, as well as the powered door that lets people into my shop.  That way, when I turn off the power, the door closes and the vendors 'go offline' so no one sees them on the map.
---
They are a private company.  They don't have shareholders.
---
No quest notifications of any kind. You get the XP, but not the message. 
---
&gt; They really mucked up this patch.
---
Change that 'm' to an 'f'. And it seemed so good. Ah, well, at least I have signs for my vendors now. Which will be off-line, because I'm not playing the game in this state, ffs.
---
So two birds with one stone. Powered doors cannot be picklocked right?
---
Nope.  The only way in is to attack the camp itself and break down a wall.
---
Ahh, perfect!
---
It also seems theres something wrong with nuclear winter's armor. Its like i can get one shotted or i can one shot someone... Worst update ever.
---
Yes actually it has, your not alone.
---
Yeah the only real rewards for pve players are the vault rewards, and you kinda need a group for those
---
Yeah a lock option as well as a not for sale option would be very welcomed.
---
Sorry about your buzz blade man
---
That's not true, though.  They've had at least two different Atomic Shop items that were given out for free accidentally.  They had to patch the shop to stop people from building them.  The glass dome hoozywhatsits were also broken, allowing them to be built in other people's camps when you're not supposed to be able to do that with Atomic Shop items unless the other player has also purchased the item.
---
I can’t play like this!!!! My unyielding armor prefix breaks for every weapon’s reload!!!!!
---
It would be no problem if we could get 30-40 players consistently. Then I wouldn't mind a smaller map every once in a while. But with 20-30 players per match, we're basically stuck with small maps all the time...
---
Yea, there should be something cool and unique for us solo players
---
I did get notifications for completion of the Biv and Scout daily challenges. But I apparently leveled and didn't know it, because it didn't tell me.
---
Yea Im not a pvp player but want the rewards from nw so grinding it to level out.  More rewards in general would be sweet.
---
I have a JE handmade and used the hell out of it today. It broke eventually,but was at 1/5 condition when I started, anyways.
---
My armor took a beeting, though.
---
It is not sarcasm, but I can understand how you might have felt it was. No worries. It is a sincere comment. No /s here.
---
Also happening on PS4. Melee was awful tonight.
---
Only a little bit, it's still far slower than spamming the button at a pool of water.
---
He only said ftw which means fight the world
---
And then their "solution" is the equivalent of, turn it of and on again.
---
Also the hat clips through the outfit when you walk...
---
Can’t believe we’re still testing the beta out after a year!
---
That's something, at least. I don't do Biv anymore, far too little XP and I already know each recipe. I'd rather do one of the Camden Park dailies, or Play Time (Berkley Springs), or Heart of the Enemy (DNA). Or Forbidden Knowledge (Tech Data) of course.
---
Take it easy, Nostradamus.
---
Then its a dumb regular tree lkl
---
There is a glitch that players can use to get thru locked and powered doors. I've had players do it to get into locked away vendors while knowing the possibility that the vendors are locked away because of cap limit.
---
I just want an actual Christmas tree with lights that would fit inside a building in my camp.
---
Yeah my friend found a BE Shotgun laying on the ground the other day too :/ someone must have accidentally dropped it during an event
---
Haha yeah, good one. I'm basing this on things that have already happened, and are in fact happening now.
---
They are actually ass. Try it for funzies but be ready to switch right back.
---
Aligned is for vats. You probably want stabilized or true depending on ads or hip fire.
---
Nah that's your guys' job!
---
You and I have a fundamental difference in what and how we accomplish. I'm very sure you're doing very well gauging by your Reddit history. No need to through stones kiddo, keep jamming games we make ;)
---
maybe he's a baby zetan?
---
Are you really that shocked though?
---
The thing I most enjoy is the damage nerf on my character, because two enemy types are fighting each other.  Really, I’m not trying to use a couple Scorched to soften up a deathclaw.  I’d have killed it twice as fast if the involved Scorched didn’t cut my damage in half.
---
The informative bits about the shoe size killed me. 😂 
---
I always emote on people, thumbs down, angry, trade or something dumb. Non violent approach you see.
---
Here’s the oddity though: I have some video evidence that reloading isn’t breaking effects. I’ll link it here. Footage isn’t mine. 
---
https://youtu.be/MpyIRgWfrE8
---
According to my friend, (with video as proof), reloading didn’t seem to affect weapon or armor effects. This was done in a private server, if it makes a difference.
---
If you can run mods, there's a mod for that.
---
I've dropped weapons reloading near corpses before :(
---
Turrents still bugged capture workshop started shooting random things ...Stools tables
---
I kind of like it like where not everyone gets all the same stuff.
---
Then probably stabilized lol, thank you for the info
---
Guess I'll be in NW till they figure their crap out
---
It synergies well if you get the 10% while aiming  effect.
---
Felt the same about F4. I enjoyed the game, but where was my megaton to blow up? (they did add far harbour though, after all the complaints), stupid convo wheel wtf is my character going to say, doesn't matter because you only have yes, no but actually yes, tell me more yes, sarcastic yes. At the start where you meet the minute men I thought next play through I'm gonna side with the attackers (like the legion in FNV), nope can't do that. Sorry I'm ranting. At least with F76 I knew there wasn't going to be npc's, I didn't expect player choice in an online game, I expected the bugs and honestly until recently the bugs didn't impact my game play. I knew the community was going to fix it, but I'm afraid mods will be locked behind a paywall now.
---
Got one with ffr, I never seem to hip fire. Don't know why, just can't really stand it lol
---
The quest won’t start for me. Oh well, guess I’ll wait for a fix.
---
Aligned= vats
---
Stabilized= ads
---
True= hipfire
---
Bashing= condition
---
This is good for all weapons and sometimes you see hybrids.
---
When you get into the lobby of NW you get to vote between morgantown and flatwoods and the majority of the votes determines the map you get for the round.
---
Lol, never change, Bethesda. Your ineptitude is a constant source of entertainment for me :)
---
Is that a Buttercup ride??
---
I hate to be devils advocate but im sure they thought they were helping and hoping to get xp and rewards, does it suck to have such low levels there running around dying and tripping over their dead bodies, yeah but it will happen. The other night i was in a nuke zone for a long time just killing all the scorched stupid enough to pop their heads out of the fissure and i teamed up with a low level and we had some fun even took them into glass caverns and gathered a bunch of ultracite so all was not lost. He gained some xp as did i but it was kinda fun i dont normally team up with people but this might have changed my mind.
---
Fix the bug that causes (certain) quest completion messages not being displayed.
---
Fix whatever you did that causes reloading to negate armor effects.
---
Before Thursday, please. Doube XP/Free Trial weekend doesn't mean shit if the game is broken.
---
They’re not free, they’re busy gaming.
---
Nice guide. I just threw my body at her with stealth commando and did as much damage as I could before I died. Took about respawns to kill her.
---
It's an unmarked quest
---
Love it.
---
Your lv200 and do poor dmg. Stop blaming other people and fix your build.
---
Legendary Scorched exist. They seem to be very rare though, but they do exist.
---
Dirty. And I still bought this with the swiftness. I love it and have a source of boiled water for my soups inside my bunker. 
---
I don't need the outdoors anymore.
---
I just realize the meta here. I'm a hermit IRL being a hermit in F76.
---
They changed it to where you can't put stuff in corpses anymore, but how did you manage that anyway? That's atleast 3 button presses.
---
This is the best way to end this. It's a 2 way street. Wanna keep wasting their time? You're gonna chance losing your junk or get irradiated as hell. Lol
---
Thank you this bug fix is a major improvement either way. But i also understand the old saying 50 bugs patch one out now you have 51 bugs. It happens programming is hell sometimes. Tell the dev team i wish them well on the journy to slay the bug  kraken. Its a hard beast to kill.
---
I have the feeling the op doesn't have a job, possibly still within a parent basement.
---
This is why button mashing is always a bad idea.
---
Just went through this all on my own once I found a post about the packages!  Weirdly we have different codes?  Maybe it has multiple inputs!
---
I thought it increased until you hit level 50 and then it stops there.
---
Two. Open inventory, drop weapon. Then someone can take it.
---
Yes, practically everything is broken.
---
Except it's a minimum max level event. They should have level restrictions for content like any other online RPG. I hear people say dataminers proved her health doesn't go up, but I'm fairly certain it only goes so high. I think it's after 8 people the health stops increasing. I could be wrong, but either way just the spawns the extra players cause is enough if a headache. At 25 they can't even handle the adds.
---
Hey, hey let's keep it nice. OP has a cool enough idea, I'm more-so commenting that the actual process of programming a mob to hunt a character in an already broken game just isn't practical.. fix the game first work on the pathfinding and AI first..
---
I stand by my other comment then; sporadic button mashing is never a good idea, especially if this game.
---
There is no need to list non-bugs like NW. That is just your request.
---
&gt; testing the live build with any average equipped player
---
Sadly, this fiasco proves two things.
---
1. They don't test at all. One single tester, playing the game for real, needs ten minutes to notice than the patch breaks critical parts of the game.
---
2, The code and the deep structures of the program, at this point, must be a mess, hard to edit/control by them. 
---
A shame for us, who still have hope in the immense (unleashed) potential of FO76.
---
Sometimes if I get bored I go launch the bodies and see how far they go.
---
saw some awesome base defenses that looked like ww2 pill boxes wish i had taken pics to show you now :P
---
Thats cool, i hope people dont leave if they get the map they dont want.
---
Oh that’s awesome! My guy lives in a fortified manor with no Build budget left haha. :)
---
Some (daily?) quests will not show proper completion messages.
---
Dont mind in the slightest. Love your bug round ups. Lol. Always a good read.
---
Lord I would be pissed. This why I don't play any PVP games, blood pressure issues. Hahaha.
---
Code is different for everyone!
---
There is a storage box attached to the right side of the robots pod.
---
Also side note the presents don’t come out til Thursday but it will still collect the toys etc
---
Buddy would be proud
---
It was just a tree in the shop they didnt indicate you could decorate it lol.  Though yes it does seem like an oversight and that tree looks huge.
---
I agree with all this. Considering wastelanders should have already been out for months. Its something they should be able to add time wise considering they delayed it because they said they wanted to add more and bug test. Its not like they just announced it. They have had over a year.
---
I would like to see some Krampus but hey thats just me.
---
That's actually normal for a big update ala Railjack prolouge or such. Emergency hotfixes on the same day or day after, then getting the finer things tuned after the weekend.
---
Cool beans bromosapien. Im 30 with a medical degree but i do love my games, and reddit nonsense.
---
Thank you
---
Oh i agree i was just trying to point out the other side of the coin thats it. We were all once low level players, maybe im wrong and they were trying to ruin the event i dont know, i can only speak from my experience and how i would show up at event and players would grumble about it. I thought i was helping but i always got the hint and would leave.
---
Good to know
---
I think they could have worked on the existing enemies alot more. Left the game for 8 months, hopped in a few days ago and it feels like they cleaned up a ton and listened to their fans.. however the enemies are not smart, there's a ton of small stuff that Bethesda seems to roll over without caring.
---
I agree 100%. Many of my friends have passed on special items because they missed the bundle, bought the items individually and when the bundle came back were faced with literally a smoke machine for like 1500 atoms (or whatever that bundle price was). Technically the should just be given the smoke machine since they already bought the items (at a much higher total than the bundle) individually. I don't know how they've not thought to incorporate this change already but it is long overdue.
---
They could deck out the sheepsquatch
---
I can see the top of my head threw the straw hat. Turned out to be a pretty good hat, but I can't wear it, seeing my head threw it bothers me. 😞
---
Holiday includes Christmas. Nobody is attacking you.
---
Yea it can be fair, but at least give the PVE players a chance to earn something similar is all I’m asking. PvP players get unique things plus the PvE stuff too, non-PvPers don’t get anything special for all the time we put in to the game
---
Eve Online breaking boot.ini was worse
---
How do I unhack it?
---
It’s probably a deformity
---
I rarely carry junk I can't easily replace &amp; I already have all the mutations.  So game on if you think that's a good use of your munitions.  I'll even give you some rounds if you run out.
---
Yup.
---
Exactly. The event failed and it wasn’t the fault of any of the lvl 25s.
---
So, the measure of a good build is being able to solo the sbq? Ok
---
You are the tester.
---
Bruh, it fits perfect inside my base... I dont know what you mean
---
Haha, yeah it's a big tree for sure.
---
Yes plus being a bloodied build
---
If i find her in WL thats whats gonna happen to her.
---
I didn't get mr fuzzy tokens
---
No What they need to do is release the server software and modding tools so that the modding community do the job that they always do... Fix the bugs that have existed in Bethesda games that they never fixed.
---
This is not the only way they try to crush the christmas spirit.
---
I bet you have Escape Artist and it’s causing the momentary invisibility
---
RemindME! 2 hours
---
This patch has been seriously buggy for me
---
I started my search at Camp McClintock, which made me go to the Charleston Capital where I found my first "package". Once you have that you can start piecing stuff together, one thing I noticed is a lot of the locations you'd find naturally by doing a fresh playthrough overtime.
---
Has anyone found the key to PO Box 999?
---
It’s not just unyielding armor that it’s affecting - it’s just much more noticeable due to the weight benefit unyielding can give
---
Logged in to an unloaded weapon ( inspite of me making sure it was loaded prior to logging out ) reloaded that weapon and now Im overencumbered, couldn't figure out what was going on at 1st until I started switching weapons, and yes even just switching from a rifle to a heavygun such as a .50 cal without reloading still causes this problem though it is intermittent.
---
I whole heartedly support your gaming, involvement and ideas. Keep em coming. More than anything keep a realistic expectation value here.. we expected the game to be 80% better from the beta, when that didn't happen the cannibalism began.
---
Yup, it's the teaser/lead-in to the upcoming Wastelanders content.  Keep going and eventually you'll get access to Vault 79.
---
kind of a mix.  there are a bunch of combat ones like kill robots with melee or energy weapons that can net you a lot, but generally,its grinding the weekly and daily challenges
---
Not sure, i think its as fast\slow as any water fountain in fallout 4 - i think you can see them or test them in Nuclear Winter's lobby
---
All armor I know. But my losses was 70 Dr and 15%. Kinda funny that 99 out of 100 posts today have been related to unyealding. That shit is so op most noticed the second the logged lol.
---
its a sheeple kinda world out there kids
---
ah I had a hunch that would be the first place because of the files at the desk! thanks!
---
When you do, let me know about the tree and lights. If you have success, I may consider buying it
---
I’m melee and I only use riffles as a last resort so I didn’t know til I checked reddit but yeah once it happened it was noticeable lol
---
Reloading during encrypted with a little lag. Dropped an all rise as it was on top of the list.
---
Hardly button mashing lol.
---
Can confirm shocks didn't negate it, used to have them and still got the bug. Glad they've got their best efforts on fixing the bugs that impact the game the most. Instead of that one that completely disables your ability to do any damage using guns to any thing until a reconnect. That one's cool.
---
Bethesda is really testing the limits of the saying: fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.
---
Fool me 385 times, time to delete the game.
---
Why do you guys keep playing? I am legitimately curious, as somebody who holds fallout very dear to my gamerheart, I could not ignore all the problems and bugs anymore a long time ago. By now it should come as no surprise at all, that whoever is in charge of the development of this game, is trying to find a road, at sea, in a thick fog, blindfolded with two prosthetic eyes.
---
What in the world of fallout 76 is it that makes you come back?
---
They fix one thing only to make a second thing worse, then they fix the second thing only to make third thing unplayable, then they release a new thing and wow would you look at that the first thing that was wrong is now back. It wouldn't surprise me if you can still hear blaring gunshots when nobody is firing any guns.
---
It's like waiting in line for a chicken sandwich, and when you're done waiting in line and it's your turn you get stabbed. Then moments later you're like oh well guess I'll get back in line.
---
Only reason I'm still following this sub is because I want to know if it ever gets better. But so far it has only confirmed that when I deleted this game a while back I did the right thing.
---
I am getting exhausted, truly.
---
I see your point, you right at how you see it. I am over lvl 200 in nw, I've been playing it seens day one. I know many good loot locating and both of the maps. And i have to say that I am really not happy about Bethesda new mechanic. I don't use wall hack and aim bot, I need terminals to see were to go and plan my route. I cant just run into team of 4 with board and 10mm pistol and somehow get out of it alive. So after this update they lost me, and my team mate. 2 less players that have been playing seens day one of nw
---
My perk stats dont match my pip boy specail stats ...I have no effects going but some stats negative 2 or 3?
---
I hear ya there, you think they could mess with the models so the covered part of the head/ hair would be “buzzed down” (don’t know how to word it) and expose what’s left out...
---
oo I need this dress tho
---
I feel like right now youre angry, but youll most likely be back.
---
Why do you need help? Like what with?
---
Liberty Prime?
---
Yes?
---
Sounds fun
---
None of those things are true. It's people like you who cry wolf that make it hard for people to report real problems.
---
I'm at the part of Mission: Countdown Alpha/I Am Become Death and I can't kill the mobs of enemies and fix the reactor pipes before the radiation kills me.
---
Some quest/event completions no longer show the rewards. In particular, none of the Camden Park dailies have the quest completion notification. You still get the rewards, but you no longer get the rewards list on the screen. Biv and scout dailies still work as usual.
---
There was an instance where I saw a hotfix minutes after a patch. DE really are the best developers at the moment. I dont know any other company that are so in touch with their community and actually listens to their feedback.
---
I just wanna get it done so my codes don't expire. I don't really have any time to play during my work week unfortunately.
---
what are you talking about..try playing the game..and apparently its not affecting everyone..although 3 of my.friends are affected by it...as soon as i fire my weapon all.effects of my.armor.stop working.
---
*Kicks can*... Fucking embarrassing!
---
You can use the website nukacript or something like that for codes every week, so you don’t need to break the codes. I could help but I can’t tonight. PLUS, I’d use excavator power armor or some power armor for the radiation.
---
Im a low level so I'll be dropped a lot wouldn't mind helping you out tho psn: ghoulish69
---
I don't have any power armor unfortunately 😭
---
Just to add to all of this, I keep getting the Over-encumbered message and actual effect, even though I’m 30 lbs away from my cap. 
---
I also noticed food drain rate is a lot faster for me. No parasites or any hunger effects, and it seriously drains a full bar in like 20 minutes. I couldn’t figure out why.
---
Mike Tyson saying stealth "stelf"
---
This is unfortunately not new and has been going on *at least* since the Wild Appalachia update. 99% of the time, simply moving the cursor out of the vendor's item list and back in will fix this, by the way. No need to fiddle with your own inventory or anything else.
---
You launch a nuke and kill the queen and that is the endgame. Sorry to be the one to tell you lol
---
First of all, if you're filing a lawsuit, you're not talking about *crime*--you're talking about filing a *civil* lawsuit.
---
Where criminal matters are concerned, jurisdiction is dictated (in part) by where the crime was committed; there can be arguments over which entity has the highest authority in that location.  *Whether* a crime was committed--that is, whether certain actions constituted a violation of criminal law--is *entirely* dependent on jurisdiction. For example, if I smoke pot in Maine, that's not a crime, even though it would have been if I'd lit up in New Hampshire.
---
But we're talking about something a lot simpler, because you're threatening to file a civil suit. Here's the problem: the EULA you agreed to by installing and playing the game explicitly forbids you from taking Zenimax/Bethesda to court. In fact, it states that you agree that, in the case of any disagreement over your use of the software, your sole recourse is to *uninstall and stop playing.* 
---
And that EULA is completely valid in 49 states... Guess which state protects its citizens' right to have their day in court, even prohibiting limitations on class action lawsuits? Yep, California. So if you can justify filing your lawsuit there, there's a chance that it can go forward. (You'd still have to show that you suffered *actual harm* because of Fallout; good luck with that.) But, since you don't live there and Zenimax has no particular presence there, they would immediately file for, and be granted, a change of venue--and, in every other jurisdiction but California, your lawsuit is dead in the water because you agreed that you're not allowed to sue when you installed the game.
---
There's a reason why the only class action lawsuit to have been filed over this nonsense (in particular, over the lack of a return policy given the state of the game at launch) was filed in California, and why every represented class member is a Californian. This is that reason. And that one is still percolating, afaik; I don't think Bethesda has even responded yet.
---
Try to keep in mind that the fact that *you* don't know what you're talking about doesn't mean that everyone who tries to set you straight is equally ignorant.
---
Made a similar comment but got downvoted to hell + thread deleted by mods.
---
I understand that but I'm still trying to finish the story at the moment.
---
I transfer by teaming up with a friend, dropping stuff, and then logging over and joining his world again, it's not perfect, and a more streamlined method would be great😅. That being said, if you're on PC, I'd be willing to help you transfer, if you need someone :)
---
What's mentioned if Vegas? I gotta ask..
---
Do you get anything for doing this, like with the other scavenger hunts?
---
Yeah, wastelanders will be a hot steaming pile of poo
---
Nah, but the experience of finding the clues and the eventual reveal at the end was worth it.
---
Well doing this is finishing the story. They’re connected.
---
Pretty much, yeah
---
Stealth is still broken right? Guess they couldn't screw that up lol. Love the pun BTW.
---
I understand that.
---
All it does is create more lag on top of the normal lag in this game which equals out to more time in the menu. If they persist, I usually mute the game, go make a sandwich/coffee or take a little break.
---
Noice. Sorry about the downsides, some people don't appreciate a good dad joke I suppose
---
I'll add ya. I'm psn: anticlockclock
---
I am having such trouble starting this quest! I went to Grafton Pawn Shop, picked up the notes by the door but none of those notes seem to indicate a place to visit next-- Any hints? I want to try to do this in order if I can, and with limited help but I honestly don't know what step to take next. I feel like I've turned this Pawn Shop upside down.
---
Let’s not emulate Tinker Tom just yet.
---
lol..your funny..but no..its happened to many people. get out from under that rock.
---
https://i.imgur.com/p5zXzJW.jpg
---
Many people lost their weapons today?
---
I too have this problem. Will you accept me into this club of sadness, brothers and sisters?
---
I'm glad we have this subreddit to discuss the overwhelming problems in this game. The official Bethesda FO76 forums seem to have a handful of users reply like they work for the company or have some financial investment.
---
Hello. I havent completed the story line myself. Not much questing at all and im level 150+. So i cant help much there. But what i can help u with is make u a set of power armor.  Ill make one that suits your character level.  Psn unikron08 ill be on tomorrow. Im at work right now. Pacific time zone.
---
Livery prime
---
Yeah I'm angry a little. But I think there is some truth in what I say.
---
I wish to play nw in old way. With new vote system its cool but the lack of players and a lot of Hacker I cant see myself enjoying this anymore
---
Sounds from here like it’s only affecting a subset of weapons (explosive harpoons only?). And maybe even a subset of a subset, as people with those weapons are not all affected.
---
If it’s actually e.g. one weapon type *with* a specific mod (my first thought scrolling through was harpoon+flechette), then it’s very edge-case. Probably already in the issue tracker, just not a priority because it’s not going to affect relatively large numbers of people.
---
Of course it may be more widespread, but looking at the replies, the title is hyperbole - this self evidently isn’t affecting all weapons, just from the replies to this post.
---
They still have 2-5 hour patch times when they’re supposedly testing that their stuff works, what a joke
---
I'd never get to place my camp, then. I purposefully put mine in the middle of nowhere, next to no resources and I still get people who have their building exactly where mine is, lol.
---
Grinding out levels to be strong enough to take on later game content is hardly new or "mindblowing"
---
I paid 60 dollars for Destiny and Destiny 2 and yet I couldn't just run straight into any of the raids - I had to work to first ensure I was well equipped So I could survive it.
---
In fact, its commonly used in a lot of games.
---
But even putting all that aside, the quest "Belly of the Beast" that awards you a set of power armor is an actual story mission so there is no reason not to get it if you don't already have it.
---
The locations in the link I provided require a quick fast travel to those locations - hardly what you might call "grinding"
---
Great work! How'd you figure out (spoiler ahead) &gt;!which church had the map fragment? Did you search more than one church, or was there another clue that led you there?!&lt;
---
Interesting!  I got one of them from the purveyor today forgot what the third effect was, something crappy like better bash I think.  I'll have to try it out now my regular guns break so fast.  I'm not buying springs and screws for BSG's screw up.
---
Was two of us working on it, just checked churches you could enter. Luckily the 2nd one we checked was the right place!
---
An assorted set of Uny/aid wr scout armor. I tried close to two dozen different weapons eventually including legacy, 250dr, legacy with 250dr, etc-etc.
---
I just want someone to help me finish the story quick, that's all. I don't wanna do anything else at this point. This game has pushed me beyond what I can take anymore after having to do 10 Enclave events and then looking for 8 pieces of codes. I'm just over doing anything else besides finishing the story. If I get that outta the way, I'll likely be inclined to do something else but my OCD is literally driving me fucking insane with this game and I can't handle it anymore.
---
Thats a lot of damage, im somewhat glad i only use melee right now...
---
If you are salty enough or mad at Bethesda's marketing decisions, then you are welcome to the brotherhood
---
The approach to Bethesda nowadays "OK, don't touch anything, we don't need fixes"
---
Downloading a 2.6 GB update right now....Hopefully fixing the more horrific gimping of weapons and armor.
---
I really don't care what other people think. I do however care that the game breaks more with almost every new patch
---
It has not been fixed, it hasn't even been 24 hours yet since the update released
---
Pretty lucky! I saw the random words and never would have thought that they referred to locations. Kudos.
---
We're in different time zones i guess
---
I don't know who Pepe Silva is but he sure gets alot of packages
---
I've only played NW twice.  Just not my thing.  My kid plays Fortnite; it's basically the same thing.  I don't know how the perk cards, etc. work and it seems like a completely different game than base FO76.
---
How are they cheating?  Is this unique to NW; or is it something that can be exploited in adventure?
---
OP said it has been happening since before patch. Plus stated they are melee.
---
First one we got was "Cryptid", from there we kinda knew the general idea behind the rest of the words. The school one took sometime given the size of the locations!
---
Yes, somewhere between next Tuesday and colonization of Mars
---
Ah missed it. Just so used to seein the same shit all day just lumped it in with the rest
---
I've noticed this too. I seem to be squishier since they patched the bug where armor wasnt breaking
---
add me: Owl_No 
---
i shall help
---
Fix coming somewhere between next Tuesday and colonization of Mars
---
Adding you now. Thank you so much! I GREATLY appreciate it! I just need the story outta my way so I can actually feel like I can do other things besides stress out about the story.
---
The updates go live at the same time regardless of time zones
---
7am pt
---
10am et
---
15:00 (3pm) uk 
---
Etc
---
Or a hazmat suit.
---
Pretty sure we're the testers. Been like this since 76 came out.  
---
At least we don't pay to be the testers, right?
---
LOL this guy gets it
---
Would you mind dropping a hint of where to look at Camp McClintock? I've been looking all around and haven't quite found any new notes yet
---
I know why you went to McClintock first but what did you find that pointed you to Charleston? The only thing I seen that was from Charleston was the Charleston herald which was already there before this update
---
HMMMMMmmmmmm. Now that you mention it I did notice the repair kits on sale...
---
Charging barrels are awful because it drops to a fire rate that's roughly the same as the Gatling gun, but the max damage is only in the 70's.  The damage for charging barrels should be double what they are to make it worthwhile.
---
Yes I played with my shotguns before and after patch, my first thought was ‘Jesus Christ why do they feel the need to nerf something already useless again’.
---
This is why I have zero faith in wastelanders being worth my time
---
That guy is on the left, under desk?
---
I use the WiFi from the guy who lives on the next street over, only took an hour lmao
---
Some bugs I’ve noticed, a few of which are not new, but never seem to be brought up.
---
Someone To Talk To is not repeatable.  I’ve only done it once each with four characters.
---
For Idle Explosives, after finding Boomer at the motel, you need to quit and re-enter the world to actually talk to him.  Otherwise you can’t interact and can walk right through him.
---
Upon logging in, the Leather Coat needs to be taken off and re-equipped in order to show your hands in 1st person, about 60% of the time.
---
Enemy loot will sometimes not show up completely while “free looting” with E (on PC).  You sometimes have to press R to enter the menu to see additional meat, weapons and quest related items.  I was wondering why some meat piles weren’t disappearing after I looted them, until a legendary ghoul turned into empty meat pile, and I pressed R to inspect further.  It had items “hidden” within that didn’t show up with a normal inspection, including the legendary item.  This started happening the Thursday or Friday before patch 16.
---
Similarly, I was experiencing strange effects with my stats at the same time.  It was as if some buff or equipment effect was counted as double.  My agility is normally 37, but it was 42 last weekend without a bobble head or any food effect active.  My STR and CHA were similarly abnormal.  Removing and equipping my armor seemed to fix the “problem”.
---
The Lock and Load perk seems to periodically switch off on its own.  I couldn’t figure out what was causing the conflict, but some reloads during normal play with both a 50 cal and LMG were significantly slower.  Removing and equipping the perk doesn’t necessarily solve the issue.  Neither of my heavyPA character’s guns have a faster reload legendary effect.
---
On my rifleman, a Fixer with a 15% reload effect behaves the same way.  Some reloads are noticeably slower.  Ground Pounder seems unaffected, but I only use it when Glow Sight is totally useless.  SBQ, for example.  It could be that I haven’t done whatever causes the conflict while having GP perked in.
---
My unyielding was working just fine tonight
---
I have seen them frequently drop baby rattles
---
There is some army papers that lead you further, they are in the upstairs under the choke board
---
Can't wait to see what happens with wastelanders, going to be apocolyptic
---
Such as?
---
Be epic. Need survival camp's for all... And survival rules as well. Camp's would have to go tho...
---
Yeah, I had someone put a stabilized long barrel on it, as well as the focuser and a beta wave deal. It shreds. Think the dmg is 160 or so with a fire rate around 230. Can't wait to prime it. 
---
It's Bffr, I've got Bffr in lmg, 50cal, mini, and gattling. And I have to say that this Ultracite gattling laser has got to be the most fun out of them. Which is a really hard to say cuz I love them all haha
---
Yeah, this may sound lame, but I actually datamined the locations of the fragments, and &gt;!Morgantown HS!&lt; was the hardest to find because it's in an interior cell, so I couldn't just map the coordinates. I didn't even realize it was connected with "Teach" so I searched every single room in the building...
---
No capes.
---
I found the mail at the pawn shop and the Ghoul's note on the church door across the street.  Not sure if they are connected.
---
I don't know if anyone has noticed but on Ps4 stealth boys immediately put you into danger now. I am in Huntsville, in a building out of the line of sight of any super mutant. I go from hidden yellow to danger red the instant I use a stealth boy.
---
Meh. Everyone else has moved on.
---
People who don't play 76 aren't going to take notice of a shitty patch. The games a year old. Unless they do something absurdly gargantuanly stupid, it's only fans who are heading about this shot now.
---
For U
---
Didnt they start selling repair kits? Maybe its not a bug but a desing to increase that microtranaction cheese
---
Yeah it's been talked about before. I would love it. Throw in a mega behemoth in the savage divide. A super sloth or crab in the mire, a big ass grafton monster in toxi valley, and maybe some huge mile rat in the Ash heap?
---
They changed something a while back and melee enemies hit a lot harder. You may try blocker.
---
P.s. I have bio mesh on my chest plate and the secret agent perk on. Stood up in stealth A.I. loses track of me. If I crotch and move an inch instant danger.
---
Reload your weapon while standing. They moved the 250 bug to armors now. Tbh unyealding has broke appt of things due to code issues like endurance boosts not y working. Seems they are untying a knot that re ties it's self.
---
My main have 4 unyielding pieces and he wasn’t affected by any issues tonight. Special and weight capacity didn’t change one bit. My other character has 4 vanguard and his DR definitely dropped 100+ after every reload. Even with a mele it dropped
---
Open your miiiind.
---
Gotta eat them all till you find the ones with Meat of Champions.
---
Not many seemed to notice but around halloween i felt like all armor got nerfed. Maybe its that.
---
Vampire outfit kind of has a cape.  8 bucks sucka.
---
I did all night. Didn’t affect my unyielding guy. Just my vanguard guy was affected. Even changed his DR with a mele
---
I understand youre angry. And maybe ive gone about it the wrong way and for that i apologize. Sincerely. Not being a troll or a dick. 
---
Ive been where you are. Yet here I am.
---
You gain about 45-55% more damage in a cost of 70% rate of fire, which means overall dps is about 60% lower compared to the standard barrel. Its a nonsense, need a rebalance.
---
Excuse me wtf? 
---
You expect them to verify an exploit?
---
Hey Bethesda is this a ruling exploit? 
---
Yup. 
---
Cool thanks. Time to dupe some shit.
---
Of course they won't verify it. Doesn't mean they won't investigate it
---
Yeh but say u have your combat armour and u want to rock a red cape without it hiding your armour is what I’m thinking
---
Hmm. Cool. I don't unyealding at all but my vanguard took the hit. Maybe they are dropping patches
---
Oh neat, the next one will be all colored asylums turn into white dirtys 😂
---
*In Thick West Virginian Drawl*
---
"Git yer feks straight!  Those thar fir'trucks are 'Merican!  Damned Rooskies copied ir designs and stole ir jabs!"
---
Yeah. Seems like the concensus is they're utter garbage haha
---
Yeah wtf is going on here... Reload and bam im over-cumbered...
---
Yeah my excavator is down 100 pound in weight, im stuck with a bunch of  2 to 3 star weapons at 503 when i should be at 603lbs!
---
I can agree that the vanguard was definitely broken so I just played my bloody guy all night. Zero issues with him other than not getting any Mr Fuzzy tokens lol
---
Using somebodys elses internet took u 1 hour took me around 5 my internet sucks
---
THY TUK ER JERBS!!!!
---
If you're on Xbox, I would be careful about "name calling" in messages. Even though they were an ass and completely provoked you in game, they can report the message which is the only proof of anyone's "wrong doing" and they will ban accordingly. Even something as little as "jerk" can be brought under scrutiny and could come with a ban.
---
Ok.  I just don't think of this game that way.  I kind of wish they would've  skipped the atom shop and 'cute' costumes in general, but I'm old.
---
That said; optional capes are fine with me if it fits with the lore.
---
This, there is definitely something new broken with friends trying to join private server with scope set to all friends.  Hit this tonight on Xbox when we had friends trying to join.
---
Thanks ! I haven't seen a new event yet not sure what it's called . i will watch for it !
---
Im the halfwit and u dont know what an example is and if u cant understand what i meant let me clarify people were cheesing it becuz it was ridiculous and not very fun to do u can do these things and make them fun to do with a small amount of effort i mean really i camped in a bush dindnt fire a shot or pick up a gun won twice cuz the end mobs killed them how bout that for a challenge
---
I've also gone there, what if the weapons breaking so fast (saw in another post) is for upcoming super duper repair kits?
---
They only have a 1 in 43 chance (2.3%) to drop a baby rattle, and it's only because it's in a [loot list of "Very Small Junk"](https://i.imgur.com/GYj0Yua.png) which is also shared by Yao Guai, Rabbits, Wendigos, Snallygasters, and Mole Miners.
---
I might be online in 10 hours or so. Could also help, just need to find some cores for my PA first.
---
PSN TraGolv
---
Definitely see this on Xbox a lot tonight and previously doing queen runs with bots and turrets getting this bug trying to sneak kill.  I see the damage show up on the screen saying they are hit but no damage taken off their life bars. 
---
A turrent nor bot can tank 6000+ damage wtf...
---
Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!
---
This is true 😂😂 didn’t even think about that
---
Please don't, we have one of the nicest in game communities. Don't think that will still be the case if it goes f2p. Not to mention we already paid for it.
---
Where was it in the end? I must have searched "teach" top to bottom and found nothing
---
I can also give you half of mine. The 6 I can give you are fully charged as well.
---
So it works like the 250 bug. Takes away primary stat. Also avoided the same way.. crouch while reloading.
---
These legendary effects are getting to be a Hassel.
---
They said free content for years to come. Not surprised, but I'm very happy they are sticking to it.
---
One that randomly shows up all over the map maybe the scorched beast king...great idea no where is safe
---
It's good to see I'm not the only one with this issue.
---
It's really sad this happens just before the holiday event and I'm not really sure on how to proceed playing the game now .
---
Because reloading my armour or world everytime I use a weapon seems  laborious.
---
Maybe I'll play nuclear winter for a while
---
And hopefully there will be an hotfix later today.
---
(I'm not getting my hopes up though 🙁)
---
Nope.  Armor is still busted.  They had better not put out terabytes in hot fixes over the next couple of days...
---
The "Teach" fragment is &gt;!on a teacher's desk in a classroom on the top floor of Morgantown High School.!&lt;
---
Those little commie robot bastards rode them over.
---
War, war never changes.
---
scorched beast king, great idea! 30% chance to spawn after you kill the queen :)
---
I think there’s an idea that Bethesdas full army of engineers are behind this game, when in actuality it’s probably a maximum of six coders clicking away in an unremarkable office complex suite.  
---
The code is probably the equivalent of opening up the 50 year old electrical box at the end of your block.  Dozens of electricians with varying levels of talent have added, removed, spliced and left miles of tangled, frayed wiring that connects to nothing or everything.  You can only guess.
---
That’s why they need to build a test server.  Something breaks every single patch, and they have eager, free QC on tap whenever they want it.  I used to participate in DDO’s test server and we’d find every bug and most exploits in under an hour.  We road tested new equipment and something like the Strangler PA acid damage issue would be found immediately, or the lack of unyielding effects on thorn armor.
---
Lend lease. Could apply here.
---
Thats not true it mostly works
---
Again? Jesus!
---
We wait for others to fast travel there and tag them, It makes it easier for everyone to get a lot of legendaries.
---
Hi Bethesda, is XYZ an exploit or acceptable gameplay? 
---
- Sorry we don't verify exploits.
---
I already know what the exploit IS, so what you just said makes no sense.
---
I’m canceling 1 of 2 fo76 subscriptions as this is beyond unacceptable how we paid for this total turd of an update. 
---
I may just totally give up on fo76 and cancel my main account fo76 subscription as well.
---
The only consistent thing they can accomplish is fucking up their own updates, habitually at this point with their patch history... they are out of get out of jail cards and out of control.
---
Fire all leadership and leads that are responsible for these patches, none of them are doing their fucking jobs and have any business working in this line of work with this continuous display of incompetency. 
---
If heads do not roll with a public announcement of firings I’m canceling my main fo1st subscription as well and ending my support for this game entirely.  I’m done with giving you the benefit of the doubt.
---
How dare those imbeciles get my fo1st money to pay their salaries/wages.
---
Did you expect anything else from them?
---
All i know is that i update it yesterday, sorry i dont see the sun
---
Yeh lol well didnt the brotherhood elders have that sort of garb /.
---
But you can get improved repair kits frome the scorched earth event thats even better than the ones in the atomic shop
---
Honest question; why are people still playing at this point? Why will people continue to play after this like nothing happened? 
---
Y'all deserve better than this shit-heap.
---
Because there aren't any...
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yeah Ive noticed those too. Really want those icicle lights, theyd look great in my blue-themed bathhouse camp
---
If you live in power armor, your day is mostly unaffected.  Gun durability is exactly the same if you don’t use Gunsmith to begin with.  The perk seems to deactivate on reload.  My 50 cal deteriorates at exactly the same rate as it did over the weekend.  It’s totally manageable.  I exit power armor to cook food and repair, and don’t even have a suit of regular armor underneath.  My sniper is screwed, but the heavy gunner is unaffected.
---
Same for me today, that combined with the broken armor prefix after reloading glitch, Inqyut for the day.
---
Iguana bits and iguana on a stick, not sure which one is human and which one is iguana?
---
Yeah that would be bad ass...what would be cool is that u get 4 star legendaries from him, not sure what the 4rth star would be but why show 5 stars when all we get is 3 stars? Make no sense
---
Would you mind sharing your list of locations in a private message?  (:
---
Yes, I think it's a great idea to provide the robots with literature for how best to serve us. I see no possible downside to this......none at all.
---
No thanks.
---
Unless you have a pile of lvl 1-thru-50 legendary armor sets on hand to grow into, the bug won’t affect your new character in any appreciable way.
---
Der der DER!!!!
---
Maybe have a survival mode server where all u get is the tent and increase the number of player, there would be wars over resources then i bet money on that...lol
---
Der der DER!!!
---
Used L25 excavator up until 60ish when I decided to make me a L45 set. Works great along with the Ultracite (which I rarely use).
---
Excavator was enough to complete main quest and participate in all events, pretty much just SBQ that tenda to kill me a bit (running bloodied melee).
---
Primary legendary effects have been fucked. Scroll through to see how to avoid. If you're a bloodied build then don't play or try something else till fix comes.
---
This is huge towards bloodied who rely on unyealding to carry them thru the game. I go vanguard's and noticed a hit but it didn't stop me from moving.
---
“Honestly” why do people keep asking this????
---
This is fantastic. Listen, I know you guys love playing this game, but you have GOT to be kidding me.
---
I have a set of power armor i can give u its a full set of raider armor psn RoninRage0352 i will be on for a couple hours this morning around 7am eastern time til maybe 9am just friend request me and i will hook u up...
---
Criminal matters are more readily understood by a layperson. Simply using a crime as a comparison to point out that universal immunity from state, federal, and international law can't be created by means of location.
---
Additionally, certain state and federal agencies have enforcement powers that can be tapped.
---
Finally, if you are familiar with shrink-wrap agreements commonly used in software licenses, you probably already know that their enforceability is dubious in the United States.
---
They are murican made actually 🤣 Mama Dolce producing them little bastards on murican soil 🤣
---
Imagine if they started looping machine gun sounds after they disappear.  Now that would have to be considered fine art.
---
To be fair, enemies never disappeared.  The meat pile just goes to their spawn point.  If you know where it is, there’s no problem.
---
I'll just post it here in a spoiler tag for anyone else who wants to see them. 
---
&gt;!These are just the fragments; I haven't mapped the packages yet. I kinda want to do those the normal way first. 1) Morgantown High School - on a teacher's desk in a classroom on the top floor. //

The armor thing is pretty annoying. Had to take all armor off and put back on last night lol. Besides resistances going down the shitter maybe losing 3 ammo weight reductions so automatically over encumbered. Who knows if sneak or ap refresh is working??
---
When you say armour breaks - You are referring the the CND I'm guessing.
---
Now, in regards to armour breaking, you are aware that up until two weeks ago there was a bug that meant armour didn't really break at all? - Approx 2 weeks ago they fixed THAT bug and now Armour breaks.
---
jesus fucking christ. like, yeah, sure, they dont have that many people working on the game, and most of them are working on wastelanders, but literally what the fuck is this? do the scripters test it themselves so they know what to check or do they have a team of fucking designated gibbons?
---
so this is happening again  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/e94i8a/so\_the\_whitesprings\_robot\_golf\_club\_bug\_is\_back/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/e94i8a/so_the_whitesprings_robot_golf_club_bug_is_back/)
---
Thank you! I had it narrowed down to the types of places just not the exact ones and really didnt want to spend a week searching :p
---
You loose rested and tuned, but not deseases? I think you should either loose all or none.
---
On a slight side note, anyone else invested in luck of the draw perks which supposedly repair weapons randomly, I have the card at level 2 and haven’t had the notification or sound affect of a random repair in months so I’m now convinced it’s broken? Anyone else just out of interest?
---
I dunno, It seemed to me that every time I reloaded my weapon I was losing the effects of 1 armor piece each time. Chameleon was first, then all the unyielding quit giving bonus stats. Weird stuff
---
I’ve noticed it’s a few events it doesn’t show up but thankfully you do get the rewards for completing the event, I wanna say the reason for it breaking was Bethesda trying to fix caps reward not popping up big 🤔
---
Sounds nice and I’m in the same boat they look really cool.
---
If it's Torso you're looking at 51DR vs 60DR
---
theres several coal veins out in front of the overseers house in Welch
---
Cause they think they have been left out of one of their favorite franchise by having a multiplayer game Is the Short answer.
---
Calm down.  It hasn’t even been close to 24 hours yet.
---
Resume the hyperventilation if it’s still broken on Thursday.
---
Who gives a fuck what someone else thinks?  Play the game if you like it.  You look like more of a fool if some Youtuber’s rant has any importance to you.
---
You only have to have 1 piece of the srmor to get the voice
---
&gt;With the right armor set **you can take**.and dish out as.much damage as you can in PA
---
Debateable, With a full set of PA, you have a 42% Damage Reduction - Not many armour sets outside full sets of "Slayer" can compete with that and get close to the DR that PA has.
---
We've got one, it's called path 16.0
---
I was wondering why I had lost some CHR when I was selling last night despite being practically on 0 health due to rads :/
---
So I can’t just change the torso or helm to get rid of the voice, I have to change the whole set?
---
Can’t wait to see how Rifle Gaming spins this into a positive light.
---
Yea or just turn down volume unfortunately
---
Imagine what the game would be if Bethesda used Unreal Engine 4 and Easy Anti Cheat. In no universe would that game be a bad game.
---
Can’t wait to see what happens in a few days. Hopefully they announce that they’re handing the game off to a more capable studio/ dev team
---
Is the legendary armour issue linked to weapons with the 250drwr effect? I don't have any guns with that perk and I haven't had any issues with my armour effects breaking
---
People have been asking this exact thing since the very first patch of the game
---
That won’t even work because it will still slow down the game from it talking despite not being able to hear it. When you’re fighting a group of enemies and the voice overlaps it just makes the game fucking self destruct. That’s fucking hilarious. Thanks man.
---
Shadow Prime PA skin plays multiple voice lines almost simulatenously when enemy is sighted; it's quite obnoxious.
---
Don't know about other variants, only have this one skin. Already clocked a ticket on Beth site.
---
+1 sjw points for letting us know whales aren't fat.:)
---
I would get rampant angry messages for calling someone fat and them not understanding the terminology. I'd rather have notifications that are meaningful than just pissed off players.
---
If you listen to some of the dialogue of the bot, it seems like it’s subroutines are kinda wonky so it randomly will switch between seeing you as naughty or nice. Hence the reason you’ll sometimes get coal instead of toys lol
---
It's a LOT slower than collecting from a stream. It's faster for to run to the stream, collect and return than use the sink next to my cooker. Very disappointing as aesthetically it's fairly pleasing. Why we can't simply have a Collect n option, rather than button mashing, continues to confound me.

Man, you are asking for a downvotes...
---
The support indeed deserve it, but devs probably only make what they are asked to make.
---
I recommend you point the jokes to Testers and Producers - they seems to be really messing up.
---
I use a keypad door and have the vendors behind that
---
"Starting December 12." - Its on the News. So tomorrow.
---
I don't know. Do you have a before and after comparison?
---
Bethesda, we understand. Just replace the 250DRWR with a new legendary effect. If you break the game this badly while trying to fix it, it's not worth it anymore.
---
&gt;I’m canceling 1 of 2 fo76 subscriptions as this is beyond unacceptable
---
I'm sorry, you lost me here XD
---
Might want to post your system
---
That happens to me every time I play NW before going into adventure.
---
In the end we are all God's testers, that's why the real world is such a mess, so many diseases and poverty....
---
Worst gameplay ever; the farm system went nuts.
---
Pissing hell. Thank you.
---
No problem!
---
Testers, you mean us? Because there is absolutely 0 chance they tested this hotfix a single time before they pushed the code live. 2 seconds to run the game woulda shown the reload bug.
---
I had a roommate like that. She left her tree up for three years. Well, 8 trees actually. One large, and 7 small trees, all over the house. She would light them all up when she had a bad night, or wanted to impress a new date.
---
Yeah sorry forgot it
---
I'll make a quick run on plants on a private world, shouldn't take alot of time. :)
---
I have only ever ran the Bravo silo, so for me that one would be easiest if no one minds. You should make a discord or messenger group to co-ordinate as the in game communications suck. Once we are at the silo it is pretty straight forward.
---
I am by no means OP but done it solo before, so should work quite well.
---
You'll be taking a ton of rad damage, so bring a PA. Hazmat suit gets you murdered by the bots.
---
Check toxic larrys meatn go under the dresser
---
As a dev, if I worked with something so broken that modifying an affix on weapon had repercussion on the whole set of equipment in the game, I would fully understand the memes about me.
---
Maybe a mutated Zetan....
---
Well, previously it was closed normally, you can see that in older f76 yt videos of ppl finding said vauly
---
Then you can visit the unmarked area yourself
---
You got a scorched that was tameable? Congrats! I’ve had a couple megasloths that weren’t scorched but they always ended up dying from environmental kills. I thought scorched were glitched and not able to be tamed. Glad that’s fixed. I’ll have to try again. I currently have  a Level 16 Diseased Yao Guia but I know his days are numbered.
---
Asking as a hobby developer how does it even get that convoluted? I have theorized prior the reload bug was variables dropping off the weapon during the reload script. So now I'd imagine my theory was wrong but how could it bork itself so bad?
---
I've made it to McLintock but no clue where to look here. A step by step guide would be great for us less intelligent players 😂
---
And you are incredibly stupid if you think a curse is a real world threat.
---
They probably tested, but did it poorly. VERY poorly.
---
I’ve done 5 dailies this morning and only the first has given me a reward and scrip. All the rest nothing.
---
How, you push code hit run login game, my game ALWAYS makes me reload the second I'm able to start moving doing just that my excavator bonus disappears in this patch. So you mean to tell me not a single tester wears power armor? Or not a single tester runs an unyielding build?
---
Repair kit being P2W ? cmon it's the least thing used in the whole game for sure, the queen give 3 each time working better than the "p2w" ones and quicjly stack to 100+
---
This was happening to shotguns before yesterday's patch
---
probably uses the phone to code rofl
---
In addition to the bounty, if it exceeds say 500 caps the criminal player should be fitted with a prisoner collar, that explodes within a certain time frame, unless they pay their bounty off by visiting a pre-determined location.  I get my inspiration from The Running Man movie.  
---
Don't be a Chico, don't lose your head.  
---
(Yes I know the collars in the movie are set off by crossing an armed perimeter and not on a time count, but the effect is the same.)
---
Would you understand if you only has access to past of the code, and the bug happens when your changes affect other parts of the code? Things you maybe had no idea to foresee..?
---
I'm not saying that happened like this, but this kind of.thing is note rare in large projects. This is why you must have a team dedicated to test all the shit alone and together.
---
No luck there yet have to hop servers
---
it's pretty dope i bought it with atoms long ago from challenges xd
---
small indie company...
---
oh wait, wrong game! nvm
---
We already got this last time,but i sincerely admire you for raiding when there are so many problems after last patch.
---
Well indeed if you only go melee there shouldn't be any problem.
---
The shotgun bug weird. I run an instigating explosive double barrel 25% less vats and it seemed 50/50 today if I would 1 hit the level 68 supers at west tek or if they would walk it off like I wasnt there and didnt just shoot them in the face.
---
# PC, Adventure mode, No 1st membership:
---
1. **\[New\]** The item list under *Favorites &gt; Change* no longer indicates legendary items, the star is missing:  [https://imgur.com/a/UKwBNpy](https://imgur.com/a/UKwBNpy) 
---
2. **\[P15+\]** The Daily: remove squatters at the *Glassed Caverns* has an unreachable scorched enemy. This is the place where you have to go up the stairs to the door that opens with the switch.  [https://imgur.com/a/4BYJlIA](https://imgur.com/a/4BYJlIA) 
---
3. **\[New\]** *Glassed Caverns* was filled with unresponsive scorched. They don't take damage and can be passed through. Also the Scorchbeast in the last cave didn't even show up. I haven't seen plasma/laser ashes but could be the result of it.  [https://imgur.com/a/8aGMFLS](https://imgur.com/a/8aGMFLS) 
---
4. **\[New\]** Reloading a gun disables the base +100 carryweight of my Excavator PA for a few seconds.
---
5. **\[New\]** Reloading a gun breaks the Furious effect sometimes, especially in the SBQ fight. Switching weapons/waiting a bit resolves the issue. Also based on the SBQ head damage numbers (32 -&gt; 19) I suspect both the Furious and the Prime effect broke on my .50 Cal. Crouch+reload doesn't seem to work reliably as I fight the SBQ crouched most of the time yet got the bug. I suspect the breakage is a lag effect, because I shot basic scorched a bit elsewhere, reloaded, and the furious effect kept working.
---
6. **\[Old\]** Crafting a *Healing Salve* counts as crafting a Stimpak for the daily challenge "Craft healing items".
---
7. **\[Bug?\]** *Event: Leader of the Pack* had only one pack of wolves and I didn't have to visit two other locations.
---
8. **\[Old\]** Many times fighting Scorchbeasts, I suspect 1/3 of my shots with the .50 Cal doesn't do actual damage despite the damage numbers showing up. The enemy health doesn't move a bit (not seeing that healback effect either). Could be latency related.
---
9. **\[Old\]** The loot popup window of the SBQ often doesn't put the legendary item first, especially if it is a Zealot's something. Then sometimes, while taking other items the list gets resorted.
---
10. **\[P15+\]** Legendary Scorchbeasts flee randomly. I'm in an open field, usually between Prime and Cranberry Glades, clearly aggro a Scorchbeast (red label), exchange shots, then it flies away, usually towards The Thorn region. Of course, once they get out of sight, they regen and forget the tagging.
---
11. **\[Old\]** Vending machines list items in every other vending machine.
---
# Quality of life
---
1. *Challenge: Level up while...* has become really tedious since after I reached lvl 300. Nearing lvl 400, it takes 3 hours (wait for respawn or other players to leave locations alone) and almost 3 rounds of Super Mutant locations cleared to level up (\~130 XP per SM on average, better density than any other mobs). Now we have the "Level up while wearing a mask (0/5)" week-long challenge that's really annoying. Instead, have a challenge about killing N high level (lvl &gt;= 50) enemies if one is above lvl 300.
---
2. Ability to mark ammo for search, similar to junk components.
---
3. Sort loot in the loot popup window with caps and marked components/ammo first.
---
4. Indicate a player vendor has plans I don't know in the popup card.
---
5. Indicate a player vendor has junk/ammo I have marked for search in the popup card.
---
6. Have the "Favorited" vendor tab list the marked for search items on the vendor side (or have a separate tab).
---
7. Announce robot vendors and the scrip machines have reset similar to how verdant seasons are announced.
---
8. Announce my vending machines or their power supply has been disabled/destroyed while I'm away.
---
9. Allow setting the vending price via keyboard (A/D) and allow chainging the price in 100 cap steps (W/S).
---
NW on PC has become dire. The 2xp and costume events can't come back fast enough in my opinion. More people at least means that the lobby doesn't close for lack of players anymore (if there is not enough people in any given lobby, the game just doesn't start and sends everyone back to the main menu) More players is good.
---
With a concurrent playerbase of 30 you basically know every single person. Where they spawn, how they play, how good they are and if they are cheaters or not. Problem is: if you know most players you also know who is the biggest threat to winning. So usually certain players just get nuked by default. They can be at the ass end of nowhere and the nuke will be right on their head with no regard to other more densly populated areas. Usually you would target areas where there are more players, so you could get more kills, I would assume. And it starts happening to me more often, the longer I play.
---
NW should go free to play in my opinion. It has been an addon (or tacked-on mode, if you are mean) to begin with. If the mode goes f2p it would do a host of good for the PC version (crossplay would be even better, but let's not dare hope) in terms of player population and simply gameplay enjoyment. Because let's be honest: starting with 21 players is no fun.
---
There is a big but(t) to my previous statement, though!
---
!ANTI CHEAT HAS TO COME FIRST!
---
Before anything else, we must get rid of the people flying through the air and shooting through walls and being invincible. So please: just put in some anti cheat. I'm sure there are perfectly fine out-of-the-box solutions you can add with very little impact to the rest of the gameplay. Or at the very least take our recorded videos seriously. There have been confirmed cheaters playing for months without repercussions.
---
Thanks and good night!
---
you can't xd even if you send a ticket they would prob give you the atoms worth of your items but they can't take stuff from you once you purchased
---
The way the thing is going there is a chance they didn't tested playing... maybe some kind of automated test (because there is tons of stuffs to test).
---
The rate of how things decay may not be a test case indeed...
---
And how did you know that the rate thing break was not messed up from the start? maybe it should endure 20% more and none noticed.
---
Except the 50 year old electrical box as regulations to allow any qualified sparks to understand what is going on and how to make changes so the next guy along knows what the fuck is up.
---
This happens in coding as well assuming people know how to use comments and doucment their work its actually easyer as you have a writen log of "hopefully"
---
Yeah, I took 2 months off so I missed it. Started Death Stranding so wanted to get this out of the way. 
---
Was very unimpressed about the acid from PA not working but what can you do?
---
Very true, no idea why I continue to play this piece of shit.
---
Yeah I am bloodied so I am f####d for now
---
😂😂
---
But apart from the freezing, crashes, broken armour, broken weapons, frozen mobs, trade glitch, emote wheel glitch and camp build issues it's still a great game right?
---
Ok, nevermind then. I guess I can just fire up the game on my phone and do research for your claims myself xP
---
/sarcasm off
---
Just saying it would be nice if you had a screenshot so others know what you are talking about
---
I like this idea.
---
Additional information, I use strangler heart and a ve Gatling plasma. But I started off doing it in t51 and a ve minigun
---
Careful with it to cause if you sprint towards the door after you fast travel before the camp fully loads the doors open.
---
You and everyone else. I make a good living over pricing that stuff. Could lead to great depression if we don't get a fix.
---
Does this effect the lever action rifle?
---
Makes more sense (pun intended cause it makes no sense) the way you're saying because if losing the full vanguard bonus resistances should've gone down exactly 175 but it was only around half that like maybe only 2 weren't working? Very weird indeed...
---
I was so ready to lash out at you for those **whales**! I'm not fat, I'm strong; heavy bones and all!  
---
But you did good.
---
I was not expecting Bethesda to add more stuff other than to atomic shop. Super excited
---
Holy, just bring in test servers already
---
yes I´m on PC
---
basically every match starts with the fire circle in 2nd stage so 50% of the map is restricted from start and 32 people spawning in half of the map is just a clusterfuck
---
To add to the problem, we still don't have solo queue.  
---
Being pitted against teams is hell twofold.  
---
First I have to battle and try to eliminate whole team in order to get more weapons/meds.  
---
And even if I win, the short map just ensures next team will put a bullet through my skull in 10-15 seconds after my last fight.
---
Hallo, schönen Gruß aus Deutschland.
---
 Die Höhen und die Tiefen, die ein jeder in diesem Spiel mitmacht sind doch genial, oder? Empathie und Bethesda sind völlig entgeisterte disparate Zustände.
---
A bug, of some kind but a bug none the less I'm sure. Maybe our first legendary player?!? Ahah, put it on the bug list for this patch. I'm not sure the "support" team's reddit names but someone should tag them here.
---
I just don't think there are enough people to have just solo players vs eachother. It would be a lot more hectic though!
---
Is it weird I find it attractive
---
Nice, hope it will be fixed in the future.
---
There'd probably be more, but a bunch of random dumb vault dwellers keep showing up naked and killing them off periodically, stripping any few of their hides and gutting them for gears while leaving the only egg to die from being n'egg'lected and alone. I wouldn't want to reproduce their either.
---
/s means sarcasm ..
---
Wow! What's the damn point of armor then? /headdesk
---
You notice the difference of 500 with heavy hitters. With the broken armor yesterday i went from 520 to 320 and saw a difference against the test yao guay next to my camp.
---
Yeah Deathclaws need wings and firebreath
---
Both the one with and the one without foundation are around 3\*3 foundations big and the budget it takes is also pretty small, compared to a normal house that size.
---
Placement can be wonky sometimes but generally its pretty easy.
---
Hmmm, must do more testing. Do you run maxed Blocker?
---
It changed last patch.  Players figured out they could jump thru it and out of the map.  So rather than fix the problem with collision, Bethesda removed the vault door.
---
Man my team and I could not get expert done on meltdown or washout. And they've all moved on now
---
The way this thing is going is: WE are the testers. They get to have us do the QC so they can collect their check and break something else for us next patch.
---
I'm sure they test the game, but finding bugs isn't an easy and deterministic task. It's easy to verify that the 250 DR bug is fixed. It's completely different beast to verify that nothing else got broken by the fix. We can say ex post facto that they should have expected this issue, but it's not possible. Hell, who would expect a bug that reloading cancels legendary effects? If you can't expect it, you can't test for it.  
---
Games are super-complex systems. Testing the WHOLE game for a patch is not feasible. They have probably some kind of checklists that they go through. There's probably "Verify that all Legendary effects still work" and "Verify that reloading of all weapons still works", but there's no entry for unexpected emergent bugs like this,
---
I used to work in QA before moving to development. And that was corporate software where the complexity isn't as big as in games. And even there critical bugs sometimes slipped through, because noone expected it.
---
Truth in both cases. They need to release certain things seperately so we have more options to chose from and they need to apply discount to bundles based on what we already own (kinda like what steam does with game bundles)
---
Though to be honest: I sometimes think they put these nice items they know everyone wants into bundles with other less than popular items (not always, though. In case of the green thumb bundle I actually enjoyed all parts of it)
---
you just lost the ones thinking of dunmer instead of an evil elf
---
Not as low as Legends though...
---
That’s not happening with Bethesda’s track record so far.
---
Ok I gotta ask. I've seen a few post that say "Smaller Maps". I player a few matches yesterday on both maps &amp; didn't notices a map size change. I might just not have realized it so I'm asking.
---
We being the testers is a joke, and a one I agree with xD.
---
... remember this is a joke because we are not getting paid for that.
---
I also obly had a fasntch mask on and it counted as 1. So i take it that it's OR not AND. You just need to have a mask on while levelling.  
---
To answer you,costumes don't specifically have costume in the name. Clown suit is a costume for example.
---
Love it. Some other person posted on reddit that they finished so I have some work to do and need to avoid spoilers. This is what I wish van Lowe was like.
---
I do, I do, it’s the best!
---
That's the real question. Why do you play?
---
Toggle the Private Server setting from Team Only to Friends
---
If your weapon is faved there's a confirm screen that defaults on "I don't want to drop it".
---
I get it's boring but I don't get how your situation happened
---
A lot of performance bugs came back too. The broke West Tek again  where you lurch through fast/slow. They fixed it 3 or 4 patches ago and brought it back with this abomination. Totally unacceptable.
---
I have a similar problem but with Zoe listening on chow line - ☹️
---
Oh and a king Angler. Actually maybe just a different special boss event for each fissure.
---
 Toggle the Private Server setting from Team Only to Friends
---
 Worked for me: Toggle the Private Server setting from Team Only to Friends
---
I've done that and my two other friends have also done that and it's still not working.
---
I was like, oh they fixed some game breaking bugs, I might come back and play the game but they pulled a Bethesda again. 
---
I think I’m done with this game.
---
&gt; with a friend
---
It seems like the acid cloud that thorn armor or vault 94 PA apply to enemies.
---
Strangely I got the first 3 star piece from queen in months 😂
---
This is lazy lol.
---
Public Realm Test! big oaf.
---
I am sure more hermits will join the mode to earn rewards or just shoot people. For the teams, since there some premades, perhaps they will be able to have a lobby for themselves.
---
Why do people continue to make these kinds of comments if they really don't care about this game?
---
Damn, didnt know about that, thought it would have something to do with a bit of extra story for the vault
---
My usual go to places:
---
* NAR repair yard
---
* Cranberry Glades and south of it
---
* Overgrown Sundew Grove
---
* Braxson's Quality Medical Supplies
---
* Rest stop between the Investigator's Cabin and Ripper Alley
---
* Crevasse Dam on Road 65 leading away
---

They should seriously roll it back to the previous patch right now. Screw the Christmas stuff. They blew it huge this time. Everything doesn't work like it should. They literally have an unplayable game right now.
---
Thanks mate🙏☺️
---
So instead of having the entire map, the zone is about 2 "zone closures" of the original circle. It also moves around the map to spice things up. It also depends on each map. Like, instead of having all of Mprgan Town, the are circle might now just focus into the city area for fighting.
---
Nothing that well thought out.  It was just gone.
---
Yeah it would be nice wouldnt it
---
Nerd rage and auto-stim ftw
---
The real question here. Does anyone knows?
---
Pretty sure the badge thing is just a visual glitch.  I noticed mine were gone 2 days ago and was kind of annoyed. The next time I logged on they were back.  If relaunching the game still shows zero then go to the vending machine and see what your balance says, I did not try that when it showed zero for me.
---
No problem 🤙🏼
---
I do not have problems so far
---
Where is blackwell's file I have searched the entire dmv
---
Don't start questioning lore friedly power armors. We'd loose X-01, possibly T60, definately Hellfire, realistically the riders of the apocalys, and most surely the Libery Prime "paint".
---
Do we want it? Should we have it? Does it make sense? These questions might not all have the same answer.
---
&gt;Bethesda is working on it.
---
😆Thanks for the laugh!
---
What system are you on? I'm on PC, logged in last night to test this and see how bad they screwed up. I've reloaded every weapon I own at this point to see if it would happen and have not been able to break my unyeilding effects.
---
K bye, please never type another word here again, even if you secretly log in tomorrow as soon as you wake up.
---
&gt;really, really wanted to
---
That is my case to, why would I ever need to look at all the keys and cards? They should be grouped somewhere that don't get in the way.
---
The test server is still undergoing extensive testing before it’s implemented :)
---
This is very true. I hoped that with private worlds and modding we would be able to create your own Fallout multiplayer experience. I would have liked to remove legendaries completely and modified the game completely to make it more immersive. I would have liked to be able to focus on the rolelpaying aspect instead of legendary grinding.
---
Are you serious? You lose armor effects when you reload🤣🤣🤣
---
Commenting for later.
---
curious about this as well
---
/shrug none of these things have affected me in this update. I use a vampiric ultracite laser gat and x-01 power armor. I have had only 1 minor issue with the stealthboy mod not working which was fixed by taking off the chest peice and putting it back.
---
been happening for a while, but always after a s/beast fight, when i've been dowsed in the acid attack.
---
I had the same problem, it's behind the desk in his office on the bookshelf, very hard to notice.  You have to go all the way upstairs and then go around the corner to the offices that have the people's names.  Blackwells' should stick out, it has writing on the door and nameplate.
---
Thanks I found the vault password and all the maps just need his file   the maps have the vault password on it
---
The halloween event had possible levels of grind and interesting rewards. I did it and got all rewards. This new christmas one? I'll get the presents and then it's just too much grind for too few things I actually want.
---
Me neither. Vanguard's broke primary effects tho. Bet some YouTube has it on front page need tho.
---
I use any 40+ lvl armor that fits my needs. The difference isn't that great to overcome the benefits of a good *** effect combo.
---
It does the same for me.
---
Top tier weapon: *Bloodied, Anti-armor, Junkies, Furious* (great for generic use)
---
Mid tier weapon: *Mutant slayer's, Ghoul slayer's, Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, Exterminator's, Executioner's, Vampire's, Quad, Instigating* (great for situational use like SBQ, West Tek &amp; Silos without compromise).
---
Bottom-tier: *Berzerker's, Mutant's, Medic's, Stalker's, Suppressor's, Assassin's, Two shot* (practically useless).
---
I tested over 30 3* most junkies but free furious and bloodied. Seems people don't tell the truth on the internet.
---
Don’t know why you are being downvoted for this. It’s a reasonable request.
---
FYI, the scorched with have Santa outfits on who drop presents.
---
It’s cause of the recent update they broke the skin there’s no fix... until the y send out a hot fix for everything
---
That only happens if you don’t have a full queue.
---
No. I only have blocker in the raid, shared by a teammate.it's a good perk indeed.
---
Called it.
---
Ah, I have been playing late at night with a queue around 25. Thats a way better touch instead of 20 min of silence with 19 people in a match
---
It's an ongoing issue that's been around for months. It affects players who don't play NW too. When it happened to me I emailed support and asked them for the missing atoms. They will probably say no at first, but just hassle them till they break and give up.
---
Really curious then
---
That’s why they did it. Faster matches if it’s a smaller group for whatever reason.
---
I suppose if it fails hard enough they will no longer have to support it. Kinda like that movie 'The Producers': they got us to back the game, they have our money, now the need us to piss off.
---
We were since the "B.E.T.A"
---
It adds a poison effect to weapons, and if you use heavy guns and certain other weapons it'll lag the game out for everyone around you. People knew this pretty quick so they intentionally do it to streamers and their communities at SBQ fights and such.
---
Dang, so just a skin? Oh well, thanks for responding!
---
And heh, hope its just a skin model change, don’t want another Imposter sheepsquatch assaultron head or alien probe fiasco!
---
I guess it's good I'm only level 50 and don't have any legendary armor to speak of.
---
Prolly kus the sarcasm
---
And prolly indirectly expecting me to boot up 76 on my phone to grab a screenie for him
---
I got one shot by a glowing death claw, that only appeared after I was dead.  lots of odd happenings post patch
---
Hey mate, check out my twitter for this. I compiled a thread moment for everyone to follow for this Pre-Wastelanders unmarked quest. My twitter is Ulysses\_Jack16. Hope this helps.
---
Damn that really blows
---
Get ready for a major headache, if that's the case.
---
During early game time near launch, they patched in a bug that caused you to go into negative weights. The only fix was basically to :
---
* Log in, with negative stats
---
* Unequip all gear
---
* Log out
---
* Log back in
---
* Put gear back on
---
* Continue game
---
and on the off hand you dc'd (which was basically every 15 minutes) with gear on, guess what process you had to repeat?
---
It then took them, IIRC, two weeks to fix that, and bethesda isn't really one that learns from past mistakes.
---
Community: This is the worst patch we have ever seen!
---
Bethesda: Hold my beer.
---
I just want to kill that mirelurk queen to finish my damn Atoms Challenge for the week, hard enough without those shreaking baestrds lopping at me like a karaoke sushi bar gone bad.
---
*pain train intensifies*
---
And the roach break your stealth lol
---
Who send all these babies to fight, waaaa
---
So is there an actual quest give for this
---
Yea the recent update broke ALOT like 90% of the Legendary effects are messed up from armor to power armor mods glitching and weapons breaking waaayyy faster than they should.
---
Food spoilage is randomly instant on fast traveling for me.  My camp objects break from full health much faster now.  Weapon duarbility is vadtly decreased for my nonenergy weapons.  My camp rocket turrets now kill each other in 1 rocket whereas before the patch, it took 3.  Green thumb still does not work all the time, for me its hit and miss even though it has not worked on some plants in particular spots since beta.  Goat legs, will also sometimes fail to prevent fall damage.
---
Man lucky for me I use a vamp laser gat, x-01 power armor and a build built around well roundedness and quality of life rather than cookie cutter min max damage builds. I can solo the queen I have decent damage and a super easy to play build. part of me feels really bad that so many people got screwed but a part of me also chuckles a bit because so many took their build right off of a guide and built around stupidly high damage numbers you  only really need at the queen fight. even then I can solo the queen with my build and most queen fights average around 5 minutes on public servers. all in all its in beths interest to fix this asap but its a teeny bit funny so many cookie cutters are raging right now.
---
on a brighter note the berzerkers builds seem to be on the uptick :) go zerks!!
---
Ofcours they dont. Why  do you think we exists/players/. This game is still in BETA and we are   QA testers that are not payed  , but actually we pay  for testing  .
---
Count yourself lucky the guy was too braindead to think about nuke mines, then he would have killed ya ,_,
---
Tbf this is why I feel like trading needs to be revamped so multiple players can see live updated stuff while accessing any vendor
---
No they promised before Voyager gets to another galaxy stop spreading disinformation
---
I mean I don't doubt Bethesdas ability to screw something up this bad, and I'm sure it's happening for some people.  I'm just wondering if it's just consoles or if you need some weird combination of perks for it to happen or something.  I was expecting it to be completely broken based on all the online comments and considered maybe it was time to move on to a different game.
---
Ended up playing for about an hour last night, completely normal experience. Only thing I did notice is that I can actually jump with a jetpack now, so that's pretty nice.
---
For PC all keys feel like a mess. It's only a few keys that's used. Yes I know it's been made to work on consols, but they should have made the interface separate and made a completely different system for PC.
---
The menues are are also a complete mess and hardly works at all on PC. If you try to use the mouse the selected row will sometimes suddenly change when you click to select. When a pop up appears as when you select amounts, what you are selling can change in the background without you noticing. If you try to use the arrows you have to move the mouse out of the way from where any choice may appear on the screen or the selected row might jump when you select.
---
Yes, there are a lot of things in Fallout 76 that doesn't really live up to a major studio game. The strange thing is that I'd say it's the story and feeling of Fallout that gets us playing the games and Bethesda focus on grinding where these faults get overwhelming.
---
Those are actually useful for making powerful mines, should check it out
---
Phone rings at desk of Bethesda support
---
“Hello is this Bethesda Support?”
---
“No this is Super Mutant”
---
None of them apparently use vanguard or weight reductions either, at least ammo wr because I have 3 but was suddenly over encumbered... still wondering about things like ap refresh and sneak...
---
That must be it. Last night was at the SBQ fight and all the enemies where glowing red and someone had strangler armor on. But how do I get rid of it?
---
Yep sure am...
---
Someone else posted the same and that’s when it started, after SBQ fight.
---
Bug it is. Game breaking??? Well some ass hats would call it that.. those that are playing a game breaking build we players has asked for a Nerf. Pve they wreck all fun.  Pvp.. well they try. Bloodied is game breaking for pve players..
---
I'm fairly practiced and even on the laggiest server can manage level 2 by myself and on even a  just decent server can easily do level 3 in the toxic sludge room(tonight i got my 6th or so formula P from a single single level 2 creature run with the "help" of only 1 other person). The other rooms are a lot harder, especially the venison one.
---
Same old copy paste reply. But ofc they can’t nut up and say “we fucked up big time.”
---
They are trying their best.
---
Man, did anything go right on this patch?
---
A patch related problem then haven’t been on since yesterday before the update hope there’s  going to be a fix for this
---
Yes! There should be some kind of world challenge that gives you a special thing/apparel/skin. It would be much cooler than just the ones we have with "Kill 1101 robots with a blunt melee weapon" and just get 80 atoms for it. 
---
There should be stuff like that that would be "Kill 760 cryptids" and you get a unique cryptid hunter apparel or "Kill the Scorchbeast Queen 76 times" and get some cool statue or whatever.
---
Where is this?
---
I deliberately make them spawn at Charleston by running from one end to the other and back again, causing them to all line up to be shot.
---
I did notice at Fort Defiance that when I first entered the building that all the ghouls on the ground floor had all congregated in the office to the left.
---
What a fright I got!! Then what a fright they got!
---
I remember going to the Charleston Harold HQ and picking up a package on the fourth floor, in the conference room. I knew it amounted to something! Good find by the way, I was wondering what the package was for.
---
Its every single armor prefix and power armor. Everything is effected. Any stat buff staticlly applied seems to reset on reload. It's super weird.
---
Try PlayStation community, or Reddit (here or the market). Hopefully you'll find some people.
---
Did they reduce the XP for placing also. My team was the last 2-3 teams, and I only got 400xp.
---
Also, this system is fucking stupid. If I'm playing squads and I run in to kill 3 of 4 remaining people, but then die and my teammates scoop the win, then I don't get it? What the fuck, what's even the point of playing squads, there's no goal to work as a team.
---
I hear all the guns are busted, or something. Not sure where I heard that.
---
Here's what went down in the patch planning meeting:

They also said cosmetic only microtransactions. They can and will change their mind, if they want to.
---

---
Yeah - any f&amp;\^king thing or just delete it.
---
I really want this. Since we can't make rooms smaller than one full foundation we need stuff to put in our large bathrooms.
---
Please watch the following video for an excellent and profound look into the marketing strategies used in the atom shop by Bethesda. It will help you to figure out when certain items will be available, and what they are really worth. It's a very well made video essay by Many A True Nerd.

Sure is,among a lot of other things gone whacky after the patch!
---
There are datamined stuff from a year ago that still haven't been released.
---
Lazy. But not wrong.
---
Yep all primary legendary armour effects break when I reload a gun. Private servers also broken games a joke right now.
---
while I disagree with the tone of this post I do think test servers would be an excellent Idea.
---
"16 times the detail"
---
Deathclaw Island is a no-go, I’m afraid. Protection of the area near the Vault covers that area, enough where it can’t be nuked... I think. 
---
I personally think the Mire or the southern end of the Divide would be a good spot - Strangler heart or Cult related event.
---
Generally when you make a post that heavily involves a particular image, people will ask for a screenshot.
---
Its something you should reasonable expect, even if you dont do it anyway.
---
Not forceful?
---
Well if you ever wanted to make an alt. Now is the time to do it I guess. You won't have to worry about your non legendary level 1 armor losing its legendary effects.

---
Lol all these people patting them selves on the back in agreement on how much joy they get from blocking people from using the vendor. If i can search 3 vendors while your afk on the 4th... you better believe I’m gonna bash you to get you to move on.
---
Take my upvote!
---
That's hilariously awful.
---
Maybe. I think any replacement would be ok.
---
Or you could just get off the vendor and let them take a look.
---
Holy fuck. I havent tested this but will be testing it in 2 hours or so. Can anyone confirm?? If bethesda doesnt fix this within 24 hours we should be given free days. That literally ruins the private server experience people pay for.
---
I would prefer it separately, this way I can take some time off NW in between challenges since I hate NW
---
I get that every time I eat Cajun Rice and Beans.
---
And in the game, too.
---
no they dont, and that question has been part off discutions for months now.
---
I knew the dark one existed and saw this on offer (the bundle) and checked the camp section to see if it was offered as just the dark floor cannot justify it only did it once for the Free States bundle learned my lesson i'll wait like i have for the Vault Tec silent generator
---
I'm using 5 chameleon pieces and it appears to still be working. Reloaded several times, came close to some Muties and they couldn't see me any worse than usually?
---
That is why you plan the release checklist with 10% of time for destructive/exploratory testing. Where testers are asked to play the game and just be creative. 
---
If you don't plan that, you are doing live-releases wrong. 
---
Also, you hire good testers that can be a bit more experienced and catch those issues while testing certain TC. If you use testers for  Y/N Test Case (binary) and not automated testing, then you should require they will halo-test the fix. Otherwise, why even put a human on it instead of using tools?
---
When I saw what was happening after the 3rd map change I got pissed. I thought it was a game glitch, but now know it isn't. this is a deliberate act to make the game faster for them so it finishes sooner and we lose because we cant explore and find decent stuff fast enough to beat the rivals. We losing points and xp because of this.
---
\^This
---
Yeah. Since day one. But without the cushy comfort and distractions of duplication glitches. I could careless about the bugs and glitches last year because I wanted to grind out 1k caps for a BE lever action.
---
No game then huh? Sad you had so many ideas.
---
Yeah, small indy company, just starting to make it out in the world. Don't be so hard on them, they are still learning.
---
Right we all know the ones who play this are the mega fans and the rare new person who will play to lvl 3 then quit.
---
No... I asked why people seem to be content with continuing to support a very broken game.
---
especially when they are thrown into the fire and not only having to learn how to use the creation engine but also convert a single-player engine into multiplayer. it aint as easy as hitting a checkbox to enable multiplayer
---
I think you can gain a lot of damage reduction via Blocker, Dodgy and Emergeny Protocols, thus Lock and Load Rank 3 is really worth it instead of Bullet Shield. Especially if you roam with LMG. Im mostly using .50cal, but the reload speed reduction from Lock and Load, Speed Demon, and from the weapon 3rd effect, keeps the dps high as possible.
---
Dumb question but does improvements to hipfire tighten the crosshairs?
---
Just move on to a better game
---
Just imagine wastelanders
---
Why do ppl play n64 games?
---
The only thing they care about, gotta make sure the cash shop is good to go.
---
Oh come on, lay off the Bethesda developers!
---
Stop complaining so much; they’re both doing their best!
---
They know their community just pays no matter what. Who cares if the patches break, the game has been broken and you still pay 100 dollars a year
---
because they're good games that aren't horrendously bugged.
---
These guys cant even get patches right lol I cant wait to see this update
---
Lol ok
---
hey, you asked. You got your answer. Still haven't answered my question, though.
---
A friend has said 2 me the private servers have been made properly private where you have to be invited is that true ?
---
Only when not aiming.
---
Did 3 public events for the mask+costume challenge yesterday and they counted, things like daily quests don't count though - are you sure you did not mix them up?
---
I'd say grind early on those first 4 days so when the armor drops on the 5th day you'll be ready to go. Again, at least they're giving us 3 weeks total.
---
No man sky crew has 20 employees. All of them are focused on no man sky. 
---
Bethesda has 1000 employees. Only 10 of them are busy with Fallout 76.
---
which is even sadder...
---
One of my turrets went rogue, as well. I stored it and re-placed it to fix the problem. This was before the latest patch.
---
We’ll see snow in our virtual applachia once the hell that is nuclear winter freezes over. I am hoping the map size update splits the NW community to shards and returns the game to its roots.
---
Yes these are the Christmas challenge rewards for NW. They begin next Tuesday. A new one becomes available each day until all are available then you have until January 6th to get them.
---
This is what happens when people fall for overmonetization. Lmao

Top banana nice one dude! Looks like I’ll have to do some grinding on NW!
---
Hater bukake incoming. But quests seem more stable on private servers. Markers update right away and doors and “activating” thins have little to no lag.
---
No idea, this is beyond me. I've been wondering since one of the first patches, and it's practically impossible to know since they do shadow modifs without telling. For all we know the current issue with durability could be a shadow nerf as much as caused by the reload patch.
---
Yeah, if my code modify your code, it's a smell. I should be aware of it and check it before calling the feature "done".
---
Nice, can’t wait to put it up 😂
---
to be fair, pete hines said that, and he's the human equivelant of finding half a worm after you bite into an apple. i wouldn't even trust that dude with half a worm.

No. Wansnt it specifically made 200 odd years from now anyway?
---
There are plenty of dead raiders, responders, order of mysteries etc.
---
I've been trying to theorize it myself. Just morbid curiosity I guess. I also havent been able to reproduce the durability issue. I went through west tek with my trusty explosive double barrel, it didnt give me any problems.

So not broken beyond usable just broken a bit. Your friend can join still?

I DO wanna play the game though, that's the thing. I love Fallout, played every single one for hundreds of hours but a lot of things in this one don't feel great at all. I simply wanna finish the story, that's all, it's really quite simple. Also, please don't tell me what it will or will not do for me because I can tell you your completely wrong. I want to complete the story so I can at least feel like I didn't waste my 60 dollars, first off. Second off, I don't like the idea of having to grind at all before the story. That's what "endgame" is for, hence the definition of the word. Simple. If you don't like what I've got to say, move on. You're clearly a seasoned Fallout 76 player so why would it bother you if they changed the game a little so it's not so repetitive and grindy all to complete the story that paying for a 60 dollar game, SHOULD get you with minimal frustration and time?
---
They have aimbots and people flying across the sky. Basically some of them you die just when you get in a certain range of them. It’s crazy.  You can tell when a game starts and 5 people just instantly die
---
Ah, now I understand your point. Thats is true, you would be unable to plant all the ingredients at your CAMP.
---
That said, some (one?) can be. But if you CAMP in the right spot, it should be too difficult to farm them in teh wild.
---
I can farm enough to make 10 from within 100-150 meters from my CAMP
---
Your speaking the language of the gods🤔
---
Why spend money on testers when they can get free testing done by their playerbase?
---
Jeez it’s people like you that makes Bethesda “fix” not transferring to corpses instead of the big ticket items. 
---
Corpses are horrible ways to transfer items even if they’re static. But someone that lazy wouldn’t have the patience to understand the game and thus shitty patches are pitched forward to appease the children that play a m rated game.
---
Yeah he came in but didn’t stay after his power armour exploded which was totally understandable 🤦‍♀️ poor guy didn’t no what was going on
---
Let them fix their mistakes first. We don’t want buggy outfits now do we?
---
B.E.T.A was more stable and smooth running than this!
---
Unless the check is for Endurance to make love to your new Ghoul friend all night.
---
One step forward, more than the total steps you've taken so far back.
---
Lol someone ACTUALLY bought that??
---
Well not for Bethesda, modders would have either fixed it or built a workaround that does the same thing!
---
Oof. Well at least hes able to join. That would have ruined the entirety of why I've got fallout first. I'd report the issue to Bethesda though.
---
I think it's a lot of armors, my sentinels assassins wasnt working either.
---
So are these bugs only happening if you are actively using a weapon with the +250 tag?  I assume that is correct, but I’m just confirming.
---
When entering an area, the mobs sometimes die on their own after only a few minutes, before you can find them/ get to them. 
---
I'll be in the middle of a fight, going through a building and hear another mob die. Which sucks because you haven't touched them, so no loot/XP
---
I've had this bug for multiple patches, wondering if anyone else ever has had it too?
---
why would they make a tab just to have one item per week there
---
*laughs through Power Armor speakers*
---
Slocums joe right next to the vault there are 3 firecaps that spawn in the area between the forks in the road going away from the restaurant towards the supers camp. 
---
on a log across the road near the bus there is a log with 1 to 3 firecaps on it. 
---
across the river from the bus there is another log with 1 to 3 firecaps on it. 
---
then go to the supervisors camp at the covered bridge there are many bloodleaf follow the river towards flatwood picking those and before you get all the way into flatwood you will start finding snaptails as well pick all of those. 
---
at level 4 you can have access to green thumb perk which will double your yield on all of it. 
---
also chemist perk in intelligence works on desease cure, also super duper of course. 
---
takes about 10 to 20 minutes easily yeilds a minimum of 6 disease cures and potentially up to 20 or so depending on perks and spawn variables. 
---
thats just the small run i do periodically to stock up. i go quite awhile without needing them. 
---
just a side pro tip. radaway causes your immune deficiency to take a hit and catch more deseases, you can avoid the use radaways by using a perk called sunkissed in endurance, it will keep you rad free in the day time for most minor exposure. for emergencies you can use nuka grape to clear the rads at 0 cost to your immune system. 
---
you can get nuka grape at whitespring. second floor . look right go away from the black and green floor towards the room with green paint. past the green paint room theres a pink room. in the pink room there's a side alcove on the wall. go around that and you can buy one nuka grape at a time from the bar there from a miss handy. 
---
only other thing is i dont use desease cures anymore i buy anti biotics or find them using pharma farmer. but at any rate hope this helps time to go home.
---
Got some Dean Martin coming up and talking about the greatest feeling in  the world, love. "Ain't That A Kick in the Head." Sure is, Dino.
---
Free stuff? But is this information not published in the weekly review of fresh bugs?
---
Bethesda: Good job boys! We fixed the bug everyone requested to be fixed for over a  year!
---
Players: You broke armor effects now
---
Bethesda: Bugs barely been out so you got to just chill while we fix it.
---
Your code may modify other's data, not other's code.
---
Bad documented projects are bound to have data modified in wrong ways.
---
I got raw fertilizer :(
---
I played a lot last night and really didnt see any issues. Just dont use the types of armor that are effected. No issues with degradation for me. Its really not as bad as people are making it out to be. Just wait til a patch.
---
I'll confirm that on ps4.
---
They'll do that when walmart stops changing the store layouts. 
---
Point being, they want us to wander.....
---
Where do you pick up this quest
---
What does war and bug had in common...?
---
It never changes
---
Lol, maybe dont put the spoiler in the title!
---
I want that too but thats not what Bethesda wants, the reason to hide the free item on the last tab is to make you look at the other items.
---
I tried it on his it won’t let me stay boots me out so it is unusable for sure so Bethesda is going 2 be hearing from me
---
Sad that there was never a 100% affinity quest for that
---
I just wanted an excuse to be naked tbh
---
The fact people still have faith in the studio at this point blows my mind. How have they not jumped on this cheating stuff immediately...
---
Even the food build gets his 15 mins.
---
No they do not. That requires they pay someone and if you don't keep asking reasonable things from Bethesda they will make Fallout 76 turn into the next Elder Scrolls Legends.
---
Maybe if they try to break it on purpose they'll accidentally fix something
---
Yep. That's *why* there is free stuff in the shop to begin with
---
Are you sure you're using the same account as the one when you registered the game key?
---
Garr, and here I was getting my hopes up, but I just checked and no, no Mr Fuzzy tokens.
---
I finished the event, and it did the ringing noise acknowledging all the challenge was done.  The event went away from my menu, and then ... nothing.
---
I even fast travelled back to the park, then to a public event and back, trying to jar it into something.  The event just stayed completed in the events menu, and no rewards.
---
I just tried it again on a few alt characters (I have a total of 4 chars).  I noticed another bug -- the scrip collection summary in stat seems to be recalling the prior character (I don't know if this is new or not), so I couldn't tell if my scrip was updating or not.
---
My results, even after relogging to verify it wasn't just tallying something wrong:
---
Char-1: No Mr Fuzzy reward - Dec 10th @ night
---
Char-2 No Mr Fuzzy - Dec 11th @ morn
---
Char-3 - Maybe (my bad to not check) Dec 11th @ morn
---
Char-4 - Received Reward - Dec 11th @ morn (note: on this char I made it /through/ the tires on two of the three times, but did hit the tire five times, and received 3 tokens like usual).
---
My third, I could have, but it could have also been I didn't stash the 3 from yesterday (I didn't check if I had some first, I only checked scrip, and I was super confused to see the total go from 45 to 315)!
---
I had this thing scheduled out, I'm like 5 day's away from getting the Mr Fuzzy outfit, assuming everything worked, it was going to be great.  Now, who knows... (sigh).
---
Someday.. just someday, they will figure out that they have competitors who can run circles around them.
---
this is true as well.
---
Part of the new Reload Bug in the game. Reloaded a gun? All your armor starts breaking mechanic wise.
---
100%, I only got the launcher to play this, so I only have 1 account.
---
Yeah it’s same wif me am a bloodied build
---
So unyielding and bolstering are the ones I use what a mess the worst update yet
---
Grafton, Pawn Shop near the church...
---
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.
---
whenever someone does that to me, i usually just start moaning daddy over the voicechat, that's sofar served me quite well as a demotivator sofar, it usually makes a bad situation into quite a fun one :)
---
Why get annoyed when you can laugh at it instead?
---
That's the 1 with the tree leaning against it right ?
---
Radroaches actually carry blood worms, which increase the damage taken by 25%. Not ideal before fighting a large mob of level 68 super mutants.
---
Have you contacted Bethesda Customer Service?
---
I have, no response yet.
---
I was thinking the same thing this morning.
---
Maybe it's a sign you should pass 😂 the game is in a really bad state right now after the last patch. But really, I'd try redeeming the key again, if nothing works out just contact support and give them all this info, they'll probably make it right for you.
---
They would be the ones who can help unfortunately, just gotta wait
---
You're asking a lot for a marketing team and not many would do that.
---
Zenimax Media which owns (is the parent company of) Bethesda Game Studios, is publicly traded. It has stocks. It has shareholders. Bethesda answers to Zenimax Media and they want money. All of these fuck ups and lack of care are because Zenimax has forced them to operate this way. 
---
https://youtu.be/qJt_i2_vsSw
---
Does this have anything to do with the thing I found in a particular homestead?
---
Yeah I tried redeeming it again, says code is invalid...
---
I have contacted support, just waiting for an answer now.
---
Great pic... But I wonder why it's been down-voted on Imgur? 🤔
---
The perks should do just fine then lol.
---
&gt;At least we don't pay to be the testers, right?
---
I don't know about you, but I bought my copy of Fallout 76.
---
Aww man.. nope.  I'm on xbox..
---
No wonder.
---
To find the shills.
---
Hey, I got one!
---
I posted in another subreddit and didn't get a response.  Does anyone else notice that after you reload the legendary weapon damage goes down? I was doing a SBQ event and my damage went from 31 to 21 after a reload. I use a primed aa ffr rw gatling plasma.
---
Ooooof. This is gonna be fun. What system?
---
Prediction - all NPCs can be killed (but respawn), making headshotting an NPC the hot new way to fried people. Bethesda's reaction will be to suggest someone buy Fallout 1st if they don't like it.
---
Resources
---
Crafting for a badge, or just need a few?
---
If the latter, there's usually several disease cures in the first aid boxes in hangars around Morgantown airport.
---
Carrying too many weapons to favorite them all
---
I think it is likely properly fixed in the Wastelanders version of the game, it just happens that the code was copied and pasted to the "legacy" version without sufficient testing, there have been changes that made the two code bases too different and incompatible, and chances are only a few interns have been working on the recent patches, everyone else is on the 2020 update.
---
In my opinion, it could have been best to simply make the "+250 damage resistance while reloading" effect legacy until Wastelanders. Quick untested changes in response to complaining can sometimes do more harm than good.
---
And accidentally buy shit we didn't mean to or want to. I accidentally bought the blue wallpaper because it was right next to the free blue wallpaper. I thought it was the free one and didn't even think twice about it.
---
Tbh never wanted to get a handjob from strong anyway
---
Oh wait, I play Fallout 76 on Xbox One. I tried looking up your gamertag and it wasn't there. So. Good luck to ya'.
---
oh my the power of a hangover thank you!
---
:) been there
---
dontknowifshill.gif
---
Wifi or hardwired?
---
Make atomic shop accessible if we don’t have ps plus too!
---
I have this same exact weapon - quad w/explosive effect but with fletchettes mod as well.  I don’t use it often but will need to test it out.
---
This is why I'm both hording Grape Mentats (and whichever is for Perception), got a set of Unyielding armor just for the boosts, AND I'll be taking a character or two that I don't really care about having a 'correct' story on so I don't get caught out at any point on my 'true' run.
---
One almost feels the impulse to laugh, if it weren't so sad. A billionaire company trying to fix a minor bug, and fucking up the entire game in the process.
---
Considering end game content for most people has been trying to gather their ideal set of equipment with just the right effects they were looking for, having none of that gear work correctly anymore is kind of an issue.  People are reporting this effecting weapons as well.  It's not game breaking in the literal sense but neither is bloodied being OP.  The bug makes all the time spent gathering that stuff wasted time until it gets fixed, which is frustrating to most people.
---
If it had happened to me, which it didn't, my choices would be to be constantly over encumbered, change out my perk cards from the build I want, quickly dump or sell a crap ton of ammo, or just play another game where the studio doesn't hand update duties and qa testing to interns apparently. 
---
 The game engine is a buggy mess I'm sure but if I rolled out buggy ass programming updates at my job with the consistency of this team, I wouldn't have my job anymore at this point.
---
Hardwired, 
---
Dauntless, division 2 and ESO all run well just. fo76 takes a performance dump when I play
---
My stats are screwed up i have negative stats but no effects on them just negative in the special list for no reason
---
In my experience, everything fo76 is downvoted there, at least everything I posted.
---
Yes, the "careless copy-paste" approach can be seen in 76 quite often. Some loading screen information was just copied from Fallout 4 without bothering to check and correct for example. I hope you are right about Wastelanders.
---
I saw that this morning too.  Was playing for about an hour and in my PA I got 2 messages that I was overemcumbered yet was clearly not. 
---
The water and food bars for me have been glitched for a while it seems.  It’s ridiculous how quickly the health bar drains.  20 minutes?   Try like 10 for me.
---
I nuked nuked toxic valley for a short run from the silo and violet flux. 
---
Got a completely different mix of critters than WS and v9 - even had an assaultron :)
---
Since swarm of suitors happens in the valley, yea, a really annoyed Mireluck queen ?
---
PS4 and what’s even weird I tried is I was able 2 join nw which hasn’t been working in the uk as not enough people use it and I was able to load in on my main character 🤦‍♀️
---
This is their shitty marketing tactic
---
Make you pay for bundles where you own 90% of the shit in it at full price
---
If wastelanders is shit I'm uninstalling and moving on but getting my plat before doing so
---
more than 1 type of disease cure, trouble is, finding the recipies to make them.
---
easiest is  tree resin/black berries/bloodleave and firecracker. they are all fairly abundant, and you can plant black berries.
---
i have found only 2 locations for firecap, 1 mentioned elsewhere in this post, the other is a little hazy, but I think its up above the tnt domes. (might be snaptail only).
---
Why do people ask questions like this?
---
Why would it make an in-game mask worthless?
---
I feel like I constantly need them
---
They don't count towards Camp budget. But! If you are at max budget you will get the error message, it's a bug.
---
Their marketing is shit if it annoys more than it sells.
---
You are correct! It's a bug, items don't actually use Camp budget.
---
Whilst frustrating and I'm not excusing it, all AAA game developers with online games are like this. Look at Bioware or even Infinity Ward, the new COD had a bug where if you had an AK47 with an underbarrel grenade launcher you could go prone, fire, and crash the whole lobby lmao
---
It was only 300 atoms. I have to decide if it's worth it to submit a ticket for it. In the meantime, I'm using it because I bought it.
---
Once you can safely navigate around Whitesprings you can save alot on cures. There is a marble-gazebo-thingie with a well (Looks like one of those drinkingfountains) with sulfuric water. Cures all diseases fort free wich is why i popped my camp down near there.
---
you are kinda doing yourself a disservice by rushing through.  Bugs and quirks aside, there's lots of stuff to discover all over the map.
---
  I'm sure by now you've found frames and parts and pieces of PA  (BTW, you can mix and match types on the same frame)
---
  That aside, goto the mining headquarters by the war of the worlds looking towers.  Read the signs in the parking lot.  Starts the excavator PA quest.  
---
Yea, some people poo-poo excavator, but I lived in it from L45 to about 145.  It works.
---
"First they came for the legendary armor effects, but I did not speak out because I didn't use any legendary armor"
---
Kill a Mirelurk Queen with a Rolling Pin.
---
Kill a Scorchbeast with a Paddle Ball.
---
Land on a Radroach, Radrat or Tick while in Power Armor and fell for at least 2 seconds.
---
Kill a Fog Crawler while wearing a Power Armor Frame by running into them.
---
Kill Ragstag with radiation.
---
Kill a Deathclaw while guarding.
---
Travel 7600 meters underwater in Power Armor.
---
Hit a Vertibot with all mininukes with MIRV Fatman.
---
Kill a Sentrybot with only your fists (no equipped weapons, including throwing weapons).
---
Eat 1 of every edible creature.
---
Kill the Flatwoods Monster with an Alien Blaster.
---
I think it should be a collection of wacky challenges like this.
---
I used that nuke to grief more people (;
---
This may be a PC only issue, I'm on XB1 and haven't noticed any issues, my armor has been breaking more quickly since the November update, and seems to be still degrading at the same rate, I would have quickly noticed a loss of legendary effects, as I run 4 pieces of WWR, I haven't used my Harpoon since the update, but my handmade isn't degrading any faster than normal.
---
Wow this is helpful, thanks for the tip
---
Those are some evil suggestions haha
---
ghoul….. horse.....
---
MAKE IT HAPPEN BETHESDA PLEASE ! AND MAKE THEM TAMEABLE !
---
The increase would be 2x. u/TimeTwoStab and I are finalizing data on budget % for each and every camp item. The bulb boxes used to be 0.2% and are now 0.4%
---
When somebody does that to me, I get up to get a drink or take a pee or something. And take my sweet time doing it.
---
I hardly use them.
---
Getting a desease doesn’t seem to happen this frequent. And even if I do, the effects aren’t really that much of a trouble. After about 15 minutes they are gone anyway…
---
Faction PvP with workshops only, no camps
---
Yo Dawg. I heared you like hating commies so we put an AI in your AI so you can hate while you hate !
---
\*gets carried off and thrown of a cliff by a mog of Angry agressotrons for that bad pun\*
---
I REGRET NOOOOOTHIIIIIIIING !
---
If they do it right they can kick you out of the window and abort every transaction. that shit got bugfixed but its still gonna happen very rarely
---
It wasn't mentioned about the shadow prime armour none stop talking on a continuous overlapped loop

I’m on Xbox
---
Great post.  I agree with the other comments, but I wanted to thank you for explaining all of your choices in a well written manner.  I wish all of the build guides were this thorough.
---
I play on console hardwired and few problems with sudden lag in crowded areas. My game is overall laggy because I carry too much stuff
---
🤣🤣 just as bad-satellite! When I got the game day 1 it took a week to download lol. Got it bc I love Fallout- and I live in WV sooo I was beyond excited. Not so much now lol
---
&gt; f2p 
---
It will happen eventually, just not yet.
---
I don't get it either. My experience is very different. Lag is unusual and solved by hopping to another server.
---
I got 3 shots with mine with gunsmith lvl 2 equipped.
---
Reloading is breaking legendary effects.  New Bug.
---
The Excavator is only suposed to give 100 additional carryweight not 200. There was a bug  though that doubled the ammount after logging in until you left the PA. So ironically enough, this is a bug they DID fix.
---
You just outlined the next 11 daily 10 atom challenges.
---
Over the year its felt like it runs well than goes down hill.
---
It basically became unplayable when they released the vault raids and had the PA issues that's when I decided to take a break
---
Well... I mean, you're not wrong, but...
---
Almost all the interior walls are by default dirty and dingy.  Many of us have been clamoring for clean options since technically we (the Vault Dwellers) are the ones building from scratch.  Why would we build dirty and dingy things?  
---
Ultimately it comes down to preference in RP I suppose, and if you envision us salvaging and squatting existing buildings or using our camp devices to fabricate new buildings and furnishings from scratch.  I personally imagined the CAMP device as a sort of mini-GECK for fabrication, so I want a clean aesthetic.
---
The players of this game are, in large part, an antithesis of the Fallout community. Many of them hate the RPG aspects of the series and enjoybthe slow grindy nature of 76. For them, Fallout is a Wasteland Sims game and Bethesda caters to this crowd because they rake in the most money. These people are just interested in wacky cosplay and camp builds. They literally don't care the rest of the game exists. Many of them even don't play the PvE aspect, hence the extreme hatred on PvP.
---
They're CMs.  They are hired to talk to the public and do other PR related things.  They can't fix anything, and most likely know little more about coding or fixing bugs than anyone here.
---
Hell, getting people to submit tickets instead of (or at least in addition to) coming here to bitch about things is not only part of their job, it's the right thing to do.  Tickets are how they get traction to actually do things, and it's how they keep track of what problems are still out there that need to be addressed.
---
Some parts of the game are Microsoft paint level pixelated. Ever get too close to a bush? Not a smooth corner to be found
---
The toilet needs to be flushable, and your toon needs the ability to de-pant and sit on it.  
---
For extra points - add audible farts and splashing sounds after your character has been sitting on there for a few minutes.
---
Very convenient for getting rid of the likely rad worms after clearing the ghouls in the golf club and nearby buildings.
---
Maps are only smaller if you don’t have a full queue. My maps were all normal size last night.
---
Interesting, I'll have to do some testing when I get home.
---
I had to use 3 repair kits on my QE harpoon during one run in whitesprings Gunsmith was maxed out.
---
They always channelled slot of XCOMs Floaters for me (the originals)
---
Not realy though. Its the frickin chinks that dug in UNDER Mama Dolce that produces them and shoot em up through the smokestacks.
---
unfortunatly, you can take any away with you.
---
Not "dirty" as in _shit-stained and grotty_, just not bright pink &amp; pristine. 
---
If you like that kind of thing, that's fine, but I just don't really see it fitting in with the world. I'm asking for a duller, worn version of the wallpapers. If we can't get any glass windows you know that paper is getting scuffed within the first few days of being put up
---
If the Camp device is like a magical geck, I'd have thought we would get intact windows. Then maybe there's be a need for glass in bulk
---
oh the humanity!!! hahahaha, shame on “people like me” . glad you are there with your patiences and understanding, you sound like a good person :)
---
It is possible to find all the ingredients for the forest version of the cure in and around Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center, although the firecaps are frequently already picked by other people. If you explore along the river by Slocum's Joe, a decent number of firecaps can be found in that area.
---
I used to have a little garage that my vendors where in, and inside my house was a switch that when I pulled turned the vending machines off, and another that shut the garage door.
---
Nope, it was one of the public ones.
---
An interesting take. Many of the papers would fit The Sims franchise pretty well, and cost a similar amount of real money
---
ABSOLUTELY NOT. Those days are long gone.
---
Don't forget they announced the "Money 1st" subscription a few days before Outer Worls release.
---
We don't know it for sure yet but I heavily bet somebody at Beth Austin knows exactly what they're doing and who's offering them more money if they ruin and switch companies
---
Now this I want.
---
Yepp. I used about 5 or 6 in a nuke silo.
---
I have a question about the weapon damage perks in bloodied builds. Are they significant enough that you want to max out all three cards, or are they generally just "win more", considering the damage boosts you already get from the bloodied weapon + adrenal reaction + nerd rage, etc.?
---
Would it be fine to just take the first three points in each perk for a flat 30% and save some perk points?
---
Mine were as well which is why I didn't notice. I play in the afternoons so more people are on.
---
For 1-2 items / week? They have it's exclusive green marker and even main menu tells you if you got all current free items
---
If you’re still looking for someone to launch a Nuke with, I can help you out possibly. Assuming I didn’t get affected by the bugs the new update brought forth, we can certainly launch with no issues. 
---
TannerHiderKille on PS4 if you’re interested.
---
Guess which post is about to be deleted.
---
We’ve tested both settings, and it’s still proving inaccessible, unfortunately.
---
If the mods think it should be deleted, that's fine.
---
Criticizing Bethesda is a big no no here.
---
Inb4 [Removed] since the mods are Bethesda shills
---
I did for a while too, especially at lower level.   Now I generally just let them run their course, as their effects are minimal.  
---
Exception is the diseases that affect food/water consumption rate - I do keep a few cures on hand to take care of those.  Since I pass through or by morgantown semi-regularly, not much of a problem to pick up a few while 'm there.
---
How?  Plz see patch 16.
---
Test servers have already been confirmed to come in 2020.
---
Heeeey, quicker reload is a thing! Especially with heavy weaponry.
---
Although what's the bug? It's about all your equipment breaking thrice as fast?
---
Since BETA?? How often do you play? I've used XP boosters like sleeping, cranberry relish and communing with the Mothman to increase XP gains. I think I've been playing a couple of months and just passed lvl 80. You should hit the upcoming double XP weekend and lvl up quickly. :)
---
This game isn't like the other ones.  There is no fight at the dam, there is no water purifier, and there isn't even a stupid 4 way choice where every choice sucks(fallout 4).  I'm just saying trying to mainline this game doesn't work that way.  I have put in my hours on this game.  It is a journey not a race.  I hope  one of the good guys in this community shows you to the finish so you can have closure on your purchase.  But I really hope when your launching that nuke you make a friend.  Then you will reach endgame.  This game has so many problems to many to list, but it's got great players who make any grind hella fun.  I hope you have a great day man didn't mean to seem like to much of a assclown on my last post.
---
Not really true. You will get luck, strength, and other checks, not just charisma
---
No they do not
---
Depends.  I'm a melee build, so I get one disease or another rather regularly.
---
But like you, not much of an issues except the ones that increase food/water consumption, so I let most of them run their course.
---
Get over yourself
---
1. They are aware the game isn't perfect
---
2. They are probably sick of hearing all the consent whining
---
3. The game isn't as unplaying as people (Youtubers) make out
---
If you truely believe that/ hate the game that much why are you still here?
---
I'd rather have level 1 armor with the kegels dary perks I want than lvl 50 fully molded armor with no perks
---
True however I think with the way alot of current builds are setup people are likely to have less charisma than other stats which is why I pointed it out. Like one of my characters has max luck and strength but only a few points in Charisma.
---
I don't think Brick and Metal tilesets have broken windows?  I switched to almost exclusively those ages ago, because I didn't like the broken look of the other tilesets.
---
Who do you mean by "Bethesda"?
---
The bug was present for many months until the last patch. Reloading your 250 DRwR weapon it would break primary legendary effect on that weapon (for example bloodied would become just normal non-bloodied weapon) unless you reloaded it  while being crounched.
---
The last patch "fixed" it. And broke much more instead.
---
Yup called it. It's gone.
---
I've seen the "we've seen reports of this were looking into it" a couple times but I wish it was more like "holy shit we know what's going on and are fixing it right now"
---
Sadly we are a joke to them . A walking moneybag of a joke
---
Trying saying point 3 again with an Unyielding armor on and reloading your gun.
---
Lol called it it's deleted. They'll shill, and they'll downvote you for calling out their shilling. This place is a fucking cult lmao.
---
Hell...  how about an outhouse or a toilet where you sit down?
---
Wow you mean a non-stationary non-spawned enemy that you can randomly find and you want to kill and having to track while trying to get people together and shit? No way dude people want really easy and boring content don't you know.
---
I respect their decision.
---
Struggling with locating the maps based on the wiki, are they on a corpse, in a container any help greatly appreciated
---
Survival Mode returning would be a Christmas miracle haha
---
Lol, yes you did
---
Of course you do. It's either that or get downvoted and harassed and get banned possibly. They straight up deleted accounts of people who made posts criticizing them yesterday.
---
I guess I'll be going back to a stealth melee build
---
How do you get to the shop? I couldn't find the entrance.
---
Yeah, I know. They banned a friend of mine and then muted him so he couldn't explain himself. 
---
It is what it is.
---
Where is their computer?
---
You'll get more damage from running 3 sets of rank 2 commandos rather tha  2 sets of rank 3. 2 sets of ra k 3 = 40% more, 3 sets of rank 2= 45%
---
As long as they have enough people buying fallout 1st and atoms they will simply not give a shit.
---
When u spawn at the train station just head straight into Grafton along the Main Street. There is a tree that has fallen and is leaning against a building, that’s the pawn shop, has a brown door 😊
---
I don't even know why people follow this sub. I wish I could just open a sub where people fiscussed the real issues about the game without fear of being shilled by these people. A place for actual discussion instead of a place where you show off your $40 digital cosplay and your $45 dollhouse.
---
Once you can make antibiotics it gets better. Not only does it double+ the amount you have (using chemist and super duper), antibiotics also increase you disease resistance.
---
Bethesda Testing: compiles code, code runs. "Okay cool ready to push to the players"
---
well, yes. Thats why i suggested parking your camp there.
---
reminds me of when i accidentally bought a pack of flower photo frames when i was trying to save up atoms for some backpack. still stings.
---
You are welcome n.n
---
Ur very welcome 😊
---
Sorry you got smashed down by the bugs! This is awesome and the exact reason I hopped on this sub Reddit today so thank you very much for providing me the best news I’ll get today.
---
Not really, in my experience. I know ppl have been complaining a lot about problems with shotguns, but things changed yesterday. 
---
Before, my shotguns worked pretty reliably. Every once in a while something odd would happen, but they were still effective weapons. Yesterday, they became entirely ineffective. 
---
The scale of the problem changed... which is why I asked the question.
---
Does it show only 2 ranks of commando? It should have all three commando cards. Huh. Thats weird. But yes, if i were only running 2 cards with 3 ranks, id be better off running a rank 2 and a rank 1.
---
I got molotved at a vending machine last night playing so I ? and they &lt;3 and irl lol I didnt even take long either I knew what I wanted I was looking for speed demon. Also last night was garbage I play on PC and was server hopping couldn't get any good events except for uranium fever once also I did camp fire tales for the first time and I was expecting a death claw maybe a mirelurk or something but it was just damn blood bugs and a few radscorpions wtf?
---
Wow. That builds super outdated. Lmao. I should have checked that link before reposting.
---
Bethesda: AiNt ThAt TeStInG???
---
&gt;  your guns break 100% within 10 minutes of play.
---
Is this supposed to be only on certain guns?  Because I played for 3 hours last night and my primary weapon didn't break until almost the very end of that time.  If anything, I thought mine seemed a little more durable than it had in the past.
---
Ssshhh...quick, talk about how awesome the last patch was. And don't use armor, then. Just build camps and buy atom shop stuff.
---
Put one point in Pharma Farma under luck and just search every med and chem box you come across and you will have more than enough disease cures and antibiotics. I used to try making them, but it's way easier to just farm them and antibiotics are way more useful because they help prevent diseases as well.
---
I do have Escape Artist. 
---
But prior to yesterday, with my chameleon armor and mutation, if I crouched, I was fully invisible. 
---
Now when I crouch, I am invisible for a moment, and then can be seen again. 
---
My understanding is that Escape Artist only affects you when in combat, and makes your enemy “lose sight” of you. That doesn’t seem to be happening either.
---
How do you even play the game without ps plus?
---
Eh. I don’t agree. I know it’s fashionable to say so on this sub, but that hasn’t been my experience, generally speaking.
---
You don't have spare levels to use, I am 272 and have about 115 level up to adjust things with.
---
So... What is breaking now, instead of this 250 DR bad influence?
---
If they want to attract and retain players, they need to concentrate more on careful polishing -vs- gimmicks and bailing wire fixes.
---
Over the last year, I've watched my entire group (that I MET playing this game) slowly gravitate away to regularly play another game.  The biggest reasons aren't so much a lack of content or being bored - but because of unrelenting gameplay and stability issues.  As we all know, we can generally make our own fun and content in the absence of having anything really to quest-wise.  Running a queen at the end of the day was once a great way to burn off the stress of the day.
---
The problems with the game have gradually started to reach a point to where the frustration of trying to play the game overshadowed the fun we would have actually playing the game.
---
Some examples:
---
* Random loss of items from player inventory (some of them even being EQUIPPED during the time of loss)
---
* Loss of the entire contents of the stash on a character - with no help whatsoever from support
---
* Crashes to desktop intermittently during gameplay
---
* Locking up regularly during gameplay (West Tek front door anybody?)
---
* Unannounced nerfs, and changes that don't seem to make any sense, and make tedious tasks even more tedious and annoying
---
* Horrible frame rates during combat.. or at random times when nothing is going on
---
* Hits not registering on enemies or other players
---
* Taking several attempts in order to fast travel - sometimes having to sprint out of a location before it would allow it
---
* Absurd budgetary restrictions on camp items
---
* ...
---
Anyway, it saddens me that the game in this state.  The people I've met playing it are amazing, and we've made some fantastic memories while playing it.  After playing something else for awhile (Destiny 2), it makes me even more sad to know that it doesn't have to be this way.  It's indeed possible to have a polished, nearly bugless open-world game with fast and smooth combat, where restrictions put in place for performance reasons are non-intrusive and seamless.
---
Only the Santa Crash and Winter Icicle Lights will come from the event.
---
For those non-techies, the rest of this is TL;DR, just skip past this post :)
---
My guess is bad data architecture and a crappy OOP design (soo many problems with OOP).  But I don't know what language it's coded in, so I could be wrong on that.  If it's just basic C, then that too could be the problem, without a strong/experienced dev team.
---
Stateless and immutable data is always best. My guess is they pre-calculate some values, and do live calculation of other values, and then let other things directly affect item values without the re-calculating state.  When you have something lifting the hood and mucking with the nethers of a thing, you are just ripe for this sort of problem.
---
Ideally, they'd create an interface to it, and treat it like OOP was originally intended to be.  You "send a message" to the object saying, "Hey, take on / remove this effect" and the object does its own state management.  Instead, I'd guess they are doing it inverted, where a thing that can change something just goes and makes the changes directly.  Then you end up with what we have now.
---
Toilets on its way.
---
If only I had 1000 upvotes to give.  Test servers are long overdue.  I'm on ps4 and I don't care if they're pc only, just do it already!
---
I get the humor, but the more we complain in detail, the quicker they'll "try" to fix it.
---
Extremely frustrating.
---
I've thought about that.  I could see that getting... just into the wrong territory :)
---
Dude. Giant crab in a cement mixer or put a worlds largest (random item)road stop in. He’ll just reuse assets like usual. Easy enough to have phases where he tucks in and crab/mirelurk waves comes to help. A Couple things to do would be awesome.
---
Like an early access *indie* game.
---
I just earned two more Possum badges and can confirm this is just a visual glitch as others have said, I now have 20 badges, so it refreshes once a collection is added to.
---
It is a glitch, the sections showed again once they were added to.
---
I mean I play in Strangler PA in Shadow Prime skin with QE Harpoon - and all three are broken after last patch...
---
Confirmed, awarded a badge and they showed up again, cheers.
---
I'll sell my soul to Satan so I can play on a test server and help report these issues before they go public.
---
The Escape Artist perk makes you invisible for a second after you crounch, even if you don't have Chameleon armor or Chameleon mutation.
---
So this perk still works for you which is why you bevome invidible now for a second after you crounch.
---
After that one sevond, your invidibility was due to the armor or the mutation with weightless armor. And the armor is now broken with the last patch.
---
I'll just get the first 3-4 then.  I don't hate myself enough to grind out 14k xp for an outfit.
---
It would be nice if they rolled out changes to private or test servers first.
---
You asked for a challenge. :P
---
Appreciate it man. I hope at the end of the day bethesda will find a way to satisfy everyone. This  game have a lot of potential
---
I really hoped this game would be ready for release by now
---
It's okay, you will be a wonderful boyfriend one day
---
Is the game actually playable right now? I stopped playing weeks ago due to bugs making it impossible to play and I’ve been missing the game and wanted to play this weekend...is it worth it to play or is the game still unstable? I really miss this game and stopped playing because of bugs and was hoping to come back when the bugs were fixed but it seems like that won’t be anytime soon..
---
Possibly, but the entire point of running around with the health of a Make-A-Wish kid is that you are handing out absolutely stupid amounts of damage. If you're going to do less damage, then there are ways to accomplish that without being on the brink of death all the time.
---
You tested the level 10 to see if he would take your stuff? Er. Okay lol.
---
Oh! Right! Ok, I understand what you are saying now... so it’s like all my chameleon isn’t working, but EA is. 
---
Good catch!
---
The latest patch needs rolling back IMO.
---
Sadly I do. lol. I want that stupid outfit. Its gunna be a bullish*t grind with me dying a lot but I also kinda like the challenge of seeing if I can get it.
---
But maybe fix the queen first, twice today I tried joining scorched earth, twice it froze during the battle.
---
Perfectly fine outside scorched earth.
---
So that's 15% health increase.
---
I prefer weapon artisian because it doesn't use 3 points, you just swap it for a moment and double the durability. Weapon repair cost isn't a problem and I go to base pretty frequently, thats why I don't think its needed.
---
Action boy regenerates AP quicker, its ok to use it instead of increased health, it's either damage or defense you prioritize.
---
Psychobuff isn't totally useless here. The HP boost % is offset for a couple of minutes by chasing it with an X-Cell. Psychotats is still the better choice, but if you're out, that's an alternative.
---
Reloading your gun disables all effects on your armor. I wish I was making this up.
---
If you use legendary weapons or armor then no, it's not playable at the moment. If you are leveling up a character and have nothing on you, then it is just as playable as it ever was. Which isn't much.
---
Yea I was in their camp and I saw the things they had in their vendors was some really good shit so I figured it was a mule or alt and was just curious if they would take the shit I decided to drop for them out of curiosity and they didn't.
---
I just read another post that stated the game is in its worst state ever. From armor and legendary weapons basically being worthless and food and thirst being aggressive. I’m really disappointed..I’m hoping they get their shit together so Wastelanders isn’t a total crash..
---
stop playing this shitass game
---
A lot. After reloading your weapon unyielding and bolstering stops working for example. Also vanguards and chameleon. Many legendary effects on armor now stop working after you reload your weapon. You have to re-equip your armor now to make it work again.
---
like how i browse between all those chocolates and candies offers when im waiting in the line to pay for my groceries?
---
life is a lie then!
---
I know OOP and I wouldn't say theres many problems with a properly ran system. I got real in depth with a few other programmers theorizing what could cause the reload bug. In my head it boiled down to variables being dropped from the gun that disappear during the reload. . 
---
When the user clicks reload, the equipped weapon is checked for type, ammo vs max ammo, and its reload variables, special effects(250 dwr) then the reload executes, then remove the effects and you're done with that procedure. 
---
Somewhere in there they remove ALL Buffs now instead of the original just 250dwr they needed to. I'm just confused how the reload procedure can be so intensive they break everything with it.
---
Good to know!! Thank you!!
---
Happy to help. I freaked out first time it happened to me too!
---
The packet at the Monongah Police Station talks about a shootout at the Ultra-Luxe as officials tried to apprehend a suspected communist spy.
---
I'm not sure if this bug affects new players as bad. Most of the time they run around with stock armor and weapons.
---
While I agree it would be cool for those players that want immersion into the game and act like a shop owner..   But, imagine this...  Some "kid" (term used loosely for any a$$hat that cant act somewhat mature), just sitting at a camp and ringing that bell incessantly.  Until you are at the point of wanting to shoot them to get them to stop..  oh look.. a griefer...

People will persevere and will push through. If they dint, this game wouldve died in ita first few months.
---
THIS IS NOT BETHESDA MARYLAND THAT IS WORKING ON 76. TODD HOWARD ISNT WORKING 76!
---
Bethesda Austin is working on Fallout 76. This is the first game that they have released and they had to learn how to use the creation engine and convert it to multiplayer. Their team is a lot smaller than Todds Bethesda MD.
---
Pc community is literally the friendliest I’ve ever seen in any game since Warcraft 2 tcp/ip aol league.
---
I'm just like you. I stopped playing some time ago. 
---
I have very long Christmas holidays this year. Three weeks in place of one. I thought I will come back to the game. I wanted to buy Fallout First for one month. 
---
Unfortunately all those bugs reports pushed me away again. 
---
It is like Bethesda don't want us to play this game any more. 
---
Wastlanders is going to be the biggest disaster in gaming world in 2020. No doubt.
---
Oh my god I am genuinely sorry for you. That is if someone kicked your animal, sliced your tires, and egged your house on the day your spouse died.
---
Yea I don’t usually drop stuff for noobs anymore unless I see what they have on them first. For the exact reason you said. A lot are 2nd characters or mules. 
---
One thing I’ve noticed when real noobs have the mic on you can easily ask a few questions to see if they’re really new or not. I always ask about their build, or what weapons they’re looking for. Most noobs have no idea what they’re going for right off.
---
I am all for more varied events and ways to earn badges.  So sure.
---
I was going to post asking if the patch came yesterday afternoon. I played on PC last night for 2 hours and again this morning for 2 hours and no problems on my bloody unyielding commando.
---
They just don't have any glass in them at all. Probably due to the game limitations. If they put glass in it'd be a barrier to gunfire and stuff, so it would effectively be bulletproof. IDK.
---
I've noticed they don't really break though - I was doing the black powder challenge a few hours back, 3 times I got a message stating the my blunderbuss was broken and unequipped it, only to go into the pipboy and find it with plenty of cnd, reequipped it and went on shooting.
---
as someone mentioned yesterday, all the coders at BGS are probably off on xmas holiday, I'd be surprised if we see any kind of patch before january, but im keeping my fingers crossed.
---
Yeah it is inevitable. This game was somehow better in Beta...when this game kinda worked it was so fun with friends. Now it’s just like...I rather spend $60 on a new game than deal with the nonstop bugs.
---
I'm generally happy with most events but I just feel their needs to be more events around each if the Camps.
---
To be fair, the community of Fo76 is old, it's not fortnite or LoL level. (no kids allowed here ), that's why it's more mature and feels quite better than any f2p title that attracts kids.
---
True but it's the durability of them that is the issue. Veteran players know what supplies you need to repair and where most benches are. A new player? Just gonna struggle figuring out what's a mechanic and what's a bug.
---
Really?  Did you ever consider some players are bored and don’t want to build or pretty up camps or grind non stop so PvP is a good change of pace? 
---
I enjoy PvP but do it more or less to pass the time.  I don’t try to pick on lower level players nor do I typically steal their junk.
---
^(But no asking for more camp budget)
---
Played last night, killed a SBQ, farmed SBs, redecorated my camp. All of it worked fine and the reload bug never affected me even though I actively tried to cause it. I don't doubt it's broken for many, but it's not broken for everyone, and certainly not to the point that it's universally unplayable.
---
There are 3 (that I know of off the top of my head) near the Charleston Herald. If you fast travel there you should spawn on the hillside. To your right should be a bunch of houses with some muttfruit growing.  If you look around these houses there are firecaps as well, most of them just off the back porches if I recall correctly.
---
There is also 1 that spawns inside an overturned boat; if you fast travel to New Gad and start heading toward Lakeside Cabins, you should see it.
---
One more that I know of is at the Groves Family Cabin.  It spawns kind of close to the road.
---
Are you diseased and have poison aura mutation?
---
It might even be pretty cool to have faction bounties. Help the Raiders and Settlers will put bounties on your head and vice versa. Could even be used to encourage some minor pvp. Collect a bounty for the Raiders or something :p
---
I’m only level like 120 or so. Very regular guy no crazy skill builds or crazy good weapons. So every major bug has affected me as since my character wasn’t very powerful already, it just weakened to seem like a low level. It’s hard to explain. But it sucks so much.
---
Exactly. I bumped into a L9 at the whitesprings station sporting the long coat, fancy hat and some kind of suppressed handmade. This guy was a twink for sure.
---
I got to play for a few hours after the patch yesterday, but most of that time was spent building a Christmas themed camp. Lol. 
---
After my camp was done, all I had time for was to check Fort Defiance for some colored uniforms. (Didnt find any). But I did notice that my vats hit % numbers were very low. I didnt think much of it at the time, but after reading about all of these bugs, I assume my Unyielding armor wasn’t working right. 
---
I didnt get much playtime to notice these new bugs, but I believe they are there and sound pretty nasty. I read about a camp bug where someone packed up and moved camp, and all of their previous camp items disappeared and had to be built from scratch. I did not experience this while moving mine.  
---
I hope BGS can get the armor bug fixed before the Christmas/double xp weekend coming up. I want to hunt down some Scorched Santas! But I wont play if these bugs arent fixed. Id be too worried that these bugs will become permanent.
---
I must be mistaken. The durability of both legendary and stock weapons and armor is affected when reloading legendary and stock weapons?
---
Because everyone is skeptical.
---
Heck, *I'm* skeptical because we're about a half-hour from when patches are normally applied and we haven't heard anything from Bethesda since afternoon yesterday ("We're investigating").
---
No, movement speed is however.
---
They need to hire the fallout 4 creation club modders I’m sure they could do a much better with this game then what they have now
---
Just drop them in a suitcase at a train station. Someone will take them. They are too heavy to keep for selling imo
---
Even indie earlybacces stuff like Oxygen Not Included and Factorio are mich much higher quality than this game.
---
Since I'm a 'youngling', the most I happen to have on me and am able to drop for random low-levels I come across are things like stimpaks, Rad-Away or -X, purified water/Nukas and/or cooked food, etc. If you're genuinely upset by veteran players taking items you offer them, then I'd recommend doing similar. These are items that can be helpful for really new players and are universally useful but aren't hard to replenish, so you're not losing anything by giving them up for 'no reason'.
---
Im pretty sure that Wastelanders was supposed to be in the game from launch, but they decided to release early to start making money. So, I hope that after wastelanders, (and of course the wave of bug fixes for that update), then the BETA will finally be over.
---
My sentiments exactly. Been with the franchise since it’s inception, 76 since the first day of BETA. I saw the complaints that went up post update, but tried to see for myself. Absolutely unplayable as a level 200. This “fix one thing and break 3 or 4 other things when you do an update” shit is absolutely ridiculous! This is a premier 3 star developer, not some half assed indie app developer. Scammers put out better shit than this. Disgusted and dejected are understatements.
---
That’s probably a good shout tbh, if I wasn’t so poor!
---
okay, this is pretty fucked up. I need to check up my equipment.
---
I think your videos are the most informative of any I've ever seen. Thank you so very much. Please keep them coming. Blessings to you and yours.
---
I agree with you. I also wish you had the option on the barn/warehouse to have broken or fixed windows. The wooden windows aren’t broke, why are these?
---
I'm not using ay of them, have to check out vampire and some other effects i'm using. My build is crap, but i'm neither into PvP, nor into PvE.
---
Why would they be on holiday the 11th of December?
---
NW mode sucks
---
It’s stealth boy + Tesla FFR exploits x1000 oh boy!
---
My Vampire Explosive LMG cares. My Berserkers rifle cares.
---
It's actually a really good perk on the right build/weapons.
---
platform?
---
System?
---
I'll but your 25 if you but my 60+ and some of my (97)120% Ultracite Cores
---
good to know.....every day's a school day
---
Okay, and?  
---
As a customer I'm like 10000 times uninterested on how they cook their buisness.  
---
But I'm interested to beeing sold a working product.
---
Re: the nuke on a person's head, you can do that w/o cheats by (ironically) using the hacker perk on a terminal and revealing enemies.  However, what I think would be a good change is when you swap to your killer's POV, you should have the option of seeing what perk card layouts them AND their team has.  Would make it much easier to figure out who is using a maphack and who is using legit terminals in game.
---
Flatwoods also isn't loot balanced, which is compounded by the new shrunken circle even more...I swear half my matches yesterday were people with crossbows and skiswords trying to kill the 1 guy who found an orange crate lol
---
I think the threshold for the shrunken circle needs to be lowered.  Right now, a full map seems to take around a mid-30s population in game.  I think shrunken circle makes sense if there are 22 players or less (and remove the low lobby match cancelation for the smaller circle), but more than that and you really should do the full map.  The maps really aren't that large to begin with and it really guts most of the strategy.
---
I mean 'Bethesda' :)
---
Probably laying the groundwork for Wastelanders, both to create hype and breaking up some small pieces and rolling them out in previous patches to lower the weight of the big one.
---
Same here on PS4, unyielding using a bloodied LMG.  I know this affects some of my friends but still wondering why my build was spared from this bug.
---
Habe you tried lowering the price? I priced mine at around 15-50 caps apeice based on how full they were and they sold fast.
---
You're the only one annoyed lol
---
My main has an incredibly uncreative and functional camp, separate low profile modules for each function (Crafting, sleeping, all that good stuff) because I move it a lot, planning on making my alts big nice houses to compensate
---
Mileage may vary, I have had a total of 3 pvp encounter since launch. I've had people one shot legendaries, but more I find people tagging it and calling every one over. Haven't had any of the other experiences.
---
Those poor creation club devs only get a one off commission, all the sales are 100% Bethesda profit!
---
&gt; I complained pre-patch about a few guns and armor that break extremely  quickly even with extended life perks like gunsmith and white knight. 
---
I've not experienced Guns breaking any quicker but the Armour issue is a fix for a bug going the other way where for 4 or so weeks, armour WASN'T breaking.
---
And this is sad imo. It should be no excuse that they're all selling overpriced half-working products as a standard conduct.  
---
For years now the products quality of said AAA companies have been decreasing.
---
I saw some other ones too, like Santas legs sticking out of a brick wall as though he crashed through. Lol. Says to find plans to unlock. So most likely from the scorched santas starting dec 12.
---
Wooden windows just aren't there like with brick and metal, but at least you get shutters to keep the dust out
---
Hahahah, nice one.
---
I’m on PS4!
---
To honest I just logged in for the first time the other day in nearly six months to test my new graphics card and processor. I also often work 60 hour weeks, so I don't often have a lot of time to play, and will often just play Civilization.
---
I stopped playing because I had completed pretty much everything in the game except for the final mission to go into the missile silo. I play solo (all the hysteria online about this game deterred all my friends from playing it despite me telling them that I actually really enjoy it), and I didn't think I was strong enough to take on the silo alone.
---
I'm not really into grinding, and without any other quest  lines, I didn't have many other ways to get exp. I try and go to some of the timed events or blast zones, but by the time I get there, every single time there are a bunch of level 300 players who are one shotting all the enemies, so I don't get any exp or loot.
---
So really I've just been waiting until the big expansion comes out.
---
Hell, I don't think I have a  single good Legendary weapon. When the legendary vendor opened I excitedly traded in all my crappy legendary weapons and armor, and got another crappy Legendary item.
---
But you have a good idea. I'll try and play during the double exp weekend. Is that this week?
---
Test servers were already announced to come in 2020. But I doubt it will happen before Wastelanders, I expect that to launch similarly to major releases like a new game or expansion.
---
Are we to guess platform, price and GT? Or are you just bitching?
---
Doubt it
---
Bloodied stealth Unyielding builds are barely effected.......so 90% of players aren't really effected.
---
Great advice, trying it!
---
Extra good luck then!  Lol. We’ve all been there
---
If you go with legacy weapons (and you should) you are going to need Weapon Artisan 3 (every build should have this) and minimally Gunsmith 3. Otherwise you’re BE GP isn’t going to survive a SBQ fight. 
---
People have done the numbers on actual HP gains with Life Giver on a Bloodied build and it’s minimal.  See how many actual HP points you gain by adding the cards, and I think you’ll agree it isn’t worthwhile. 
---
Action Boy is offense and defense.  Remember that Dodgy uses 30 AP each time it’s triggered.  So you need the AP for it to reliably work. For a Power Armor build, you really need the extra AP too, because for whatever reason you spend more AP sprinting and whatnot.  So having more AP/regen is a big quality of life thing too.  I like to make speed runs through areas like Whitesprings where I want to sprint quite a lot between skirmish points, and AP is a big issue. I never have enough.
---
:( 
---
Sadly I think you are right.
---
They are mute.
---
They had a firebreather version this summer I bought.  It's more of a red and white color than what you are describing though.
---
Just bitching. You caught me.
---
why wouldn't they be, I doubt they follow the normal 9-5 day to day, 5 days a week routine, but hopefully im wrong
---
Players report multiple bugs now. 
---
Reloading ANY weapon now makes some of your armor pieces lose their legendary effects completely until you re-equip them.
---
 Also there are durability issues now - some weapons and armor break down and need repairing much quicker than earlier. 
---
Other players report their weapons to have become "immortal" - not breaking at all. 
---
The last patch seems to be a disaster. Just read the last day's posts here.
---
That's the Firefighter one, got that one. This one's different
---
So the Halloween version had its own music but the Xmas ones they decided to be lazy?
---
 A suppressed handmade at level 9 you say..  that's some Christmas magic right there.
---
Don’t waste atoms on useless shit then
---
Ahhhh.... the infamous FO76 hate bandwagon.
---
I had no issues. Read about them on here and went home preparing to go berserker for a little while. Played all night and my full set of unyielding acted normal.
---
Did you file a ticket for this and can you send me that ticket number so we can take a closer look at your character?

If I use the search feature typing in "icicle" i get 2 posts, maybe they contain the answer?
---
He’s not saying nuking one guy is a hack, he’s saying when a good player is in the lobby anyone who finds a nuke hits him with it for a better chance to win.
---
We're looking into these reports, can you file a ticket for me and let me know the ticket number?
---
Yeah..... all the new bugs are affecting my build, literally trying to find a new game to play.... to bad the choices suck atm....
---
It's very rare I come across a troll in adventure, almost everytime I do Uranium Fever everyone calls out the supervisor and lets everyone get a hit in
---
Haha, well, it's only a game after all; got enough stuff to do irl in this pre-christmas days... So I'll just have a pause and wait for a hotfix - not gonna be the only one, I believe.  
---
Still, sometimes I do wonder why even keep playing this game - it's definitely fun for me and folks from friendlist, can be gorgeous and exciting, but these horrible technical and monetization issues just keep testing our patience. Also I just bought a monthly F1st sub few days ago, so the joke's definitely on me. *\*sad trombone\**
---
You’re weak if you’re not already passed 100 robco research cards.
---
Get some caned meat stew from the event feed the people and sleep till your well rested. There are other food items that raise xp as well that combine for some decent xp gain
---
FWIW, the Batteries Included perk will reduce the weight of the ones you are carrying
---
Hahahahahha okay thanks, i am only fifteen though, monday sixteen, but great idea😂
---
Yeah you got the atoms so there no diff
---
*Root Beet.
---
nobody at bethesda plays it
---
Exactly.  The studio that currently holds this game hasn’t done really any other game besides DOOM. They basically gave a giant of a game to the new kid who just got hired and said “impress me” and tried to make a game that everyone loves but it’s just falling apart at the seems. Which sucks because I LOVE Fallout and especially had fun with this one while it worked. Bethesda needs to give this game to another Bethesda studio or hell. Give it to Obsidian
---
Havn't been able to play yet, but it probably won't bother me much either, as more often than not, I'm in PA.
---
You out of your mind. Most unyielding builds run wwr armor......second I reload I'm now over encumbered permanently.
---
It fires a cannon too! I went to someone's camp that had it, and it scared the shit out of me lol.
---
Well it's been already bought; nothing much to do but wait for hotfix.
---
Haven't been able to play yet, but it probably won't bother me much either, as more often than not, I'm in PA.
---
when you fired it, did it make the Mothman statue noise of fading out and coming back? idk if it was a bug on my end or not
---
So before the last patch you always reloaded them while crounched? Or reequipped after reloading?
---
Not when I've only been in the vendor for less than a minute. I've had people smacking me on many many occasions before the vendor's inventory loads in. So with that said, they could just you know, patiently wait their turn.
---
I'm not sure if they're supposed to play music or not. But BGS did say the Xmas event doesn't start until the 12th. That's when the gifts, events, and all the in-game stuff drops. So maybe tomorrow??
---
You sure he was lvl 9??
---
The lowest level handmade a player can use is 15 🤔
---
you can earn the vault raid power armor that the NW players cant ear ..
---
&gt; This game needs to be made Free to Play now
---
What would that change, exactly?  How is reducing the revenue they get going to help fix the problems?
---
It runs the 12th-16th
---

---
You basically have to take off and put back your armor for the effects to reapply. Also, even just aiming your weapon can cause the same issue, at least for me, anyways.
---
I don't know why. I carry a Bloodied Fixer and a railway rifle. What do people need more than 2 guns for?
---
I've got 2 builds...one wears a full set of Unyielding sneak and the other has a bunch of random Unyielding pieces. I honestly can't notice the difference between the two builds.
---
Also weapon weight shouldn't be effected. It is only the first prefix that you lose.
---
No doubt the bug was annoying last night but after trying my berserkers build I quickly went back to bloodied.
---
There a lots of ways to level up. But I would suggest doing the following first:
---
- Always sleep and get “well rested” to increase your xp bonus
---
- Always play an instrument to get “well tuned” for an AP bonus
---
- Gather cranberries (not diseased) and craft cranberry cobbler for a 5% XP bonus. 
---
After all this of an event pops up go there. Don’t worry about the level ranking or if you finish. You’ll still get a lot of XP. And now that it’s free to fast travel then it even better. 
---
If I want to level fast then I fast travel to White Springs Golf Club, choose a safe place to sniper post, anger the ghouls by blowing up the cars and then I pick them off one by one while crit spamming. Once you’re done with that you can make your way to the train station and take out the ghouls along the way. Since you’re sniper like me then choose a rooftop or high place to pick off the ghouls. 
---
Make your way past the residential area of White Springs and up the map to the train yard. You’ll pass super mutants and a random spawn just beyond the Muties.  Pick off enemies starting from the warehouse and jump on the trains to snipe enemies. At the end you should encounter a Sentry bot, 2x gutsies and 2x eyebots. 
---
That should end your run.   Your XP should be about half hopefully. It will be even better during double bonus. 
---
I hope this helps. If you’d like to roll with my community then come check out PKOA. We are here to help you and others in the wasteland. 
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I think it’s broken with 2*. I have it on 3* and it works fine. Had it on 1* for a while and worked with that one as well. Someone told me it doesn’t work with rank 2. I can’t say unequivocally that it’s true.
---
Jesus christ Beth, give us a patch test realm!
---
I guess sometimes I forget the benefits of having 2 accounts with 7 mules. 
---
Weapon weight armor shouldn't have been effected though. The only thing you lose is up to 75lbs of carry weight from strength.
---
On one of my toons 2 of the pieces I had were strangely not effected by the glitch, so I only lost 35lbs of carry weight.
---
"revamped"  You trust Bethesda to correctly implement multiple active transactions?  Of course you don't, that's been what they've got wrong multiple times, the source of all the duping since day one.
---
The next time you crouch-reload, could you test to see if simply aiming down the sights borks your armor? It seems to happen for me on Xbox, but I’d like to know if anyone else can confirm whether this is actually a thing.
---
The whole Zetan model is actually visible.
---
This was discovered by someone about a year ago.
---
Nothing besides “ we are investigating this issue at the time”
---
Wait... are you saying that you technically need 251 Xp to get the wrapped present? and 1001 to get the holiday tree? That's insane that's like 27000 total XP to get the fur jacket and jeans.
---
Well there is an animation for sitting down in pot-o- potties you can build  in camp.
---
You keep items refunded. 
---
Seems a little too good to be true, but honestly, everything I've had refunded for one reason or another never gets used, so it works out.
---
Wallpaper would still be used often enough for the endless variation from new designs, so not a bad accident to make.
---
Ticket takes 5 minutes, definitely worth your 3 dollar equivalent points back.
---
Wauw thanks for the detailed explanation!😂
---
But they have a acknowledged that this specifically is a thing?
---
They revamped some events so leader of the pack may just be the new style.
---
Sure thing. What platform are you on?
---
Xbox one
---
Hopefully so.
---
I submitted a ticket, but under "my support" i do not see any tickets, so cant give you a #, but my PSN: dj5150119.
---
All valid points I'm not mad I was just telling my experience is all. I'm totally ignorant to all this and I should use a mic but I play after my kids go to sleep and I barely have the volume on I dont want to be talking into a headset. It's more of a heads up post I'm not trying to offend anyone I'm still learning as I go and it's just a lesson I learned the hard way I guess lol.
---
According to what me &amp; some others found online. You have to get each reward in order &amp; once you get the XP for one then the XP starts for the next reward...It SUCKS!! Like I've said, gunna be a hell of a grind...which is why we now know they gave us 3 weeks to complete it...
---
This guy gets it.
---
Ouch.
---
I run vampire, so we shall see if it was affected. 
---
Last couple sessions, I've been tearing down/rebuilding my camp, and still have a way to go before it's finished - so maybe I'll get lucky and a fix will come out before I get back to full adventuring. :)
---
Cool!  My community is on all platforms and so you can run with them especially for Scorchbeast Queen during double XP weekend. Come visit on the PKOA subreddit. You’ll see me on there an I can introduce you.
---
This seems like the obvious choice for now until the full fix in wastelanders.  i really hope we dont have to deal with this new bug all the way through the holidays and new years.
---
Yeah I noticed sometimes if i reloaded and didnt shoot for like 15 20 seconds it wouldn't remove the effects. Then sometimes it would happen at random times so idk but I will test more when I get home from work.
---
I wouldn't replace it with anything else. 250dmg resistance on a vampire explosive LMG is absolute God roll status. High fire rate..... explosive doubles the healing affects......and the only time you're vulnerable is while you're reloading....but 250dmg resistance is the equivalent of a 50% reduction in damage.
---
I wouldn't want any other 3rd affect for a berserkers build either because 250drwr doesn't affect the prefix and it protects you when you're most vulnerable.
---
The answer to your question is if I were to start theorizing about different perks......I would go bloodied explosive 25% VATS reduced. But that would be pretty lame if there was only one build in the game.
---
Yeah, then they passed it along to the one monkey sitting behind a desk and computer smashing and jumping on the keyboard throwing poo
---
You’re not required to play NW? It’s extra fun for the people who like PvP, this same argument could be used on survival, and it was. The nuclear winter rewards are meant to show your dedication and effort, like the fuzzy outfit (another thing you can only get in PvE) to whatever. It’s not like you’re getting a suit of PA, it’s skins. I’m sure you can live without “bad hair day icon 2” or you’ll put in the time to get it.
---
I've tested this in pip-boy and damage seems to remain consistent after reloads, but not tested it with hit markers yet.  Might have to do that in case the pip boy lies.  Barely played since the update - used my bloodied melee to do daily atoms yesterday.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
There you go joined the protectors!
---
Oh, yes, i did. I hope Bethesda will fix it ASAP. I don't want them to become one level with Blizzard.
---
It is on Unyleding
---
It's not the reload that affects the durability, the durability of weapons and armor is flat out lower than before.
---
See, that is what I was talking about. 
---
It is just one of the side effects of a very very very small playerbase. If you play for a bit you start to know who the other players are. Now this doesn't have to be a bad thing, per se, there can be a lot of strategy involved if you have a plan an the right kind of playstyle. Good players are not immortal, after all. And there can be alot (!) of fun involved hunting down certain players.
---
BUT what it does is discourage new players from coming in and/or staying motivated to play. Because, let's be honest, NW isn't PUBG and the regular Fallout player isn't a FPS/Shooter player (actually I think there is very little overlap from people in the "rpg" world of games and the people in the "fps" world of games. Just a guess on my part, though!)
---
So what I am saying is: We need to have an increase of player numbers in NW or this, just like survival mode (ironically), will die out and get scrapped. Since I actually enjoy playing NW, I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN!
---
&lt;3
---
&gt;that looks rubbish compared to the Hellfire
---
you can put any skin on it. and its fucking legendery my dude wtf arem you on about....
---
Little side mission?
---
Evidence suggests otherwise.
---
I've got a vampire explosive LMG with 250drwr that's been sitting in my stash waiting for this bug to be fixed.
---
I might give it a run today. Who needs armor when you're immortal?
---
A lot of people have been asking me if there's a Mrs New Vegas, well of course there is! It's you.
---
Fat mans suck, it’s not that impressive. Come back when he can do it with a BE Gatling plasma.
---
Bloodied? It broke *all* legendary armor effects + weapon durability and a lot things more. Check the bugs list, bruh
---
I’m on about excluding a large portion of the players from certain rewards when there could be a fair way for PvE and PvP players to earn both or similar in their respective play modes
---
I ran with 4 unyielding and 1 chameleon all day yesterday and didn’t have any issues with my special or carry weight. Switched to my vanguard guy and his armor stats were all messed up. I played a good 5hrs with my bloody guy though no issues.
---
Go to pawn shop in grafton. No real direction but clues to unlock. New instanced building and a lot of stuff to find.
---
Grafton Pawn Shop. All I'll say.
---
The main door of the pawn shop?
---
Bloody hope so.
---
I expect nothing less than artillery box dupe swiftness.
---
I'd love to see both versions, clean and dirty.
---
Wow thanks not sure how I missed this
---
Darn it I ruined everything.
---
I was referring to bugs that affect the game in general. Like the fast travel bug so I would have to walk everywhere. Or getting disconnected from the server so I can't play at all.
---
Have they ever released a hotfix within a few days, unless ofc it was something regarding Atom Shop ?
---
You get to work for your free shit.
---
I have asked for a real deathclaw too many times. The type of demon that used to dismember me in Fallout 4.
---
They charged me AAA, that's for sure.
---
Fireproof 3, Dense Chest.  
---
Or Fireproof 3, Adamantium Skeleton 3.
---
the holloween ones start today, winter is 12/17 for a start date
---
+karma
---
Thanks for the support.
---
It seemed like a reasonable request at the time... But it looks like people dislike a snarky reply to a snarky comment even more than the snarky comment itself.
---
So the country has been nuked, it's everyone on their own
---
And everybody should just round being happy?
---
Yeah I dont think thats what would happen in a real case scenario, this player you met is probably a highly skilled RP'er
---
Ohhh gotcha
---
Oooo the people clamoring for the non-broken toilet and sink get their wish to have a pristine bathroom!
---
Problem is that Bethesda wants you to tab through the shop and see other items and potentially buy them. Other games have free tabs in their shops, so it's not like it's unheard of, but I don't see Bethesda doing it.
---
Plus, there's only one free item per week. So having a tab for one whole item, seems pointless.
---
That implies one single person existed there to test their patches ever. Press X to doubt.
---
try fallout.com next time, all the info is there
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights
---
You can’t but I’d still like to be able to get some of the free promotional items/ buying timed items when I’m between having a subscription.
---
My lever gun is a mess even with a long CND bar, it breaks constantly.  Of course everyone has just accepted that gatling guns break fast. Always been that way for me.
---
I am pretty sure the White Springs bots are no longer good for XP and loot, no?
---
Just Fireproof does that.  I swap that on and the only things I worry about are the melee adds and a little radiation.  I can dance with the SB all day without much worry at all.
---
What really sucks is your inability to spell “went”.
---
Imagine you buy a Ferrari. You pay for it, cash, a suitcase full of money. Then you find out the problems you were having are cause because this new model (Fallout 76 Spazzio) wasn't really made by Ferrari engineers, but a company located in Sudan, where some hardworking people are trying their best to put a car together with their limited resources. They work for Ferrari, but... 
---
You still want your Ferrari to work, don't you?
---
haven't tried mine yet, but that weapon use to be pretty solid in terms of CND.
---
That’s what I’ve been using my full health vanguard charcater it’s ok from what I can tell
---
Only in FO76 could trolling be defended as "roleplaying."  Dude likes to pick on low levels.
---
What I really want is an owned tab.
---
Real case scenario is out the window when you are playing with people dressed as clowns, turkeys or wearing hello kitty pink power armour whilst you hunt scorched inexplicably dressed as Santa.
---
The toilet has been datamined but the people will have to go without a nice bath for a while
---
It's a wasteland, not f'ing disneyworld
---
Im not saying i condone his actions, but kids needs to whine less and realize what the world has become.
---
Survival of the fittest
---
That would be too easy
---
I wouldn't have as much of a problem with shorter matches if I didn't have to wait 5 minutes to connect to a lobby, then another 2-3 minutes in the lobby. As it is, for every 10 minutes I spend trying to okay NW, I might be in game for 3 of it, and I don't suck at pvp.
---
It's about the worst gameplay time ratio of any pvp game. The effort to "get us into combat more quickly" just worsened the divide. Are there really only 30-something regular PC players on NW worldwide? I doubt it. There has gotta be a better  way to find servers.
---
Probably an alt, and probably not a handmade, don't think those start until 15.
---
  I always equip my alts with reward gear a low level is unlikely to have to discourage people from gifting me, I have already loaded my alt up pretty well to start.
---
No
---
Do not give player names.
---
Hah i guess thats true
---
But people complaining that some people arent being nice and helpful, just needs to take a chillpill, and realize that people play the game they want to play it
---
A bloated radiated ghoul behemoth would be superb. Give it a telephone pole, an aoe stagger stomp and have miniature irradiated ghouls spawn from its pustules.
---
he fired it and it didn't sound weird to me, sorry i didn't pay super close attention.
---
Tried it, was jus weird, have spots on edge i like to work my way in from. Just gotta work on the fly now.
---
But basicly, a change nobody asked for that nobody wanted.
---
Found it!
---
No.
---
I'll go ahead and list the bugs that I've been experiencing:
---
-Lagging/studdering player character movement.
---
-Enemies warping around, in and out of combat.
---
-Enemies randomly don't take damage.
---
-Enemies randomly damage me without doing their attack animation.
---
-Sound glitches, like my friend fires her gun and when she goes to reload, the sound of it firing doesn't stop, so I just hear shooting whenever I'm near her.
---
-Game studdering and lockups when I try to open the map or go to my Pip-Boy or use an item or open the favorite wheel.
---
-Quests disappearing from my quest log, they don't show up unless I reset the game. I also can't progress than until I reset the game.
---
-I kill an enemy and the corpse just has no loot at all.
---
-My friend removing quests from her active list, but they don't disappear from my screen. Or her adding quests to her active list and they don't show up on my screen.
---
-My little doggie bag not appearing after I die and respawn so I lose all my scrap (yea losing scrap isn't just a problem for 1st members. And this disappearing scrap bag bug has been a problem since launch by the way).
---
-Fast Travel just not working. It starts to count down and then stops and I can't fast travel.
---
-Quest markers being in the wrong location or just not appearing at all.
---
-I die and when I try to respawn, all the location markers have disappeared so I have to reset the game.
---
-Being on a crafting table and when I quit out of the crafting, it puts me right back in so I have to just keep trying to leave until it lets me.
---
-Getting disconnected from the server, this happens AT LEAST once per gameplay session.
---
I can go on, I definitely didn't mention everything, but all these things, I've encountered in just the past few days.
---
I'd love to see level 50 chainsaws. Give them a bonus stagger chance in pve so that they can be used to efficiently clean up ghouls, like they're meant to do.
---
Maybe the could have unique variants as a reward for certain events, like a Ghoul Slayers Chainsaw with 50 percent Limb damage.
---
You were higher lvl than me lol, I think anyway
---
I was thinking I will play naked and only use my fists to fight lol a new game mode! Remove all armor, aid and weapons. I'm going to try it out..
---
Even with rank 5 gunsmith the most I can squeeze out of it is 4 reloads between advanced repair kit.  I hope it gets fixed cause I just got that gun
---
My pipboy numbers remained constant as well. It was hit markers that seemed affected.
---
Karma whore
---
Really? Hot damn I’m in!
---
There's a difference between "playing the game how you want to play it" and "chain kill a low level player trying to get the slightest bit of stuff he truly needs to keep going on Fallout's adventure and also insulting him and calling him words on vocal"
---
The second one is being a total a-hole.
---
*finds out fists are broken too
---
Dang - so this bug could be even BIGGER - breaking weapon prefixes as well like I've seen reports of.
---
Shill.
---
Hmm I’ve had this too and assumed that’s what it was.
---
How do you see the Halloween I cant see them
---
Is it a guided quest for you guys? Because it’s not for me.
---
In some sense, at least the unequipped legendary effects can even be beneficial to new players - less competition from level 300+ bloodied builds one shotting everything at low level events. Although if item conditions do also degrade abnormally fast, that is not so good for anyone.
---
But marketing fails when I see the "Free" graphic, but don't even bother opening the atom shop, since I can't quickly filter to the free items.  Loss Leaders have to actually lead you into the store.
---
Were you in a pvp zone?
---
Na, none I can remember
---
Damage resistance does make a difference. I switched out a few pieces that lowered my dr and I was getting downed a lot faster. I'm not sure if it was a stealth nerf or just their great programming skills.
---
I've gotten the same impression. No one cares that the Chinese and Responders suddenly have power armour or what sense it makes. No one wants to build post-apocalyptic camps, they want brightly coloured barbie and ken playsets.
---
Well I agree with that, you didnt mention chain killing you in your OP, and i dont even know how that's possible to do, it shouldnt be anyways.
---
Yeah a workshop
---
They did not add the glowing skeleton back why didnt they
---
I knew that name sounded familiar, i watched a vid last night that popped up on youtube recommended, same player too, apparantly he's known for being toxic lol
---
[Same person](https://youtu.be/UrKmCrXUpAc)
---
Then there is a lesson to be learnt here.
---
we later find out red phantom is just 3 Zetans in a space suit
---
I am a below average player with whatever I picked up equipped. A 6 year old is probably better at the game than I am. I payed for about 4 minutes any noted stuff was, in two words, jacked up. 
---
Nothing seemed overly game breaking for me because I'm awful at the game, but when I can go, "Oh hell what is this nonsense?" you know something is very, very screwed up. 
---
The first clue was being told I was Overencumbered at random times without any change in gamestate.
---
Fallout 1st scrap box eating scrap was fixed within 36 hours iirc.
---
Bethesda blew up because of the popularity of Skyrim and have never quite caught up with themselves.
---
He's actually the person OP was referring to! Small world.
---
I hope so! I'm away on for business training for a few days and won't be back home to play until Thursday night.
---
I know what you mean but it wasn’t that. It’s gone now after about 3 hours so maybe just a glitch.
---
How does that change the issue exactly?
---
Icm not endgame yet (lv.50) but im pretty sure a Raid Claw's entire moveset is stronger than the raid Assaultron's Player removal laser
---
.... It took me a hot minute to get it. Nice one
---
Who do YOU mean by "Bethesda"?
---
Yeah 20 may have been generous, now that I think about it. 20 at most. 
---
I noticed after playing a bit more that the overencumbered issue was related to my PA as well, I thought it was freaking out when registering the weight increase with Excavator. Who knows.
---
Like someone else pointed out, there’s no way they let this go on during the free weekend, so chances are they’ll fix all this pretty quick. As sad as that is for us.
---
Can’t scroll left and right to see the different pictures? I’m on Xbox idk if it’s different
---
Its possible if OP was in a PvP zone . . .
---
Interesting... I didn't even bother trying to play because I assumed the bug was universal. I guess I should try before I hang it up waiting for a hotfix.
---
Just gathered about 50 cores over the weekend too. Need to get them sold, free up that space! Woop!!
---
Because Bethesda has settled on simultaneous releases while warframe does the opposite.
---
Warframe has their pc and console updates seperate because the process for updating consoles is far more complex. Every time you want to update a console game the patch has to go through Microsoft and Sony for certification which takes time and money. Warframe uses pc as a test and then after the bugs are ironed out bases the console builds on that since they can't even hotfix a console build without again going through cert.
---
Bethesda could likely patch the pc version as soon as today if they either fixed the bug or wanted to revert the build, but they can't because then console players would throw a fit because they would still be waiting for their patch to go cert before they got their fix.
---
Also atom shop bugs are ironed out quickly because those errors are entirely server side and don't require any updates at all.
---
It's funny that you put that much faith into Bethesda to fix things.
---
Yup! Get on it bud, I can help you out no problem. Have you found the Filthy sub?
---
If you get killed in a workshop just hit ignore and find a new server of you want to take a workshop. It sucks getting killed in them but that is the risk you agree upon.
---
It's an unmarked quest...
---
Well then it's all good
---
Well, I know Beth Austin is hiring, if you have the skills go apply! You could be the one! 🤠👍

Honestly, I really don't understand why casual players even bother with workshops anymore. They are there to give players looking for PvP a way to do it. The only two productive enough to bother with are Charleston Landfill and Hemlock Holes. The rest don't really give enough resources to be worth the expense of setting it up. 
---
Personally, if you take a workshop, I really don't have any sympathy for you if you get taken out, regardless of your level. It's just a part of the game, and there are ways to get what you want without them. In most cases farming is more productive anyway.
---
Maybe I'm reading your statement wrong but I play on PS4 &amp; can see everything in a bundle. If you click on the bundle it gives you a list of everything included &amp; if you scroll over while in the bundle menu it shows pictures of everything as well....
---
Let's be honest here - What probably happened is a coder was assigned to fix the 250 DR bug, wrote up his patch, went in long enough to see his test 'toon got the 250DR when reloading, and marked it done.
---
It seams the first players that caught the bug was because they were running unyielding or excavator armor and suddenly became over-encumbered when they reloaded. A test character with access to the developer rooms would most likely not be running with a full backpack since anything is instantly available to them anyway.
---
What they are really missing is a comprehensive testing - not something you will get from a few employees playing on the internal servers but more like 50 - 100 real-life characters actually playing the game to see how the thousands of combinations of armor / guns / perks / consumables may interact. It would obviously add a delay in patch releases but would avoid issues like this.
---
Where do you look at McClintock? Been through most buildings, and no package....
---
If they made an elf themed/colored chinese stealth suit named the stelf suit, pretty sure I'd click purchase faster than my controller could register.
---
Yeah, I was losing like 5 points of stat bonuses on my bloodied Unyielding guy max. I didn't heavily test it or anything but there was a big drop in resistances on my vanguard's guy, but not 175 as you said, it was about 100 less. And my other dudes Weightless armour seemed to work fine as chameleon mutation was working all night
---
And, moreover, they usually refund without asking if well explained.
---
Tbh i see alot less workshop claiming these days, especially now fo1st is available, i'll only ever see maybe 1-2 workshops claimed per week or so, and i server hop regularly.
---
He can't unless OP kept retaliating. It gives you the option to give up each time you die. That's like getting mauled by a bear, surviving, then going back to the same bear and slapping him on the ass. What did he think was going to happen?
---
As for fusion cores, just run events and check generators and such. I literally NEVER have to farm them at a workshop.
---
DLC New Vegas in mind.
---
More animations are most welcome. I'd also like some new standing idle and combat stance animations.
---
It's an intentional part of the game. There's nothing you can get from a workshop that can't also be gotten some other way.
---
Reminds me of my neighbors lol. Leave them up all year and turn them on through November-January
---
Permanently? If you need to run or fast travel just remove and reequip your armor and everything works until it bugs again. At least know how a bug works before you bitch about it.
---
They are also bigger than the standard ones, I've had to move them about a bit to fit them in!
---
Well, at least now we know it's Bethesda's pickle being referenced in their username...
---
Halloween ones start today, but not until 7pm est. Some real bullshit really.
---
I can see that. I'm sure with the shutdown of Survival mode that the handful of players affected by that are quick to attack a workshop. I'm a 1st player, and I almost want to go take workshops just as bait. My main is full meta, could be fun.
---
Okay cool. Did you get to the Clarksburg post office?
---
What are you talking about
---
You might pass that free wallpaper because of no filter but it's safe to say most people scroll through and get it.
---
&gt;Also. Funny how youre so against me here, but on the other threads where this stuff is being actively talked about, friendly as pie. Constructive as all get out. Lol. Im actually getting a good laugh out of it
---
YOU LITERALLY JUST MADE THIS SHIT UP. I have replied to no other posts on this topic. ONLY THIS ONE. Maybe you shouldn't post on reddit when you're too high to understand what you're reading.
---
The feels.
---
Something funky is afoot. Just scrapped (not stored) my water pump, in preparation for the new sink I just purchased. Not only was I unable to place the sink, I'm no longer able to place the pump that was just there moments ago.
---
Nothing else has been built, and I don't own the bulb letter set. If I may: u/Valseek u/LadyDevann Is this something you could look into?
---
Is it?
---
They sound salty
---
I already know that's all you have to do......but in still unwilling to play properly until they sort it out. All I've done today is get my 150 scrip and sign off. Not playing a game that's just been massively broken.......and I've been around since the beta before you call me a 76 hater.
---
You know, I just noticed that.
---
At least an owners tab -_-
---
Man I was afraid of that. Let's hope there is a fix by tomorrow. So far I haven't seen any update by Bethesda though.
---
Add the dense mod tho chest Armor for extra explosive resistance also if you like.
---
wrong sub.  lmao
---
I just sleep/play an instrument (do something "useful") or sit and wait.
---
noting stops pvp players from getting the pa and nothing spots the pve players from geting the skins.. what are you on about?
---
It really is.
---
I’m saying Bethesda should hire them as employees
---
SChweet, but I'm ooohh so jealous :)
---
  RNG Gods have not been quite that good to me.
---
I would like a Hellfire power armor, not a skin.
---
?
---
I've been saying for a while now that I think Bethesda is trying to set up justification to shut the game down in a year or so because it underperformed so badly sales-wise.  The over priced Atom Shop and the release of Fallout 1st without Wastelanders are them doing what they can to help recoup financial losses.  Once they get Wastelanders out and it turns out to be a trainwreck they'll probably put out the odd patch or hotfix here and there and use the few existing seasonal events they already have made before closing the game down just before the 2020 holiday season when whatever they next game they release is comes out.  Might be acting like a conspiracy nut but it honestly wouldn't surprise me at this point.
---
Thats you being lazy then, it really only takes a few seconds to claim the free items, I dont think they need to add every request because people don't want to take a second to claim free items because they may have to look for them.
---
A bit hyperbolic. 
---
1. Don't post issues that aren't confirmed like they are, that's called hearsay and has zero value
---
2. New players are barely going to notice the actually confirmed bug with reload, because they won't have legendary sets
---
3. This is not even remotely the worst the game has been. 
---
They screwed the pooch on this one and clearly need QA, but damn some people get themselves way too worked up concerning this game. They'll roll back or hotfix the reload bug and that'll be the end of only real problem unearthed from patch 16 so far.
---
Yea it is an Enclave prototype so they could easily retcon it at the Whitespring like X01
---
Was it a legendary handmade? I was under the impression you could get lower leveled gear if it was through purveyor, like if I use my level 1 alt to go to purveyor I'm not getting level 50 gear, I'm getting level 1 gear.
---
There was an annoying glitch that made you invincible and it completely made PvP a waste of time.
---
Me? On the contrary, I'm glad.
---
I *think* it is.
---
I *am* the one.
---
It just works
---
Another week of Netflix.
---
Well. I was going to go on this game for the first time since the Halloween event but now. I think il pass.
---
highlight the (item), then press X.
---
You'll get a larger image, and usually, can scroll left/right to see additional images/angles, or if a bundle, the other included items.
---
If you like it, you can X/buy/unlock the item, or Circle to back out of screen and return to the shop.
---
My legendaries don't seem to be affected and I did a SBQ fight last night and my .50 Cal and PA were fine. So idk what anyone's talking about with those "bugs"
---
Yes I’m part of it
---
You are right, everyone is lying. This is all a conspiracy 👍
---
No legendary effect after reloading, courtesy of +250DR reloading fix.
---
I tried to test this - my hit marker damage was consistent though after reloading - no PA, stood up while reloading/firing so no sneak/etc.  Tried with a Junkie's fixer.
---
Keep an eye out for the Path of Enlightenment event particularly-- the one at the Landview Lighthouse. It's easy for low levels to complete, even solo (radtoads can be annoying, but they should be no problem at level 39), and when you commune with the wise mothman at the end you get a 5% EXP bonus from that as well.
---
The game is still playable. What do you mean by “unplayable”. That’s some hyperbole if I ever heard it.
---
I did, but can't find the key?
---
Thanks! I am actually, but have a small collection of them across a couple characters. I should be able to transfer one from one to another. I'm actually saving my caps and searching for vampire's swing speed walking canes &amp; golf clubs. lol
---
Witcher comes out on the 20th...that might cut into my NW playing time. lol
---
Take a deep breath.
---
They have the list when you click on it in the shop...?
---
I'll add you after work! Short day today and done with drug counseling! Off probation in 1 month too hahaha.  Be safe everyone.
---
For me, it's because I haven't really "finished" the game yet (I'm level 45 and haven't finished the main quest) and I'm just getting a kick out of discovering new areas and wandering around. I haven't started the endgame yet and I'm pretty positive Wastelanders will come out before I do. I haven't spent a dime on the atom shop and Bethesda's world design is literally the only reason I keep coming back to this game.
---
I got them all in 3 days last time. 3 weeks is almost to much time. the 3 days I played for the Halloween stuff was the only time I played NW. I guess I will play it again for the new stuff.
---
You're not being ignored, they specifically wrote that they are working to bring a test server live in the new year. 
---
Read some shit and get knowledge before you whine. Cause that's all this is, a whine, not a useful criticism.
---
Got it, all ammo now weighs 15% more when you reload
---
Yes. We should be very grateful that did their job and ignore the hundreds of other issues that they flat out ignore everyday. Issues like stolen account because of their piss poor security, for example.
---
*fingers crossed*
---
I don't know where to put it since my CAMP don't have doors BUT DAMN I WANT IT TOO.
---
thank you all for your replies
---
indeed, I think I only highlighted individual items so never saw there were additional pictures
---
thanks again for enlighting me so quickly
---
you can work on the excavator quest.  Once you have it, you can vanquish the ash heap/welsh area, then go to blackwater mine.  While at blackwater, if you have an auto weapon, do uranium fever when it pops up.
---
Scrap/sell/scrip as appropriate at the train station
---
At 39, WS may be difficult, but it is doable, so run the WS cottage loop.  Don't forget the laundry building, adn dont accidentally aggro the robots.
---
complete the circuit, repeat blackwater.
---
Please read up on "battered wife syndrome".
---
Made the purchase. Can confirm it's the same speed as the hand pump.
---
I found a note under the main desk (below the terminal) that said
---
“999,
---
 Going on the hunting expedition. Arm the “switch.” Of you don’t hear back from me in 30 days, flip it.”
---
I’m trying to figure out what this means currently. But what do you mean by key? Did you find a locked PO Box?
---
Maybe new weapon for Wastelanders since they are already putting file games in the updates.
---
It's playable in the way a comatose person is alive.
---
so I haven't experienced any problems. granted I'm not a bloody build, I have multiple fall damage reduction pieces and they are all working properly. as well as chameleon, autostim, rad resist... sucks for y'all tho
---
But are those same developers still struggling with those bugs 1 year later?
---
This is a solution of course, but certainly not what I pay money for ie fallout first subscription. If this extends out for days weeks months even should this be acceptable. I'm not really a nitwit I expect the game to function at some minimum level of quality. This simply is not good enough.
---
Hahaha that’s true
---
Do you know how many times per minute people load their guns? Do you expect them to unequip and reequip 5 pieces of armor every 40-50 seconds? Is that playing?
---
I am very glad they were able to resolve your issue. You should be very happy that your issue involved the paid microtransactions section and not a normal gameplay issue as I suspect that would have delayed the resolution significantly.
---
Honestly idk, there aren't amn games I follow as closely as I do with 76
---
Perfect!
---
I'm still playing. I only need to look out even as a non bloodied build because I'm very vulnerable without legendary effects from armour.
---
Do you have an ammo weight reducing armor piece equipped?
---
it's strength related? lmao. my strength is like -3.
---
I thought the santatron can only collect scrap if you already have the scraptron?
---
Nope, it replaces it.
---
It gives diseases and it's dirty water.
---
*laughs in railway*
---
Maybe if you submit a ticket to Bethesda instead of whining about it on Reddit you’d get your issues taken care of. 
---
But no, you gotta cry about it on a completely unrelated site for the karma instead. 
---
But it’s not really about the issues, is it? It’s about shitposting for Internet fame. Crying entitled brats that have nothing better to do than write bullshit every time Bethesda does anything.
---
No if you only have santatron you'll only be able to collect toy/candy and gifts when available.. you need the scrapbot to be able to look for junk/scrap
---
Any kind of heavy weapon like the LMG, 50 Cal and the harpoon gun for me.
---
You don't lose any carry weight from strength when you go negative so you at least that mitigates the loss from one piece of armor.
---
It doesn’t pick up regular scrap though
---
That was the intent, anyway...
---
I did notice yesterday that at least several people would drop out each round, pretty much immediately after a map is chosen. Apparently because they did not get the map of their choice. That means less people per match to kill, or in other words, less possible points to rack up if you're trying to level by killing people (which is way faster than trying to level based on length of survival).
---
You should reread the item description. Only picks up toys and coal.
---
Whats your main lookin like? Id do the whole meta scene but honestly not a fan of the whole low hp bloodied side of things, as well as carrying around extra drugs and stuff for Junkies.. cant really afford to either since i run a heavy build, the carry weight (especially in PA) is dire..
---
No crossplay with cheaters plz. FFS it's horrible on pc why try to bring that to consoles too
---
Just posted this elsewhere, but in case anyone finds this relevant: I'm no longer able to place anything in my CAMP, despite having scrapped a water pump moments beforehand. Of course, nothing else had been placed since scraping the pump, and I do not open the light bulb letter set (which I know had it's budget increased with this patch). The CAMP was at max budget before removing the water pump.
---
(I'll personally treat this as a bug for now, as I don't believe any items beyond the bulb letters were stated to have had their budget modified.)
---
OP got his Atom bucks back. Why does he need to post about it here then. He's the one farming karma as I see.
---
And I literally said Bethesda does not respond to these actual tickets, and your response is "post a ticket"? Are you being intentionally thick?
---
Not really 0 damage. You still take damage but the amount of damage is low enough that you have time to react to it, and stop firing. I have Dense + 3Fireproof + Full Sentinel armors and i can still kill myself (rarely though) if i don't pay attention.
---
The way I read the notes was that during the event the Santatron will randomly collect a prize while collecting toys/candy etc. After the event is over it will default over to become a Santa skinned Collectron. This essentially means that it is a Collectron with an event timed perk on it?
---
Hell no. I carry the habit of keeping all weapons fully loaded. This is a game breaking problem and needs to be fixed ASAP.
---
Do you suggest we go melee? Fine. That's what I am doing, in fact. Hooded rags and unarmed.
---
I consider it borderline unplayable.
---
I'm basically forced into using melee to deal with everything.  I can't use my pistols or Tesla without getting overencumbered.  It's not very fun to have a bunch of things on rooftops taking potshots at me, or being totally swarmed by Ghouls I have to deal with one at a time.
---
I've looked past or worked around countless things since this game's launch.  I'm not able to "look past" this one.  This one sucks.  And also, I'm not particularly thrilled about Bethesda's lack of response so far today.
---
Actually, you didn’t say that. But I’m sure you’ll edit your post to fix that error.
---
I think you may have made a mistake.
---
After the event it will collect toys and candy. That’s it.
---
For a heavy build Bear Arms is essential, as well as Bandolier. It's worth the small hit to damage.
---
I run a bloody commando, main weapon is a B2525 Handmade, full Unyielding/AP Refresh/Sentinel armor, all the relevant bloody perks. I've gone up against whole teams on my own. I honestly prefer when it's someone that can down me, makes it a challenge.
---
I didn't say that Bethesda ignores the tickets? That's literally the only line in my original comment! Seriously are you just being an idiot intentionally?
---
I clicked on the last tab thinking it would be there lol, but smart it was stashed in the middle of the camp tab
---
Personally yes I would prefer lore friendly. I am also not against soft retcons that give us plausible use that makes sense lore wise.
---
Adamantium skeleton has nothing to do with explosive damage, it protects you from limb damage.
---
Nice find man! Ty!
---
Event starts tomorrow.
---
they dont start until tom
---
Holiday scorched will arrive tomorrow!
---
Yes, you are correct, however Fireproof does not protect you from the crippling from explosions, which is why some people prefer to run AS as well.
---
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my god...thx for reply

---
 &gt; Holiday scorched will arrive tomorrow!
---
What should one be looking for in the sub
---
Search for Pawn shop on here :)
---
It's happened a couple times.  The Scrapbox problem, as was noted, and the bulk scrapping problem back around Patch 5 (which didn't actually restore it to how it used to work).
---
I'd like to believe this is a five-alarm fire, especially with the free play weekend ahead, but then I remember this is the same Bethesda that allowed that Power Armor exit crash to go on for *months*, and my expectations are tempered.
---
oh no so shame
---
You chose a bad time to join. The last update broke all legendary armor effects.
---
Getting "Leaving event" notifications for events across the map from me.
---
I believe it can be set to collect typical Collectron stuff once the event is over, from the vault:  
---
 *'If you already own a Scavenger Collectron Station, you can switch your Santatron to hunt for items the Scavenger bot normally looks for, and vice versa. However, only one type of Collectron Station can be built in your C.A.M.P. at any given time. You will still be able to build and use your Santatron even after it has left the Atomic Shop, so be sure to claim yours before December 31.'*  
---
So it seems that ONLY IF you purchased the Collectron you can set the Santatron to take over scrap duties after the event.
---
I'm sorry I have no idea what that is
---
Sigh. Youre a sad sad dipshit.
---
I always try to get in and out of vendor windows, and anything that someone else may possibly try to interact with, but as soon as someone starts doing that, I slow waaay down. And if they dont stop I'll go take a shit. Or maybe go vacuum out my car.. lol
---
Constant failures to fast travel.
---
ohhhhh...... thx for reply, i misunderstood about beginning
---
Thanks for the tag! We're looking into these reports of CAMP budget after the lights were moved. We'll let you know as soon as we have an update on this.
---
Basically all good armor are useless now. They stop working after you reload your gun.
---
I play a commando only build when I reload this must now be  followed by unequiping all my armor and the equipping it all again. I can of course do this every few second or minutes of course depending on the number of enemies around me, I don't call this playable. I understand that brand ambassadors will be out in full force at this point telling everyone that playable is just a subjective term.  That this armor bug is just  it's just a fantastic quirk and of course it isn't it's just terrible customer service.
---
Do you mean the train station?
---
I know, I'm just saying, the only time I ever use unyielding is when I'm trying to learn new weapon mods.
---

---
Thank you.  But that doesnt help me understand if I want to play the game or if I even car about this legendary thing as a level 1.
---
we did all that, one at a time with every player. no dice
---
Why are you still here then?
---
Yes, if you have both bots the santatron can still collect scrap/junk or holiday surprises. I have mine already set to scrap for now.
---
If you only have the Santa one, after the event it’ll only collect toys and candy.
---
With Bethesda's repeated 'competence' at patching things...while I would like to have testservers I dislike the risk they might patch the testservers over the live servers deleting every database and normal server that was before
---
"What do you mean I shouldn't have rolled that patch out to production yet like every other patch?....wait we were supposed to set up new servers for this? ohh..."
---
The paper is in the Charleston Herald.
---
Bethesda is the only major studio known for always have bugs. The bigger problem in this is that they take forever to fix them or never do. I'm sure they get that common bug where a unkillable npc spawns and doesn't move or the fact that everytime on a Gatling laser zooming in you cannot shoot, yet they have done nothing since release. They are trying to skimp cost savings with low amount of staff.
---
Can anyone verify if this is true?
---
If you have played Fallout 4 this game is very sinilar with respect to crafting and building. There isn't much PvP and even then, PcP is consent based 
---
You'll level up quickly so you'll definitely want to look into legendary gear soon.
---
Precisely, hence I will not be running to Bethesda for a refund on my Collectron, haha!
---
The cats probably fucking dead. Just cause it made it into space doesn’t mean it comes back.
---
They don't do the same thing....
---
I ran 3 queens yesterday. It was honestly nothing more than a nuisance becoming overemcumbered from time to time. I still hope a hotfix for this shows up, but its not as game ending as some make it 2 be.
---
People are going to get upset, but this is the truth. I haven't had weird issues this patch, but if I did I'd just use different armor. It's not a requirement in game to use unyielding armor. I used nothing but unyielding for 5 months, started using different pieces a month ago and realized it can be just as fun.
---
Just carry a few less things for the time being.
---
Yes it’s an issue but game is far from unplayable.
---
I PvP'd two groups with some friends yesterday and had to repeatedly unequip and re-equip my chameleon piece every reload. Definitely made it a lot more challenging. And the one a-hole got the god mode bug and killed the fun for everyone.
---
Did the same and ran two queens. One of my armor pieces has the chameleon effect so it's really easy to test if I'm affected by the bug.
---
You said this:
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/Alychqi
---
Which did not specify anything about putting a ticket in.
---
Lol. Anyone who disagrees with you is not on Bethesda’s payroll. Is it a big issue? Yes. Is the game still very much playable? Yes. Should this issue be prioritized? Yes? Are you being hyperbolic? Yes.
---
Stop worrying so much and play the game, im sure you'll like it.
---
Giving you all the answers here would ruin your expericence, play, learn, die, get wiser and have fun
---
AAE 25% AP reduction railway is sick in full auto. I can drop a level 80 scorched beast with one clip.
---
I main a BE15r And use the railway for sheepsquatch, gutsy, scorched beasts, etc. I only carry about 100 spikes on me and rock bandolier.
---
That is pretty useless advice and quite condescending tone...
---
When do these rewards begin? I feel like I read the Halloween ones are coming back first..?
---
I think it might be added at a later date. If there was one, Id have it north side leaving Grafton Steel. It would make sense to have it for the trucks leaving the Steelyard, however with this game it could be anywhere....
---
I havent actually "completed" the quest yet, as Im at work, but this is the first Ive heard of a switch being mentioned by anyone. I wonder if the entire quest is "instanced" and are there are  different  clues for different people to get to Vault 79. It would be hell cool if it were. And hella annoying.
---
If the homestead in question was the Silva homestead, then yes
---
I would think the "weigh station" would be the train yard. Other than that, a "weigh station" is typically off a highway, where they weigh freight.
---
You certainly can start the game as a low level with minimal  impact from the latest bugs. It will affect you once you begin to get towards 40- 50th level. You may in fact find mostly low levels for the near future as many higher level players are affected by this bug. My level is 206 and the game is un-enjoyable for me at this point because of the newest bug. There are workarounds but these game immersion breaking for me. Certainly don't make any atom store purchases or subscription services
---
When do these rewards start? Did I read somewhere that the Halloween rewards were going to come back temporarily before these start..?
---
What do you think I meant when I said they ignore the issue?
---
This would be really cool if the game was still playable. 
---
Hotfix now BGS.
---
Thank.. can’t figure out how to get from one package to the next.. what clues am I not seeing?
---
I have 5 characters, only one is bloodied. Problem is, all of them have useful, necessary sets of armor. I haven't checked if all effects stop working or only prefixes... But won't find out.
---
reloading breaks the legendary perks, durability is broken regardless of reload
---
I did.
---
In terms of pvp people can only damage you if you attack them back. You can turn on pacifist mode which means it’s impossible to damage other players which means they can’t kill you.
---
There are workshops around the map that if you own people can kill you in the area but other than that you can be safe.
---
If you die or get killed people can only get your junk you had on your character nothing else drops.
---
People can not steal or damage your camp, you have a stash you can store things in that no one else can access, you can access it at your camp train stations and other peoples camp.
---
For builds you can go for whatever you want for pve but for end game fights or pvp bloodied builds are by far the best currently. So it depends how you like to play, if you’re into min/maxing you’re limited. If you just want to explore and play then lots of builds are viable!
---
(I know I missed a lot of your questions out)
---
When you say "I ate" do you specifically mention putting food in your mouth and chewing by moving your jaws?
---
I've heard that. Along with the microwave thing. What if you just dropped a juke right on top of it. There's literally nothing that could survive that right?

***removes all of them, permanently***
---
Fixed!
---
They ignore your Reddit posts about it. Sorry, I missed mind reading at hogwarts.
---
That's a really odd time to start something..? 7pm on a Wednesday..?
---
Yeah got 3 so far but all randomly. Are the connected, should one lead me to the next?
---
 Bullshit. They lost nothing. Santatron was free. There's no way you'd get a refund over it in any way.
---
Was the locked PO Box with the rest of them?
---
Or it could be describing a sex act. Again, not a mind reader.
---
It's not fixed. Had a nice big group fight until one a-hole got it and wouldn't relog. I had him at no go for a good two or three seconds and he wouldn't die. Other people dumped a bunch of ammo into him as well.
---
Here ya go! https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/e8iszz/filthy_under_50_private_server_edition
---
Yes, Halloween first. Christmas ones begin on the 17th afaik
---
Maybe maybe not I dont play it either but I hope they turn it around for the players that do enjoy it they deserve that
---
I made a post saying this, that was downvoted to hell awhile ago. Remove it from all pools. Legacy it (lol). And please let us all just move on with our lives. What the fuck have been they doing the last month? It certainly wasn't testing. And it really fucks me up that Wastelanders is delayed "to ensure it meets their expectations of quality" and then they drop this shit? WHAT QUALITY?!
---
We would pay 6,000 atoms to go to test servers.
---
But you aren't repairing mid PvP are you?
---
It would be pretty cool. I’m gonna go to Grafton steel next since it keeps being mentioned
---
PvP is consent based, except when you take a Workshop. You are given a warning that other players can contest ownership and flag you for PvP. You have to be within the border though, so they can't flag you from across.the map and gank you.
---
If you get killed by another player or mob, outside of Public Events, you drop all of the items in your Junk tab, and those are fair game for anyone. You do not drop weapons, armor, or anything else though.
---
No I think you missed basic badic english and went to "assuming and aggressively attacking" instead.
---
Random events are the only way to fast level I found. You get kill exp and reward exp at the same time.
---
Word.
---
Read up some guides, watch some videos, maybe join some discord group, but mainly do play.
---
After lvling over 5 switch on Pacifist mode and you should be golden.
---
Have you ever seen a game so detailed in variety of bugs? I bet you haven't!
---
Yep if not in PA
---
Because context means jackshit right?
---
Again my main character is commando I have no alt characters. Is the game playable yes like a car with flat tires it can still move forward. I don't care if you agree or disagree with me but yes brand ambassadors will be out in full force in order to mitigate them damage.
---
Can confirm that they did.
---
Oh he’s alive
---
No, you answered a good bit! ty.
---
That sucks tho... if a mob kills me a rando can mosey on down and take my stuff?  I guess I can live with that. Not a big enough deterrent.
---
All but the sentry bots. Standard gardeners and protectrons are garbage. Sentry bots and assualtrons are still okay (unless that changed from last 2x xp day).
---
Holloween rewards started yesterday and end next Tuesday. Then the Christmas challenges start right after they end.
---
Last time I checked cats can’t live 25 years + however old it was before the bombs.
---
LOL all right, all right... I'll just hop in blind :D  Already getting the warm fuzzy from whats here now.
---
It’s actually not very accurate...sometimes the pictures show things that aren’t included (mothman bundle).  Then sometimes it lists things but doesn’t show a picture (the recent free states bundle said their were two backpack skins but only showed a picture of 1).  I learned the hard way not to blindly trust just pictures or just lists so I don’t buy anymore unless I’m certain of what exactly is in it.
---
oh somebody with a bit of power at Beth already knows that very well, just look at how the controversial Fallout 1st sub came out a few days before Outer Worlds release
---
I doubt that was truly coincidental
---
I did miss badic[sic] English, its a dialect I’m unfamiliar with. Where do they speak badic?
---
Yeah they can but unless they are next to you when they die it’s unlikely someone will get it before you as you know where it is (you drop a small brown bag) also not everyone will take it players are kind so especially if you’re lower level people might guard it for you.
---
Also as they can only take junk you ideally should be dropping off junk in your stash regularly so you shouldn’t lose much if you die. Most junk is easily farmed
---
Bethesda:  “What? Pull out now in our moment of triumph?”
---
Bleedout syringer works (and only it, nothing else afaik).
---
Cool suggestion but they wont do it. They want people to browse the store and find stuff to buy... Realistically the free item of the week should just be on the front page of the atom store with the other featured items.
---
I didn't even think of this but now it makes me want doorbells even more, The pranks i could pull on my friends... I bet they could work something in for trick or treating next halloween too.
---
I consider all rad roaches legendary enemies since half of the real ones drop super subpar stuff like the onestar troubleshooters crossbow i picked off of that 3star 68 mutant
---
You can’t, the trade-able one is one that was glitched during beta and has since been duped. This is only on PC as far as I know. If you need one I have them available.
---
Yep. Definitely went to "dickish attacking people school" where people are so perfect they never make typos and fat finger the button literally next to the one you wanna press, right?
---
You know what? Good day. Bethesda is definitely the best company in the world, they are amazing, I am sure we are sinning by not worshipping them 24x7.
---
I’m honestly not sure currently. I’m stuck on a log about a weight station currently
---
Oldest cat on earth is 30 right now. But dude it’s a video game. A lot is possible in a world where bats are the size of dragons that shoot you with sonic blasts.  Not to mention the hive mind scorched or zombified ghouls that roam the streets with super mutants.
---
Ahhh I thought junk was vernacular for any item on my toon.  That makes more sense.  Biggest point is I wont lose progress, and what I do lose just adds to the risk of dying which adds to the challenge component.
---
Yeah. The locations are all on the fallout wiki but that seems like cheating :)
---
You dont need to carry around extra meds for junkies. Get addicted once to 5 different chems. boom there you go. smh
---
In your opinion. 😋
---
A).  As other have stated, they're 2 different functions, so it's irrelevant.
---
B). If they reduce the price of something, you don't automatically get a refund, including if the new price is free.  If they feel like giving away money, they certainly can, but you have no automatic right to anything like a refund.
---
They are all dead too (the Communists) and the chances of anyone from the vault having communist  sympathies is rather slim IMO
---
Just tested, it did bypass it. I used vanguards , when reloading manually I dropped DR but quick hands triggered and didn’t loose any DR
---
Yeah that would feel like cheating to me too
---
Unfortunately we are not able to speak the forbidden name. 
---
It is the subreddit that cannot be named.  Look for the snakehead and flowing black cloak, and you will find the F o 7 6 M A R K E T
---
They don't allow buying and selling things here.
---
They don't allow telling people where to buy and sell things here.
---
So, yeah...
---
I mean we'd have to remove the concept of resource locations being a thing atleast for camps. Change it to you can produce one of anything anywhere but only one.
---
I use barbarian 3 and with fireproof 2 I can stand on exploding bots &amp; stand still through scorchbeast sonic attacks and take almost 0 damage.
---
Holy assumptions batman. I don't hate the game at all.
---
The bugs from Fallout 4 that I am talking about carried over to this game. They are the same bugs, thus waiting years for a fix for these exact bugs.
---
&gt; This is all with the caveat that feedback from the test server is listened to and addressed. **My guess for when we get the test server is that people point out X, and 2 months later X is still there and goes live**.
---
Exactly. At this point a public test server would be yet another hollow PR move. If they want crap like this to stop happening they need to fix whatever is broken in their internal QA processes.
---
Is that a freezer? Does that imply a “no condition loss” storage option?
---
This sounds amazing I’ll will definitely be joining in on the fun
---
Hmmm, idk what could cause what I'm seeing then. I retry on different targets later when I get home.
---
That's awesome!   Thanks for the test and confirmation of my theory!
---
Strangler PA works as well i think
---
Yes, this advice about broken sets of unyielding armor is very useful to someone who's asking about starting the game b/c we all totes had a full bloodied build by level 5, right? lol
---
He got a refund on Collectron not Santatron
---
Sha-weeeet
---
Other players cannot loot or destroy your camp.
---
Gear level maxes at 45-50 depending on what ot is, but you can earn levels indefinitely. Up to level 50, you can assign 1 SPECIAL point and pick one perk card per level. You also get a pack of perk cards every 5 levels up to level 50, these are random. After level 50 you can either pick a prk card, or move a SPECIAL point from one category to another. Perk cards have an assigned value, and the total for each stat can not exceed your base score without buffs.
---
There are certain builds that do more damage, but you are essentially free to play the game however is most comfortable for you. You may not get top tier performance out of every build, but almost any build can be viable, except for pure crafting builds. I would recommend picking one weapon type, and focusing on that till you hit 50, then after that you can tweak your build around it.
---
This is not an MMORPG, it's just an Online RPG. There are no more than 24 people per server, and typically not that many. There are Vault Raids that are instanced per team, but other than that no, there are no dungeons in the traditional sense. There are areas that you can clear and loot, and there will be an "elite" mob per area.
---
You can craft essentially anything that's in the game, except some clothing items and a few other oddball things, but you have to get the plan/recipe first. It can get you to level 50, and can help your lower level friends, but you cannot craft legendaries  and those are the end game equipment. You can only get those from legendary mob spawns or the Purveyor.
---
There's always a grind, stuff you can farm for crafting, farming legendaries to turn in for scrip to roll for new legendaries etc.
---
The game is relatively easy, but if you adventure out of your level too quickly it can knock you down pretty quick.
---
There are no areas to explore underwater as far as I'm aware.
---
The event system was recently changed, but typically anyone on a server can participate in any event. The exception is certain dailies and Enclave events that require quests to be done to unlock them. Events labeled as Public Events can be fast travelled to for free, and even if you walk away they are still a good way to unlock new fast travel locations.
---
Hope that helped; have fun out there! I play on PS4, and have a couple friends that are always willing to help new people.
---
So we can still do these things as players. I wish it had more official support, but some of us as players are legitimately trying to do these things even without mods. 
---
Especially the RP side. And I totally agree with the legendaries, they kind of derail everything, especially crafting.
---
You know what's funny Bethesda doesn't have to refund shit. As someone before me has said "you spend real money for fun currency and then the fun currency gets you something from the shop" in retrospect you got what you paid for.yiy paid for fun currency not the item itself.
---
True
---
Sounds perfect, thanks!
---
Lol. I’m going to venture to say a direct hit would probably kill that cockroach.
---
Forget bloodied. Quests reward legendart armor and they are very useful in early game, such as Life saving pieces and Chameleon pieces, which are also broken. What do you think OP will feel when he is wearing one and it doesn't trigger? Quite possiblly a variant of "this sucks".
---
You are not wrong. But that doesn't mean we should throw the baby out with the bathwater either. I have a small glimmer of hope that the people making the decisions at Bethesda realise the damage it will cause to the longetivity of the brand if they go too far off into the wacky wasteland.
---
Goddamn is New Vegas perfect.
---
If you’re lvl 60, you might not be doing enough damage if you’re not optimized.
---
😈
---
That's a wonderful example of poor emotional regulation, I'm sure you gave your wife or kids a smack in the face.
---
Because your wanted person is on a private server....
---
Yeah qol for me so I don't have to browse the same repeated shit that's been "on sale" for the past year.
---
lol really?
---
I've never noticed that, but I guess I will from now on, too funny
---
You can only have one Collectron at a time, regular or Santatron. Which is why when you stored the old one it let you build the new one.
---
I have a feeling we've already got those...
---
If you want credit and don't have a strong weapon loadout hit her with a few grenades (any kind). If not you need to do around 1k damage to her before it will flag credit (sometimes less but that is a safe place). I recommend tagging her with a few Molotovs and frag (mirv) grenades for a worry-free experience.
---
Ya, I'm kinda crabby about the disease part.
---
There is a damage threshold that you have to meet, at least that’s my understanding.
---
If we assume the cat was born in space, somehow surviving, then stays up there for 26* (forgot it’s been a year since reclamation day) years, then makes it to an escape pod or something, and then comes down (again somehow, because it’s most likely going into shock on reentry) with its 4 years left, to do what? It’s a cat, there isn’t anything special other than it being in space. The most use you’d get is nailing it’s paralyzed limb body to a piece of wood and hanging it on your wall. But that isn’t what happened, we know this from the fact that it was the first cat, so instead, it probably was taken down earlier in the timeline, before the bombs drop (if even) and died when they hit, or earlier. If not, he’s still probably over 2 or 3 years old, and it having lived 29 years isn’t going to look like the picture. The best you’re getting is a shriveled old gross looking (possibly mutated) corpse that is named.
---
I think they might be able to read through the forum and to see that this is a bug that will probably be addressed in a month or two, but you seem to know how lower levels use and appreciate random armor drops from events much better than I do
---
This is the only time I wish I had that blue dress because I want the gold one haha
---
Add me I can make it for you IGN TheHoboSeer I will be on around 4pm est
---
I haven't logged on because of the patch. I'm PAYING YOU Bethesda, get your shit together already, jfc.
---
You are making judgements when you have no idea what the players situation is. Evasion is absolutely a legitimate playstyle. You shouldn't be shoehorned into a single playstyle to have a chance at winning the match.
---
Added!
---
I've put maybe five hours into the game in the last month. I planned on getting back into fallout76 and trying the Christmas stuff etc. is bethesda putting out a hot patch? I run bloodied and can't afford broken armor and no stats especially considering I only have one set of armor. This sounds like a game breaking thing and I don't want to participate in that and just get mad. Maybe I'll load fallout in next year. Sigh.
---
Awesome, sent you a request
---
Excellent, added you
---
Puppies! Sent you a request
---
Or to wash your dirty hands before using it so the next player there wont get Bone worms...
---
I know you are just a messenger but Is mess this going to be addressed? What will Bethesda do in order for this not to occur again? The fan base keeps on getting shitted on yet we still play and don't get anything back except a more broken game each week.
---
Whats test server going to do exactly? Does it hire more coders to fix the game? What Test servers do is give companies somewhere to test updates to help notify them of any on going issues before its rolled out to users which is great when they have the resources but this team doesn't. Yes test servers are nice but doesn't matter if Bethesda doesn't listen to the feedback as anyone who played Fallout 4 could of easily gave them the list of most of the bugs that were in Fallout 76 on day one.
---
Again it’s a video game. Anything is possible. Maybe he’s a shriveled mutated corpse. Maybe it’s an immortal super cat that traveled so close to a black hole that time passed differently for it than for us. And while it’s been 26 years for us it’s only been months for him.
---
Within 10 min of playing 
---
Stings and things Quest - they fixed the visual bug for badges but I get a reward of “&lt;missing text&gt; “ so I guess that’s the badge lol
---
Visual bug - Quests don’t show rewards anymore
---
So basically you're saying the game's unplayable?
---
You fix one thing, break everything else lmaoooo
---
From what I can tell, it only breaks the primary effect, so weight reductions, fall damage reduction, and other resistances still work.
---
The italicized quote above is directly from BGS. How much more verification do you need?
---
I would not worry too much, in the early game, legendary gear is very rare, and by the time you are at a high enough level to commonly find it, the bug will most likely have been hot fixed already.
---
Maybe. But you've never tested it. So who knows.
---
You should have been able to pick up a lot more than 6.  I got the required number on the first go.  There are some by the waterfront, and several more around the Mothman Statue (which you need to snap a picture of in Photomode for the challenge anyway).
---
was wondering I was not going invisible anymore when prone. Guess the that effect on my chest piece is broken now.
---
Lol yes.  Just like the dr bug was fixed because they said it was.
---
Same here. Flechette. Could be the mod or quad weapons themselves breaking stupid fast.
---
That really is it, it's so simple. Just a tiny bit off attention to detail would fix so many logical issues.
---
Lol, I’m also hoping to have a backpack one day but have a hard time motivating myself to complete the challenges. Been sloooowly working on it. Maybe we can help each other with that? Added you
---
Most AAA game companies make good games while Bethesda just spits them out and gives mod support.
---
similar situation
---
You can get all 25 in one go. There are 6 by the water &amp; another 20 around the statue. I got all mine yesterday
---
Or just auto apply ownership for the free item to anyone logging in.
---
People who download it for free weekend most likely wont have any idea about the broken patch unless they follow this sub or youtube channels about the game. I dont honestly see there being a fix or a patch for the issue until next update. I guess the best bet is to just stash the regular armor and use PA until then. At least the enter/exit crash issue with PA was resolved.
---
It is really shity that this happened. People who have endgame builds based off their legendary armor have to go back to running around like they are in their mid 50s again. I hate it because every armor piece of mine has chance to revive on it, and several have auto stim pack, so I have to go back to setting perks with mysterious savious and such. I am not as boned as other players, but still fucking rediculous.
---
I picked up 28 last night in 1 shot. Shouldn’t have to server hop. Don’t forget the ones by the river and under the moth man statue
---
There's a huge problem lately with the massive amounts of duped weapons in the game. Literally everyone is killing the queen in less than a minute. There is a certain amount of damage that you need to do in order to get a reward, somewhere in the range of 2,000.
---
Right now people are stacking a ton of damage multipliers and  cheesing the queen with duped bloodied explosive gatling plasma and bloodied deathclaw gauntlets. They're robbing other players of rewards and it's absolutely ridiculous that the end boss in the game is being defeated in less than a minute.
---
Bugs are just Features waiting to implemented. Whats more challenging then having an unyielding build break in the middle of combat.
---
Was this legitimately added? Why was it not in the patch notes?
---
It's good to know the people of the Old World were keeping their hands clean.
---
I swear you will see it all the time, now.
---
its the franchise effect, no matter how bad the next thing gets, people are so emotionally vested in it that hey can’t walk away
---
Ooooooooooohhhh I found an envelope last night at Silva but I hit X too quickly and didn't get a chance to read it and didn't know what to look for in my Pip-Boy
---
Some seriously Sims looking shit in there. 
---
I want a post apocalyptic stronghold, not fucking Barbie Dreamhouse. Shit is weak AF
---
Have you beaten the BOS storyline? Sometimes that prevents people from getting loot. This was an older glitch though so it may have been fixed by now.
---
Just running around naked beating on things with my beserkers death tambo
---
If they do a patch as big as wastelanders and don't do a public test server first ... I don't even have the correct words for how stupid that would be.
---
There's no damage threshold. I've literally hit her a couple times by barely getting to the event just before she's killed and gotten all the loot she drops as well as the event rewards. The key is to make sure you actually join the event. This happened to me several times where I fast  traveled to Drop Site V9 or walked into the event area and didn't get any loot or event rewards. Actually join the event from the map and have your teammates confirm that your name appears in yellow while the event is going on. If your name appears in yellow to other players it means you're actively participating in the event. There's a bug where the event objective still appears in the upper lefthand corner of the screen when you're in the event area but the game doesn't actually recognize that you're participating in it.
---
Guess it’s a secret quest. It’s confusing as hell though
---
This whole patch just shits on bloodied sneak commandos. Unyielding broken, sneak broken, hunger &amp; thirst is fucky. The whole god damn patch team is fucky.
---
Limbs don't get crippled in PA.
---
By your lack of standards, you could still "play" Super Mario Brothers if the jump button worked 50% of the time.
---
Indefinitily*
---
And the number of screws should correspond to the level it is, as well! (And maybe the number of mods it has)
---
I haven’t been on in a long time. I didn’t realise they were giving away free items so often
---
Everything I've read sounds pretty awful towards bloody builds. I was going to get back on after taking a long break away from the game. I rely on the bloody stats for my build. There is no point for me to ever play again if they don't fix this because trying to reset my character would take forever after all the time I've put it. This sounds pretty game breaking for my play style. Which sucks, I was looking forward to a weekend of gaming and looting.
---
The game mechanics are not a secret. If you carry loot you can loose it when you die. Your death is not the fault of the other guy.
---
What's the point of this post other than karma farming? You aren't going to get an answer.
---
Didn't say they were.
---
This guy has it figured out ^ if there was a damage threshold the "tapping" mechanic people use for other legendaries wouldn't work.
---
Dumbest rule on this sub, that it can't even be spoken about....
---
They should at least provide a link on the side bar, would actually help a lot of people. There's more helpful than hurtful people, and very quickly the hurtful people would be outed as they scammed. 
---
Mods need to lighten up on this rule, or at least provide the link on the sidebar.
---
Yeah, I'm wondering if the bug that made armor not break also was buffing it somehow and when they fixed it, it made armor work the way it was originally intended to. It's nothing huge and the numbers seem the same, but I have to be more cautious when I run head first into an incoming swarm of enemies.
---
What about a Moleman Foreman who uses modified deep drills to call in reinforcements. Perhaps he could be summoned at that one giant digger after you have it activated for those 30 minutes. Maybe it would be a case of mistaken identity where they are still spiteful towards the mining company who betrayed them.
---
Ingredients are easy to gather for the Forest recipe, From Gauley mine to Overseers, area along Tracks, Road &amp; River, using green Thumb I usually get around 26-30 Firecaps in about 10 minutes, follow the river to Flatwoods/Ag center picking Bloodleaf &amp; Snaptails, then use the Chem bench at the church with Chemist &amp; Super Duper, should get enough to last a couple of weeks playing 6 hours a day on average.
---
I will try my best to answer as best I can on all of your talking points. 
---
**PVP**: In adventure mode, you cannot PVP with someone who does not want to.  There is a setting you can turn on and off "Pacifist" mode.  If you are turned on, you cannot PVP.   With one exception.  PVP is free game at workshops when they are contested, even if you are just a passerby.
---
**Loot**:  When you die you drop your junk items.  Only junk items are lost.  It is important in Fo76 to stash your junk as much as possible.   You will lose junk from dying in PVP or PVE.  The good part is you will then have a mission marker show up telling you where your dropped junk is sitting.
---
**CAMP:** Noone can take your camp,  once you build it, its yours.   Enemies can damage it, and destroy some elements, but you can repair them.   Your stashbox is only accessible by you.   The only things someone can take from your camp are crops or resources from an extractor (a machine that mines stuff for you at a resource node) or water from your purifiers.    You can however lock extractors and purifiers.  If someone picks the lock they become wanted and every high level player on the world will hunt them down.
---
**Endgame**:  Endgame is a little bare in Fo76 right now with only a few events.  There is no level cap, or at least noone has reached it yet.   Im sure there is a coded maximum, but its so high its likely  unobtainable.  After lvl 50 you will get the option to start moving your special points around or select a new perk, so leveling serves to gain more perk cards, and reposition your perk points if you want to try a different build.    Most people dont finish workign on their first build till around lvl 70 or 80.   People like me will grind out levels to respec and try different playstyles.
---
**Build**:  You can build what you want, some builds are more effective for some content, but if you want to run nothing but weight reduction perks you can or nothing but health regen, you can.  Noone will judge.
---
**Dungeons**:  There are a few places that could be considered dungeonesque in design, but Fo76 doenst have the same type of encounters for dungeons as most MMOs you may be familiar with.  We do have group events, and the endgame raid requires a full group, and is an instanced event.  Most content is open world and event related.  An event shows up on the map, and you can fast travel to it to partake in the fun.   Most events run for 15minutes to 30 minutes depending on which one, and how many people show.
---
**Crafting**: A very intregal portion of the game.  Yes you can craft and mod your own weapons and armor.  Most playermade gear is not going to be as good as a dropped legendary counterpart, but it can be done.   Same for weapons.  You have the ability to craft any base gun or armor in the game.  Crafting will play a much bigger part in keeping your foodstuffs stocked and making sure you have ammo for weapons.  You can also craft meds, drugs, chems and alchohol for buffs and healing.  Crafting is a big deal.
---
**Realms**. Servers are not set up like normal MMO servers where you pick one, and that is all you play on till you stop playing.   All Fo76 servers are instanced, and change.  there are 24 players maximum per world server.  If you leave to go to a different world, everything you have including your camp goes with you.
---
**Grind**. Welcome to Fo76 the game that takes grinding for a specific item to a whole new level.  Yes, there will be things you will want to grind for.  Plans, Chems, Items, Armor, Weapons, Outfits.
---
**Dynamic Events**. Dynamic Events is what 76 is based off of.  Most of the non mission based content is event based.  There are public events, and smaller events.   Both open to the public, one type is usually a bit more difficult (public) and allows free travel options and no penalties on death (you keep your junk).  Smaller events function just like open world combat, but with an added reward at the end (usually chems water and plans)
---
**Challenge**. Yes and no.  76 has some very OP builds, but it also has some that arnt so OP, and will be a challenge to run.   Early game can be tough if you arnt loaded down from the beginning with gear and items.  If your on your own to start, there will be some challenge.    Trivial encounters tend to start happening after lvl 50
---
**Biomes**. Yes, you can explore underwater.  There are even a few perks and gear items available so you can breath and survive under water.    Fallout water is scary, you will need those items or perks to survive in it for extended periods of time.
---
I hope this helps.   See you in the Wasteland.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
There’s more than 6 there and they’re not just by the statue
---
"PvP: ...the community is super cool and relaxed, except for the occasional asshole"
---
So those who enjoy PvP are not "super cool and relaxed", and are indeed assholes?
---
Thanks man. Unfortunately I figured it out the hard way like OP here.
---
Not more or less stupid than releasing a new game without public testing. The disadvantage of a public test is that it needs to be fairly long to make a real, appreciable difference, and releasing a beta of the overhaul months in advance would spoil the launch of the final version. Regardless of whether the initial version is called a beta, the public still treats it as "the" launch - there is only one chance to give a first impression.
---
commando automatic weapon- burn thru ammo need to reload every few seconds.....play at downgraded level ie armor...paying for a lesser level of service perhaps they should lower prices to compensate players
---
I agree.
---
Don't know if anyone else has had this happen but for some reason I ran into at least 30 rag stags and 2 bears fighting outside of Grafton. The fps tanked as you can imagine. Been playing since launch and have never seen anything like it.
---
Shill spotting.
---
I got two now!
---
&gt; broken in their internal QA processes.
---
The assumption that such things even exist should be reconsidered.
---
Very interesting. My experience was just the opposite. I did all three Camden Park events back to back, and none of them gave me any notification that the event was done at all -- no splash text with rewards, nothing. They just disappeared from my active quest list. 
---
I did get rewards though. My token count went up enough that I could afford things I couldn't before, and I got the splash notification for a legendary armor piece.
---
16 x 0 = 0
---
I dont know,  I didnt make the rule, and I dislike the rule myself. 
---
But I dont want to get banned from the sub.  Ive already made enough enemies here, I dont need to make more.
---
I did it last night and had multiple "crowned" charred ghouls up simultaneously, and players were being attacked by various ghouls.
---
I was with a group who was farming it, it didn't seem out of the ordinary to me.
---
Hey, so here is some basic structure to the quest. I am going to put it in a spoiler tag though, just to be safe:
---
&gt;!When you enter the pawn shop, immediately look at the floor to get 3 clues.!&lt;
---
&gt;!On the 2nd floor, use the black light.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The two boards are the quest.  The heist board is the lore board. As you find lore packages, you can add them to the board. On the table at the starting quest hints as well as the hints from the packages at the front door.Start where other conspiracy related quests started ;)!&lt;
---
&gt;!The lore board has nothing to do with getting you into Vault 79, its just what it sounds like, its the story.!&lt;
---
&gt;!To unlock Vault 79 though, you'll need map fragments. When you use the black light, you will see 6 clues. Each clue leads to a location where you will find a map fragment.  Once you have all 6, you can put them up on the wall and it will show you your own personal code to use the Vault 79 Elevator.!&lt;
---
We found one of these on the table at the steakhouse
---
I have an alt that has done nothing with the BOS that gets loot Everytime when I get enough hits in, I don't think he is even aware the BOS exists.
---
I suspect this is a prime example of why functional testing is needed, not just unit testing.
---
You are a sad bitter person. 
---
P.s. quit your bullshit. Or do i gotta break out the screenshots on you again? Lol. Evidence is hell right?
---
Wonder if the Halloween one they opened back up works the same way? Was considering trying to grind out a few of those rewards.
---
Thanks, I know about the eggs around the statue. I have picked up those in the weekend (before this week's challenge) and they haven't respawned since either for me.
---
If I'm in my camp, minding my own business, and someone comes along, comes inside and starts swinging away with their meat hooks or shooting me with their gatling plasma, they are an asshole.
---
Yeah. Your caps lock anger ranting really drives that point home. Im sad for you.
---
&gt; this bullshit is preventing me from playing the game.
---
Yea, I was just thinking it might be time to take a break for a few days. I was looking forward to the double XP event this weekend, but if it's still broken, I'll pass. What a massive screw up.
---
Ahh, yes, that's right.  The OP was mentioning PA use.  I forgot.  Well then all he really needs is Fireproof then.
---
MUST ... FEEL ... CLEAN!!! lol
---
Sure have fun. Post all the screenshots you want. I'm not sure what that's supposed to accomplish.
---
Do you know what "contributing to the discussion" is? Do you know that rhetorical questions contribute fuck all?
---
Wow do you have FPS??!😂
---
I didnt promise you anything. Learn how to fucking read. 
---
Since we have devolved to this point in your targeted tangent of being absolutely insufferable across multiple different threads, ill add specifically what im talking about here. 
---
This dipshit up here, (you) has come at me several times accusing me of lying about a patch update. (Yeah i know right? Its a patch. Chill.) 
---
Ive mentioned several times that there was no lie. It was his comprehension that was at fault. This dipshit then felt the need to start finding all my other comments to bash because whatever reason. Now spanning multiple days of this idiocy. 
---
So i called him out on it. Got told i was lying again. 
---
Posted the screenshot. And homie got super butthurt. 
---
Now since he got called on his bullshit, hes on a rampage to repair his feelings. 
---
I genuinely feel sorry for you and how you feel you have to behave today. Id like to apologize again on the behalf of whoever made you this way. Its gotta be tough living a life full of so much hate. Have a great day.
---
Lol. Kids these days. It’s a bug, it will be fixed. Calm down. Just use regular armor for a bit. You can still have fun. It’s not the end of the world.
---
I can understand that. Still, I think that it's good to show Bethesda (because they do read the posts around here) that the community is angry. If we didn't make posts about it and stood silent, they might get the idea that we don't care and that they don't need to fix it.
---
Yes, we are planning to address the reload bug as soon as possible, we'll post and let you all know as soon as we have more information on when that is.
---
PVP - You're immune to all player damage prior to level 5, and there's a pacifist setting you can turn on to keep you safe after that. There are certain public resources you can capture that will open you up to PvP if you stay in the area, but the game clearly warns you before you do it.
---
Loot - When you die, you drop anything that is in the "junk" category of your inventory, and anyone in the area can grab it, but all your weapons, meds, and other stuff is safe. There are stash boxes all over the map (and you can build them in your camp), so as long as you drop your junk every now and then there's no real loss. 
---
CAMP - People can't really do much to your camp. In theory they could kite a bunch of high level mobs to your house and they can attack it, but you won't be camping anywhere with high level mobs for at least the first 20 hours, so it's not a concern. If you have crops or water purifiers they can harvest them, but they refill quickly enough that you probably won't even notice. The worlds aren't persistent, so when you log off your camp disappears.
---
Endgame - You stop gaining stat points at level 50, but other than that there's no "max level" to speak of. You'll see people that are level 400+, but the only real advantage they have over a level 50 player is more flexibilty when it comes to choosing their perk card loadout. There is one fairly long main quest and dozens of side quests, and after you've done them all there are high level group events you can play as well as a dozen or more daily/repeatable missions you can do.
---
Build - Yes, there's a bunch of viable playstyles so you can build your character any way you see fit. Some builds are more OP than others, but if you're not involved in PvP itt doesn't really matter, almost any build is viable at the end game with the right gear and perks.
---
Dugeons - there's 3 vault raids that rotate on a weekly basis, but other than that there aren't really instanced dungeons or whatever. That said, there's 100+ locations filled with enemies that respawn regularly, so you can repeatedly farm them for resources or loot.
---
Crafting - you earn plans by completing quests and events, and after you read the plans to learn them you can craft those items. You can also mod things you craft or find to make them better (adding scopes, extra pockets for your armor, etc). Scrap all the weapons and armor you don't need to learn and unlock new mods for those items. Eventually you'll find legendary gear that's better than anything you can craft, but for the first 20-25 levels you can definitely craft things that are better than what you find.
---
Realms - they're instanced worlds with a max population of 24 people.  If you log out and log back in again you'll be in a new world, so on the off chance someone decides to grief you it's easy to block them and server hop to get away.
---
Grind - There's tons of different things to grind for, with the "perfect" weapons and armor for your build being the main one for most people. There's also tons of rare outfits you can hunt for, and dozens of collectibles like bobbleheads and magazines that you can collect and display in your camp.
---
Dynamic events - most of the public events have timers and different objectives. Many can be completed alone, but some definitely require coordination with others to get the best outcome and rewards.
---
Challenge - The first few levels come fairly quick, then the progression slows a bit in the 20-35 range. At some point after level 50 you can be geared up to the point that there's very little challenge outside of certain events or locations, but you can always impose your own limitations on your character to add to the challenge, such as not using legendary armor, or avoiding some of the mutations that would make you overpowered.
---
Biomes - There's water, and you can swim in it, but its highly irradiated and there's not much to be found. That said, you can find gear that allows you to breathe underwater if you really want to explore. The map is divided into 6 regions that all have their own distinct look and feel, distinct playlife and enemies, etc. It's also huge, so it'll take you dozens of hours to explore it all.
---
Wastelanders - no official date other than Q1 of 2020. Outside of what's been shown in the trailers I don't think anyone knows what else is coming other than NPC's.
---
Not enough to be sharing
---
Bloodied build in PA with emergency protocols? Best of both worlds maybe. I haven’t tried it yet as my alt just hit 50 and I thought you could save perk cards so I’ve got more grinding before he’ll have the right cards. Seems like it helps mitigate the dying a bit.
---
Youre actually one of very few people responding negatively. Across the other threads where ive said all of the same things, even in this thread. People with actual reading comprehension skills are being rather nice.
---
Just keep your friends under 100 you will get better FPS
---
&gt;I think that it's good to show Bethesda ... that the community is angry.
---
Yes, I do think it's important to let Bethesda know when they've fucked up. But there are other posts already that do a much better job of addressing the issues at hand. This is really just a low effort post for karma, from what I can see.
---
Adhesive is my bane.  Probably because I took down my Mutfruit/corn/tato farm for gourds (need em to make cranberry relish)
---
Im right with you on Ballistic Fiber.
---
I didn't have any problem with my bloodied either.  
---
Full unyielding / weapon weight reduction wood armor sets were working fine.
---
I basically turned McLintock upside down and can NOT figure out what to do next.
---
Probably not for a while, but there is a pack coming in the future 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8tv9f/datamined_responders_pack_including_responder_pa/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
hm I wonder shrouded mod effect goes before the unyielding effect on my wood armor sets.  
---
my unyielding was working fine.
---
&lt;Why would we build dirty and dingy things?&gt;
---
Because it's all you can get. Do you think there are wallpaper factories churning out brand new flashy pink wallpapers in post-apoc West Virginia? xD
---
I think there's some middle ground between what you want and what the OP wants. The problem is that Bethesda is frequently delivering pristine looking wallpapers that are also bright gaudy colours or kitschy patterns. What we need are some basic, natural looking options that have dirty and clean versions, and then only occassionally see pretty pink barbie wallpapers on the cash shop.
---
How many coders do they have? Right... you have no idea. Test servers are a must!
---
"I'm okay, so fuck everyone else"
---
What is this black light you keep speaking of?
---
This is what I’m trying to figure out as well. At the Clarksburg post office, there is a note related to 999 but that’s the only other thing I could find
---
the only screw scrapping gives you is a big "screw you"
---
I got all mine last time so I couldn't say. I would hope not though as they only get 1 week to get them all done. The first 3 aren't hard to get though.
---
Repair kits were not in the game at the start, so I doubt that was a factor.
---
Gift boxes dropped from holiday scorched and santatron collectron most likely.
---
on melee?
---
Why would they make a free tab, when the whole Idea of the Atom shop is to rape us for $20 for power armor paint???  Silly consumer, don't you know how this works?
---
I found out that PO Box is actually for a different quest with a missing kid
---
My TSE 250DR blunderbuss cares
---
Yes
---
Supposedly, this is a UI problem, but you actually do get the rewards.
---
Also... Red Rocket daily?  What is this?  I must be daft... or this is something that showed up on launch day and never came back for me because I have no idea what event you're talking about.
---
Well, they haven't worked the rest of the year....
---
Nope! It's an unmarked quest, which makes it pretty confusing but fun (IMO)!
---
I know, right? The suit has a few details that make it look a lot lighter than the other sets, and I could view it on my Excavator and on a t-series suit so it should be a skin that can be applied onto any armor. I'm looking forward to seeing if they put out a Fire Breather-version of this paint as well
---
Agreed. I'm not changing my character build because Bethesda can't do their job properly. They're supposed to be erasing bugs, not creating them ffs!
---
&gt;accusing me of lying about a patch update
---
I never accused you of lying. You fully believe the bullshit you make up. Which is what I said, you made it up.
---
A lie requires one to know that what they're saying isn't true. You cannot tell the difference between your fantasies and reality.
---
Is it the mystery of the half eaten preserved pie?!?! =O
---
Honestly, I don't give a shit about fake Internet points. But if you think I do, oh well, too bad.
---
I wasn't referring to PvP players as a whole. Just the trash ones with no skill, as I stated. I PvP and live in NW myself because it is a good change of pace. I don't engage is the Toxic sort of PvP. I don't use Teslas or Stealth Boys. I don't use explosive weapons unless the other party is using them or the other party is using Stealth Boys. Typically I VATS or free aim in PvP.
---
That would indicate the eggs are not treated like plants / flowers (which respawn after 20 hours, afaik) but like other static world spawns, where you have to pick up either 60 or 180 (I always forget which number is for containers and which is for world spawns) other world items to make them respawn for you.
---
Just go to the Asylum and completely loot every room, that should do the trick.
---
A lot of people did, but that could really mean anything, and with how broken the patch has the game right now, I think they probably made the problem worse, not better.
---
Shouldn't the #1 priority to be to invest the money from FU1st back into the game, in any possible way?  Like, in any way at all? THey had to have masses of cash, none of which they seem to have spent on the game.
---
Joining the event will get you the event rewards but if you want drops from the queen you need to hit a damage threshold. From most of what I've read the threshold is about 300 or so damage.
---
I had exactly enough to get it, it looks so good
---
It's kinda tough to see but does it look like the other fire breather paint scheme?
---
When paying for a service or a game you should be able to expect a level of service yesterday before the patch I was enjoying the game today this enjoyment is gone.
---
Thanks for helping make my point.
---
The guys with the deathclaws fucking around in their PIP popping bobbleheads and eating glowing steak or the guys popping psychotats, ballistic bock ,and stacking bobbleheads to maximize the damage on their bloodied explosive gatling plasma.......
---
Well those people are fucking that level 60 with a hunting rifle out of a reward because that guy can't do 2k damage in 90 seconds.
---
It's really no different than on shot killing legendaries at group events. Put the bloodied Gatling Plasma away and let everyone get some hits in.
---
Its a daily event, on the west from freddys fears house of scares, there is a red rocket that launches that event for you when you go there the first time, and every day, it shows up onto your map after you discovered that red rocket and used the console.
---
Yeah, that's not happening xD Marketing 101
---
This.  Drink it once then spam the collect button and you can get q2 or 12 per drink
---
They have done that before with a mounted heads no mention in patch  notes
---
How long has it been since you submitted the ticket, and have you tried restarting your console?
---
There are a few closer images that shows the dark parts being blue rather than black:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8tv9f/datamined_responders_pack_including_responder_pa/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
They want us to stay tuned and look in regularly ;) the last weeks they gave away free wallpapers. This week it's a santatron. The green marker works fine for me, no need for a tab
---
I use bloodied handmade stealth commando build.
---
The new “quest” called Treasure Unknown
---
Find a friend or family member with PS+ and log in on their console.
---
It did in Fallout 4. They tried to hard in this game to make scarcity a thing, it's to the point where it doesn't even make sense.
---
It's really too annoying to worry about. Stealth is useless until they fix it. In tests I did right after the patch, it's actually the left arm and torso. Some reason the secondary effect on those two isn't lost either.
---
One of websters definitions of "lie" is as follows. "A falsehood" and the definition of falsehood according to webster is "the state of being untrue". 
---
[Heres the screenshot you asked for](http://imgur.com/gallery/19KCsMy)
---
With your caps lock rampage and all.
---
Yeah, not technically a Responders skin. Same with the Fire Axe and the Flamer ones. The only one of them that was a Responder skin was the Shotgun one.
---
They're becoming AAA at MTX. Max weapon deterioration just before a free trial + sale on "repair kits".
---
Lol hood rags ftw
---
Where it involves diving under the deepest body of water only to discover an under water treasure city?!!??!?! =O
---
I think it's called "Poe's Law", (not the writer) about the misinterpretation in online ironic comments. A good read.
---
How long would X01 stand up to nuke mines? Would emergency protocols have any effect, or do rads still eat through the last 20% of health at the same rate?
---
Me: I’ll never spend money on the Atomic Shop.
---
Me while looking for the free item: A toilet made out of tires?!? Take my money!!
---
I’m actually going to buy the regular one now. I was on the fence before. I liked it bit always other things I wanted first but the Santa guy cracks me up and I want him to be able to collect junk after. I owe it to him. He’s a good boy.
---
That's weird - all of my (and everyone else's) bloodied builds are fucked.
---
I’m a bit worried you aren’t going to enjoy 76 since it’s basically Fallout 4 Online.  
---
That said, just turn I pacifist mode when you hit level 5 and you don’t need to worry about PvP.  
---
As for dungeons, you don’t need to worry about those until you are full geared and max level/built. 
---
Take advantage of double XP this weekend. Join events if you see other people are attending them and can help out. Do NOT use the main quest as a leveling guide. Once you complete the Airport quests, just focus on exploring and killing stuff for XP. If you just stick to the main quest you’ll end up facing level 68 mobs when you’re in your late 20’s and not enjoy yourself. 
---
And have fun. 
---
There isn’t really much else you need to get going.
---
It would be cool if there was a mule costume we could use. I try to gather sheepsquatch mascot outfits for mules. Tends to work.
---
It shows up for T-60 too, so it's a skin and not a paint. Bonus!
---
More of the police version it looks like. 
---
Btw someone told me there is a responder police hat. I don't have that for some reason so I will have to be on the lookout for it to add to my collection.
---
Thanks for the reply glad you guys know, also I noticed whenever I select or interact with something music from a banjo plays for some reason. This seems to happen sporadically but mostly on public worlds.
---
I meant today, specifically.
---
Honestly I have surpluses of everything, and the only thing I consistently run out of is circuits. What you can do is set up every junk node you can find, then just hop between them. Gives you all the rare junk. For aluminum loot Fort Defiance, the surgical trays have 2 aluminum per, and there's easily 100 in there. For adhesive the farming is a must. I have everything but melons, because melons weigh too much to be useful for anything. Just make sure you pick your crops and make the adhesive every time you come back to drop stuff off, you'll be swimming in it in no time.
---
Is it just me or are some of the carryweight cards broken.
---
Tried putting on traveling pharmacy for fast travel with no effect to my carryweight
---
PvP. Most of the game's PVP is "Opt-In" but some of the options are deceptive.  Don't go to any Workshops (little cog icon) unless you are willing to PVP.  Make sure you turn on Pacifist Mode in the settings to avoid friendly-fire accidental PVP initating.
---
Loot. In Adventure Mode, you will drop all Junk items upon death and any player can come along and take your loot bag.  Some are nice enough if you die, to stand watch over it til you can return and grab it.  Others... not so much.
---
CAMP. CAMP's are only persistent while you are in-game.  Any resource extractors that are left unlocked can be looted.  Your personal Stash however is account locked to you and no one can steal anything out of it.  In Adventure Mode, CAMP destruction by other players is now turned off, BUT they can incite NPC's to come and attack the camp.  There's also a few exploits that break the game's intended limits that allow griefers to attack your camp, but I won't detail them here.  By and large however, your camp is pretty much immune from PVP destruction.
---
Endgame. Well I don't think I've observed a max level limit yet, but for practical purposes at this time, gear maxes out at 50 and most people are pretty much solid in their final builds at 70+.
---
Build.  There's gonna be elitists regardless of game system.  But this game does have one of the most unique systems for customization and flexibility in your build, allowing you to continue to tailor and tweak the slotted perks you use as you continue to level.  I **highly** recommend you check some build guides and read the Fallout wiki just to get an understanding of what builds utilize synergy and effectiveness.  You're going to want to understand concepts like Perk Sharing, gear degradation, and the fact that currently Power-Armor builds take a second seat to tailored 'armor builds' based around specific Legendary traits.  Legendary gear however is all RNG and trade based so it's hard to guarantee that you will have an optimized set of gear.
---
Dungeons. There are currently (three?) raids, all set in Vaults.  I personally have never tried them, as they came out while I was on breka from the game.  But there is some top-end gear in them, including a grind for the best Power Armor in the game currently.
---
Crafting. Crafting is incredibly powerful in this game, and you can get some incredibly killer combinations of Legendary with mods.  However you might wish to hold off on getting crafting perks at lower levels, and if you can befriend a top-tier crafter, get them to help keep you upgraded as you progress through the main campaign story.
---
Realms. Everything is account bound that you earn, with the exception of taken-workshops that you occupy do not follow you from server shard to server shard.
---
Grind. Hell yes!   Everything is usable/craftable in some way, shape, or form.  There's certain resources that are more valuable than others, and often depend at the level you're playing at and what kind of gear you tend to use.  Ballistic users find lead and acid neccessities for gunpowder and ammo.  Energy users are always hungry for crystal and fiber optics.  
---
Dynamic Events. Yes, there's a lot of quests called 'Events' that cycle throughout the day, and it's randomized.  Some Events are highly desirable to hit, such as Uranium Fever and One Violent Night, for farming Legendary gear.  Others like the Scorched Earth Event, are depending on player actions, such as launching a nuke.  The low level zones have quite a few regularly occuring events, and I used to famr them all the time, to gear up and get staple stocks of neccessities.  They offer good XP too.
---
Challenge. This is subjective.  Some folks claim they rollstomp everything.  Others have a few enemies and situations that always kill them.  It's all dependent.  Group content such as the Sheepsquatch and Scorchbeast Queen though are generally not things to Leeroy Jenkins into.
---
Biomes. There's no real underwater boime unfortunately, *HOWEVER* the environments here are gorgeous and varied.  There are hostile zones like the Ash Heap and Nuke Zones where you will die without the proper protection.  
---
DLC. We don't have a solid answer on Wastelanders.  It sucks, but it will drop when Beth says it's ready toi drop.
---
It's called Cop Cap, just like the regular version.
---
nope. the only thing you get up to level 50 is points to put into your SPECIAL stats. camp budget is always the same regardless of level.
---
Apparently it has red trim. Guess I have something to shop for. Lol
---
Hey do you happen to know when the NW challenges go up? Or where in game I can see them the patch notes said the holloween ones started today.
---
You need to buy the Scrapbot for 500 atoms or you can’t place the Santabot.  I learned that with my alt account.
---
I guess it’s different for all of us then because everyone is complaining about their unyielding being broken but mine is just fine. On my vanguard guy I lose around 150 DR every time I reload and even when I use mele weapons.
---
Really cool idea for a boss. Probably too hard for Bethesda to code to work correctly so would just glitch out and be impossible to beat or cause entire game to crash. Maybe even end of deleting peoples items when crash happened. Anythings possible with this game! 
---
Honestly though I would take ANY.FUCKING.NEW.BOSS. It could be a giant purple dinosaur for all I fucking care but Fallout 76 is ONE GIANT SANDBOX with VERY LITTLE SHIT TO PLAY WITH IN IT.
---
most helpful sir
---
Buy the Scrapbot and it will show up.  Go to resources, scroll through the robots, place Santabot.
---
There's references to stuff from 20 year old games in the code. It's really bad.
---
You got banned for duping. 
---
It took two minutes to search Google and find that answer.
---
It would put the community as ease knowing what the team was working on. I have a hunch everyone's overworked over there. Hope all is actually going well for you during the holidays! Y'all don't forget to take a rest every now and then! Looking forward to what's to come from you!
---
For circuits, Try the side room (with the weapons workbench) in the whitesprings laundry building.  
---
Theres a metal bucket on the floor with several loose circuit boards, and IIRC, a military grade board nearby.
---
Oh come on man. This game has had nearly every edge smoothed out and now your complaining there's a consequence to dying? Go play something else
---
Modify a three star bladed weapon will made it 4 stars. Thats the only 4 star I know of right now.
---
I mop up the rest of the mobs before I go loot the queen. I also wait to loot meat piles til after the event is over. There are also a lot of tents at events, just rush to one and drop your flux.
---
A giant deathclaw would be pretty awesome.  Maybe give it some stealth phases so it can avoid vats hits.
---
I really like your super behemoth idea as well.
---
I think a huge wendigo that calls in feral ghouls would be pretty awesome too. Maybe give it an acid spit attack like the mirelurk queen so it can hit ranged characters.
---
lmao, it does kind of look like a cop car - the Responder Police uniform would look really good with this paint
---
Interesting... it doesn't come across as FO4 online (other than look and feel).  I dont know, this just feels like more of an RPG where FO4 felt more like a FPS with light RPG concepts.  But I guess I have to see how the perks and level up experience is like.
---
But the answers given here is falling inline with my expectations and what I'm looking for so I;m jumping in.
---
A bloated glowing wendigo. That would be cool. I'm wondering if that weird wendigo colossus thing from the wastelanders preview will be a boss, or another version of the Sheepsquatch.
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
Oh shit, did you just misquote the dictionary at me in order to tell me that I'm using words wrong?
---
Merriam-Websters also defines 'lie' as: "to be or to stay at rest in a horizontal position"
---
In your fake world that I said you were lying, do you also think that I was accusing you of being horizontal?
---
But wait!! What's this? Merriam-Websters doesn't actually define a lie as being a falsehood? 
---
https://imgur.com/a/uPrE96n

Color me shocked that you just made more stuff up. But you see, I think that you believe what you're saying, which means they are not lies. You're just a fabulist.
---
POSTCRIPT: You also made up the definition of falsehood.
---
Yes actually.  My gatling laser breaks real quick. Course I'm using repair kits.
---
Oh is that what it is? I was wondering when they were going to make it were I couldn't put the jetpack in my arm, just did it yesterday since they said they fixed the jump bug
---
I forgot about that creature.
---
Hopefully they get some new nuke areas with bossed coming with Wastelanders.  I really like the SBQ and Imposter fight. Definitely need more epic battles like this.
---
look near the chair ;)
---
Im going to make an unfounded statement not backed up by any facts or game lore, just a deduction. 
---
Im guessing Enclave has a higher energy resist because most of the time they are fighting the BoS whom uses alot of energy weapons.  While BoS tends to fight everything, and ballistic damage is more common on the battlefield.
---
Just hang on for brand ambassadors to tell you that it's really not that bad, it's just quirky, doesn't make it unplayable, adjust your style of play, don't be entitled, quit complaining, buy fallout first, how about that Santatron freebie.
---
Well hopefully you enjoy it.  It’s my favorite Fallout game, period.  
---
I honestly don’t really enjoy quests in pretty much any game. I prefer to just explore the world.  I only completed all the main quests on my first character this week, and I have 5 characters level 100+.  I only completed them because I figure I *had* to on one character.
---
Here are the lore piece spoilers:
---
&gt;!Mrs. Silva
---
The Taxidermist
---
Monogah Law 
---
The Senator 
---
The Newspaper Editor !&lt;
---
Anybody found the letter to senetor blackwell only pice im missing
---
Yeah I think it’s like a grandfathered in type thing that they can’t fix or if they do fix it they know they’ll break three other things
---
The enclave was expecting to fight aliens/ foes with just as advanced weaponry. They werent rlly expecting the americans themselves to be the bigger treat. Also in all fallouts, energy weapons are mainly the end game weapons (primarily plasma and gauss), so it follows that logic as well.
---
I don't know, everybody has their breaking point. Mine was the vault raids re-introducing the damage bug back to pre-patch levels. I stuck through 600 hours of endless problems with the game, but that was what tipped it. I'm not even considering coming back until that's fixed for good. I've had an itch to come back recently but I'm satisfying that with FNV mods instead
---
They need to make a "Owned" tab.
---
PvE players get tons of shit.
---
Go to Clancy Manor in the forest. Assuming it hasn't been looted already and your loot counter has reset easy 24-26 adhesive only guarded by a few level 5 scorched.  Check the workbench upstairs for 3 military grade duct tape, a sealed wonderglue on the pegboard, and a economy wonderglue on a shelf in the upstairs on a bookcase.  Loot containers there usually give you an additional glue or 2.  Of course there are other ways to get it, but I used to hit there once a day because it was so easy to loot. You can just run right by the scorched if you want.  45 seconds, 24 adhesive. Also has bonus resources, circuits, fiberglass, acid and 2 screws from a fan and globe in the next room over upstairs.
---
Redeem on the Atom Shop
---
I don’t think it’s one of the items you can put at a workshop, just your camp
---
It also includes the 4th of July, Easter, Columbus Day, President's day, etc. I don't recall putting up a tree for any of those holidays, just Christmas.
---
What platform are you on? If it's PC, I can give you a spare.
---
"playable" is meant to be a subjective term, not literal. Why would we term a game based on weather we could load into in the game. Think about it.
---
If Microsoft Windows or any other software has an bug... do they send you a check in the mail? 
---
Yes this is an issue ...maybe I’m crazy... but I am somehow still able to play and have fun with the game. 
---
Just relax and enjoy the game. If it really upsets you that much, play something else. It’s not that big of deal. Just use regular armor for a little bit. 
---
Are you seriously unable to play the game since the patch? Lol
---
Several of the daily quests (mostly in the Mire, but I'm not sure) seem to have a display bug since yesterday's patch, Chloe's and the Pumpkin House quest didn't show completion but did give me rewards as usual. 
---
Easy way to see it for yourself: take note of your caps balance before and after handing in the quest! And the Pumpkin rewards are always the same, so that's easy to check for as well.
---
“Playable” is not subjective. “Unplayable” means... unable to be played. 
---
Apologies if English is not your first language.
---
I do not aggre with a lot of your build, I don't run bullet shield or blocker as I find the dmg reduction unessisary with emergency protocols and lone wanders. Life giver isn't great for bloodied and 7 points of endurance eats your points. Dodgy will destroy your ap, and cores (not that they're super important) richocay isn't very useful when you should be killing this fast anyway. I can't remember everything in one go so might edit
---
Here's a link to my build that I have been using for a good 75 levels (I am now running r3 bear arms n r1 lock n load due to carrying 11 heavy guns lol)
---
I love having my Collectron wandering CAMP. It adds a little life to it when travelers aren't around. I hope they add more voice lines for him though, they can get repetitive.
---
That's not to say they weren't planned from day 1, just like Fallout first was likely planned from the beginning. Just look at ESO if you want to see where Bethesda gets their ideas for stuff like this.
---
That totally makes sense. I knew they were opposing factions, just never connected BoS's weapon type of choice to the enclave's armor.
---
That was my thoughts on the matter. I have it in my brain that itll be fixed by then. Although we havent actually heard anything other that "we are working on it."
---
It makes the most sense to me, but with today already being half over in EST, im starting to get a little worried.
---
The Enclave was the continuation of the US government and army and they took over the remaining oil deposit on earth. Doing this they managed to develop more advanced technology than anyone else. The BoS are basically a few steps behind and therefore searching for remaining older technology. Basically BoS has Enclave hand-me-downs.
---
Yes and No.  
---
We're the chronologically *earliest* Fallout game yet made.  We're only 25 years after the bombs fell, and we have the benefit of (in-lore) CAMP devices that help shape and fabricate our buildings from raw materials.  There's lathes, saws, and drills on the CAMP device.  We're building our own s---!
---
Likewise there's a LOT of stuff here in 76 that isn't at the state of decay and degradation that the setting of 200 years forward Fallout is.  Most of what is here is and should be 'different' from what is seen and experienced in Fallouts 1-4.
---
Lore-wise there were always mentions of exceptions that proved the rules.  The Chinese experimented with Power Armor, but for their own reasons, they had more advancements in Stealth technology.  Responders logically have access to whatever we as survivors do, because they were formed post-war.  So PA for them isn't out of the realms of possibility.  Fallout lore is not static, in any case, and I for one feel that 76's lore has been bang-up in staying true to the spirit of what has come before, and splendidly laying easter-eggs all over West Virginia in terms of lore tidbits and storytelling.
---
I think someone mentioned a secondary or tertiary effect was unaffected. was it weightless? I'm not sure. either way it fixed the problem.
---
Added
---
Xbox but I appreciate the offer!
---
I think eggs work like ingame items, where it can take 48 hours or so much gameplay time before they respawns. 
---
If you're worried about them not respawning in time (They should), run a second character out there to harvest them. Different characters run on different timers.
---
Awesome. Since arm mods are useless and there's no way I'm giving up my protocols lol. Haven't had a jet pack on 100 levels or so
---
Slow down and think. Being defensive doesn't help you're case.
---
I'm also guessing that BoS would, at least to an extent, build armor to protect against the weapons used by all settlers they seem to *really* excel at pissing off.
---
I am not defensive... I’m explaining the English language which clearly is not your native tongue.
---
I don't think weapon artisan helps your weapons degrading rate. But is a perk that can be switched in and out when reapire. Also running the Queen gives you tons of improved repair kits, I haven't repaired a weapon since they introduced them. And have had to drop over 100 of them lol
---
They are gatekeeping faction specific rewards in NW. If you play one of those factions it kinda becomes mandatory
---
More like *phone rings at desk of Bethesda Support.*
---
That’s it.
---
Yup. Happened to me too. I just installed a second machine and was moving all my ammo for sell into it. Some idiot kept bashing me. I even told him to bug off the machine is empty, so he started shooting me and attacking my camp. People man...damn.
---
You can also harvest pitcher plants in the bog and snallygasters and many of the creatures in the mire give adhesive.
---
It's ok to be wrong.
---
LOL...I just now realized you were OP.
---
This.
---
Many of us are waiting until the bad press gets out of the public light, so we can talk to our friends about it and dismiss things as "yeah, it used to be pretty bad lol, game's pretty fun now though". Pretty hard to do that when we get one update a month and it fucks things up even worse consistently. The only time they don't break a major feature is when the update has like 3 graphical fixes and a bunch of NW changes
---
Found it thank you!
---
I noticed it too. Corpses still disappear before I am able to loot them. Happens frequently too. Still a bug and still not fixed, despite being reported as such by the patch notes.
---
Bruh, they revamp trading and bobby pins will go back to weighing 0.1 lbs. Dont give them ideas. LoL
---
Ok? Are you seriously arguing that using the word “weather” is correct and “whether” is wrong in the context of your previous reply? Or are you saying that unplayable doesn’t actually mean unplayable. Lol
---
Bruh...
---
I'm getting the same overencumbered bug on PS4
---
Sugar Grove is also good for circuits or any other place with a large amount of robots.
---
Exactly.  Use Weapon Artisan when you repair your gun, but run Gunsmith 3+ day to day when using a legacy.  
---
I’ve got 5 different characters level 100+, and my main guy is a heavy build using legacy weapons pretty much exclusively (other than a VE LMG when I worried about blowing myself up). Fireproof provides zero explosion protection from legacies.  So you can’t use them if enemies are in melee range.  My personal favorite is the VE Gatling Plasma.
---
*slow clap*
---
He did say that anticheat would have to come first. In mostly capital letters. Lol.
---
Then do what I did in kindergarten and either suck it up or make do without them.
---
No, they absolutely do. I still get ribbed by coworkers about it every time Bethesda fucks up.
---
Wow, another adult. I'm slightly less embarrassed.
---
I can log in and play my character at a much reduced level which seems counterintuitive to the purpose of the game ie level up acquire better weapons armor etc. There is no indication that this will be fixed in a timely manner in fact the company history is any indicator it could well be months. To compare microsoft and bethesda is an insult to microsoft. I will have to pick up a different game but as a paying supporter of the game ie fallout first this has definitely impacted my enjoyment of the game. I was foolish to have supported this game with my monies
---
ill take weight reduction please
---
Sometimes a word holds more then one meaning is my point (same spelling). Literally you are correct playable means just that.
---
Sadly yes. It doesn't help the community when they release "big update" with an free week end without testing everything first... Some will leave, many will trashtalk.
---
Joking, yes I was
---
I'm half disappointed and half laughing internally. I stopped playing months ago when the vault raids broke everything I enjoyed about the game (that was actually working at the time, that is), and felt like at this point it's been so long that I probably missed a whole bunch of cool stuff. Nope, just missed a few grindy events with cosmetic rewards and came back to a horrendous patch that broke even more basic aspects of the game
---
Yep, and it is a problem. Especially when talking about added or removed content.
---
Yeah I run a lot of legacys and I die way more often from myself then from enemy's. I love my be plasma. VE is great for being at full health, the heals are insane (10 procs a shot like wtf mate)
---
And then I runn ffr heavys so I don't have to switch to demo expert and can just keep gunsmith on since my guns break all the time
---
Bethesda! All joking aside I believe you have to find or sell to get them. So vendor sell for 8-9 days and you should have it!
---
They should have just gotten wastelanders out of the way this year so they don't get another year of bad press
---
I was thinking for those guys that run solo, maybe drop the requirement of 4 players for hunter vs hunted in adventure mode down to two. That way you could still get solo fights. 
---
But i suspect its the NW environment youre after as well.
---
A blnote saying we added a secret quest would be great.
---
It is now a level 20 (was 40). Killed it's first Supermutant today. So cute. Who's a good girl? You are, yes you arrrrrrrrre.
---
Holy Jesus thank you
---
Levels keep increasing in xp until 1000. It used to be a lot more head on swivel when it first came out, there was slap damage and you could go wanted for just shooting a guys camp. It was kind of easy to trick people into going wanted back then too (open to pvp). Nowdays they have a cap on pvp damage and you can pretty much opt out of everything pvp using pacifist mode and falling into traps will be good learns. Game is grindy if played legit, but that's what I love about it.
---
Crafting is decent. You need to find plans. Legendary farming is what you want. You can explore under water. Not sure on wastelanders release, only know it's q1 2020.
---
Lol. Weather is not correct... “weather” refers to storms, rain, the temperature etc. You really are doubling down on this hah
---
Nope, it doesn't. Also barbed harpoon doesn't work... The only thing that works is bleedout syringer.
---
No, but I expect people to know how to read. I explicitly stated that this "fix" is almost only relegated to temporarily fixing issues that keep you from fast traveling due to lost legendary effects fucking your carry weight.
---
Damn, I thought something was up but wasn't sure. They really screwed up a lot of stuff. Thanks for posting.
---
Oh sorry, I meant the camp workshop! If it's even called that, haha. I mean the screen where you create your camp and add items. Sorry, bit of a 76 n00b still. I've redeemed the item, it just won't appear under resources! Gutted.
---
Preferably a forest or hunter green. Not olive or neon bright green.
---
That was my big gripe. I mean truth be told, i understand nothing of how to program something, other than one high school programming course 15 years ago. 
---
I like the shorter matches, but that does nothing for how insanely bored i get just sitting there for two minutes in the vault. I get they want to show it off, but cant we cut that time in half somehow? Especially since the patch was supposed to cut searching time in half?
---
The holloween should be on beth website. Tomorrow is the holloween rerun.
---
Ok. Cancel your subscription then and stop the temper tantrum. This is not a big deal.
---
I never referred to or commented on weather vs whether.
---
i’ve only seen people on reddit say this, was this actually confirmed? the e3 panel comment was a pretty big deflectionand didn’t directly say this was happening
---
What I suggest is you learn how to read. I never said this was a fix for the bug, I stated that it would serve as a quick fix if your lost legendary effects are keeping you from fast traveling.
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
---
...also just go in and out. Same server works
---
It's a bad thing
---
Sorry, did this patch break the atomic shop and the ability for people to give them money to buy more crap?  I think not, and they probably rolling in cash from the holiday sales.  So, the game is not actually broken.  Me, like some, but not nearly enough, won’t give them more of my money via atom purchases until they make the game better, etc.  I am exception.  There are ton of gamers that just entered their credit card to buy atoms and holiday crap and that is what Bes cares about.
---
I noticed that too
---
haha i thought i noticed that but then it didn’t work again for me. but i only retried that once.
---
Got the makings of a rap song right here... lol
---
&gt; Cant see BGS going into free to play weekend with a gane breaking sized bug.
---
Then you clearly haven't been around very long lol. They allowed a cheatfest to occur in NW during the last free weekend event. Duplication exploits that were found during the beta weren't addressed until 2019, and some of them were still around until like April or May. Game breaking damage bug existed since beta, it was "fixed" to occur less often around January, and then bethesda ignored any posts about it and pretended it never existed. Vault raids brought it back to the same levels as before and it's still not addressed. This game breaking problem has been there for 100% of the game's current life span, including every free event
---
100 ft tall Todd Howard that yells "it just works" and stomps around like Godzilla.
---
Be careful what you wish for. Maybe they'll add a new mode with repetitive pve matches then remove adventure mode.
---
It’s the collectron, you have to remove it and switch to the right to place Santa

---
I then reply about your incorrect use of the word weather, and continue to mention it in each reply
---
I never claimed this to be a miracle cure, I actually explicitly stated this would only really work to unfuck your carry weight if you rely on specific perks . I falsely assumed that you nitwits would have be able to read through those few sentences to grasp that much.
---
Oh I see! Thanks very much, I will try that.
---
Sadly i haven’t been able to do the quest yet but i’ve added a bunch more info into the moment thread that should help. Supposedly its gonna be a actual quest but can’t get full confirmation yet.
---
I don’t think Demolition Expert even works with legacy weapons, but you’re right about killing yourself more than enemies killing you.  It’s worth the trade off though. 
---
I ended up selling all my FFR guns I think, but I think I might have an Ultracite Gatling FFR still.  I carry too many guns and don’t use half of them. 🤷‍♂️
---
They will refund unused portion of subscription? So if I purchased a year they will refund 11 months?
---
I'm not experiencing a temper tantrum I am in fact very well emotionally regulated. I simply am stating my views on the condition of my play experience since the patch and it is now substandard for me. I have not expressed anything personal about you or your temperament
---
That's not the point of the argument. I make mistakes and I'm not afraid to admit it.
---
Color me jaded, but BETA was essentially a test server and Bethesda did nothing to fix bugs that were reported during that period. I fail to see how a test server will change their  don't-give-a-shit attitude. Sure,  people will find bugs,  but if it's not a dupe they won't do jack.
---
I agree that its not par the course for Bethesda. It may also be more hope than sense. 
---
That being said, SOMETIMES Bethesda has fixed big things fast. I saw in a different thread some examples supporting that. The only one i can remember offhand is not a good example though. But they fixed the stashbox issues rather fast for fallout 1st subscribers. Like i said. Bad example, i know. I can try to find the other examples if you would like. 
---
Its not out of the realm of possibility, but as today continues on, im feeling my hopes of a hot fix dwindle.
---
I think the idea is it doesn't tell you what is included in those images. Like the Holloween bundle, which showed a witch and pumpkins which weren't part of the bundle.
---
Once placed it will be set to collect gifts, but can also be set to junk or scrap if need be
---
A behemoth city where you have to fight your way to a 3* behemoth would be fun. Give the weapons instead of just melee to make it more of a challenge.
---
A giant 3* mirelurk would also be fun.
---
No actual quest, sort of like the TNT Dome keys.  Though you do get a holotape that counts as a quest item.
---
good job
---
Demo dose not work with legacys which is nice cuz gunsmith is a must lol
---
Yeah I'm carrying a be n VE plasma. A be flamer, and cryo. A QE harpoon. And Bffr versions of the: lmg, mini, 50cal, gattling, and Ultracite gattling. Thank god for bear arms, cuz I can not pick which ones not to have lol
---
Seriously, we have to use so many to craft/repair, but scrapping them yields no screws. Whyyyy
---
Cancel your 1st subscription, stop playing.
---
It's because this subs styling doesn't play well with oldreddit.
---
[I can't see your username because of the color used for OP's name in comments.](https://i.imgur.com/xj7aJpb.png)
---
Which has never been announced as coming ever
---
Oh. You didn't say that though, you said "Nerd rage does nothing in PA". Why say that if you meant you were at full health, it obviously does nothing then
---
When they first came out, I spent a lot of time setting up a glitch museum. It was awesome, except pretty much none of the items actually have a visible distinguishing feature of being bugged. If you have a scoped weapon, you can maybe tell that the tesla rifle is bugged to not have any sights. Pretty much the only really visible items are the combat knife and sledgehammer without a blade/head, and of course the items that literally don't have a world model
---
"Bother Bethesda for a fix"? 
---
They're on the verge of a free to play and double XP event and a core aspect of the game is busted. Do you think they're just playing sit-and-spin in the office or what?
---
You are right. It’s ok to be wrong. I get it now. Apologies accepted.
---
This is how they should address each and every problem with the game. Replace it while they work on a fix. I've been saying this since launch.
---
hello computer
---
Exactly. Just skip the pointless bs wooden leg events.
---
I liked this and I think it fits perfectly.
---
No, the NW reward is a "Charlie Brown" tree in a tire.
---
Make sure to add invincible enemies, and that one bug where damaging enemies too quickly makes them regenerate some health. I’m noticing it happens more frequently with a non-legendary handmade, but it happens with all my weapons, even a lvl 30 vampires hatchet.
---
 Apologies for spelling whether wrong. You can take that if it makes you feel better.
---
Yeah
---
Yeah I have a QE harpoon and haven’t even fired it once.  I use a BE one occasionally as a toy, but it pretty much sucks. 
---
I’ve got 9 legacy Gatling Plasmas I think.  I lose track.  I also have a BE Laser Gatling for occasional use.  No flamer or cryo legacies since I never really wanted one. 
---
I don’t carry any of the ballistic heavy guns any more besides the VE LMG.
---
This actually happened to me, I bought the sink for my camps bathroom lol
---
lol I believe you
---
I think a ton is broken. Everything feels WRONG. Reports like yours helps identify stuff faster. Don't know what weapons/perks are affected. Water consumption seems off as well.
---
&gt; Downvote if you're a salty Excavator boy
---
Upvote if you're a sneaky scavenger :)
---
Understandable.
---
I see you
---
https://youtu.be/06lqu5vT17U?t=45
---
You mean the tired,  canned "we are aware of the issue" response?  Followed by a mea culpa here's 25 percent of at the Purveyor consolation prize?
---
They have a really odd idea about what people want it seems.  They usually have 1 cool post apocalyptic piece in the atom shop each week and a bunch of silly/flashy stuff that doesn't really fit imo.
---
Same feeling
---
No. All weapons reduce your movement speed when equipped. Some more than others. Heavy guns slow you down more, so you only see these effects stacking on the heaviest of weapons. The change is barely noticeable because it's not by a large margin.
---
I’m other words, one is small the other is big.
---
Then don't go pushing people around for reacting reasonably and expecting what is most likely going to happen
---
I haven’t seen any of the devs acknowledge any if this yet, but I’m holding out hope they’re just staying silent until they find a solution. I’ve noticed the invincible enemies and the damage bug have both returned as well
---
No, that really is the reward.
---
There is a decorated "indoor" tree in the mined AS pics, looks better than the giant, unlit tree in the shop now, IMO. I was holding out for it.
---
Yes that's exactly what I'm expecting from bethesda
---
&gt;all weapons upon reload break all legendary effects
---
All?  That doesn't seem to be true.  I'm using a TSE Handmade right now and reloading doesn't break its legendary effects.
---
Says the guy pushing someone around for having a second reasonable reaction and hopes of something coming...... Foh.
---
Heck, how about a scorched in a power armor, like a turned BoS Paladin?!
---
Pick a finger and go poke Bethesda with it.
---
Stay, of course.
---
Because he had pizza.
---
Haha its all relative man
---
A lot of new people and old players are coming in. If they don't fix it soon they game will continue to lose players.
---
Lately, sometimes if a gun I'm using breaks mid fight, I can hit left on my dpad to swap to my previous weapon and the game will reequip my broken weapon and it'll last until I swap weapons again. Also on PC here.
---
No u dont
---
I think the key point here is that most problems and bugs just appear, product of new fixes and patches for different things. Introducing problems that weren't there before. 
---
Imagine you have a broken light at home, you replace it and discover you have no more water and the fridge is now alive: he is annoying and talks to himself during the night, tells dad jokes and laughs like a maniac. 
---
That's Fallout 76.
---
Paying QA testers for their 12th consecutive month of vacation
---
Are you sure? I didn’t have a resource tab at all until I bought the Scrapbot.
---
Here you can see that the lowered durability is with full intent.
---
This isn't affecting everyone. It's not universally glitched. Give them a chance to figure out what actually broke.
---
I've got a tse n fe plasma as well, but I never use them. You should try out the qe harpoon, they are great and make there own ammo
---
I had that happen for a few of the photo challenges as well.  I just gave up and did something else in game. The next time I logged in it registered.  Maybe just try logging off and then back in.
---
You have to get used to the grind so you will be more inclined to spend money on MTX.
---
It works at workshops
---
But it’s the fridge from the atomic shop for only 700 atoms
---
It effects anybody wearing legendary armor
---
Brill thanks again and happy holidays!
---
lol. telling people they're wrong and shouldn't be making threads because they don't automatically jump to your conclusion despite you even later admitting it's unlikely isn't a "second reasonable reaction". All I did was point out the flaw with part of your reasoning, you don't need to get all mad here as well. Seems like you have enough threads to reply to as is
---
oh it is awesome XD I play a bloody pa and Emergency Protocols is amazing. I rarely need stimpaks anymore XD
---
This is both hilarious and sadly very close to the truth.
---
It breaks your armors legendary effects, from my understanding nothing will happen to your weapons.
---
Well at least make a tab that says “owned”
---
I didnt tell OP they were wrong. And all those are replied to. Most of them were yesterday, except for one guy that wasnt quite sure how a dictionary worked.
---
In his office, on a shelf behind his desk. It’s hard to spot.
---
Thanks! I will sure give that a try.
---
It must be nice... it took them 7 months to reply to one of my issues...
---
I'm coming back in for the NW Double XP but then I'm going back on the shelf until Wastelanders works.
---
It's hard to be surprised anymore but I have to say, didn't see them pulling off one of if not THE biggest fuck ups they've ever done right before a free trial. That's pretty funny stuff. I've loved this game, just wish they could do better.
---
Not that all those bugs dont bug me but this new bug tops all of that. Everytime we reload? Doesn’t compare.
---
I appear to have misread OP's title.  Bad me.  Withdrawing my comment, thanks for clarifying for me :-)
---
Ok thank you so much. Now i hope it is the right building. Haha.
---
Sadly, sometimes that seems to be the way of things. But if you are getting really bad framerate drops, often a server hop will help. Servers that have been around a lot and have had a lot of nukes, etc. will get really slow. Also, I've found if you have too much stuff in your stash it can slow the game down. My game has been running a lot smoother since I offloaded a bunch of my outfits that I don't use to my second character.
---
The biggest issue I’ve seen with Bethesda is that instead of fixing the issue, they try to remove it altogether. In this case, instead of preventing you from targeting players, only enemies, you simply can’t target anything that isn’t hostile now
---
I feel like the entire nature of a test server in this game requires extensive error checking tools, because just running around until the server crashes isn't really testing its just QA then you have a subset of ppl who will post feedback, most ppl aren't going to actually try to debug the game. then you need ppl actively restarting servers because of crashes.
---
Don't forget people spreading rumors like the trade steal bug that never existed for shits and giggles, crashing servers to dupe their legendaries, finding ways to exploit mutations/reactive plates to kill people who dont want to pvp, or camps with deathtraps/forced rad scrubs/etc
---
A giant Queen Cazador with a flock of other cazadors to help fend the queen!
---
I run Vanguard, and though I've seen people mention that particular trait before, I saw no effect from this bug all through my playtime last night, ~4 hours worth.  Assuming the displayed stats are correct.
---
I spent most of the evening taking out scorchbeasts, with the occasional bop on the head from some of the adds.  I didn't notice anything different, though the SB fights aren't the best indicators for running onto trouble.
---
Im not suggesting that, rather Im suggesting have two sets of servers, and you pick wether you want server A: current main story with scorched and the queen, or server B: wastelanders without scorched but new enemies and bosses, it would just make more sense lore wise, and you'd still have access to your progress on the current setting.
---
That would be cool thank you
---
I don't have that bug lol.. you guys must be unlucky or something lmao
---
bethesda where is the hotfix? do something i know you will read this
---
Happens intermittently, or used to for me. reload the area, walk around, etc. Should reopen.
---
Server hop?
---
Yeap it's work
---
I wonder what that behemoth would do. The SBQ already bugs out so much that half the time she either flies off into the sunset or just stands still for 5 minutes. Not to mention the horrendous server lag. Imagine what would happen if there was an even bigger enemy that had an outpost and other enemies whose location was directly tied to that behemoth
---
It's like our toons are bashing the screws into the rifle with a fucking hammer lol.
---
Wow i have this error since first lunch game lol
---
BGS will gimp bloodied eventually like they gutted Vampire's. Junkie's will become the new OP probably. Vampire weapons suck now except for high cyclic explosive weapons. Even my non explosive 50 cal is super weak and barley keeps up with incoming damage. Same with handmade.
---
The one event reward that showed up for me was the Stings and Things Daily quest. And it rewarded me a “&lt;missing name&gt; “ I guess that’s the possum badge name now lol
---
They do compare. For an unyielding build, this one impacts you the most. As a PA build, the power armor one did, and this one does not so much. As a trader, the friend list bug impacted you the most, and the other not so much. It is just about perspective. It always seems worse when it is directly affecting your own personal gameplay, but to other players, those bugs were just as bad or worse to them than this armor bug.
---
Weird I just saw a post some said there Bolstering armor was breaking. My Unyielding armor was definitely breaking when reloading last night before I just hopped on my melee build to avoid it.
---
Sorry I thought you were also apologizing for not knowing the meaning of something being unplayable and what it means to be hyperbolic.
---
It does then loads right after to an open door.
---
I thought it was obvious when I said a TSE Gauss that I would not be running a bloodied build in PA...
---
Those were the "other ways" I alluded to lol. The Clancy Manor thing is accessible to all levels and might be helpful for some new player. Between that place and the sources in the mire, it's been a really long time since I've had to worry about adhesive.  Early on it was definitely the one thing I couldn't find enough of though.
---
Sometimes it does that when the world hasn't loaded in all the way.  Maybe just give it a few minutes and try again.
---
Star Wars
---
Death Standing 
---
Ashen
---
Fallout4/Skyrim
---
Plenty of games to choose from
---
This issue is actually being blown up a bit. Some people are raging without even playing and trying it and some people are straight up faking.  I would link it (twas deleted) but someone got called out on it trying to show less damage but the pics showed it was psycho on and off.  And a couple others I've seen but dont want to find. And I'm Xbox: me, 2 friends, and 8 randos i ran into yesterday arent having the issue. So it's not a default for everybody like "media" says it is. 
---
Now dont get me wrong. This IS a REAL issue. There is NO EXCUSE for letting it be released like this. Especially after the FO76 history. They are obviously showing they dont give a cinnamon toast fuck about the fans and just do whatever they want knowing the worst that will happen is the usual internet outrage. 
---
And the likely reason they dont care about internet outrage is because they know its ALWAYS exaggerated. Because Bethesda.
---
But again, this issue is terrible and shouldn't have happened. Easily worst update to let this slip.  But you would also think they blew up consoles and murdered puppies the way people are reacting. 
---
And I like OPs post. Great way communicating the problem with facts to get fixed. I'm just tired of the people who jerk off to being angry adding on to shit and lying about stuff needlessly so they can join in on the 'fun'.
---
That’s what I did as well. Needed to be able to wash my hands.
---
I still haven't gotten the opportunity to see a reduced map. Played last night after the update, but every map was 80%+ full.
---
The 'mysterious map fragments' are almost always on top of a built-in cabinet, out in the open, in each of the 6 locations. I just took in game photos of each of the 6 locations however it's more fun if you find them on your own. Some of them are very near the main entrance of the location. Once I found all six, put them on the board, turned on the black light, I saw the numbers on each page. They appear to be different for each player. Anyway, I got the 6-digit vault entrance code by reading each number left to right, top to bottom (just like normal reading).
---
I still have to find all the other missing evidence to put on the main board and I'm still not sure what 6 words / phrases are supposed to mean that appear above the cork board when you turn on the black light.
---
Precisely, I've been carrying shit in my hands since release. So glad I can finally wash up
---
First they'll shrink the maps. Next they'll reduce weapon damage to 10%. Then they'll just remove the mode altogether.
---
That kind of game play sucks for everyone else. Glad they improved things.
---
Not to be the devils advocate or anything but I would much rather have it work the way it does now then the old way.  It was way more of a pain the old way than it is now.
---
Need time for it to load.
---
Not true at all. I hit her with literally one single shell from a non-explosive Shotgun and got loot from her.
---
No, I did not prove your point...You should not even be at the SBQ fight at level 60....Why does everyone on here use the level 50 benchmark for the endgame point....IMHO you should not even be able to join the SBQ until you are level 100... Anyone below minimum level 75-80 is doing absolutely nothing at the SBQ fight,..,..You just do not have the build for it in most cases....My second character was a specific build, shotgunner from day 1, by level 50-60 I could stand in here face and unload 200 rounds into her but that is only because I used my PERK cards very wisely in that build...I have changed my main character like times now at level 400 and rarely go to the SBQ fight with that character.
---
Agreed.
---
Oh...
---
  I thought each of the additional images highlighted the separate items included with the bundle.
---
Yeah calibrated shocks, jet pack arm, bracer arm and medic pump IS MY LIFE
---
All of them got bugged.
---
If this has happened to you before I recommend going into passive mode to prevent this from happening.
---
The only real pain was players. You weren’t trying to hit them. Anything else should be fine outside the Whitesprings. If they simply kept those two entities separate from Vats then everything would work. My point is for Bethesda to actually fix the issue instead of removing it like they normally do. Example would be the cap stashed in the early days before they were containers. Players used them to make caps quick so rather than fixing them or adjusting their spawn they simply removed all of them
---
It hasn't motivated Bethesda to pick things up. Why would you expect any different now?
---
Use pacifist mode
---
How do you go into paasive mode?
---
Normally it does, but there have been a few times where it hasn't included everything pictured.
---
Pacifist mode?
---
I said this on a different post but I appreciate the NW games going a bit quicker now when we have less people.  I think they need to give everyone a shitty pipe rifle and ammo to start with.  I also think having the ring start at max level but also having less time between it constricting would solve a lot of the issues people are having since the patch.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44182/~/how-does-pacifist-mode-work-in-fallout-76%3F
---
I can’t say I didn’t laugh, but it’s a little mean spirited.  
---
No one becomes a video game developer because their parents forced them into that career.  You have to love games.  Despite their lack of perfection, these are human beings with feelings and families tasked with teasing gold out of a filthy mass of wool.  I seriously doubt Fred and Erika are feeling great about their jobs today.  I have a feeling it’s going to be a long day today.  
---
It’s barely been a full 24 hours since the patch.  Let’s hold off personal attacks for at least another day.
---
Go into the game settings sub menu, or end up gameplay and you should find passive mode under the sub heading. You want to turn it 'on'
---
Do you think the corpse is of the Vigilant Citizen whose initials are FS?
---
How so?
---
Passive mode....Geez.....Has no one learned this yet??  go to settings and turn passive mode ON
---
I would like the immortal bug on my quad explosive harpoon gun. I got break if you look at it bug instead. Tried West Tek resetting armor every reload. Just impractical. Playing speed run P.A. tanker until this is fixed. Just gat and LMG everything before they can react and keep moving pick up the lootonce everything is dead  (except legendaries, pick that up first).
---
Well... You can always turn on pacifist and it won't ever happen again. Just sayin'.
---
Fallout 4 was so much more forgiving once you got higher up and literally everything would give you screws when you got the second tier of scrapper
---
It is under settings, go to the map and you will see settings, I believe it is under the game category.
---
I don't understand how anyone can be optimistic about Wastelanders at this point. Of course it's going to be beyond fucked.
---
It's really the only penalty that dying in this survival game has so im personally ok with it this way.
---
Reloading has broken the prefixes of armor.
---
Do you mean outside of consent PvP, like dying at event? In that case sure, why not; it would spice things up.
---
Why?  You suck and got killed and dropped your junk.  It is what would happen in real life.
---
It takes about 30 seconds for the cell to reload. The amount of junk you get really isn't worth it, though
---
 **PvP.** at level 5 switch to pacifist. If you take a workshop you need to server hop afterwards as it can flag you for pvp even when you are in pacifist.
---
**Loot**. When you die you drop all the junk items you were carrying. You can return to your bag if you want to retrieve it, but anybody who stumbles on it can also take it. I recommend you reserve most of your stash space for junk, remember to break everything down before stashing as it will save you a lot of weight.
---
**CAMP**. Nobody can take stuff out of your camp period. If you are flagged for PVP they can break it but you can repair it anyway. Also, enemies will come and harass your base if you have plants or a power generator, or if you build in high traffic areas.
---
**Endgame**. Gear goes up to 50, there is no max level but you stop getting perk points at level 50 so you may want to think about a build and what cards you need using nukadragon or any other build creator. 
---
**Build.** You can build any way you want and still be mostly viable. YOu will have to do some damage cards if you want an easier time doin things like the Scorch Beast Queen, Encryptid Robot, or Raid. But all in all, you can do what you want and change it up later anyway.
---
**Dungeons**. Not like WoW at all, more like small instances that may or may not have a quest related to it. I think we may get more stuff like that when wastelanders drops.
---
**Crafting**. You can make weapons armors and healing items after you find or unlock the plans. Scrapping weapons and armors have a chance to teach you mods you can use with them and these mods coupled with armors and weapons give a great boost (you can also mod legendaries you find as well)
---
**Realms**. You keep all your stuff between servers. You will not have a server to join as you are dropped autofill style into a server with space. The only other type is private servers which are the same map with a total player limit of only 8. On these, your stuff still carries over.
---
**Grind**. Always be grinding for them god rolls XD
---
**Dynamic Events**. Yes, these are world events and are free to fast travel to. Other events can allow anybody to join at any time but are not as big as world events.
---
**Challenge**. Leveling starts fast, I would recommend you follow the main quest and then do side quests. Leveling is not too bad and I can average about 10 levels a day if I focus on it.
---
**Biomes**. You can get perks and legendary armors that let you breathe underwater, as of now there are only a few interesting things in the waters and most of the time the amount of radiation you get is not work the cool factor tbh.
---
DLC. Q1 2020 so probably end of March
---
I hope that helps!
---
I would never waste my time with a non explosive vampire weapon. The explosion counts as a second hit and doubles the healing affect. Same thing happens with radiation from radium's, and ammo returns from explosive railway rifles and harpoons. It's an unintended glitch that gives a huge benefit.
---
I'm hoping that they buff Berserkers.
---
They only care about money though
---
Vats targeting bots at Whitesprings was a pain in the ass before the change. I still get the occasional vats miss hitting the bots with faster fire rate rifles.
---
I should add, I tried to replicate it (the new sub menu), and couldn't.
---
Yeah but you dont leave PA nearly as much as you reload, and its not just unyielding armor from what
---
If the bugs were to switch places, and the PA broke whenever you reload, it would be plenty times worse then freezing when you exit. Then it would compare. 
---
Not to mention there’s barely any real benefits from PA.
---
No lagged and got killed by exploding cars
---
You want to pvp someone that didn’t harm you? Oh yea, that makes sense 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
A free tab, with better free items lol
---
I might be asking too much
---
That big ass tree needs SOMETHING. I bought it and can’t do a thing with it.
---
Yeah but people pay more for that. Us poor people already bought the game, no money in fixing our 2nd world problems lol.
---
abandoned bog town, top of building with elevator access, drop down and loot the old newspaper company for a ton of them!
---
Maybe you should. Think of how festive it would be!
---
You don't drop anything while in events. They changed this some time ago.
---
I'm sure there are things breaking.  What I'm starting to get pissed about is that almost everyone is just parroting what other people have said.  ALL effects are breaking on EVERY reload.  Most people probably haven't even tried to experiment with it, they're just repeating what someone else said.
---
Yes, things are broken, but no, not everything, not for everyone, and it behooves us to be more accurate in our whining.  BGS isn't good at triage (understatement of the year there), and if we feed them inaccurate information, they're likely to miss the mark, again, on the fix.
---
lol you're full of shit, and it shows. It's obvious by most of your comments in the last 24 hours that you don't play this game and are just trying to whine and generate hate toward its creators. xD 
---
Bethesda was big long before Skyrim, with a big hit in FO3 and highly rated games going back to the 90s. Wake up.
---
Thank you, I needed a good laugh today.
---
Scrapper perk needs to be changed to be exactly like Fallout 4 and give rarer materials at a higher rank
---
More or less just to get my junk back ig it’s called revenge bud
---
I'm level 336. Actually probably higher because I have 2 more toons at 150 and 185.
---
You seem to have been offended by my original post.......trust me your 10% damage buff Mutants weapon and your 6-8 minute kill time we're not the players I was referring to. I'm talking about the people who are killing the queen in 90 seconds. I've been playing since Beta and the 30 minute timer on the event used to have a reason.
---
Thing is, the staggered method ensures at least *some* of the playerbase will have a stable time. The system they have now just ensures everyone's gonna have busted as hell patches.
---
Ive run across a 3 * level 100 Supermutant Behemoth in a nuke zone before. It was fun to take down! Fecker runs quick and hits hard! I found it north of the munitions factory after someone got salty in pvp and nuked it.
---
I don't think I've ever found this console.  I'll have to keep an eye peeled for it next time I'm in that area.
---
That's a you problem
---
Engagement is what matters and I can pretty much guarantee that having the customer engaged with going through the market to find the free shit raises the chance of them also impulse buying another item they were on the fence about or unaware of until they happened to see it while browsing.
---
If all they had to do was open the Atom shop and click the "Free" tab sales would drop a lot.
---
Some time ago there was this bug that it just wasn't displayed, but you got everything. Are you sure? Check your inventory and caps before and after completing the next one
---
Not trying to make an overall excuse but isn’t main development of FO76 maintained by a newer team at Bethesda? I think it’s Bethesda Austin, and the only other game they did any amount of work on (looking online) was 2016’s DOOM. This is basically their first major project so I can at least somewhat see why they might have so many issues in development. 
---
I’m just saying this so people understand that this game isn’t (at least currently) being mainly developed by the main Bethesda team (Maryland) to my knowledge. I believe they created the world space and some questlines and then handed it over to the other team.
---
The community is primed and ready to provide Bethesda with a giant pile of chaotic but thourghough QA. It seems like their in-house QA is a couple of interns and a bag of loose screws.
---
Buh bye 
---
Seriously, just go. I don’t get you people that have to post manifestos then rage quit. 
---
No one cares
---
Okay well the first reply under the italicized quote is a person who is actually a player talking about how it's working for them so once again how much more verification do you need?
---
ITT People who don't know the first damn thing about customer engagement or marketing.
---
Basic defense plans, i.e. barriers, cement walls etc, unlock when you take a workshop for the first time.
---
I've been playing since the start and love the game still but I said I will start spending zmoney on the game when it comes out of beta.. Glad I haven't supported any of Bethesda's bad decisions like 1st just disappointing to see majority of the player bases has, I'm not keen in rewarding Bethesda for walking all over me..
---
Could you spoiler/pm the exact location of the map fragments, I’ve found one but am having trouble finding the others in their locations. Thanks!
---
No rage, just voicing my opinion. I'll be back when it's fixed.
---
They are making more money now with fo first and if they want to make more by attracting more people they'll attempt to.
---
But you don't play the game so all you have is an outsider's view based on reddit and games media. People said the game would die quickly after the horrible launch and yet one year later there's a major (potentially disastrous) update on the way and the game has improved overall despite the many problems.
---
I have no particular respect for Bethesda's way of handling this game, mind, but people like you are just parasites feeding on negativity and regurgitating it back at others like that somehow makes you a better person.
---
How do you have this much free time, anyway?
---
Because people keep giving them money.
---
And excusing any number of egregious errors that would have tanked a smaller developer. For all the uproar right now, a week after it's "fixed", there will be numerous posts extolling Bethesda's virtues... "I can't understand the hate they get! Sure they've made a couple of mistakes, but they keep giving us content and support!" or "Hey, those paid utility items are completely optional and you can totally earn atoms in game with ease!"
---
Enough of us have voted with our wallets... in a way that is very detrimental to Bethesda's future.
---
You also noticed that your damage was a bit off?
---
Well, we are the ones that test the game for them right...
---
They cant really expect much from the community. Its really on them to figure out whats wrong. Unfortunately not enough going on down at BGS.
---
just use the keyboard
---
As a solo stealthy type player I 100% support your complaint!
---
You can do the same thing in V94.  There’s usually a cap stash in the side room of the staging area.  I have yet to be so hard up for caps or a couple screws that I’ll spend my time in load screens, but it’s possible.  Granted, the pawn shop has a lot of lead and nothing to fight, so I could see it as a poor mans alternative to visiting Lucky Hole.
---
My f1st sub is on hold until anti cheat gets looked at.
---
OKAY THEN JEEZ
---
Big doesn't really cover that 300 atom tree. I put it down and it's, well, massive. Like town center massive.
---
Too bad it's in a garbage can and unlit.
---
Smart move. Did that many months ago. Haven't regretted it.
---
Hope the wait is worth it though.
---
Yeah, after reloading my Bloodied lmg my damage dropped by about 30%. I checked all my chems and bobble head to make sure everything was still active which they were. I switched to my Bloodied fire rate 50cal and noticed the same thing.
---
"We're delaying Wastelanders to make sure it meets our expectations of quality" 
---
Announces over 30 days ago that this bug is going to be fixed and this is the steaming pile that is delivered. Doesn't make me feel good about /u/Bethesdagamestudios definition of quality. I think we should start making bets with Bethesda "I bet you can't drop a decent patch without a game breaking bug. If you do ill buy 100.00 worth of Atoms. If you don't you owe me 2 years of 1st for free"
---
It's an old bug but it checks out.  You got everything including your xp and scrip it's just bugged and sometimes doesnt tell you what you got.
---
...might go for pre-war West Virginia as well...
---
Better late than never I guess.
---
Correction : You are not supposed to drop loot at events, but it still happens. I've dropped loot on death many times at events after that update, and there is no way to know when it will do that.
---
How much free time you got to follow my comments over the last 24 hours? Oh that's right, enough time to dump into Fallout 76.
---
Bethesda: No
---
What year is that whine?
---
Well... Finally the poor and rich can be reunited in the wasteland!!! Neither class of people will stand for this!!!
---
You can get the Responders Police uniform and Cop cap by doing the “patrol” quest line while at the Morgantown Airport. I tried going back through with my lvl 104 character and it wouldn’t let me do it a second time since I had already completed it, so I had to made a new character to get the Responders Paramedic outfit and Police outfit as part of the starting Responders quests.
---
Did they really say they fixed the Fast Travel bug?  I don't remember them saying that, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
---
Keep in mind that what they *usually* say is not "We fixed [x]."  It's usually "We fixed a bug that can lead to [x]."  Sometimes in code, different root causes produce the same result.  A symptom that we experience while playing might come from multiple different things going wrong.
---
Not that I'm excusing their terrible QA testing, but I don't count that as a lie.  If four different things can lead to the miniguns firing infinitely and they patch one of them, that doesn't mean that they've promised you'll never hear a minigun firing infinitely again.  It means they've nailed down one cause, patched that one, and hoped for the best.

---
They've said they're going to release an update "as soon as possible" for it.  This would suggest, to me, that it's a hotfix coming sometime this week.  It's also distinct from the "We're investigating" language they often use for something that isn't.
---
I just think ill grow to hate it if I stay here any longer.

And yet here you are ? 😉

I know I sound stupid but where is that? I've got 1800 hours and still can't remember where a damn thing is, your an angel👼

Thanks for the response, i didnt see many complains about this, maybe not that many people use primed weapons. I was just about to reroll to melee, but how is it bugging out if you use a melee weapon with uny gear?

I also spend cash on the Atom Shop and FO 1st but if the bugs continue, I'm not going to stick around... 😔

Ballistic
---
Alright thanks. I just wanted to know for future reference.
---
Whenever I complete an event, it just disappears, no  “event complete” screen.  Sometimes I get the rewards, most of the time I don’t.
---
Also, getting “Event Failed” at the end of an event when I clearly have not...so that’s frustrating.
---
As for other things, Experienced same bugs as everyone else basically
---
And I missed this how? I mean, I just dumped 490 atoms on the Arktos fridge because, hey, it was on sale.
---
Seriously. This game is **just like real life**, OP.

yeah, that one can be a bear to find, you gotta go through the cafeteria to get to the area that its in

I haven't played yet but i want to test out the smaller map. Moving bush to bush for 20 minutes can get boring, pushing everyone in a smaller circle in the beginning could be fun.

Whats happened to Bethesda since Fallout 76 came out is just the saddest story in the Video Game industry imo. They were the cool kids who could do no wrong in my eyes and today they are the greediest motherfuckers in existence who's number 1 priority is to gang rape their customer's wallets. Fuck them and the vertibird they rode in on.
---
&gt;Enough of us have voted with our wallets... in a way that is very detrimental to Bethesda's future.
---
We really have no idea of the stats regarding player base, $ spend, people leaving returning, having a holiday. It is just guessing to fit one's narrative.
---
Ok thanks will keep looking. What about Meat, thats the other one I can’t find..
---
This. Took me weeks to find the Red Rocket Jumpsuit, from the RR pack, so I could NW favorite it.
---
they wont hotfix. the only thing they hotfix is exploits and that is sometimes.lol
---
Yes. But being reasonable is counter to the prevailing narrative. 
---
One of the points of this project was to develop a second team that could work on a different IP... Fallout 5 while Maryland is doing ES6 and the like. 
---
Easier to shout insults and demand they all be fired I guess.
---
That is the least of the issues. Most people rely on armor effects to deal damage.
---
So nothing happened... Nice thx for including that.
---
If I come a cross a dead body in the street I should be able to loot the corpse without it coming back to fight.
---
Dnlamn... Did you work to be this gay?

Git Good, don't die.

Time to dump some more! - Todd Howard
---
Reddit is a great place to find ragey circle jerks lol.
---
It’s a 2018 whine.
---
I haven't seen much said about invincible enemies, so I'm glad you brought it up. They're all over. There were 3 scorched just standing around the SBQ fight that everybody would try to take down then give up on, last night. Not a big deal since they aren't doing damage, but just about everyone there wasted a magazine trying to kill 'em.
---
No...one....cares....   and if you quit, wtf are you still on this sub? Trolling?
---
You can take it and then leave, if you absolutely have to have the plans. Nothing makes you stay, except stubbornness.
---
Don't tell him... Next he's gonna threatten cod devs. Tooooi Mich pvp. Lol fuck these queers
---
Correct. Just like I stated right off the bat in the original comment you replied to.
---
Yet everyone is calling for a test server...
---
The reason is that no matter how much BGS tries to test things, there are only a *very* small number of people working there, and most of them have other jobs (like actually fixing the code).  If they have more than a few people actually play testing the patches, I'd be pretty surprised.
---
If they open up a test server and let people fart around on it (especially if they actually target the activity by explaining *in detail* what they're changing), there would be quite a number of people willing to help out and look for things that got broken.
---
Sorry I killed here with a limb damage rolling pin, her fault.
---
Surfs up dude! Gnarly wipeout for unyielders.
---
The thing is these bugs were common in prior games, heck the Lever Action Rifle reload bug is still in Fallout 4 despite quarterly updates for creation club. Bethesda killed the golden goose(modding) because they wanted to bleed the fallout community dry and now we are in this situation.
---
Is that what the plan is supposed to be? I figured the main team would still be making any numerical fallout games or elder scrolls games while this team might make the spinoffs
---
You just don't have a relevant build.
---
Chill out will you? He's probably just keeping an eye on things, like I will be.
---
You on XBox? There's too many great games on Game Pass right now for me to list. There's plenty out there.
---
Yeeeeee
---
I think it also affects power armor effects :(
---
Main metric they watch is uninstall numbers, a player who uninstalls doesn't normally reinstall unless they have a proper incentive.
---
Why? Any law you know of that stops him?
---
Its actually a chinese flag if ya look closer at it
---
I guess you have a hard time reading also...It says 6-8 people in less than 3 minutes, usually less than 2 minutes.  Everyone has their own way of doing things...IMO that event is the current endgame, the highest level and hardest kill.  It is a high level event, should be at least 100 or above to join, I would even go as low as 75 if the system could some how gauge your damage.  And your smart comment about my 10% buff is funny....That 50 cal puts out 312 base DMG with a high fire rate...It is absolutely built for SBQ fight, especially since that character is only level 160.   My bloodied level 400 and BE Laser rifle absolutely melts her meter but that damn gun breaks all the time.  Good discussion and not trying to be rude but we have different views....I did the grind and launched the first nuke at about level 80 or so....Never went Far East  until way later when I could handle things easier.....Now a days they are just trying to level up ASAP and going to the SBQ for the EXP skipping all of the questlines in between...Peace!!
---
New players are ther least impacted by that.
---
If you unequip and reequip your armor it fixes it temporarily. From my testings it happens almost all the time when I fast travel, sometimes when I swap weapons. I just make sure that I re equip everything everytime I fast travel or enter into a cell, annoying as all hell though, trying to find emergency protocol plans for my ultracite armor lol
---
I can't help but shake the feeling that this is the game dying. It's not even going to make it to Wastelanders. And I don't think these issues have continually arisen over the past year because they've got so many people working on Wastelanders, either. We're over a year in and this is the worst 76 has ever been and I've played since BETA. Beth isn't up to the task, plain and simple.
---
I want that fridge does, it have Christmas skins?
---
&gt;!The General ;) !&lt;
---
They are when users can fix their games with mods post launch.
---
Yep, you die and I will take your stuff
---
Yeah but where in there? :)
---
Yeah.
---
I think its normal and healthy to take  breaks, this is my primary game but ill take a week or two if feeling burned out on it to scratch my rts or turn based itch (looking at you stellaris, frost punk, xcoms, wasteland 2, div os 2).
---
Gl man!
---
Possiblly, given that's what they have  been doing this last year. Unless you count the aggressive money grabbing
---
Been open a long time..
---
My body is ready.
---
This seems to happen randomly with several mods since the November Patch.
---
It's just different ways of lying.
---
That may well be true. Though whether or not you like a game should be based on the facts of the matter. Seems like you're starting to realise a lot of the hate (though not all) is entirely based on facts &amp; warranted.
---
I was just there and didn't start a quest. How do you get it to start
---
&gt;!In the bar\\dining area!&lt;
---
I appreciate this post simply because it acknowledges the assholes in the game instead of trying to prop up the myth that this is the nicest community ever.
---
This kind of thing is seriously on the rise in my recent experience.
---
You can do a single thing about it. There is a box in your Camp that can hold up to 800lbs of your precious junk and an infinite capacity box that you can pay for. Problem solved
---
Aaaah found it thanks! Now just the Teach one
---
It directly impacts my main play style.
---
Armor: 4 x Unyielding 1 x Chameleon
---
Main weapon. Bloodied Handmade no explosive effect. Stinging Mag helps but having to re equip armor each reload is onerous.
---
I have moved to melee until a fix is released.
---
You forgot how they broke heavy weapon firing and still have not fixed it months later.
---
Yes but the repair kits anyone can buy. They're not exclusive to 1st members.
---
2 wrongs don't make a right. Nerfing two-shot was a positive change.
---
Bethesda should just fix their shit.
---
 It directly impacts my main play style.
---
I recently started a new character and got a sweet 3* boxing glove. So I go to craft/scrap a few to learn the couple of mods. 
---
Leather? Makes sense. 
---
Cloth? Makes sense. 
---
3 screws? Wait what? Why am I needing 3 screws to make an unmodded basic bixing glove?! (And when you scrap them, you only get leather and cloth back.) WTF?
---
Sorry it effects you. I feel your pain.  Have an internet hug. Hopefully someone is working today to fix this then fire the lazy shmuck that let this happen.
---
It depends. If the literal shell, you know- the thing that weighs like a thousand+ kilograms, fell onto a roach, the roach would suffer the equivalent of being crushed by a shoe x 1000. It would die. I'd assume, and I'm no scientist, but the immediate release of heat and radiation would disintegrate anything, from an elephant to a roach (baring in mind that the thermal pulse created by a nuke is something in the tens of thousands/thousands of degrees Celsius). Radiation though, is a tricky subject. You see, when you die in an atomic blast, you die from the pure amount of heat. Radiation, however, is a post detonation killer. If a nuke landed close enough to a cockroach to soak it in radiation, but far enough from it to fry it to death with heat, then chances are it'd just carry on with its day. If you were at the same distance, then you'd die of cancer shortly afterwards.
---
Isnt two shot bugged also right now? Might be wrong but heard the 2nd shot sometimes does 1% of dmg
---
But yes i agree it does need abit of a buff, the fact both shots are 25% damage is kinda meh, especially since the accuracy of the 2nd bullet is ass...
---
Oh good, more exploits.....
---
Please this, I want to have nightmares.
---
Good luck with that.  I want them to make TSEs great again permanently.
---
Tbh most of the people I take junk from wouldnt stand a chance at killing me.
---
I went to the shop but I can't interact with the door. How do I get in?
---
..and a holotape deck.
---
Bethesda is a big boy company, they don't need you to tell them how to test their patches!
---
+karma isn't a reddit wide thing, it is only specific to the market subreddit. If you want to give reddit karma you press the upvote arrow under the comment
---
consider it a lesson learned and use pacifist mode unless you actually want to pvp.  
---
Additionally stay out of workshops unless again, you want to pvp as pacifist mode won't protect you in those cases.
---
No, it's not.  I think if you delve into things they've said this about in the past, they've been consistent about prompt fixes.
---
Not that I expect you to do that, since it's so cathartic to just be *angry* at something.
---
The level 35 is killing your damage for the lever
---
That was my thought exactly, haha. Just grabbing it by the barrel and wildly swinging it into a rock until its just pieces everywhere. Thats why we only sometimes learn mods, because occasionally a piece survives the "hacking and wacking and smacking."
---
With armor, weapons and prime status rn I wouldn't
---
It took them over a year to fix a bug from beta, let alone many months to change a lightbulb, I expect this bug to take 2 years to fix and its fix to break living.
---
Liberty prime prototype, a 1/3 scale proof of concept that tosses mininukes and at low health activates a stealth shield that couldn't be scaled up for the final version.
---
They didn't even go far enough with the nerf.
---
Never spent a single dollar on atoms/1st until they start proving they care about their players. If people wanna worship bethesda and throw them money even after they dissapointed us countless of times thats fine but dont expect any change.
---
Or replace them with nails, at least that way you can give the explanation that they got bend when pulling out
---
Perhaps.
---
But my narrative, such as it is, would be that giving Bethesda ANY MONEY after this fairly disastrous launch and year of play is a great disservice to them. Yes, they are treating us like like wallets with legs, giving far higher priority to color shifted asset flips on the Atomic Shop than anything more than the most paltry of post launch content... but we MIGHT have the power to dissuade them from this f2p mobile gaming style of service.
---
it’s time consuming but useful for a noob for a hot sec. chill
---
I've been encountering similar issues in the Silos since the November patch, I killed 22 Assaultrons during launch Prep on one last week, but have had others with only a couple of Eyebots.
---
Unless they fixed it, a 2 shot gun is wildly inaccurate. So the second projectile probably misses. With only 1 Tank Killer you are not really getting through to heavily armoured opponents, like Muties.
---
Why do you care Bro, calm down👍
---
OP I love your idea but the vast majority of camp visitors don't even ask before opening doors or sleeping on your bed!
---
Not sure what the deal was exactly but I spawned in with my carry weight in my full unyielding set being much lower even with my normal rads and health at about 30%. I think I had a combat rifle equipped from my last play session but it was holstered so I know I hadn't reloaded. I know that reloading while in excavator also temporarily drops my carry weight every time. I'll test it out again this evening and see if it's consistent.
---
"No. Your move, chump!"
---
Yes. And how many of those have they actually fixed?
---
When I went it just opens, like u see in the video, maybe it hadn’t loaded in yet? Sometimes if I go too quickly it’s still boarded up 😊
---
Thank you!  Yeah this is sounding like what I wanted out of FO4. No mac level so I can continue leveling. Bunch of useful crafting. Lots of exploration and no roll in the keyboard easy mode. Some games make the content so easy it's hard to enjoy it. I think wastelanders sounds awesome and cant wait.
---
Why are you having such a temper tantrum, why do you care 😉
---
A clean dweller is a happy dweller. *thumbs up pose*
---
Just glad I am a food build for once
---
Is the office you can get to from the roof?
---
I go back and forth with quests. Sometimes I want that lore/story to push me forward but always want ths option to break off and explore but more importantly find something meaningful.
---
I removed all my unyielding armor yesterday and switch to my pvp gear. I had to re-equip my chameleon armor piece every time I reloaded while in a big pvp battle so I am right there with you.
---
&gt;it would serve as a quick fix
---
quick maybe, but not a fix
---
Thanks helps greatly, didn't want exact locations just a shove in the right direction, I've got all the evidence on the main board but haven't had time to read through it all yet and the phrases are another mystery all together
---
The other two master rifleman and all 3 tank killer are essential for max damage. I also run 1 adrenaline and 3 bloody mess. Not having those plus a lower level weapon is what's killing your damage
---
Since patch 16 i've been finishing missions and getting no rewards, makes playing kinda pointless.
---
I have submitted a ticket, will update if/when i get a response.
---
I've never seen a community manager say anything remotely close to any of those things. Ease up on the hyperbole bud, there's plenty of valid criticisms to make.
---
A communist liberty prime alike robot broken prototype, with strangler hearts on it. I know, thats kind of specific, but could also be realy cool. It could drop plans for an unique gun: its head, which would be a reskined laser gatling with unique effects on it.
---
Let’s not forget the waves of mole miners for Uranium Fever. Seems as if there are a lot more and it’s slowing the extraction process.
---
There is nothing funny about a super  rich man asking for your food.
---
100%. Like how Microsoft did with Sea of Thieves and there Insider Program. 
---
Was gonna mention that too, not a lot of man hours working on this game. I imagine little skits in my head of what goes on a BGS that make me laugh, makes it a little harder to be mad over it.
---
You type like a Super Mutant speaks. Please shut up.
---
Also a lot of enemies have much lower resistance to energy weapons than physical ones. That could play a big part too
---
The tesla rifle does count as a rifle, it just deals energy damage. There are no separate damage perks for laser/plasma/tesla rifles. Two shot weapons are not very accurate and fire two projectiles, maybe only one did actually hit the target, or it had higher DR than ER. Alternatively, it might have dealt more total damage, but the numbers shown are per projectile, similarly to shotguns.
---
Scrapbox got fixed.  It doesn't eat items anymore.
---
The bulk scrapping problem wasn't returned to how it was, which would have been the preferable solution, but it didn't auto-scrap bulk anymore either.
---
Any other questions?
---
So it has that MMO loop I love. Explore. Harvest. Craft. Rinse. Repeat. So I can kinda make my own agenda of what I want to do day to day knowing over time I will get better/stronger.
---
I dont mind PvP. I just suck at it lol. So having the ability to do it on my own terms in a plus.
---
*commits die
---
They downvoted you and tell you the bugs are game breaking. True is: the bugs are serious and Bethesda need fix this, but they only are game breaking to the cookie cutters.
---
I will try give you a few answers.
---
-pvp only activates when you fire back and when take a workshop (a tooltip warning prompts every time you take a workshop).
---
-when you are killed you will drop all your junk (needed to craft). When no in PvP you will probably recover it (a quest will mark the loot bag for you).
---
-you can drop your junk safely in your personal stash. (there are containers in the world and you can build one in the workshops and in your base).
---
-your base is transported with you on login. Your thighs are safe in your stash. You can have resource extractors, a garden and water purifiers. That elements have separate containers and everyone can collect the resources. You can lock them, but generally is not a problem.
---
-this is my favorite build planner: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/
---
-the game is easy (kind of... It's complicated)
---
-it has events (a la dolmes).
---
-it has dungeons and hard content for a 4 member party.
---
-the servers are limited to 24 players. Your character, inventory and camp are shared in all servers. You can have 5 characters.
---
-the game dont have matchmaking.
---
-if you play with the meta, all can be one shooted (or killed under one minute). In order to obtain that gear you need farm mindlessly. It feels chessy, I don't liked.
---
-if you play with your own build the pve game is challenging and fun but PvP it's impossible. Although there a mode (nuclear winter) with balanced PvP.
---
-the quest are best played solo. The events are fun with a party (but also are enjoyable solo).
---
-there are zones with different ecosystem and according to your level but all the map is open. They are: Forest(East, level 1-15), Toxic Valley (Northeast, lv 15-25), Ash Heap (southeast, lv 25-35), Savage Divide (center, north and south, lv 15-50+), the Mire (Northwest, 50+), cranberry bog (southwest, 50+).
---
-there are not max level. You collect all perk points at level 50, but you continue get perk cards every level (or Respec). Typically a build is ready on level 75. You can Respec, but if you're high level it's slow.
---
-with a character, I personally suggest get all quest done before move to the next zone. Also, use gear according to the area (for example, gear level 10 for the Forest) in order to not depend on high end gear and have good control, VATS technique, and practice the use of favorites.
---
-with others characters only do events, nuclear winter and kill enemies for level up in order to test different builds.
---
-I think there are 3 endgame activities: build a gorgeous camp and a cool character (doing the challenges in order to get premium currency-atoms), farming legendaries for PvP (high end gear), and farming the pve content (raids, badgets, recipes, etc... for the completionist).
---
Good point
---
Poor baby.... No game breaking for you?so sad😦
---
Edit: ps4
---
They’ll be coming for your nice things next.
---
Starts December 12th
---
It is still an exploit. It doesn't matter who it is useful to.
---
I actually do have a hard time reading..... because  Your posts just look like giant globs of text. Punctuation is helpful.
---
The game itself recommends that you have 8 players level 50 or higher and has a 30 minute timer to complete the event. Currently it takes longer to complete the Campfire Takes event.
---
Now if we look into the math involved in the legendary system we would find that, without duping, there shouldn't be more than a few players running around with OP weapons. I've got over 3,000 hours in the game and just finally rolled an OP weapon. Game developers designed the queen fight with the idea that everyone would have average weapons.....this is why 9 months ago you didn't see the queen being killed in 90 seconds other than when people were stacking bobbleheads with duped DCG.
---
You can argue until you're blue in the face but it's undeniable that duping has had a major impact on the balance of the game. The game is flooded with dupes.
---
I noticed it only happens if I switch my perk cards out before using bench. Backing out and starting over again will eliminate level menu and if you use the lvl menu it’ll use mats and not give you the mod.
---
Oh my you poor cunt.   How will you play?
---
One string would take your whole budget
---
I like some of this idea. 
---
Up the cost for legendary purveyor items and give us a chance to choose a primary effect.  Not the weapon, just the primary effect. 
---
For example:
---
Normal random items remain the same (3\* weapon at 100 for instance)
---
Specific Prefix desired raises the cost to 500.  Dont make this available after 1 day of farming.  If you want a specific prefix, you should have to pay for it.'
---
5x's the cost gets you a specific prefix, you only get to pick the prefix, not the other attributes, so they can keep the randomness intact.  You are still at the whim of mama murg for the weapon type and major and minor effects.  But this would allow people to at least get something they could use vs scrip bait which is what most purveyor weapons end up being.
---
So only the Fallout 1st thing was solved.
---
And bulking was not solved. A work around was given.
---
And seriously, that two out of do you know how many broken stuff? I said that "Any other questions" like these were literally the only bugs in the game. Lol.
---
What is you main most fun weapon?
---
Very helpful. Thank you. Cant wait to start and take my time slow like. Is there anything to do in the vault at the start.. like FO3? Or after character create I'm outside?
---
Man you should run for office. Plenty of people think .... Something else is out to get them.
---
Bethesda: "You can't use the Atom Shop!? We will get on it right now!"
---
You're very welcome.  If you're on PC I highly recommend you consider installing two quality of life Mods: 
---
* Perk Card Loadouts (allows you to configure and save up to twelve Perk Card  loadouts and hotkey them in the perk screen, so you can have switch you most common cards at a touch)
---
* Text Chat Mod.   This allows you to speak through text Chat globally with anyone else who also has the mod.  It's an exceptionally useful tool that I am amazed Beth still hasn't implemented.
---
This post is unintelligible af. Hopefully Bethesda will fix you soon, you seem pretty broken.
---
maybe?  didn't know about that - but if you can access the top floor, then yes - where the speaker's office is
---
Unyielding\*
---
Poor baby
---
I get what you are saying but this patch has absolutely broken the game.....everything is broken
---
Shills gonna shill
---
Deleting this cos there's too much negativity.
---
Oh so sry... Enough of my language.. on to White boys who cry
---
Speaker? At the HS?
---
A lot of questions here. Best to learn as you go. 
---
If you're on PC and need a group to run with, we can get you up to speed. 
---
The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter https://imgur.com/gallery/SbFabp1
---
Really? I didn't know that the level lowered damage. I figured it was all about the damage number. That sucks. 
---
Thank you.
---
They go up 7PM us east coast time
---
Good points.
---
Are you a sneaky boy or no?  
---
Definitely look for a level 50 weapon. I prefer Furious Handmade with +10% damage while aiming. Dealing with level 68 super mutants I hit anywhere from 150 to up to 700 (sneak, head shot, adrenaline). But typically in the 100-200s, *thats* with commando though. Rifleman doesn't hit a whole lot higher though, I switch back and forth depending on how Im feeling.  
---
I run your typical rifleman perks with 3 sneak and carry weight perks.
---
I played for a few hours this afternoon and didn’t have any issues. But that was on a private world. I did do several events in that world and the rewards didn’t proc. So that’s a little frustrating
---
If I remember correctly, you redeem them at MODUS in the bunker and it should trigger the" I am become death quest" upon completion.
---
Its rough, its been this way the whole time. 
---
Fundamental parts of the game are still very much broken that most people don't even notice or realize, especially around perks.
---
Thank you. This makes sense. PvP not as bad as I imagined. I'm definitely not cookie cutter and play games like this blind (no lookups unless seriously stuck) to see how far I can go just on in game mettle.
---
Your language sucks.  You need to go back to grammar school and learn how words are supposed to fit together in a sentance.
---
Ah. I didn't think of that. They are usually right around 60 damage a piece. I have damage numbers turned on.
---
what is it I'm looking for here? still kinda confused
---
I usually drop stimpacks, Rad away, quality food, pure water basically anything a player will need eventually. I especially drop things for anyone doing a mission w me or if they’re low level. Items? I don’t accept weapons or armor because I will easily become over-encumbered. 
---
I’m level 74 soooo close to my level 76 goal haha
---
The whole game was "outsourced" to a 3rd tier failing studio ZeniMax had sitting around burning money
---
FO76 isn't being run by Bethesda Maryland, the people everyone thinks of when they think Bethesda, it's being run by Bethesda Austin, who were formerly called Battlecry Studios.
---
Considering FO76 to be a "Bethesda" game is like thinking ME:Andromeda was a "Bioware" game.
---
If Todd Howard and Bethesda proper cared though, Austin would have been publicly obliterated before launching this disaster and the game put under the main studios care to salvage the IP.
---
Thanks. Should have made that a question
---
 What are some mods or addons people use. Will mark these.
---
Pn PS4 too
---
Oh so sorry
---
Yeah but I don't want to be firing a gun made with nails... Personally I prefer to know my gun won't break unexpectedly
---
Yes. PC master race here :-)
---
Bethesda is like that student in highschool physics that didn't really participate in the group activity with you but rode along to a passing grade and then somehow through charisma and personal relationships in life managed to land in a Executive level leadership position and makes every aspect of your job harder through poor discussions, lack of knowledge, and neglect.
---
A scorched Beast King.
---
You kill his Missus and he Spawns pissed,really,really pissed ,twice the Size of his Queen,10 times the Bullet Sponge.
---
It is a random Spawn and he takes out one of the players Camps who killed his wifey.
---
And if he is not killed,he keeps attacking Camps until he is killed.
---
Nah. I use power armor. 
---
I can craft the handmades and I use one of those also. I just have multiple rifles because of ammo.
---
Na whats cringy is your the type of guy to abuse godmode and think its cool.
---
Lmao no skill
---
It's not a placeholder, it's a monetized tech demo
---
Bethesda/ZeniMax was paying Battlecry to overhaul the engine to be server based and decided to cash in on the Fallout IP to pay for some of the overhead.
---
No... the biggest, A-1 + thing they need to do is \*\*stop being so fucking cheap and hire actual beta testers\*\*.
---
The broken things in this update show that they did \*literally\* NO testing of this update. All the major ones could be found in less than an hour of normal play.
---
This is \*bullshit\*. Pure and simple.
---
Their development process is fundamentally broken. 
---
So many parts of the game are fundamentally broken. 
---
Until they realize and accept this, and really dig in to fix things, I totally agree that a Test Server won't matter.
---
Word of Todd is they want to be able to handle multiple large projects at once. According to the Making Of video that came out after the initial announcement of FO76.
---
I’ve noticed the ricochet bug has made a return when enemies are close with explosive weapons or it’ll clip through them.
---
Or to get more players to purchase?
---
An elipsis is 3 periods in a row not 2. 
---
The sentance fragment after your failed elipsis should read "someone is out to get them", and you should have omitted the elipsis for a competently written statement.
---
You used too many unnecessary words.
---
I'm on mobile atm, but when I get back I will collect a "Top Mod Picks" list for you.
---
I've certainly seen more crashes since the patch. Mostly during accesses of inventory items like stimpacks and radaways, but it seems like it's when I get them out of the Pipboy inventory screen. Quick wheel accesses aren't a culprit for me.   
---
Have had two server disconnects in last night's session as well.
---
Aaand downvotes, just for saying that you might not stick around.
---
Jesus, the shills are really sensitive.
---
A huge wendigo would be nutz
---
Dude, if my code's signature is no longer useful for your code, it's called a breaking change, and it's supposed to be tested and documented beforehand.
---
We're not talking about a rewrite of the physic engine, or the implementation of a whole new arc of quests here. We're talking about a fix on a very basic affix : augment the character's resistance while state "reloading" is true. That should NOT, in any way, affect the affixes of any other piece of equipment, let aside ALL OF THEM at once.
---
They're not "moving on" because nobody ever moved to it in the first place. The whole game is a busy work project for a failing studio ZeniMax had sitting around doing nothing else important.
---
is broken Search?
---
Yes.
---
How about you mod in what you want.. see faggots complain about 3* but no one... I mean no one has reported that 1* drop  3*.
---
Go fuck your special self.
---
Im sure i placed mine just fine i do not own the scrapbot
---
yes, why do you ask, you know it is, according to your post history anyway
---
I want to do PvP but i want to know if it is broken like unyielding
---
Maybe this is how they plan to reimplement the karma system?
---
Interesting.  I didn’t have the resource ya until I added it.  I own 3 accounts too.  
---
What platform are you on?
---
It most likely is just a standard fridge with different appearance.
---
Starting with your bitchy post
---
Ohso smarter.. should be gov of land
---
oh sorry, thought you were referencing the senator one
---
maybe?  didn't know there was a roof entrance to the school either... but you gotta go the long way around through the cafeteria into an area that only has like 3 rooms in it, its on the teacher's desk
---
This is a very well done video. I remember all these things happening when I was playing last year. It really puts things into context. The entire game is made to revolve around the Atom Store and to push microtransactions.
---
Wtf?
---
Me too, brother. Me too
---
I have a BE Laser Rifle and a TSE Gauss rifle that I received from drops about a year ago.  I use an unstoppable monster which is from a survival event completion which I would consider my most OP weapon I use.  I use a damn boxing glove with the spiked mod that does 1200 base damage with one star...  What do you consider OP?  I can get like 5-8k damage with my monster if I want but it is a standard weapon widely available in the game.  I get what you are saying about duping but there are some out here that have never duped and never bought a duped weapon (that I know of) and you are trying to say that is unfair because a level 60 is fighting in the endgame event.
---
Yeah you go through the cafeteria, there’s a locked door, you go up the stairs (they lead to the roof) and then it’s a office with a red door?
---
I've gotten more disconnects today than I usually get in a week.  (XBox)
---
I've noticed lag on Xbox the last few days, before the patch yesterday. Really noticeable when in crafting menus, took me ages to craft ammo, you can see your character stuttering and glitching in the background. Seems fine in Vendor menu etc. I've just been gathering materials and crafting, not really took on any mobs.
---
Maybe something is wrong with my xbox?  It's a one S, and it's a few years old, but doesn't seem to suffer in any other circumstances.  When I play in the vault or there are more than one or two enemies around, I literally can't play. The screen will freeze for several seconds and I'll be dead.  I'm sad that it's so bad :(
---
Honestly, situations like this are the *real* reason why "convenience" items as microtransactions aren't a good idea. I'm not even saying that Bethesda intentionally broke durability, but just the fact that they have an incentive to do so erodes a lot of trust in them.
---
I am trying to teach you how to write proper english statements. 
---
You misused the elipsis again, immediately after a grammar lesson. 
---
And yes,  I am smarter than you.  I know how to use an elipsis.
---
Ngl I was clearing a hotel with another player and while he went upstairs to finish off the remaining enemies I found a front desk bell... and proceeded to ding ding ding ding ding exactly 76 times. I could hear him from the floors above walking around trying to figure out where it was coming from until he stood by me for the last 10 dings. It was immensely satisfying.
---
Thought had crossed my mind.
---
I had the worst day of gaming yet on 76 day before yesterday 
---
1.Nuke Run,Blue screen, crashed on the second set of Main frame Cores.
---
2.Not deterred,tried again,crashed on the Pipe fixing.
---
3. Finally completed the Nuke run,launched a Nuke,game crashed.
---
4.Crashed at the Cottages in Whitespring.
---
5 Crashed at the Stash Box Whiespring Station.
---
Give up logged off. Didn't even bother logging in yesterday after reading the comments on here.
---
If exploding cars can kill you, you probably have very little chance of defeating an actual player.
---
ahh sounds right then
---
I think you have it set to junk OP
---
Hmmm keeps coming up empty :(
---
What about instead of +250 DR we get, "Apply Active Camouflage while Reloading".  For me stealth boys have never had a problem working, same as the chameleon effect.  This would still give us a bonus while we reload, but instead of reducing incoming damage we get partial invisibility to try to loose what ever we are fighting.  Seeing as they were able to change stealth boys from being able to fire while cloaked, to firing breaking the cloak, this is an effect they seem to be able to edit "easily enough".
---
LOL indeed! for now I am OP! hehe I am sure that will get patched out asap lol.
---
I feel like the investors need to be strapped to a chair and forced to grind 100 lvls on each platform before they get to decide how to use developer time.
---
What?
---
The first thing to do is fix the worst bugs
---
They should. It's funny how the original nerd was intended as balance but now we basically have no PVP anymore, everyone has duped God roll weapons, and I haven't seen the queen survive for longer than 3 minutes in a long time.
---
I'd say balance in this game is pretty much fucked......bring back explosive energy weapons also.
---
Not quite.
---
What system are you on? I have a 1* junkies lever I can mod out for you. Get 5 addictions going and you'll be kicking ass and taking names. I'm on xbox btw.
---
Learn to aim like people do in a majority of shooting games and stop relying on auto-aim.
---
yes doctor, can i get some of what this user is on?
---
Could be an ancient you made for toddlers.... But no... Someone else is a fault.
---
Idk I think they kinda went overkill on it. But then they were incapable to stop duping so game balance ended up fucked anyhow.
---
A dude can hope, damn it! But you are probably right.
---
Thank you. I greatly appreciate those words!
---
Ok so I just went back to put in some more clues and I also can’t get it, Maybe they have locked it again? Noooooo I was having so much fun lol
---
100% down!

The charleston building has been like that for me on X1.  Every time i go in there, its at least 12-15  (or more but its alot) level 62 Scorched Ghouls with some lower levels scattered in.  
---
Fort Defiance was like that as well, add a radiated wendingo for added fun.
---
My gatling plasma helps mow them down.  Level 40 with standard equipment.
---
Doesn't appear to be referring to the CMs (who are nearly silent except perhaps to compliment a camp build) but the overly enthusiastic players claiming that it's just haters who don't actually play the game who would ever complain.
---
It's winter and we need a dumpster fire to keep us warm.
---
Check and mate, atheist.
---
Baldurs Gate / 2 ...
---
We played several last night. It's a very different experience.
---
The reduced map seems random. There are situations where 32 players will spawn in a part of the map that cannot provide 32 loot crates, leaving some players running around with nothing, other players running around with grenade launchers/handmades/subbies/etc, and some players running around with like... Quick Stairs. There was at least one case when one player ended up with a pipe pistol, while another player had the ammo.
---
It can be a fun experience. We had a couple of rounds where only 1 or 2 of us could gear up, so the other 3 or 4 would act as bullet shields/distractions while the 1 or 2 with gear confiscated additional gear from enemy players who no longer needed it. That's great for people like you and me; we can count on the crews we run with to work as a team. It's hell for the other 90% of the player base.
---
Because there's no live vote tracking system to give you any idea of which map will be selected AND because the server population can hop above or below the 32-33 small/large map threshold in the blink of an eye, you SHOULD be given 15-25 seconds to see which map scenario  you're dealing with and adjust your perks. Instead, you have no time to make any changes. I only managed to change a single perk card once despite several attempts and even sitting in the SPECIAL screen with 6 out of 7 cards selected while a teammate told me the map details. Why does this matter? Because the reduced gear options mean you need to be able to get any loot you can. Though I hate Picklock and Hacker as permanent perk cards, it's almost necessary to have at least one. I'd prefer to have something more combat-oriented, but I can't. Even the best players can only do so much with fists against a grenade launcher or automatic rifle...
---
Does the sink actually work?

Actually, starting with your vocal cords. We'll be over with a scalpel.
---
really. Ok where you live? Whiskey for all.
---
Well said. The game is so much fucking fun. It checks all of the boxes with what I want out of an online open world game on console:  Huge, has building, solid endgame (raid exclided), boss fights, exploring, rare plans, rare outfits, random encounters, limitless roleplay opporunities, huge legendary drop pool, and massively awesome player to player economy.  
---
But fuck me I feel humiliated and embarrassed every time something like this happens....again and again and again!
---
Ok so I joined another server and it worked again 😊
---
When I see that someone has taken so little care to proofread a post, I know they don't care about their own words.  The only thing that I don't know is why *I'm* supposed to care if they don't.
---
You first lol
---
Xbox Live has been having server issues for the past 4-5 days. Microsoft hasn't openly acknowledged all of it. It's hard to tell the source of the problem.
---
Is there an ammo box on the desk?
---
Thanks man, but i can't be arsed with this shit anymore.
---
That...
---
Sounds *hectic*, and more fun than it probably was. Maybe tonight, lol.
---
Thanks Bethesda im glad i can count on you to take my money!
---
I think I'm done with the game. Not gonna stick around.
---
usually my junkie vats railway. I have a JE railway, and JE shotgun... but I prefer to be able to play for a while, and once I start pounding crits I put plenty of damage out. I want a junkie crit damage vats cost handmade/fixer to make it zero vats, but I'm still searching for that
---
i can't get in game, but I'l check when I can
---
Feature
---
Xbox. Getting a lot of lag in crafting menus. Vendor/stash menus seem fine. This is before yesterday's patch too. I've not been taking on groups of mobs though, just gathering and crafting. So I'm unsure if it's lag in general.
---
-
---
Lever as my main, when I log in I have the usual no ammo bug. But when I reload now, it reloads infinitely, can't use the weapon unless and change weapons, and back again. Only at log in, it's fine after that. Weapon Wheel bug in Private too.
---
I'm also getting the Legendary loss on reload. Ducking/stealth, then reloading does seem to avoid this, rather than unequiping/re-equipping.
---
The blue light on the Atom Shop's Colored Lights item doesn't work. I'm more pissed at this than anything else. The Winter Vendors are huge by the way, I had to reshuffle the machines to make them fit where I had the standard ones. They're taller too. Hummpf.
---
Fallout 76 is the test server
---
You meed to bump Tank killer to 3☆. It's more important than full rifleman perks for end game mobs. It's the only way to negate some of the crazy damage resists they have.
---
I look at the items and can't justify the sale without a "Free " attached to it. Been modding and playing Fallout 4 instead. Everything is *so* overpriced in the MTX Shop. Seriously, $20 PA skins? I can get full games for cheaper.
---
not by much though.
---
It was a lot of fun, actually. About 60 second into one round, I remember hearing gunfire and saying, "two boards and four pistols. Let's see what we can do with this." We squad wiped 2 teams back-to-back, split the gear, and won the round.
---
People will join you. You don’t need to organize, don’t worry.
---
You can do it with 5 or 6 if y'all have good builds, and know your shit.
---
I've always been looking forward to the day I can run an auto pipe pistol to end game without my teammates yelling at me.
---
No. You can solo her.
---
If it's your first time, you'll probably need help. But players from the lobby will likely come to help out
---
Like you it directly impact my play style
---
4 vanguard and 1 chameleon My DR is reduced by just under a third.
---
I don't have an alternate character so I would have to start a new one, just seem so disheartening, Can they not get anything right  and then of course I'm bombarded by folks telling me it's not that bad, your exagerating etc
---
Unless you're the one dropping the nuke you're not being robbed of anything. If you don't get anything from coat-tailing someone else's nuke just suck it up and move on.
---
Are you the 1st member? Is she joining your world?
---
Because that was my experience - the only way to get someone into my private world was to add them to the team at the main menu, start my world, then have them join. Then they got booted. I can stay in my private world as long as I want, but no one else can play with me.
---
&gt;!Small envelopes containing containing pieces of a map. Collect them all, put them on the board in Grafton Pawn Shop, turn on the blacklight, and you get the code to enter the elevator that goes down to the game where the vault 79 entrance is located. You can't enter the vault yet, but there are a few interesting clues down there.!&lt;
---
I have this issue as well since last patch, never experienced it before.
---
For some reason completing Scorched Earth still gives the notification after completing it, but completing any other quest (even taking a workshop, so not just dailies) don't show a popup anymore. I think I still got the rewards for them though.
---
&gt;I have never in my life (IRL) taken apart a rifle and not had screws sitting next to me, even simple rifles have 3 or 4.
---
Hopefully not after you've put it back together though :P
---
Dammit I had a dream that they outsourced Wastelanders to Obisidian
---
That is exactly the problem. Atleast I know it's not just our accounts because I have not seen this reported anywhere else.
---
Sometimes I do.   Usually only when swapping stocks.  Sometimes the new peice has less screws.
---
Im still here, and im still playing since day 1. I understand all the hate, i really do. Im probably not going to stop playing, and im sure as shit not going to stop randomly having fun with it despite all the hate it gets. But at this point, i feel like test servers are a requirement. Even if its just for the people who bought the subscription.( i did not.) SOMETHING. just something needs to be done. 
---
I honestly doubt Bethesda would even have to pay anyone to test it. If they put test servers in with the first subscription, they'd actually be having people pay them to test stuff. It seems pretty win-win to me.
---
We play with my son and wife on private servers and we have the same problem. We all have 1st and tried it on each server one at a time but the same message keeps popping up no matter what we do. And as far as I know, I'm still friends with them......
---
Yeah I don't think the original design team was onboard for the Unstoppable Monster giveaway. Many people have agreed with me that it was a terrible idea to give those out so easily. Even with the Unstoppable Monster it still takes a lot of effort to hit for &gt;10k with it. This kind of goes back to my point on how people are getting robbed out of event awards by people who put in a lot of effort to do ridiculous amounts not damage. It's not a dick measuring contest so there really isn't a need to go crazy with the damage stacks.....the event is really easy.
---
As far as dupes go........if it's a god roll weapon you should just assume that it's highly unlikely that anyone would trade with you unless they had another one.
---
Interestingly I have a quad explosive radium rifle that I got had drop for me a year ago. Don't see too many of them floating around..... I'll give you one guess as to why.... LOL. Without duping there would literally only be less than a dozen bloodied explosive Handmade floating around and the explosive energy weapons would be practically Jon existent.
---
Where do I sign up lol.
---
Yup , pre launch of Wastelanders
---
I have encountered this before. Restarted our PS4 and it worked.
---
&gt;I didnt tell OP they were wrong.
---
No, you just told that they shouldn't have made a post because Bethesda gave a shitty, no-content reply.
---
&gt;Vent where everyone else is venting then. Oh wait, had they done that they would have seen the response from Bethesda.
---
&gt;If you see that there are 800 posts about a subject. You dont need to make another.
---
&gt;If you read all the shit, why wasnt it said there? Thats literally the only point im making.
---
&gt;I tried to shut it down before it got to here
---
You are right. Money and investors is your problem. No one is spending a dime but your right. I besties or investors... Ya that's the problem.
---
Before we go any further let's be upfront......
---
Which duped weapons do you have in your inventory that made my comment hurt your butt?
---
Yeah I've even noticed an overencumbered message pop up everytime I reload in excavator power armor and seen my carryweight slowly drain from 260 to 238 with no idea what's going on. Can't loot much of anything without slamming canned coffee and nuka
---
Just launch a nuke.  People will show up 95% of the time.
---
Lmao I got uny and vanguard buddy
---
The lowest I've ever seen it done, confirmed with my own eyes, was with 3 (4 with me) people who all knew their stuff and worked as a coordinated team.  
---
The fastest I've ever seen it done was with a coordinated clan group (9 people) in 1 min 12 seconds.
---
I am sure there's high-speed low-drag hitters out there that have done it faster or with fewer, but those are the  ranges I have personally been there for.  
---
I think you're in for a treat though, if it's your first time.  Just do a few Google and Youtube searches on the best way to target the nuke, as some folks make a total mess of it and waste the nuke.
---
The only way you're likely to do it solo is if you're playing alone on a private server. If there are other players, they're going to come help as soon as the Death From Above notice pops.
---
You'll get more help and have an easier time if you place your nuke well. If you drop it centered on Fissure Site Prime, the nuke zone will encompass all the fast-travel points nearby and you'll wind up fighting her inside the nuke zone, which is just unnecessary. Try to position it so Forward Station Delta, Drop Site V9, or the Overgrown Sundew Grove are outside the nuke zone. You just need to have Fissure Site Prime somewhere in the zone to spawn the queen.
---
Well most of the forums aren't 1st members (or ready to admit they are), and the reload/armor/durability bugs rightly take precedence over how many people can play in a private server. I want the latter fixed, but I as a bloodied rifleman I care about the former a heck of a lot more.
---
You can apply both sleek and shadowed to armor
---
Ran into this as well yesterday
---
&amp; springs 😣
---
Yes but not at the same time. I'm looking for opinions on which is a better choice.
---
This free content that constantly torments your psyche towards a game you desperately want to love. Give me working content or give me no content!
---
??  You make 0 logics, sir.  I've purchased the game, and I've paid for the subscription.  The devs are working, and the money that pays them is directed by investors.  What are you getting at?
---
I guess that's possible. I've only ever heard brand ambassador in the context of someone hired by a company.
---
I like this one the most. God how long till we have to have bloodied back. Been nice without these faggots.
---
Heyfuck you
---
Just for an experiment, craft up a level 45 lever action with the same mods and try it out.  I think you’ll find similar or higher damage than the level 35 legendary.  
---
The two-shot effect takes your total damage (125%) and divides it by two.  So each of two bullets has a chance to hit for 62.5% damage.  One miss and you might as well be using a pipe pistol.  Raise perception and get closer to your enemy to increase hit chance.  
---
It may take another shot or two, but with some adrenaline running I can run through Wes Tek with a non legendary lever action.  I’m running 9 ranks rifleman, 3 Tank Killer, 1 Concentrated Fire, 2Bloody Mess, and Adrenaline mutation with low health.  Rank 3 Nerd Rage will also boost those damage numbers.  (I always run legendary weapons, but the right build doesn’t require them, that’s what I’m trying say)
---
I had mine put me over carry weight by gifting me a Tesla Rifle similar to one I had sold in my previous session.... Sold gun, bulked scrap and logged out before patch. Logged in after update and got Santatron from shop, put him down, decorated at camp and 10 minutes later, became overloaded with a new gun...
---
I think something would be nice. It wouldn't remove the grind. It would just aid the people they are having difficulty finding anything of value.
---
It is only getting worse I can look clips from the fake first coming to now and it runs so much worse
---
Maybe submit a ticket just in case for clarification, especially if something in its description gave you that impression.
---
Same here as well on xbox
---
??? I was civil, and shall remain so.  You, however, have not made a coherent statement yet.
---
Xbox

I was playing a round with Real Good. He ran into a camp at the Morgantown Airport while I was on the Monorail. He wanted a distraction so he could squad wipe, but I didn't have any ranged weapons. I grabbed the only scoped weapon nearby, a Scoped Pipe Rifle. I shot one of the guys at the camp, who took something like 24 damage. He was rude and didn't stand still for me to shoot him another 10-16 times to get that kill. :(
---
I wanted to report a bug, maybe is related with corpses disapearing. In short, if you kill an enemy using energy weapons such as a gatling plasma o laser gatling, if the enemy is comberted in a pile of goo or ash in the air, that pile while be generated in the air, it won't fall down to the ground, and since they don't have a texture under the glue, you can't loot it.
---
I noticed this happening for the first time in the mire, while fighting a scorched beast in a bridge, I killed it between the bridge and the floor and the corpse became a pile of goo, bit it didn't fall to the floor.
---
It just happened again while fighting a 3\* scorched beast (that by it self seems strange, I had the impression SB could only be up to 2\*, and this one was not flagged as enemy until I shot it like 3 times). While figthing it a wendigo and a group of super mutants started attacking, so I pulled my gatling plasma, but while normally I wouldn't attack a scorched beast with energy weapons if it's in the air since I learned about this bug, this one flew away while fighting the super mutants, so I rushed to kill it and when I finally got aggroed again (took me another 3 shoots to make it attack me) some crickets decided to join, so I pulled the gatling plasma again, killed the crickets and started shooting the scorched beast, only to have it became a pile of goo in the air, making it imposible to loot for me and another level 89 guy that joined the fight at the end.
---
By the way, I was going around in the cranberry bog to try to test if the bug of reloading weapons affected my equipment, and my guns didn't loose any durability, but my armor got hit really bad (although I wasn't using white knight, and I'm not sure if they broke quicker or slower since normally I play as a sneaky boi). I didn't loose any legendary effect either, though my armor reduces weight of stuff mostly, so maybe it only affects armor that, by some conditional, increases some stat, like unyielding.
---
I'll try to capture this bug in video somehow, but I'm not confident in recording video in game directly since I'm running the game at minimum, so I fear that if I try to use shadow play or something the game will crash, if that doesn't work I'll try using my cellphone to record video.
---
I'm starting to wonder if they even have an internal test server.
---
It's an avatar I've seen on psn with vault boy holding fatman
---
I'm not the one with the hurt butt, nor do I ever have a problem doing enough damage to get rewards. All the weapons I use are ones that dropped for me.
---
Thanks TN! We just tried but that did not work in this case.
---
With strangler PA and a be gatling plasma anyone can solo the sbq in probably less then 5min
---
F/&amp;;£() up vote !!!!
---
I feel like at this point trying to fix it would take more man hours and money than starting over?
---
You need to max the scrapping perk to get more than wood and steel.  Otherwise your character is to inept at scrapping to get anything really useful back in return except wood and steel.
---
I’m getting so many Jangles! Living that good girl life.
---
Explore the vault before you leave, but many of the halls and rooms are locked off.  Check every terminal and container, and be sure to get every farewell kiosk on the way out.  I can't count the number of players I met who sped by them and missed out on their starting gear that way.
---
If you haven’t put it together yet, test servers cost money, and FO76 is being done on the cheap.
---
Have they not changed it so you can switch between Team Only or All Friends? Or have you done that and it's still kicking your team mates off?
---
Gay as in 'happy player' or gay as in 'homo'? Because I feel Bethesda is fucking me in the ass with these patches and I still play.
---
Good to know, ive been working on a new build so havent been on the one with all chalmeleon pieces....so damn lol, there goes my stealth. However im crouched most the time anyways so i should be ok?? Guess ill have to find out tn
---
Not true.  I have both on my legs.  Pretty sure sleek is only for legs though as its a movement speed modifier
---
With hemlock holes, and defending it, and free acid and lead.  Sounds like a fun ol time in the wasteland.
---
So you just want old scrapper back...?
---
So what was your point?
---
I'd agree with you if you were to say that Fallout 76 is a solo player game but unfortunately that isn't the direction that Bethesda went with this game.
---
Sure you have a right to kill the queen in 90 seconds but as a game developer Bethesda has a responsibility to provide a multiplayer experience where players of all walks find entertainment.
---
I used to use a game genie when I was 12 also......most of us have evolved past cheesing games and Bethesda should have made 76 solo if they weren't capable of balancing that.
---
Nope getting the odd toy too\
---
About to go blow up my bathroom. Does that count?
---
All scrapper does is give you more steel or wood. I had max int and scrapper and still got eff all useful
---
Just so you know, you can unequip then re-equip your armor and the legendary affects return....until you reload again.
---
I guess me. Played for a few hours earlier and didn't see them or get rewards.. Maybe not up yet.
---
It’s weird cuz on the news on the game it said it starts on the 11th today
---
Did you get one?
---
I'm surprised you didn't mention The New Quest that you add at pawn shop
---
As someone who has been a fallout fan since the original game came out on PC, I deleted 76 a few months after it released.  It's a dumpster fire of a game.  
---
I occasionally come back to this sub, however, just to see how bad it's become.
---
Leave V9 out of the circle and people are more likely to show.  
---
If your on xbox post a LFG to the fallout 76 social club a few minutes before you actually launch.
---
All I do now a days is log in and collect any free items in Atomic Shop and log out again.  Game's gotten too buggy, no new content (will check out Grafton Pawn eventually) so no reason to really play.  May play during the Scorched present thing, but not sure how much.
---
Absolute truths don't need to be proven bruh
---
Pitter patter.
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened    
---
1) I know for a fact they do testing, I just think it is seriously lacking.  
---
2) Likely true...  
---
Agree
---
No offense my dude. I've got to ask this though.
---
*Are you genuinely asking if this fucking patch was tested? Obviously not*
---
I run a full unyielding weapon weight reduction set. I would not be able to move if my effects weren’t working. This bug hasn’t effected me, I would know immediately. 
---
It must be a certain type of weapon or effect that is breaking it. Switching through all my handmades and reloading isn’t breaking it. My friend who runs the same set is also not effected.
---
That'll be a negative, good buddy
---
ouch....
---
Aktuooly...
---
Plus the Grafton monster that spawns all the time and 2 snallygasters.  This isn't amateur hour mats harvesting.
---
just a radroach that has a lot of health
---
fair enough
---
It's been a year.  There are no more excuses.  They run this game like they're two guys working out of a garage.  That;s what happens when you are short-sighted and eyeing big profits.  I defended the game for a long time but nothing has changed.  It's a fun game that would have been a great experience had it been made by a competent, adequately funded team of developers, not Bethesda.
---
Have to disagree in part, I played and in many cases BETA'ed almost every MMO until the early 201x's, few Successful MMO's have done this repeatedly, for more than a few months, and not ended up as a serious failure.
---
We're working as hard as we can to get a fix out to you as soon as possible. As soon as we have more information on when it is coming we will let you all know! Thank you for your patience and reports, every report has been extremely helpful in solving this.
---
Yay!
---
I have a Responder cop character. 
---
Now I get my patrol "car"
---
They will be active 10pm eastern time on the 11th
---
To maximize the chance of success, you could server hop around to find one with at least a few high level players around. Not many SBQ runs fail anymore, but having a few veteran players around will help ensure success. Good luck to you.
---
That would’ve been nice to know how’d you find that out ??
---
It was in their patch notes on the website.
---
PS4
---
There’s no way this goes through the free/double Xp weekend. If it does they risk a lot of people just saying fuck it. Any end game players play for the legendaries. If they’re broken what’s the point? New players seeing things this bad won’t buy the game. I thoroughly enjoy playing but man...lately it’s tough.
---
I want a toilet with functionality, like when you sitdown and get a positive effect or remove a negative effect.
---
And just my luck there is a FREE WEEKEND starting TOMORROW!! :)

Sooo... that means I can download the client, create an account and just sign in right?
---
Peter Parker.
---
the holiday event is just killing scorched lol
---
&gt;I don't even have the correct words for how stupid that would be
---
*Business as usual.*
---
Just change it to you have higher resistance the higher your wespon condition then put a cap at a certain resistance.
---
Walmart changing store layouts doesn't work at all.
---
Worked at Walmart for a few years and our sales would always decline slightly after reorganizing the store because people would get pissed off they couldn't find where something was moved to and then leave their full buggy and go buy it somewhere else.
---
thank you kindly, sir....
---
Need Screws? Acquire a Scrap assaultron head, a bunch of steel, and Super Duper x3. Craft a Assaultron helmet. Scrap the Helmet (it scraps back down to the scrap assaultron head), craft a helmet, Scrap it. Repeat. Eventually Super Duper should proc and you should start getting multiple Helmets. Repeat this loop until Super Duper has made your single Scrap assaultron head into as many as you wish then scrap the the scrap assaultron heads and get 3 Circuits, 1 Screw, and 1 Silver per each one. Keep 2-3 of the Helmets (lower weight than the junk item and no chance to get scrapped when repairing or crafting) to expedite the process the next time you need to do this.
---
Ok where’s the pics that show where these things are there are no map markers I’m losing my shit I can’t find anything or even where to start. What am I even looking for
---
It doesnt matter what your INT is at or what perks you run, you will NEVER get screws from scrapping gear.
---
I was excited to play but then I saw all the bullshit and now I’m like...well...fuck. Guess I’ll go back to fo4.
---
Does it make the game unplayable no of course not, don't complain only offer up glowing reports of the games greatness. Have you really even played the game ever I find those who complain about any aspect of the game have in facted never played it. Bethesda loves you and you love Bethesda
---
bwahahahaha
---
Pretty sure owned things are currently at top (or they will be?  I heard it somewhere).  And a free tab is coming, too. Heard that somewhere. 
---
Source: trust me bruh
---
The whole game is bugged.
---
bethesda makes bethesda games
---
https://youtu.be/eRkkKyZzgI8
---
...wut?
---
10 caps on the before fixed bulp
---
I'm being a dick
---
nah happened to me tonight , they still do it
---
Yeah, I've noticed this too.
---
Yeah. It essentially means that one is trash and the other is intentionally trash.
---
As others said. Launch away, others on the server will join to take her down. Just make sure you drop the nuke in a good spot. Do it so Fissure site prime is covered but Drop Site V9 isn't. It is feasible to do solo, but you need to have some pretty good gear to do it.
---
Oh player icon. Not sure about that one
---
Everyone, not just me.
---
I filled the chalkboard in and I was never able to find anything at McClintock.
---
For someone who needs lead it is totally worth it
---
I have a Responder cop character. I couldn't be more excited. First power armor skin I actually really want.
---
You are infer an error on the part of the all powerful Bethesda, there are no screws or soup for you.
---
I sure hope you're just trolling here. LOL
---
I'll allow it.
---
STOP you are VIOLATING the LAW!
---
Charlie Brown would like a word. I realize that’s probably what they were going for but swing a miss IMO.
---
Put them in a vendor for 30000 caps a peice while you are crafting. 
---
Another handy way to prevent this is to lock your camp up while you are crafting, drop the bug parts on the ground, do your crafting, then pick them back up.
---
The game uses the following order when crafting:
---
First it checks what you have on your person.  Then it checks your stashbox.  Then as a last resort, it goes to the scrapbox. 
---
If you have scrappable items with the materials you need to craft in  your stash box, then those will be broken down automatically and used for crafting.   You need to force the game to not use them by making them inaccessible to your crafting bench by dropping them, or putting them in your vendor.
---
It's like the ghost of bugs past. Old bugs returning just in time for a free weekend and double xp
---
Exactly. I'm pretty much a mix between Judge Dredd and Hank Hill.
---
That's why cookies and chips and many other deaired or necessary items are at the back of stores, so you have to walk past everything else.
---
Or just restore it and lower its drop rate to 0
---
Had this problem also. Had to switch the server option to allow all friends.
---
built a pc and moved from xbox, but ive been using the game pass lately
---
It's the self-depricating way of saying you don't need bloodied/unyielding to know stuff is screwed up.
---
Yeah same - i guess that chance of an xmas gift is fairly rare!
---
I've done it solo in 22 seconds on xbox
---
I hear you on that....For example, Uranium Fever, I do not have a weapon that does not one shot the Supervisor, even that silly boxing glove.  So I go in there with a regular fixer and take a few shots to tag.  I also try to get 4 randoms on a team to get a tagging advantage.  This is much more of a mess than the SBQ IMHO.  Bloodied build is definitely OP but should never be nerfed because I am living on the edge with every move I make.  I picked up a BFFR plasma rifle from the Purveyor this morning....I have no rifle cards in and it does 161 DMG with adrenaline kicked in and a massive fire rate...  That is what you get with the build.
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....       
---
Melee worse than before or same issues since Patch 15.0?
---
lol
---
Exactly why physical shops move items around, to make your ass look through the whole shop
---
Bear in mind that parts of this code could date back as far as Morrowind; it's a minor miracle it runs at all. That said, this is why they should have made a new engine years ago.
---
and terrible timing...
---
That's odd, which versions of the Stealth Boy?
---
 Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....   
---
Wait that seems backwards..
---
FU 1st subs: "bu...but we are supporting the game!!1!1"
---
\&gt; People who don't play 76 aren't going to take notice of a shitty patch 
---
False. Stopped playing a week or so after Fallout First was announced, went to other games like Destiny, and some older single players.
---
Whenever I'm unhappy with a piece of content, game, or DLC, I like to visit the r/fo76 reddit and see how much worse off this community is for playing this game. Every day I visit 50% of whoever is left has lost faith and honestly? It makes almost any other videogame seem like a godsend.
---
I thought I read 7pm est?
---
Good one, Hitler
---
And see them go public anyway*
---
I already have a workaround for the future. The point is that this is rather unacceptable. They create a repeatable quest that uses these items, but auto-scrap them even when I have waste of what I need.
---
But thank GOD they don't auto-scrap my assaultron heads and ski blades, because I need those right? So many people use those for things? Same with Sheepsquatch shards?
---
Come on. I should be able to mark them as an item to not scrap at the very least.
---
What I do not get about duping is that it should easily be controlled...Every item in this game is tagged in some manner...Find the tags that are being duped and get rid of those and the players producing them
---
Thanks for the follow up, still free of durability bug?
---
Thanks for the comment, odd it seems to be effecting some and not others
---
what is the best stuff you can get from the santatron?
---
 Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....     
---
Patch 15.0 bug, wish they'd fix that!
---
The return of the ever-generating enemies, even miners and scorched.
---
Literally got home from class today and decide to hop on after a long break and noticed my Chameleon armor wasn’t working and my gun durability what atrocious. Happy to see the folks at Bethesda are hard at work breaking their game again...fingers crossed they decide to hot fix asap, but who knows it’s not like it’s an Atomic Shop bug that’s costing them precious money that gets patched almost immediately.
---
All the time, sometimes?  
---
Events or ?
---
I could have possibly miss read it so either 7 or 10 pm.
---
got the pieces, going around for the packages now, thanks!
---
I will take a look when I get time. 
---
GT: Dragonic One
---
Shoot me a msg and when I get time I'll let you know if I have any you might want.
---
Thanks for the comment, I saw that a couple times pre 16.0, but makes me think it's gotten worse
---
how do you know it gives you a gun? and is it in the machine itself or does it go straight to inventory?
---
What do you think it is then?
---
If you are trying to get high end stuff your better using the trade market sub or discord.  People generally don't put really good stuff in their vending machines because it may be worth more than the cap max or it is worth enough to put them over the cap max.
---
 
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....
---
I just play the game rather than watch somebody else play it.
---
Isn’t a bad option.
---
PC. Thank you, though.
---
everybody wants to be a youtuber.
---
Whatever happened to just listing your idea's in bullet points format?
---
That's what surprised me, I was away from my controller, came back and the gun was just in my inventory... Is the only explanation I can come up with....
---
I noticed my weapons losing damage output when I had the damage numbers turned on during a SBQ event yesterday.
---
why would you waste time watching instead of playing it yourself?
---
Wow. I wasn't aware of that. Thanks.
---
Because I don’t decided to buy it
---
Were you in a party?
---
I understand. But I’m just curious. If this is the stuff they’re selling, then what are they feeding into the scrip machine?
---
Awesome. Thanks. I'll have to hit up the bunker and experiment. This is the problem with mods and no plans.
---
Easy, take it away from Bethesda Austin.
---
To many to write, easer to record ;-) 
---
And yes - everyone wants to be a youtuber :-D
---
You just have to reeeeeeaaaallllllyyyy look. Sometimes you'll get lucky. But yeah, usually it's trash lmao
---
I swear to god, they've reverted the game to the launch build. It's like the last year of patches never happened!
---
They do not close down the lobby at 18, I've played matches with as few as six people
---
I doubt it, or else you could effectively buy the Ranger Armor for a few cents.
---
There's a grip of awesome post-apoc games on there. I'm doing another playthrough of Mutant Year Zero right now, plus Wasteland 2 is on there. You've got the full Metro series and Rage 2, though I never really was able to get into those. For more survival/looting type stuff you've got State of Decay 2 and Void Bastards is great. Lots of good options. I hope you find something cuz 76 is just not worth putting up with right now and isn't going to be for a while it seems.
---
It’s super rare but it’s always awesome when I find a nearly god-roll item for like 500 caps. :)
---
I mean, you should just get it, it's like $10 or something. If you just want to see what the game looks like you could watch anyones youtube crap, really.
---
I'll be honest, I just go for deep pockets and polymer.
---
I don't mind so long as it's at scrip pricing.  4k for a nocturnal, limb damage, limb damage, 90% reduced weight rolling pin is batshit insane but I'd happily pay a couple hundred caps for the 40 scrip.
---
Not to downplay just how big of a deal this is (its a big fucking deal) but this bug doesn't seem to be affecting everyone either that or it isn't affecting 100% of all Legendary effects (may be just the primary effect). I run with Weight Reduction Legendary effects on my armor (last effect) on all 5 pieces (im a pack rat i would be totally over encumbered otherwise) and not once in my 3-4 hours played last night did those effects stop working. Don't know on the other effects on my armor, i didn't really notice anything, then again I'm not really relying on their effects, I'm not a Bloodied Build- (2xVanguard Scout, 1 Unyelding Scout that i dont rely on at all, Mutant Metal and dont recall the last effect Combat).
---
Same with durability i had to repair my primary weapon (Furious Handmade) once while putting around 2K rounds through it (which is normal).
---
Today was the first time I ever got loot from the queen. So if I managed to do enough damage then there’s definitely something wrong compared to before lol 
---
Used a lot of 5mms and 50’s as always
---
That is exactly what I’m doing right now, where is 10$?
---
You can check out a new stream that I’ve been starting. I’m level 225 and trying to get to 300 by the end of the month. Would love to have you! 
---
https://twitch.tv/notagamergamer28
---
Sometimes you fill your scrip limit and have extra. That’s what I do. I generally sell scrip weapons for cheap but occasionally do sell decent stuff, primarily bloody and junkies for a few thousand caps.
---
Sadly, the former is generally the standard in my experience.
---
Love when that happens
---
Yes. I think when you have top tier armor and weapon most of vending machines look to store only sh*t because you'll never find a BE handmade. 
---
But  in my case I sell BOS modded combat armor with no top meta effects and I think some new lvl 50 are happy to get a full armor set and not so bad weapon for 2500-3000 caps in my vending.
---
Shadowed is the primary modification. 
---
Sleek is a secondary mod for legs only. 
---
You can totally get both. That's what I use.
---
That’s true
---
Ok nice
---
You got any vanguard combat armor..... oh yeah, and are you on PS4? :)
---
That is a visual bug you are still getting the rewards its just not showing the notification. I got that first thing last night as well as i was running through my dailies but did notice the rewards (plans, fuzzy tokens, etc) were added to my inventory when i checked my Pipboy. Also the notifications started back up correctly after a re-launch.
---
If you go into the military wing of the Bunker, take a left and walk down the central aisle with all of the computer desks. Along the far wall are some computer terminals that deal with all things related to Commendations.
---
I think most people have no idea on pricing, even when you ask for a price check you usually get 3 didfernet price points.   
---
I have a sign, pm offers, I over price my legendaries.
---
Nope. Just finished loading in, checked the map and joined the event just hoping I'd make it in time. I was around level 50 at the time. I got there, got one shot off and got attacked by the mobs. Didn't get a chance to even hit her again before the higher level cats finished her off. At first I was worried I hadn't even hit her but sure enough it's just like every other Legendary enemy in the game.
---
Why downvote this guy? He's made an effort to record a video and upload it to share hos thoughts and some arsehole downvotes, probably didn't even watch the video.
---
You can watch a few youtube videos to see whats up.  I like Riflegaming as he has some good lore videos and some interesting nuke experiments.  
---
All that being said the game is worth the 20 bucks or whatever it goes for nowadays.
---
People paid for this.
---
Nice answer!, thanks for the advice!!
---
2k and 4k caps unmodded armor and weapons. It may be good stuff, I not not know, may be you do not know. Those 22 legendary armor and weapons, clothing, beer and wine, salt and pepper are the only way I can trick players into visiting my elaborate confusing camp.
---
Past experience would make that a resounding "yes".
---
I got good weapons for sale in my machines. look me up on Xbox Dabeanzfynest07
---
Excellent points. The world is going to benefit a lot from wastelanders, bulk ammo and increased stash will be amazing. Clans will be great and settlements complete with NPC's we can attack and control, similar to workshops but you have to complete a daily questline to win them over. We should be able to command them to attack other locations or farm, gather etc. Something like: take out a legendary alpha that has been attacking each settlement, fix up the town, build amenities..
---
I hope they fix these recent issues and concentrate more on the player experience than the business end.
---
Thanks for the comment, you are echoing the words I spammed the CM's with when I read the patch notes, the choice they made is not what was requested (Anonymous mode and the ability to "Invite" players)  
---
Documented and reported
---
PS4 here. Rats. :)
---
Thanks for the comment and confirmation
---
"We've listened to the community and decided to add this feature".
---
I don't know, I just see random posts on here people asking if it's worth it to buy for $8-12 or whatever. Try a google search
---
I didnt have any problems with armor / weapons. So it must be related to something the player owns / perk. I played for 8 hours today without any issue (EU PC).
---
Not that it'll happen, but a large amount of player uninstalling and cancelling Fallout 1st subs (both are tracked statistics, and one would directly hurt their bottom line) might get the idea across.
---
My favorite Santatron quote so far has to be "Have you been naughty or nice? \*analyzing\* Oh god, why would do that, oh god why" Or something along those lines.
---
You get like 27 lead per run. Lucky Hole Mine and the weight rooms in the nuke silos are much more efficient sources of lead
---
I'm so glad I made a melee character recently.  Found a bloodied power attack meathook and designed a new character around it.  Now it's getting a ton of use because of this broken shit.  Problem is my main is my more fun character...  oh well...
---
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Plenty of coal, too.  At least I know why from his dialogue.  "Checking naughty or nice... Oh my god... Oh why... WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!"  (Or something like that.)  B. did a great job with the dialogue on this one!
---
Ok well if you read the other comments here or do a simple google search you will realize that this has been brought up on many forums and there is in fact a damage threshold. I've also personally done at least 300-400 queens between my 5 characters and I can tell you there is.
---
Maybe the 'one' time you got credit with 1 small hit but this isn't the norm.  Everyone except you says there is threshold, so the border of proof is on you now.
---
Stop spreading false info.
---
Whistling away lol. Sadly, Jugg's method doesnt allow you to place a floor. 
---
Also, I never would charge for info but there are some things I dont want to spread around Bethesda patrolled areas. Hell, I even help people in person, using my own resources and never charged a thing.
---
Yeaah I had to restart my game because it wasn't completing the quest.
---
Its working now
---
Well said. A week from now, the closed reddit-cults will once again succeed in downvoting any kind of critical thinking.
---
Fallout 76 has to be the living embodiment of "One step forward, two steps back."
---
I was just saying it shows what 4 stars or 5 just wondering what the future holds...would be cool if it was a mod would be cool
---
add me: Owl_No
---
That is my experience as well, on PC
---
Maybe
---
That's fallout 4 scrapper. Fo76 scraper just increases the amount of steel or plastic you get back it seems. It definitely does not cause you to get any of the rarer mats
---
You need to equip them in the emotes tab of the atom shop
---
Tell you what; I'll stop using exploits as soon as Bethesda bothers to fix all the game breaking bugs. Sound fair?
---
Darn. I’m out of suggestions. Good luck though!
---
You can do it with 2 a shotgunner to cripple its limbs and a melee guy for dps
---
Nice.
---
Can't try it while I'm at work, but floors won't snap to the doorway before you modify it into a wall?
---
RageChronicles
---
I wonder if it's related to specific weapons.  Going to try my fixer later and see if that also breaks my build.  I'd hate to burn through ultracite .45 but if it let's me play so be it.
---
Speaking of free..... I got the free santa robot collector.....
---
I can't find it in my Camp at all when I go to building mode
---
Thanks for the comment, and this is a little insane. documenting and reporting
---
Walking in the desert midnight seeing the glow shining from Vegas and listening to these fine songs(yes you too Johnny Guitar). New Vegas is truly a magical game.
---
Want a proof? I remeber the B.E.T.A and remained a player for over a year. Waiting for the Wastelanders. Then, we'll see.
---
Dont tease me like that. Lol.
---
I think they should have given everyone a free month as a Thank you for even playing the game. Pretty cheeky to ask people  To pay for something that they might not even like. Just about everything in the world has a free trial or a money back guarantee these days.
---
So why do you want to cancel it anyway? Is it shit?
---
 **We need a new scorched beast queen type enemy!** 
---
Flying sheep squatch! it would be cool if packs of Scorched could fly lol please don't make mole rats fly lol
---
Why pay? If there is a test server, we could do it for free :)
---
Can u elaborate please? How is bloatfly and bloodbug parts used in smelting ore?
---
Every black powder gun too
---
At this point I think it would be faster to list the things that *weren't* broken by this patch.
---
Because those are crafting components in and of themselves. 
---
Beer Bottles don’t autoscrap, because they are used to make Molotovs. 
---
Yes, they should be included in the non-autoscrap list. But until then, put them in you vendor to protect them if you want to do that quest repeatedly.
---
I tried to make my own fire lookout tower but couldnt build above 3 levels (savage divide) however my current camp is located under the train bridge near harpers ferry and i can place power connectors on the underside of the bridge and build on the bridge itself, which is higher than 3 levels.  
---
Seems dependent on your altitude and the height of the surrounding structures
---
Wow. I just did your recommended Google search and there's nothing about her having a damage threshold to get loot from her. I was just giving you my personal experience in the process of answering the questions YOU ASKED ME. That's not the same thing as spreading false information. You're just putting in too much effort into being a know it all dick. I've done just as many queens as you with my one character and maybe I might've gotten lucky in that regard a few times but I still answered OP's inquiry about why he wasn't getting loot or rewards from the event in an accurate manner. Sometimes the cats on this sub are so damn salty for no reason.
---
But we already have the biggest, most frightening boss ever: the Patch 16 coder!
---
I had this happen to me just after the patch. I quit the game for a few hours and it fixed itself
---
"It won't make any difference."
---
Newt 1986
---
Ive done a 5 story and Ive seen and 8 story before!
---
no I like it well enough but with the patch yesterday it completely impacts my playstyle, and with bethesda they could be weeks fixing it.
---
The only thing this post is missing is a response by a community manager talking about how amazingly creative the griefers are and how friendly this community is
---
What about the “Meltdown” raid. Are you working on the freezing issues?
---
Confirmed not new, but annoying...
---
The thing of it is, I am usually close to max caps. So I'm not going to put a 25k+ wep or armor set in and easily lose out in a blink with a few high cap purchases. So yeah, it's scrip and mid level items depending entirely on what I have for caps.
---
Ha, reminds me of the guy that asked the Arkham Asylum devs when they would fix the "broken" cape gliding mechanic at a convention xD
---
 Sorry for the delay, thanks for the follow up, annoying issue but not new
---
It's not an exploit if you never confirm it!
---
They probably do this with bugs too
---
I agree 100% that this is an issue.  
---
I was just providing a possible workaround to use until bugthesda gets off its ass and fixes the problem.
---
What platform?  I think xbox has a free play weekend coming up for it.
---
Did anything, *literally ANYTHING* go right with this patch?
---
&gt;Bethesda killed the golden goose(modding) because they wanted to bleed the fallout community dry and now we are in this situation.
---
😥
---
Yes I'm the one who is salty.
---
PC
---
Yea but the run is 1 minute long
---
They are already doing it....
---
Nice
---
Think my treehouse is 5 or 6 stories. All you have to do, is place your camp device higher. The higher your camp device when you first place it at a location, the more levels you will have from the ground up!
---
This.  Same reason you don't put the free samples right at the front door of a shop
---
I gotcha. I don't have the plan for lever action yet. Hope to find it soon. Until then I'll just stick to the handmade and put this up for my next character.
---
Or in 2 months time, bring out a patch that fucks things up 10 times worse you mean? Yeah, don't give the arseholes any money unless they fix the game.
---
know dat feel 
---
especially on non-pro ps4 the performance of the game can be cancer..
---
I think it's actually in the brochure for the intro course you take as a prerequisite to Marketing 101 xD
---
Dumb question, I found all the map pieces and went to vault 79, but is there an actual “start” to a mission.  I found some evidence but no mission.
---
Phwoar! Check out the Ultracite on that scorched!
---
Seems like it. Accusing me of spreading false information because my personal experience doesn't jive with what you'd like it to be. Again I answered OP's question accurately and you took it upon yourself to try and discredit me for no good reason. That's what salty people usually do.
---
I think this is it.  The listed damage for a two shot includes damage for both shots summed together.  The first shot will include all the perks and mods that increase damage.  The second shot will be 25% of the gun's base damage plus perks.  (Perks apply, mods like Hardened do not.)  Both of the shots will diverge in flight, so your long ranged accuracy will be lower than expected, too.  Two shot isn't all that great for long range sniper weapons, IMO.  Probably better for short range and/or high-ROF spray-and-pray tactics.  Increasing your armor piercing in general is likely the better bet at range.
---
All unyielding in stash, using backup armor and 100% health, fun to try different.
---
i’m using a launch day ps4 lol, it’s a little slow at the moment
---
Fuck votes, the most dysfunctional addition to forums ever.  Twas a different system back in the day so I’m a sort by new person.
---
You didn't answer his question accurately.  If you are going to keep doubling down on your false narrative then give us all some proof.
---
The extra +100 bug is reported as fixed and gone.
---
The intended +100 Excavator Bonus is reportedly broken along with all Legendary armor after you reload a firearm while standing.
---
Heheheh you might be right.  I never reported another exploit because I thought I may as well use it if that's the response I'm going to get.  PS Bobby pins.  BobbyBobbyBobbyBobbyBobbyBobbyBobbyBobbyBobbypins.
---
Yes, I found it only but a couple minutes ago. 
---
In the least spoilery way I can think of I'll put it like this.
---
Senators get certain perks as a result of being in office. One of which is a location where they get to work while elected. You'll find his letter there.
---
I agree. Most would jump at the chance to do it for free. Im right there in line with you there. 100 percent. 
---
I mentioned it that way (hide test servers in fallout first) for two reasons. 
---
1. They would be getting paid by people to find their bugs. That sounds like business 101 to me. 
---
2. It might actually help sell more subs. People would know the bugs are being located and documented properly. Content would be released in better a better state( hopefully). Clearing up a lot of hesitation from people on the fence about the sub as is. You might actually get more subscribers out of it too because of people wanting to be beta testers. 
---
Doing it like that means Bethesda wouldnt lose any more money on patch updates and might actually stand to make money on subscriptions and an added bonus of actually fixing the game moving forward and bringing more new players in or even old players back. 
---
Bethesda has nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing it this way from where i stand. 
---
This next part is not directed specifically at you, but at anyone wanting to reply.......
---
Im sure i overlooked something. I just ask that it please not be pointed out in "dickheaded" ways. Im just spitballing ideas here.
---
Across from the Grafton church. Should say pawn above it and have a interactive door
---
Let me ask you this. How many people do you see using any of the other explosive weapons on a regular for AOE instead of non-explosive (insert weapon class here)
---
The truth is that people would much rather use any weapon with the explosive legendary prefix over say, a missile launcher or a grenade launcher.
---
That is a huge problem and directly related to how good the explosive legendary effect actually is.
---
I hate watching vids I can learn quicker by reading.  Yet there’s different learning styles and many people learn better by various ways. Fuck the haters bro.
---
It is a unmarked quest so it's discovery based. Nothing to direct you place to place. Wits and curiosity are what get you place to place
---
Historically speaking many exploits have caused some of those game breaking issues.
---
Future atomic shop content. There's a bunch of different variants datamined also, like: responder, enclave, plain black, funny eye, pink with heart, free states
---
Are people still buying the game at this point?
---
2 shot breaks the damage into 2 projectiles.  So if you deal 100 damage, it's actually 50 + 50 per shot.  Those 2 projectiles have lower accuracy than normal, but in any case you will never see number other than 50 (though in practice it will be a different number due to range fall off and DR).  
---
Meanwhile a non 2 shot weapon that does 100 damage will report 100 damage.  Again, this is ignoring range damage fall off and dr/er.
---
Santatron things OP is full of shit.

**Someone To Talk To is not repeatable....**

Any other dailys not coming up for you?  B.E.T.A. player?  
---

---
Interesting, 100% of the time, only asking because it's the first time I've heard this one.  
---
**Upon logging in, the Leather Coat needs to be taken off and re-equipped  in order to show your hands in 1st person, about 60% of the time.**

What Underarmor do you wear?

Asking to verify and replicate  
---
**Enemy loot will sometimes not show up completely while “free looting” with E....**   
---
This is an older issue, but it could be there is a lag / delay in loot populating.  
---
**Similarly, I was experiencing strange effects with my stats at the same  time...............**  
---
Likely linked to the other similar issues linked to all Legendary Armor effects including PA, but worth watching.  
---
**The Lock and Load perk seems to periodically switch off on its own....**     
---
While logged into the same session?    
---
Good chance this is linked to the other reload bugs, but again worth noting, thanks.   
---
**On my rifleman, a Fixer with a 15% reload effect behaves the same way....**  
---
See Above... Confirmation is great!     
---
**The reload issues have been happening to me for at least a month.  250gate is not the cause, although they may be related....**   
---
Besides Perk related issues after patches or server crashes, I've not seen a serious uptick in reports of the Reload perks not functioning, could you provide more information?    
---
Aka armor, perk loadouts etc, to try and replicate,
---
Its Fucking shit mate, I was an active member of an amazing forum about 10 years ago, there was no stupid votes. If you didn't like something you said so, and if you were out of line, you got 'flamed'. Simple, not like the sofa masturbators these days, can't even be arsed to construct a response.
---
My vending machine holds scrippable garbage while im waiting for the next day to come so I can scrip more. 
---
You can only turn in so many crap 3\*s a day.
---
Please come buy my 3\* Furious black powder rifle with bashing damage and aim speed.
---
Is there a post about it anywhere?
---
That lvl 35 is a wonderful weapon for leveling up your next character. Holding onto it is a smart move.  If you stumble across an Instigating Lever, that’s a hot ticket with a rifle build.  
---
Will you switching into Comando perks?   The greater dps of automatic rifles is really fun, and they only use half the AP of semi auto rifles.
---
this is how I got my bloodied bone hammer with power attack and str.
---
It doesn't start giving the gifts until tomorrow when the event starts
---
Perfect - thank you!
---
The base damage of the weapon is proportional to its level.  A L45 weapon will have a higher damage stat than an otherwise identical L35.  I think in your case, the way damage is listed for two-shot (adding the two values together) is masking it.
---
That said, it's not a huge difference.  I don't have the numbers, but on the order of a few percent difference between level steps (i.e. between L35 and L45).  If you have a L35 with all the legendary effects you want, it may be better than a L45 with irrelevant effects.  Same with armor defense.
---
 Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....       
---
Thanks for the comment, but this is not new and never went away, from time to time the Ghoul's glitch out and turn into robots, first eyebots, then evolving through various Protectrons.  
---
I  think we stopped seeing it so often when they nerf'ed the respawning of the club house months back, but still worth noting!
---
It’s much worse if you built around a full unyielding/sneak or vanguard/sentinel suit.  90% of your defensive effectiveness is gone, with vanguard/sentinel being obvious and loss of stealth ability if being hidden is your primary defense.  Losing two poison resist effects is horrible vs a legendary mirelurk queen, king or hunter.  Your health just rockets down.
---
Eh, depends how far you take it. Not everything needs to be specialized. I get stuff like auto-stim or regenerating, they're practical. But yeah, stuff like nocturnal or mutant Slayers can get trashed
---
FaLlOuT fIrSt HaS tReMeNdOuS VaLuE
---
Yup for consoles it would be cool but i definitely wouldn't want it with PC.
---
It would definitely help with Nuclear Winter wait times, but i doubt it would ever happen. Bethesda are already having enough trouble as it is without adding anything else to the mix and the PlayStation company are notoriously known for not playing well with others
---
what about to undo the patch and to bring it back when it works?
---
If the patch fixes one minor feature (250DR), but it breaks some critical features, it's not worth it. 
---
It's just a common sense thing… 
---
Don't you have a boss there to take this kind of decisions or something?
---
 Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....      
---
Thanks for the followup, think we've seen less of it due to them nerfing the way to respawn the clubhouse on \[PC\]
---
No.  Not at all.  Two shot weapons have one shot do all the damage while the second shot does 25% of the base damage.
---
I don't use the high fire rate heavy weapons (mostly handmade, combat rifles and plasma), but I have commandos and find it is a lot easier to jump into some excavator armor and hit the 7 or 8 Lead veins east of berkeley station, smelt it, make some ammo and be done with it for a week or so. So little things like this are nice, if nothing else, to have a quick way to get some ammo made.
---
would be awesome if it wasn't a bug, but it's one of my favorite ones!
---
Honestly don't know how to make my statement any more clear. It was only two sentences and there weren't any big words. But here it goes anyway:
---
You launch nuke, do what want. Don't launch nuke, take what get.
---
1.  Cop a Squatter is uncommon, but repeats.  All others are fine.  Yes, BETA.
---
2.
---
Lets not cherry pick crossplay.
---
Dude!!! He asked why he wasn't getting loot or rewards from the event. I told him why the same thing happened to me in the past and what I did to make sure it doesn't happen anymore. You know there's no way to provide proof you only did 100 damage one time when there's 10 people attacking her at the same time and you can easily test for yourself if what I'm saying is true. Why don't you give us some proof. Link an article or tweet from Bethesda confirming a damage threshold. You wouldn't be able to because it doesn't exist. What enjoyment do you get from being so damn salty about an online video game? Relax man and maybe you'll get some contentment in life at some point.
---
thanks!
---
This place is turning into FB.
---
You okay hun? PM me. Xx
---
Got bloodied plasma Gatling with 10 percent while aiming and 90 WR for 500 caps the other day.  I don't know what to do with it, but at less than 2 pounds it will be traveling around with me until I figure it out.
---
You're right, but there's many here (including me) who have cut code for a living one way or another.  What surprises me most is how many times there's been unintended impacts related to changes.  Fixing thing A breaks thing Z.   Typically with the work I did, my module would work, or it would work incorrectly, or it wouldn't work at all; it wouldn't cause some distantly related thing to go haywire.   I don't think it's the people who are at fault, my assumption is that they have code that goes back years, and has dependencies all over the place that aren't obvious.   I'd absolutely love a detailed technical explanation of how something like this patch issue happened.   I know we can't get that. But it would be a fascinating study.
---
I agree, sits in my lodge bar but looks so bland! Needs more https://i.imgur.com/yN5ghqQ.png
---
...also would a decent lighting engine be too much to ask for?
---
I'm just going to start storing them on my alt, now that I'm aware of it being a problem. I should have payed closer attention to it when scrapping. I had no idea it would take things that need to be scrapped from my stash before taking the actual waste from my scrapbox. What a stupid design.
---
They scrap down to acid.
---
So that's roughly 800 lead in 30 minutes?  You can get 1200+ lead in a single run through Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator armor. Not sure how much lead is in the weight rooms, but it's definitely still a lot more efficient than Grafton Pawn.
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....     
---
Thanks for the comment, but this is a B.E.T.A. age bug they have never fixed, I think people got tired of mentioning it, but I'll add it to the UI page of the Wiki
---
That's stupid. It's an MMORPG.
---
Like I said you can do whatever you want. Bethesda on the other hand needs to find a way to balance the game between the noobs and the cheaters using duped gear.
---
Ok but they have to call it Gang Green
---
They are made of acid so it scraps them for anything that uses acid. Junk items should be the very last thing pulled out when crafting.
---
Let’s hope it fixes itself before the Halloween challenge starts at 7pm est!
---
The camp has a height, but also a depth meter. So if truly wanted to do the maximum build height, you'd need to find a location with a cliff or something tall you can place your camp (like a building, sometimes trees). To the get max, you need to test a little. Place it at more or less the max height of building, if it was on the ground, then check if you can still build on the ground, then move higher or lower.

EU, PC. It took me 30 seconds yesterday to notice that reloading was breaking all the perks (5xchameleon, wwr's...) of my armor pieces, making my current builds unplayable for me.
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened and thanks for the comment....       
---
B.E.T.A. Age bug they've not fixed and drives people crazy on Private servers, long debate as to the cause, but hopefully they will eventually fix it, have that documented on the NPC page of the Bug Wiki if memory serves.  
---
That said, always better to have issues raised more than once than miss a bug, so thanks again!
---
When you go to start private world look at the bottom of your screen there is a new option
---
I don't need proof. Anyone here on the forums can go tag the queen with 1 or 2 shots and see they wont get a reward.  Most people who do the queen regularly know this.
---
my camp is a hovering village connected to a cliff, high enough to die if you jump down
---
i call it mountown
---
I do the same. 
---
I only stock weapons in my vending machine with the following prefixes:
---
Bloodied, Junkies, Furious, AntiArmor, Vampires.   Sometimes a rare 2 shot god tier gets there.
---
Rarely will a 1 or 2\* weapon get vendored, most of it is all 3\*
---
People dont even want to look at the other stuff.  
---
Everything else goes to scrip.  
---
I feel my prices are reasonable, but stuff can sit for a while before it sells sometimes.  I dont advertise, so I rely on people randomly stopping by.
---
I found a be 10mm mmg for 600 caps once. Amazing.
---
That would defeat the purpose *of* an Atomic Shop
---
I can hear Tod Howard laughing from here.
---
This patch is just the gift that keeps on giving.
---
They aren’t along my bot thinks I am as well.
---
4 story firewatch
---
nice find.   
---
You can trade that for pretty much whatever you want.
---
Thanks for the comment, so to clarify you don't have the letters set people noticed got nerfed?
---
I'd really love to see this fixed...
---
world spawns are 180, containers 60
---
Lol. Now that’s useful information, appreciate it. Should be upvoted imo. The fact you dedicated that much effort instead of downvoting and moving along is commendable.
---
Look man, if I say this Drill is worth 76 caps then that's what it's worth. Got it off the Impostor Sheepsquatch myself!
---
*cries*
---
Thanks for the comment and to clarify, is this all quests and are you getting the other rewards?
---
Saying "I don't need proof" while demanding proof from others is what salty people who aren't being honest with themselves usually say. Have a good one man . It must suck being that damn miserable and I don't wanna contribute to your high blood pressure.
---
Look grafton Pawshop
---
Send me a friend request I’ll be on tomorrow grinding out the event
---
Saw a bunch of flooring I hadn't seen before.  That said, I still come across camps with new-to-me stuff...playing July 2019-current.
---
hmm, i'll check that, good news if applies to me, thank you :)
---
Don’t cry. One day they’ll make drills legendary too. :)
---
ts breaks the damage into 2 projectiles each with less paper damage than the total.  so for example and iirc a 100 damage weapon would actually deal 50 + 50 assuming both projectiles hit.    
---
Meanwhile that 100 damage non ts is reporting 100, but in the end 50 + 50 and 100 are the same damage received by the enemy.  
---
In practice though its a lot more complex.  DR/ER work more based on the ratio between the dr/er value and the damage, meaning 100 damage will actually harm an enemy more than 2 50 damage shots.
---
Ultimately TS isn't the best effect for raw damage but it's a mid tier damage boost and really good for applying secondary effects like say, strangler heart PA acid damage.
---
Bethesda crossing it's fingers you misunderstand what is and isn't free and end up spending atom points by accident.
---
I’m on the PC, so maybe that’s a thing on the PC only.  Or maybe if I restarted the game it would show up.  🤷‍♂️
---
What do you mean start? If you mean like a questline, sadly no. It’s just piecing together things with little to no guidance atm
---
I passed up a mr fuzzy outfit and head in vending machine for 150 caps each...i just didnt want it...look at it now
---
I found the pc player LOL!
---
Guilded/Nukashine(?) minigun...yep.
---
Fireplace, clean toilet, clean sink
---
...yep.
---
Thanks for the comment, but not a new issue to patch 16.0, question for you, using a Bloodied / low health build to max damage?  
---
BTW again thanks for the comment, always better to have something reported more than once than miss a critical issue!
---
Yes please, more personal attacks. I'm simply giving the people on the forums the correct information. Sorry that bothers you so much..  it also seems like you should google the meaning of salty because you obviously don't understand that either.
---
Yup, and we feel alone sometimes
---
These aren't true quests in a sense. These are fun little optional side stuff that you can either follow, or not. I doubt any of this stuff will really have a large impact on Wastelanders. The recordings you could find containers before Nuclear Winter came out didn't affect anything. Neither did the Sheepsquatch stuff before Wild Appalachia. 
---
It's nothing more than a nice tease. If they put in patch notes about this kind of stuff it kind of takes away from the whole exploration aspect of 76.
---
Ah ok, thanks.  The map fragments should be all you need at the moment though.
---
They probably removed springs and screws from weapons and stuff to maintain the resource gathering ecosystem.  But with the scrap box, that kind of went out the window.
---
If balance was done in a more intelligent manner, they could have simply allowed valuable materials like that to scale on your intelligence and whether you're using the perk or not.  Higher intelligence gives better yields and stuff.  But they didn't, and now scrapping basically only gives you steel and other useless, common materials.  Such a shame.
---
dont forget to eject the holo tape game from your computer before you leave.
---
I was just messing around in a workshop and built a tower as high as I could. It went 8 levels high but I could not put a roof on.... so 7 1/2? lol
---
Eso was like this in its baby days , I remember the exact same "Best community ever " all the time posts. Its not as good any more once the mainstream finally relized how good the game was after a certain time it was already gotten fairly good lol.
---
You're telling me. Its annoying that stealth boys break stealth :/
---
All quest don’t show rewards and when they do show its randomly 10 min later. It’s a visual bug so not a big deal but still
---
Sorry for the delay, real-life intervened....   
---
Ouch, falls in line with other's posts and comments, will document and report!
---
What things do you make if you can't make that? pm me if you can't get one I will make you one for free
---
Games as much as the power armor they sell nowadays so lol idk.
---
In all your years playing video games this is the worst? I'd love to know what games you've been playing.
---
OMG i guess i never realized that so funny thanks for the info
---
Correct, I've never used (nor purchased) the light bulb letter set that was moved to the "Lights" section with Patch 16. 
---
I did receive a reply from LadyDevann stating they're looking into budget-related issues, however, after tagging a couple CMs in another post. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8x8jq/did_camp_build_budgets_shrink/fahb406/
---
Thanks for these write-ups, by the way!
---
Yeah because you can’t enter Vault 79 currently. I think it’s more of a “start” to an unfinished quest that will be finished with Wastelanders in the next couple months
---
Oh wow , I didn't know !
---
Does it sort it self out ?
---
They made that overwatch esq game but watch the noclip documentary pls.
---
Durability seems ok, I don't have a harpoon tho ATM, and seems most complaints are about it specifically.
---
Update about missing stats: I done more tests today (now that I wasn't nearly passed out due to lack of sleep), and it looks like only some pieces of armor are affected, in my case - 2 out of 5.
---
So consistency still goes out of the window. As I said in another thread - expecting a fix sometimes between today and colonization of Saturn.
---
Absolutely. I completely agree.
---
1. BETA yes.  It’s the only daily that never repeats.  Cop a Squatter is uncommon and sometimes doesn’t register completion, but I never get to repeat StTT.
---
2.  If I have a daily misc telling me to find Boomer at the motel, I will always have to log back in to be able to interact.  Several different characters.
---
3.  I wear shielded raider, specifically road leathers.
---
4.  Definitely not lag, and it happens on public and private servers.  Never had this happen before last week.  Maybe I just never noticed, but it’s unlikely.
---
5-8.  One character uses T-51b with West Virginia paint, emergency protocols, optimized bracers, calibrated shocks and the int boost on the helmet.  Heavy gunner perks, blocker, lock and load, first aid, born survivor, stabilized and one gun army.  I could link a nukesdragons if needed.  b/ffr/vatscost 50 cal and b/e LMG.  
---
The other wears full uny/sneak with a couple poison resist and uses a b/e/reload fixer and b/e/weightless lever gun.  Rifleman and stealth perks, plus the standard blocker/serendipity/dodgy combo.  Again, I could link a full perk set up.
---
Typing as I’m getting a ride home, so I can dig deeper or join in game for testing if needed at a later time.
---
With Legends going to maintenance mode with people buying expacs and cards there, whats to say this couldnt happen with this game honestly eek .
---
Which ones count for both? If so its just the meat hook that double dips off unarmed and one handed perk cards.
---
The only one that counts for both us the meathook.
---
Quality games.
---
...
---
OR JUST ADD IT TO EVERYONE'S DAMN INVENTORY BY DEFAULT.
---
It seems Bethesda saw EA's BFV 5.2 update disaster and said, "hold my beer...."
---
This morning I came across a camp that had nothing but hazmat suits in all vendor machines all at 25k caps lol
---
Why not play with us?
---
Thanks for all the work you’re putting in! I’m only level 35 on this character so I don’t have all the damage perks for commando yet, but I am also running covert operative, nothing’s bloodied though.
---
For C.A.M.P builds and ideas check out Finalrender on youtube. He has some excellent videos on his page 👍
---
You can't spam it like a river or body of water but it is faster than the water pump. There is a animation to it that not as long as the water pump. If you're on Xbox you can use mine see if you like it or not.
---
Buy that's not what you're doing all. You're telling everyone something that's not true while providing zero evidence to back up your claim. You said a Google search would vindicate your point but it doesn't and you can't provide a single link, tweet, YouTube video to prove otherwise. You like advising others to use Google a whole lot but it seems you don't like using it yourself. There is literally no enemy in the game with a damage threshold. There's never been one ever. What Bethesda has said since before the game was released is that anyone who hits an enemy once will get the loot and experience from that enemy. Never once did they say that if you don't do enough damage it sucks you wasted the resources you put your time and effort into acquiring in the game.
---
Ahhh! Thanks!
---
I forgot I only have the sink. I didn't get the fountain.
---
I see what you did there...
---
I have no idea what your talking about but I really want to. You must tell me!
---
I have my camp right by the purveyor. I put that garbage in the vending machine so when you only need a few more scrip you stop down and but that shit 2 star for a measly 500-1000 caps.
---
Someone happen to know how many hits you can do with a super sledge before it breaks?
---
Trying to figure out if I really did as much damage as I think. Went through more than two sledges at 150%, buffed and bloodied hitting for 100-1000 per hit. Average around 350.
---
I'm sometimes baffled by Bethesda's moves, but you're not being accurate when you paint this to be a Bethesda issue and imply that the hate against them is justified (fundamentally, hatred toward a video game maker is never justified, it's only petty and sad). Releasing fixes that don't work or continue to work in the long run is a games industry issue, and while it doesn't affect every company equally, I've seen supposedly fixed bugs resurface or simply not go away many, many times in the last 15+ years I've been playing online games. Including from Blizzard, which is fairly renowned for polished games and updates. 
---
The main reason this happens is likely that a lot of developers don't have the type and quantity of rigs that the massive player bases they service do. So what seems fine on the inside becomes problematic once released.
---
However, I will agree that in 76's case it does seem like there is little to no QA done pre-patch. It's a definite problem they need to work on. That said, I don't see it going away any time soon, and I don't really understand your desire to push yourself into an ultimatum that will surely amount to nothing at all. If you're going to insist on the 'one more time' part, you might as well just uninstall now, because Bethesda (and others) are absolutely going to do this again. :p
---
I cant find the toggle. Where is it?
---
OK thanks
---
Thanks for the comments!   
---
**I wanted to report a bug, maybe is related with corpses disapearing. In  short, if you kill an enemy using energy weapons such as a gatling  plasma o laser gatling....**  
---
an annoying Fallout 4 bug they've not addressed, it's the worst when you kill a flying NPC!      
---
**....this one flew away while fighting the super mutants, so I rushed to  kill it and when I finally got aggroed again (took me another 3 shoots  to make it attack me)....**  
---
The aggro issue has gotten worse, another one I hope they address soon.    
---
**By the way, I was going around in the cranberry bog to try to test if  the bug of reloading weapons affected my equipment, and my guns didn't  loose any durability, but my armor got hit really bad...**  
---
Interesting, maybe it's durability as a whole?  
---
**I'll try to capture this bug in video somehow....**  
---
Thanks, the more info the better!
---
I'm not sure if you know how to use google but if you type '76 queen damage requirements" youll see what I mean.
---
I always thought playing with kb/mouse made targeting things way faster so I wouldn't want to play against PC players even if it wasn't for the mods and hacks
---
Having a ton of fun on PC. Better performance and haven't seen any hackers. But I don't play NW
---
Really? Is it really that powerful? I thought it was only unarmed like Powerfist.
---
Distance to the target also makes a difference. You're going to do significantly less damage at maximum range than at close range.
---
I played yesterday and the map was the same, how did it get smaller?
---
Yeah i get it. I ground out the glowing skelly too, but its far from rare.
---
I really just wish they started the "holiday" even sooner. Instead or re-doing the halloween one
---
Dude... why don't you provide a link directly from a source at Bethesda that specifically says the SBQ has a damage requirement? You won't do that because you can't. All you have is second hand speculation but I guess that somehow makes you correct. You win man. Go be oppressive somewhere else besides my comment thread.
---
Its classified as a Unarmed weapon but for whatever reason gets Damage bonus from the gladiator perks similar to how the pipe revolver benefits from both rifleman and gunslinger perks, so a bloodied ss Strength meat hook is a great weapon for you to have if you're a bloodied melee build
---
your'e right it affects vanguard armor as well
---
Captainoob is another one that isn't actively shitting on the game for views.  He mostly does weapon showcases, but he has some live stream playlists.
---
For streams, Egoviking plays a lot, australvoid isn't on a lot but does a lot of nuclear winter (the pvp arena mode).  Not a lot of big streamers on in the evening when I'm home though.
---
Sorry if this has been posted, only have a moment. 
---
Did stings and things quest. Did not visually complete. This bug happened a while back that events would not complete on screen. It's back. 
---
Logged in today and 3 daily challenges were already completed. No atoms rewarded. Because ya know I couldnt do them. 
---
And now all of my tracking of challenges undid itself as well. I had about 12 various long term challenges tracking and the list is gone. All that's on it is a NW challenge I never tracked.
---
Ca... can I PM you too?
---
Visual bug only
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
I don’t think it’s that they did nothing, it’s that the game was waaaaay close to being released for them to possibly have any time or resources to go back and polish literally the entire game. There was a list of like 10,000 reported bugs days after the game dropped, it’s not like they could have just fixed it. 
---
I bet the BETA was just a test for them to see how big of a shitstorm was coming their way. They knew exactly how this game was going to be received, and then it got worse with the data leaks and the cash grabs
---
Thats why i use 2 acrobat pieces, oh no! i just reloaded my gun and acrobat is the main on one of my piiiiieeeeecccceeeeesss!
---
Then they can make you scroll through everything increasing their chance or you buying something.
---
Come out on the 12th
---
yeah...wait

Holiday Scorched Event Details:
---
Start Date: Thursday, December 12 at 11:00 a.m. ET
---
End Date: Thursday, December 26 at 12:00 p.m. ET
---
some dorks, just want to play the "trading game" but they have no idea of how this market works, or the in-game economy... so they just mark everything absurdly overpriced to start...
---
O, it’s certainly justified.  Totally Retodded company.   Never go full Todd people.  Shits no good.
---
Tomorrow
---
Bringo!
---
Only time I had this issue I joined late to the fight it was after her health regeneration and I melted her with my meat hook and got nothing.
---
WOW I THOUGHT IT WAS THE 12TH. 
---
Jesus christ.
---
My camp now continously attacks itself.
---
I was goofing around at Poseiden and got about 10 stories after starting on top of the electrical panels....Way the hell up there!!
---
A lot of the leg armor perks are doing this.  It’s a fing pita, but every few minutes you need to click on every damn piece...fuck  me
---
Well, usually what you are seeing is what *hasn't* sold. Most off the reasonably priced items have sold already, leaving the things that *aren't* reasonably priced. With some exceptions, of course. 
---
That's the way I think of it when I'm doing research for pricing my own items, anyway. I generally tend to undercut the market to sell fast, so I use what I find in vendors as examples of what prices to _not_ use.
---
Go buy a broken microwave and just keep trying. Make sure you get a nice broken one. And then hopefully wherever you bought it, just falls into a sinkhole so you can never return it.
---
That's what I'm saying. I didn't actually join the event from the map icon. I either fast traveled or walked into the area. A friend who I was not on a team with told me my name appeared in white while everyone else's was yellow.
---
One mans garbage is another mans caps!
---
Bethesda would like to hire you to run the Nuclear Winter event calendar. :)
---
Even they have to empty that bladder bag from time to time.
---
It’s mainly cosmetic for me. Nothing is going to be as fast as spamming the collect button on a river or lake
---
the only change they needed to make was make the pacifist flag disable VATS targeting players...
---
Ahh yes idk why exactly that happens cause I usually fast travel to drop sight v9 without problems but it happens on occasion. I actually like it sometimes cause I get to choose my spawn, still get the loot tho.
---
Not at all. I've had a team of three at the smallest for her.
---
This criticism primarily comes from PC players. On console, we are used to full lobbies about 16-18 hours a day. On PC, with all of the rampant hacking, people are not interested in NW.
---
Desk fans and typewriters. Anywhere that many of these is a screw gold mine. I actually have more screws than I know what to do with, due to all my scrapping runs. I put 150 of them in my vendor, priced pretty highly, and they sold in minutes.
---
Your idea, approach and predictions are good and noble but let's not forget it's Bethesda we're talking about. They get the knowledge of a specific and very serious bug and they end up not only not fixing it, but make it a lot more severe :(
---
It should have two targeting choices keybound - one a skip, the other a fire, and go between ALL valid target NPCs.
---
Sometimes I'd get loot and no reward, other times rewards and no loot. Sometimes none of either one. I was just letting OP know what I did to make sure it didn't happen to me anymore.
---
Same, put my C.A.M.P. on the railway bridge below seneca rocks built on the lake. 8 stories. Maybe you saw it, had traffic signals at the top and a strip joint inside
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Best comment today ☝🏻
---
I have 600 screws, I'm fine with them I'm just saying scrapper doesnt help
---
&gt;There are SOOO many situation where this can happen and the "error" tells a developer nothing except that something went wrong.
---
I see. But now things are worse the game crashed immediately after i open it.
---
That’s not how they work though.  Logic and Bethesda don’t mix.
---
Yeah its a good strategy.
---
The smaller map sizes got nothing to do with the fact we can vote for 2 maps.
---
The size is determined by number of players in lobby, which always seems to be lower on PC
---
Right! When the event ends, you'll still have your character and account, but you'll need to buy the game to load it.
---
I liked the earlier seasons of The Storyteller by Shoddycast? I feel you on Oxhorn tho, too slow and his voice is just... monotonous. Not necessarily bad just not for me
---
Maybe for lower levels
---
A festive boss
---
Make every enemy.
---
People have already accepted them monitizing the game now, even though they promised not to monitize it for in-game advantages. Why is this game still getting advice when they don't listen???
---
Hey there! I hate to break it to you, but it's actually spelled _mon**e**tize_. A good way to remember this is that "money" starts with "mone" as well. Just wanted to let you know. Have a good day!
---
----
---
^This ^action ^was ^performed ^automatically ^by ^a ^bot ^to ^raise ^awareness ^about ^the ^common ^misspelling ^of ^"monetize".
---
Shhhhh, you don't want to upset our glorious king, God Howard! Lmao! 
---
I wish you the best!
---
If you'll notice it's under "Quality of Life" and it's related to Patch 16.0.  
---
Also, not my opinion, as I can't play the game at present, but had a great number of PM's, DM's and comments here and other places regarding it, so figured it was worth including.
---
More likely ass grabber and bugger the boss, but yeah, basically just that.
---
It's buggy. You'll definitely get it through natural play before you get level 100.
---
It was the router I had no problems after I reset it and let it sit for a while. Thank you all.
---
Apparently this guy thinks that I'm somehow spreading false information in some way.
---
Oh? Obsessively positive Pro-'76 YouTube "Influencer"?
---
Thanks for the comment, confirmed what many others have reported!
---
I am indeed a PC player yeah. And since the latest patch we keep getting the smaller versions of the maps.  
---
You will always be able to choose between these two most of the time:  
---
\- [https://i.imgur.com/Fo1a9RO.png](https://i.imgur.com/Fo1a9RO.png)
---
And this is how it looks the moment you spawn: 
---
\- [https://i.imgur.com/ILYBfP2.png](https://i.imgur.com/ILYBfP2.png) 
---
It's just instantly small and (imo) it kinda ruins it for me and my friends. We really wish to get the entire map  back again.
---
He says calling out Bethesda ok their mistakes and bad business practices is “bad media” and he won’t focus on it
---
"The recordings you could find containers before Nuclear Winter came out didn't affect anything"
---
Ah, but they did! If you didn't know about them it affects your perceptions as to what is going on with that vault. 
---
Any content added to the game is a good thing, and these undocumented mini-quests if you will are a huge thing. Sadly instead of reading about their existence and trying to figure them out we normally learn about them from either dataminers or people who have already completed about them, so it's spoilers ahoy when it could be much more of an organic community experience.
---
Thanks for the comment, seems to be an issue with this patch, confirming what others have reported
---
LOL Who advertises?
---
Honestly I barely read into your first comment till just now. But I agree with it.
---
Wearing Legendary armor that effect Stats or have any addictions / Diseases?   
---
Sometimes they don't show up!
---
Really? I like it, it's the one reward I'm looking forward to.
---
The Quest issue seems to be a common problem this patch as well, confirming what others have said!
---
yeah..like read my reply, you got it all wrong
---
No, but it's also not effecting everyone, so there must be a common factor.
---
You give them far too much credit - they’ve gone ahead and created “one step sideways, three steps back, one step forward”.    
---
The forward is only there because they’re tripping trying to grab that fo1st money, but at least it’s there I suppose. 
---
Full Todd.  Never go full Todd.
---
Thanks for the comment, so both Shadow and Prime "Prime", double thanks for placing a ticket.
---
I understand and sympathize with your frustration.
---
Depending on how costly it is to implement cross play, technically it could be cost-effective. Cramming 1000 players onto 20 "servers" is more effective than having 1000 players on say 25 servers. Removing the platform divide would be a more efficient use of resources.
---
But do not dump the PC cheat fest on consoles.
---
The closest thing I can think of is chad: a fallout story. It's really good.
---
Oh ok I guess theres a rule where I cant mention that sub? Lol whoops
---
If you're watching videos on YouTube make sure to set the video speed to x0.25 or x.50. Speeding them up makes a lot of tutorials and lore videos tolerable with only a sight increase to voice pitch
---
This isn't true.  Not all of it.  
---
My PA doesn't lose any of its effects from reloading.  Stop.   Stop spewing nonsense.  There's enough wrong that making things up is unnecessary.
---
Think it's worse since patch 15.0?
---
I think my prices are good, my items sell at a steady pace. I have only charged 25K once and that was a AAE LMG: it sold in an hour. Wonder how long before he realized what a pain in the ass ammo is for that thing. Sticking with my AA FFR Railway Rifle - best vats gun out there.
---
I grab an auto pipe rifle every chance I get in the beginning. You literally have to empty an entire clip into someone *before* they get armor to down someone, but it sounds badass. Like you're firing a howitzer at them, lol
---
Kind of sucks we can't just load a buggy and run in the Atomic shop. 
---
No worries. I wasn't disputing it. I think I replied to the wrong comment. XD
---
Same thing happened with power companies.  Now there’s one “choice” where I live.  No anti trust mentality in my country and Zeni sees the future so this what we get.
---
Taking.   Not giving.  Taking.
---
Hasn't that been the way since last patch?
---
Oh hell yeah that would suck. I’m on console so it didn’t do that, at least not yet.
---
I go down 5 units with all my weapons, probably because of health and perks - I'm already maxed out.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlhsly/psareminder_the_mount_blair_workshop_has_no_build/
---
All good haha
---
 Desk fans and type writers are like the number 1 thing I pick up tho so that's solid advice
---
I wonder why the original poster wouldn't just ask for free items to be automatically be added to a user's inventory.
---
"Quality of life gaming community ohmagerd!"
---
First time for me and it started last night. PS4
---
So all of the following are available from the trusted NexusMods website.  I'm onky listing names here instead of links, but they're all available there if you use the search.  But these are the ones I highly recommend.
---
* Cloudy01's FO76 Mod Manager
---
* SFE (required base file)
---
* Text Chat Mod
---
* Perk Load Out Manager
---
* Save Everything
---
* Better Inventory
---
* Reasonable Scorch Beast Scream Effects
---
* Old Style Workbench Repair
---
* TZMap
---
I also use the various glow mods, becuase I have color-blindness issues which makes spotting things hard on my eyes.  Some people think that takes the fun out of stumbling in the dark looking for components, but for me it's just a quality of life improvement.  
---
There's also two very fine Radio Mods that are throwbacks to earlier Fallout radio:
---
* More Where That Came From (adds to the Appalachian Radio)
---
* Storm Radio (replaces the Classical Music channel)
---
The audio mods tends to work best when added to the INI files manually, instead of relying on the Mod Manager to install them.  Just follow the instructions provided with them, and it should be easy.
---
Check for an Xbox live partial outage in your area. You can also both try a full restart of your consoles by holding down the Xbox button and selecting restart. After you restart, if the Fallout 76 icon says "Resume Fallout 76," you need to click the start button and Select Quit. It should then say "Launch Fallout 76." That will usually resolve the issue, assuming you don't have an Xbox Live social outage.
---
Yeah.  I spend about 150-200 for a star.  But 4000 for  useless turd?  Don't make me come look at crap.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I added that to the post :)
---
Rad. Now I don't feel bad about missing Gage's patch from that outfit.
---
Not sure tbf but it could be like a nuke zone
---
Funny analogy. BGS had enough modders finishing their homework for them before, that they started to believe they really were "A" students.
---
Portal/2 was awesome games! Some of the last good games.
---
It's a bug added in the last patch. Team up from the main menu then enter the server and it should work.
---
100% agree sucks to wait another week for more content
---
Lol. Yeah, the novelty of having a really awesome LMG wears off pretty quick.
---
You’re my hero, literally been tryna figure it out for a few hours and didn’t find it smh
---
It's not. Maybe you didn't have a Bloodied Gauss and that was an alternative
---
If I did. Would you be on that Reddit sub too?
---
If they want to charge a monthly sub, the bitches better have people in that office 6 days a week.
---
What power armor? Liberty Prime paint mass plays lines on every reload. Excavator loses it's inherent weight bonus but the game chugs to get it back. Strangler Heart has been reported numerous times to stop it's inherent poison. PAs with a unique effect are affected
---
Since the last patch, I constantly, without exception, CTD when the map loads in. 
---
Did a scan/repair to no avail.
---
Time to uninstall this peice of crap...
---
I just found this lead jackpot last week cause someone put their camp there. It's like 8 or 9 nodes right next to each other. Just south of vault 63 (me thinks?).
---
I'm still getting the +200 bug, but it's different. I get it if I'm not in my PA when I load into Adventure. When I enter my PA for the first time, I have 530 carry weight. During the reload glitch, it goes from 530 to 295 to 430 to 530 again. I stay at 530 until I die. Then it's back to 430.
---
I had a guy this morning on the XBOX looking for group put "Endgame Vendor with Endgame Weapons and Armor"....I went and looked and everything they had was stuff I scrip all day,.....I sent him a message stating as such.
---
I think it starts tomorrow
---
Yeah, would you be a complete cunt for no reason on my broken microwave posts?
---
You can break a mirror, but even if you fix it you can’t just ‘undo’ breaking it.
---
You have to imagine, this is an Alpha test grade issue, over a year into it’s life.
---
To save stash space, I carry every single weapon I own. When I take off my armor, I gain hundreds of pounds. I think it was like 600lbs last time I checked. So I would instantly know if it wasn’t working. I would barely be able to move and I wouldn’t be able to fast travel. When I take off my armor and perks, I sit around 1200lbs. 
---
This bug is obviously affecting a good many people, I just wanted to pitch in and say that it doesn’t affect everyone. Maybe it is a certain type of weapon that they are using (pistols, heavy) or a certain combo of perks on those weapons. It hasn’t happened to any of my guns, they are all handmades with various prefixes with faster fire and explosive.
---
Pc MaStEr RaCe lmaoooo ya ok
---
I've been seeing camps having turrets kill each other for weeks. It's funny to see.
---
It is ridiculous that we have to put them for sale to keep from scrapping. But I push the R1 button on the PS4 controller. It prices them at like 1658 caps or so. I've actually sold one before. Maybe they scrapped theirs and didn't want to find one?
---
That dam, undecorated Christmas tree, should be free! 
---
I bought it yesterday, and thought you could decorate the dam thing, and you can't. Grrrr! 
---
It looks like plain old pine tree in a garbage can. 
---
Thats not a Christmas Tree! 
---
It would have been nice if at the least you could hang lighting on it! 
---
I had to resort to more camp budget using flood lights, so it at least looks like it's glowing at night! 
---
The dam thing we have to do to make things worthwhile in this game at times. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Using a hard line instead of Wi-Fi will help with this. Also, installing 76 on a SSD is a pretty drastic improvement.
---
im annoyed they made the tree on a 2 per camp limit :( i wanted to make a nice christmas forrest themed camp lol
---
They are all over the place in clumps, you can check out Mappalachia and look at the Resource veins map on there and see if any are near your camp. My camps are all in the mire, so I usually hit the Purveyor and then do the short Lead run east of her station.
---
I agree, there should be a second tier of rewards available for those of us that didn't sit around with our thumbs up our asses the first time and actually put in the effort. It ended 6 hours early, those lazy people that were putting it off to the last minute weren't going to get it anyway so it's ridiculous they now get an extra week to do it.
---
Found an Urban Scout Mask for 200c in a vendor, messaged the guy to ask if he knew that thing was way too underpriced, he said he knew and just wanted to sell his surplus stuff fast, so I got it without thinking I was robbing someone. It was the only good deal I had for a good gear on this game this month, all the rest is just overpriced crap. People are just clueless about prices lately.
---
I’m not sure how to do that &gt;.&lt;
---
I rely on unyielding str boost to carry my loot and over and over again I’d suddenly drop all my stats and not be able to buy items or fast travel because of this. It’s bull shit.  
---
People like you acting like it’s not happening aren’t helping either.
---
I didnt say it worked lol just that that's why they do it. I've worked retail too, we all know mgmt hast their heads up their asses
---
The one your thinking of is the meathook. But i heard something new today, and didnt have one to test it. But i was just told the pole hook double dips on 1h and 2h melee perks.🤗 i wouldnt take my word for it though, test it on a regular one before you blow your wad on a legendary.
---
Hold the menu button (the middle button with the three lines) to open the social menu when you are at the main menu and just select their profile and invite to team.
---
Really? I just thought about loading this up for a bit, now I feel I need to pass on this until I hear more. Just sad to hear this. I stopped when I heard latest Raid was breaking things.
---
PS I call it Fallout Fist on purpose
---
Given how poorly this game was received overall, you really don't have much choice in the matter. He's pretty much the only show in town when it comes to lore.
---
If you use a fixer, have 5 pieces of sneak legendary gear, maxed out sneak perk and 15 base agility, you really probably won’t even need shadowed mods on your armor. I have no fixer, 1 piece of sneak armor, 1 shadowed piece, max sneak perk and 15 base agility and I’m basically invisible to enemies when sneaking. I get the SBQ nuzzling my face when she’s on the ground and remain in caution, just to give you an idea. But hey, overkill seems to be the trend so go all out if you want to.
---
Cancel the search for a server and try again. Also, if one of your teammates is still in a previous match and you get the "[PLAYER NAME HERE] is still on a match" message, you will not be able to load into a server until you click "OK."
---
Did you ever hear of "the atom shop"? You Bethies need to make up your mind at some point.
---
Camps that sell non legendary weapons are the worst or stupidly overpriced ammo
---
Intelligence doesn't affect your chance to learn a mod, that's just a myth. It's all RNG.
---
Clowndaddy saying in your video calm down with real world threats was awesome lol. Cant believe that guy reported that.
---
Yeah on the PC we never really get above 40+ players in a lobby. Meaning we keep getting only these two zones constantly. It's quite annoying and we really wish to just play with the full map. Not just these towns.
---
That's fine I don't mind, thanks for adding to the list.
---
I dont even use the black powder weapons. Ill play around with legendary versions but eventually they either end up in the scrip machine or my camp vendors.
---
This is like a deja vu to Patch 11. The best way to play now is with melee weapons (no reloading) if you want to keep your armor attributes in place. Or keep the strangler Heart Armor Set Bonus if you play with it... The FREE trial and double XP weekend is starting tomorrow and we have no news about this major issue from Bethesda. It's going to be a disaster... Way to promote a product, breaking it before a free trial. Jezzz... Why didn't they just delete that legendary effect if they knew it was not an easy fix? I mean who even cares about resistance while reloading it lasts 1-2 seconds at most. It's difficult to understand their decisions as a company.
---
&gt; You can break a mirror, but even if you fix it you can’t just ‘undo’ breaking it.
---
Believe it, or not, but "undos" in game patches exist and they are a normal thing.
---
The guy in charge of this, need to asume devs failed this time and to take action. It happens, np. We all, who work, fail sometimes…
---
It works with containers, paper vats stays, but are empty.
---
Same, ive got a 1st sub going at the moment for the cheaper atoms and will decide weather or not to keep it whenever wastelanders drops, if its good quality ill keep it if not then its going
---
I never got fertilizer from it so far, only toys and gums, coal... some random junk items. I think the Christmas Gifts option is not working yet because I've got no gifts in the container until now.
---
And they get double xp to boot. I’m putting away my skeleton. It was fun to flex while it was unique.
---
you mean "light bulbs randomly everywhere" like with the empty PA chassis that can randomly appear?
---
Go for it. No harm in asking. Tell them in detail how it's affecting you and see what happens.
---
OMG. My low level 2nd character is about to get some serious love from my high level main!
---
There was some green wallpaper in datamined items for November. Now, the question is... when will they release it? :P
---
Do the Vault raids instead, I've been flexing everywhere in my Solar armor and matching mask for the past week.
---
It can be soloed but if you are asking this question, then you are not equipped to solo it.
---
Widgeon TV on YouTube does some lore videos and he talks a bit faster. 
---
I'm still hanging for someone to do a good vault 94 lore video. My team doesn't have the patience for me to read through terminals while protecting my back.
---
Most traders.  They either use the subreddit that cannot be named, or on Xbox, a LFG post announcing a sale or specific items for trade. 
---
Lots of people advertise.
---
I play on PC and I upvote this.
---
I think it breaks everything at this point... Armor effects, weapons effects, under armor stats, strangler heart set bonus, they are all different systems... Uhg...
---
Was that the problem? Lazy people thumbing asses?
---
I just find it weird that you would be on subs for things you don't like, and just harass passersby.
---
I agree 100%. I’m on pc too. I’m also an old guy who likes to (needs to) have a little strategy time. It’s why I can’t play fort nite with my kids!
---
"Clever re-use of an asset"- Bethesda games in a nutshell
---
No, you don't.
---
My faith :D grew strong after the scrapbox debacle. Still seems ...too dumb to be true.
---
Unless the server or console crashes. Then you’re SOL
---
yes no maybe could you repeat the question?
---
Should I get it?
---
Get it for 1 month, get the Ranger Armour and transfer all of your junk into the stash box. Then cancel the membership. 
---
You will still be able to take out of the stash box, just lot add to it after the subscription (obviously).
---
I want a pumpkin eye patch as new reward for people who unlocked everything the first time. Small enough to not really matter, but a badge of honor to mark the one time I didn't procrastinate too long in achieving a goal.
---
If you plan on playing a lot then I'd say it's a decent deal for a month. If you plan on playing casually there's really no need unless you REALLY love the exclusive cosmetics.
---
Really good reference but you forgot *I don't know*
---
I like having some strategy time as well yeah. I'm happy to hear you agree. It just feels super rushed now and takes the fun away from us like that. Lets hope they see this at least.
---
I like it, gonna start using it myself
---
Tbh I have it an I love it junk takes up so much storage it’s ridiculous the scrap box is a life savior for me I see everything else as a bonus I spent about 20 dollars a month in the atom shop so a win win for me
---
Plenty people have posted about bugs they are experiencing. I'm subbed to this thread and it's usually all I see. But when I vent I get sarcasm.. so fuck off. You posted nothing constructive leaving you a troll not a passerby.
---
So sorry you feel harrassed. Wanna PM about it hun?
---
You are so mean... and I'm okay with that.
---
Its best to find a bag or container with no weight limit. 
---
There is one at just about every train station.  Look for the burlap bag.  
---
Put the gear you wish to transfer in the container.   Dont drop it in a paper bag, you will lose it.
---
Log into your other character and select private world.
---
Go back to the container and pick up your stuff.
---
damnit !
---
Can they change the effect without messing things up more?
---
Both the Enclave and the BOS were part of the US government/military just before the war, outwardly on the same side. The difference was the Enclave was a secret shadow government within the US government, working with the largest mega-corporations to plan for the inevitable nuclear war. The Enclave brought in all of the best and brightest the country had to offer, and they continued their research into cutting-edge science and technology after the war.
---
The BOS are the remnants of a group of US soldiers who realized that the US government was running experiments on their fellow soldiers. Outraged, they rebelled and became disenchanted with the government just before the bombs dropped. After the Great War, the BOS was founded on the idea that advanced technology is too dangerous, and the corruption of the pre-war US government is never acceptable. 
---
The Enclave and BOS are therefore natural enemies due to grossly conflicting ideologies. The difference in technology comes from the Enclave's continued pursuit of advanced technology, whereas the BOS had little interest in a technological arms race.
---
Welp, just logged in to trade in some legendaries and server hop a bit to check vendors. Guess that all I’ll be doing tonight.
---
Are you on xbox by chance? I just sold one of those for the same price like 3 days ago. 
---
1 star= 200 caps or 200 5.56
---
2 star= 350 caps or 350 5.56
---
3 star= 500 caps or 500 5.56
---
God roll stuff= 6 or 700 caps max or 6-700 5.56.
---
Legendary stuff does nothing for my character at the moment. I like what i have so i dont really roll at the purveyor. Ever. So scrip is useless to me too. And its really easy to make 20k caps in a day or two so caps are pretty useless. 
---
I usually wind up trading legendary stuff for ammo because im too lazy to make it. And its worth way more than caps to me.
---
Save yourself the trouble and just dip out now lol, i just had a guy go through my walls, teleport through my base, attempt to open trade to steal my shit, and then kill me... i recorded it, i took the bait, and i can't even f'ing send it to bethesda because ALL THREE browsers i tried have THREE different bugs... Chrome gets to the submit button and then craps out, IE gets one step less and then does the same thing, and edge doesn't even want to load the f'ing support page, it tried in a loop infinitely lol.   
---
There is literally no way to send them any kind of video evidence. Just a button and a, "ok we'll look into it, but won't tell you tehehe"   
---
They don't know what they are doing at all, and the worst part is they don't care. As long as the Atom shop is stocked OH and by the way, ever notice how the stuff people want the most goes on sale just before a holiday? Gotta clear out those extra Atoms don'tchyaknow? Or you won't be reaching for that wallet when Santa comes to town!... that's sinister shit my dudes lol.
---
just let me filter by price please.
---
Sometime I can't stop thinking about some people doing shit on purpose in their team..
---
If you like the atom shop, then its a good idea as you will get atoms at like 30% off just from the cost of the sub.
---
In addition, the endless scrap box is the best thing in the sub.  never having to worry about  how much junk I have in my stash is more valuable than any other first perk. 
---
The survival tent is great, not vital, but great.   I never move mine, its permaplaced at V9.  Quick easy fast travel to your favorite hunting ground.  You can keep your camp in a more docile location, or on your favorite node, and not have to worry about moving to a new area should you decide to start farming a different location.
---
thank you !!
---
current code is 0000.
---
Yep just need to go to that one super mutant installation near beta and there are like a dozen type writers and fans
---
This mystery you are talking about is similar to the Vault 51 Overseer mystery just before the launch of NW. I won't say how many items there are to find to avoid spoilers, but there's nothing more to it than that.
---
Nothing wrong with selling scrip. Plenty of players buy it when they’re maxed out on caps or RNGesus hasn’t graced them with enough for the day. 
---
I’ve found 30 caps per scrip to be a good price point. It moves slowly enough that my machines don’t get bought out instantly and I have some backup scrip every day, but quick enough that it doesn’t linger too long. Most people can’t do math, so they buy tons of the 1 and 2 star stuff, then leave the 3 stars. Works for me, as it leaves me the same scrip with less weight.
---
This is exactly why we use their pickup service. Cut our weekly shopping bill down quite a bit.
---
What's your horror scope? ;)
---
Screws are so rare simply to keep people playing longer.  To place artificial limits on the speed at which you can improve your gear for finishing the main quest and tackling that singular bit of end game content that the game provides.
---
Even knowing about the "hidden" room in the tallest building near the abandoned bog town workshop, you've still got the 20 hour real world time cooldown on that room.  That's to make you comeback each day to get your supply of screws so you can do the thing you want to do.  And each time you see adverts for the Atom Shop.  And each time maybe you are tempted to acquire something from the Atom Shop with real world money because there's nothing else to do on account of the cooldown for the very limited number of places you might farm screws still being in effect.
---
Pretty much lol.
---
Your BF will have to also be in the main menu for this to work.  So when you load up your game, just stick around on the menu till you do the team invite. 
---
You should then both be able to join a private world together
---
*sprippable*
---
For everything but Vault 94 I run a bloodied unyeilding sneak rifles build. 
---
For 94 I run a standard PA full health Heavy tank build.
---
The only feature of other games have I would like in addition to those you already mentioned would be text chat which we still don't have even a year after release
---
fresh acid is the best acid
---
How about delete the patch and just hold off doing anything until wastelanders
---
They still can't fix trade bug (you have to fast travel to fix trade), friend list is still bugged (can't see invitations), weapons still reloads slower after using PA, it's pathetic at what state this game is still...
---
Usually on the trade sub I use it goes 20 caps per scrip, so 40 scrip is 800 caps
---
got it thanks
---
Well they genuinely have an amazing formula here for those of us into the genre... but i mean damn dude... the incompetence and lack of giving a single shit is staggering... like someone else said, this is the perfect open world game for people who like housing, gathering random shit, hoarding like a maniac and showing off our rares/selling/showing off builds.   
---
It's an otherwise great game, marred by horrible decisions from the top. They are getting away with this because a lot of people waited for this for a long time, and won't walk away from it yet. But Wastelanders is it... make no mistake. As hardcore as i am, my wife is... the people we know... this is the last chance.
---
Not until the Patch-ocolypse has been resolved, at least.
---
I'd be happy with the second shot doing its un-nerfed damage and keeping explosive like it is now.
---
Right??? I was spectating my last surviving teammate the other day, and she ran into another person in a building. There was a ridiculously fast and vicious exchange of fire using a weapon I hadn't heard in NW before. My reaction was, "WTF just happened? What... Did you both just auto-pipe each other? That sounded amazing!"
---
Thank you for acknowledging it. Hope it can get fixed so it can be a nice holiday event. Been hoping to spoil some noobs this weekend.
---
I'm on PC, and I do NOT hack. I've never played NW, nor will I.  My partner is on Xbox and the times we've said we'd possibly consider Ist if we could cross play!
---
I'm on xbox so that's less of a concern for me. But I get it.  
---
We have the ability to easily send a msg through xbox, though. From in game you go to recent list, click A, then Send Message. Quickly goes to messenger. Pretty convenient actually.
---
You can tell we have Xbox NW haters here, because we're both getting down voted while having a one-on-one conversation 😂
---
Nope, it's instanced to each player. You 100% *need* to do the quest. I just did it myself.
---
I was flying solo (so no teammates to cause issue) and it occurs on the initial load-in screen ‘after’ it’s located a NW game (I assume)...so there’s no option to cancel...the only option at that point is to actually close out Fallout 76 completely and restart it.
---
Adventure and Private Worlds load and are playable...only occurs with NW.
---
Omg just be happy that they gave you something for free and stop complaining about everything in the game all you people that complain is what's wrong with the game if it's so dam bad quit and play another game
---
That was a new information for me. Have to take it in use tomorow; thanks!
---
Now if I could just figure out what to do once I'm down there. I'm just sitting outside the main entrance to the vault, trying to figure out how to proceed.
---
Do not use paper bags, your other characters see them as empty.
---
It wasn't even 12 hours early. That's what has me "frustrated" by it. Instead of doing the logical thing and restoring progress with 2 days they restored the progress and gave people 5 days. It completely devalues limited time challenges
---
Oh no a snow machine would be so fun &lt;3
---
And some ornaments too!
---
So you're stuck on the screen where it has those Vault-Tec tips at the bottom and random screenshots?
---
Still, there is something that discounts your setup making you an outlier.
---
all the screws get stripped cuz the screwdrivers get scrapped too.
---
I think it's just a reskinned water pump.
---
I know the tree itself can't be decorated but I found a neat camp last night that had the base of the tree surrounded by hay bales to hide the base - then they put rugs around it and their collection of atom shop plushies around the base - it was pretty cool. 
---
Wish they'd give us lights/ornaments tho.. Imagine.. like scorched hand oranament! Raider ornaments!! MOTHMAN ORNAMENTS!!
---
I figured out most of it. Ended up at vault 79 but I can’t get in so now I’m really sad :(
---
Nah, they can't touch reload coding at all, just delete the affix. Delete Stalker too.
---
That build is insane! Nice work!
---
👍 my approval 
---
Sincerely,  an experienced vault raider with 4 pieces of strangler heart
---
Ah, yet another previously fixed issue that's cropped back up. I'm starting to seriously wonder if they built patch 16 off of an outdated version of the game.
---
SHIT! And here i thought it was because Tyler Durden had perpetually been at every terminal moments before me.
---
So THAT'S where my bloatfly glands went!  I had a bunch saved up, then got that dumb daily quest, and they were gone.  Confused the heck out of me!
---
It’s an adjective :)
---
On the flip side. Not all of us enjoy getting one shotted from a random bush either. 
---
I understand and sympathize with your frustration, but try to look at the other side as well. 
---
At least its not perma small. You still get the bigger maps too. 
---
Im on xbox and its been a fairly healthy mix of map sizes for me. 
---
So where you have weaknesses on one size of the maps, some of us have those weaknesses on the bigger ones. I feel like its a healthy in between for all players. But thats probably just me.
---
Strange... iv'e the vague feeling that iv'e been here before. But i have no memory of this place.
---
I'm also a one character player, way to lazy to build more. I actually started playing my Berserker's Explosive Handmade that was collecting dust in my stash with that FO 1st ranger outfit (moved to the dark side couple days ago) as it gives no resists, pretty fun acctually.
---
I'm fair burning through 5.56 now, not bloodied OP for sure but it will do and is making a refreshing change  being full health and not a glass canon.
---
The good build is the least of your worries. You have to work under pressure , know how to co operate with others , and most of all.... Practice. 
---
Have the ability to learn the puzzles and important locations .
---
Yah that changed with the last update
---
This worked for me thanks!
---
Haven't figured that out myself yet, I have a feeling that we can't get any further until the wastelanders DLC is out
---
I change often so I’m constantly using them.
---
lol I'm surprised if even 100 subscriber YouTube channel ends up mention about this. No one cares, no one will care. That's how it's been since the launch, nothing has changed yet people stopped talking about it.
---
Only to keep from accidentally dropping or trading my Legacy lasers.
---
Wait, but isn't this just more fault, why are only 10 on fall out 76? That seems like something they could change but they don't.
---
&gt;junkie crit damage vats cost handmade/fixer
---
not sure I could say that while addicted 😆
---
Good luck with the search, never got into VATS, this crit business is a dark art to me, maybe one day.
---
That game was in a different engine as well was never released
---
Yep... wife has been kicked and told she's not my friend about 3523590236462364 times, i love supporting this game... i'm a total f'ing moron... someone please punch me! 😀🙂😐😑😭
---
Yeah it’s not happening for me. I’ve been using excavator today because I’m super overweight, and I step out to use unyielding for fighting. It must be specific weapons or something causing it, surely.
---
Id personally like to see the time in vault 51 shortened next. Instead of 2 and a half minutes, leta cut that down to 1 and a half. 
---
Id also like to stop having to go back to the main menu between every match. Maybe find a way to keep us in the lobby?
---
 Maybe when there are 30 seconds  left til launch they could disable being able to quit until the match starts like how MCC does in matchmaking?
---
Maybe open up vault 51 in adventure mode to queue for NW? Like entering the vault finds you a match and then youd load into the interior of 51? 
---
Idk im just spitballing here.
---
It won't reduce revenue, it will INCREASE revenue
---
Funny thing is the exact same thing would have been doable on PC if they had just used steam to launch their game. But no, they have to use their buggy POS launcher that has forced me to reinstall the game 5+ times instead.
---
Hey that works... sometimes, unless it doesn't lol.
---
LOL 😉 dumpster fires are so warm and have that nice orange glow.
---
What, you don’t like spawning in a house with 20 other people? C’mon, it speeds the game up so we can go back to waiting in the lobby.
---
Yes, bring the old patch make 250DR bugged again, its not worth it for loosing Legendary effects on reload, anyways you guys are not able to handle your own coding...  ridiculous.
---
We need more eye patches in this game in general imo
---
I ft'ed to a well known West-Tek (exterior) to check. 
---
I shot a smutant, I reload… and I immediately noticed that things were weird: I was in danger, not hidden as usual, and wwr perks were gone.
---
30 seconds to find the patch was very wrong.
---
To me, they don't test the most basic actions any average player does every day. Maybe that is the problem, they have no idea how and what to test.
---
